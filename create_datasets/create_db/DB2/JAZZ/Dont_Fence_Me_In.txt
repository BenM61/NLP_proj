Wildcat Kelley, lookin' mighty pale,
Was standin' by the Sherrif's side
And when the Sherrif said "I'm sendin' you to jail,
Wildcat raised his head and cried

Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above,
Don't fence me in.
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love,
Don't fence me in.
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze,
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees,
Send me off forever but I ask you please,
Don't fence me in.

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies.
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountains rise.

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in.

Wildcat Kelley, back again in town,
was standin' by his sweethearts side,
And when his sweetheart said "come on let's settle down,
Wildcat raised his head and cried

Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies,
Don't fence me in.
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love,
Don't fence me in.
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please,
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountains rise.

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon 'til I lose my senses
I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in.
