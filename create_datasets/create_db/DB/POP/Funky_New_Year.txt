Went to a party just last night
Wanted to bring the year in right
Woke up this morning I don't know how
Last night I was a happy man, but the way I feel right now

It's gonna be a funky new year
Funky new year
Oh, ah, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year

Can't remember when I ever felt worse
Nothing matters and everything hurts
They were passin' round the bottle, made me feel brand new
Trouble with the new man he wants a hit too, hit me

Funky new year
Funky new year
Oh, it's a funky new year

Funky new year
Funky new year
Funky new year
Lord, mmm, funky new year
Nurse I'm worse funky new year

I got to perk up a little funky new year
My hair hurts funky new year
Funky new year
Funky new year

Funky new year
Funky new year
A party baby
Never again funky new year

Funky new year
Who's shoes are these funky new year
Funky new year
Party hardy baby funky new year

Funky new year
What year is this anyway?
