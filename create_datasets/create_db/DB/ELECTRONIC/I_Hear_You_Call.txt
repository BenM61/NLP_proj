'Though you don't call me anymore I find myself waiting

be no more letters from you
So what's wrong anticipating ?
I wanna tell you so the way I've been changing my life

but if you come back to me
Let water change to wine.

Hit it
Baby
Ooh ! Hit it
Baby
Ooh !
It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name.
I hear you call
I hear you call
I hear you call my name.

'Though I can't see you no more
I feel your eyes watchin''

guess I'll try talking to you
It'll be a one way conversation.
I wanna rescue my soul
Beg you please
Find time

if you could come back to me
Let water change to wine.

Hit it
Baby
Ooh ! Hit it
Baby
Ooh !
It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name.
I hear you call
I hear you call
I hear you call my name.

I been looking around for a sign

I'm so blind you were there all the time.
Always be there you once said to me

all that I had to do was believe !

Hit it
Baby
Ooh ! Hit it
Baby
Ooh !
It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name.
I hear you call
I hear you call
I hear you call my name.

It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name
...
I hear you call
I hear you call
I hear you call my name.
It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name.
It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name
...
It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name
...
It's what they call a miracle
I hear you call my name
...
