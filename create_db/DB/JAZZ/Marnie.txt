Moon and mist
Make rainbows in your hair
When I see your smile
There's sunlight everywhere

But your world is lonely
Marnie
Oh, Marnie

So lost yet so lovely
Take my hand
And stay with me awhile

Let me try to dry
The tears beneath your smile

Only love can save you
Marnie

Please love me
Please be mine

I love you
Marnie

Please me mine
