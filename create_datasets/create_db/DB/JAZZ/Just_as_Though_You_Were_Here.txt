I'll wake each morning, and I'll promise to laugh
I'll say good morning to your old photograph
And I'll speak to you, dear
(Just as though you were here)

When purple shadows start to welcome the dark
I'll take the same old stroll we took through the park
And I'll cling to you, dear
(Just as though you were here)

(Oh, don't be afraid that distance and time)
Will finally tear us apart
(The farther you go, the longer you stay)
(The deeper you grow in my heart)

Each night before I wander off into sleep
I'll bring to light the tears I've buried so deep
Then I'll kiss you, my dear
(Just as though you were here)

Each night before I wander off into sleep
I'll bring to light the tears I've buried so deep
Then I'll kiss you, my dear
And though you're gone, my love for you goes on, darling
(Just as though you were here)
