Well, I see you around town 
You got no time for dressing down 
The days headlines all suit you fine 
You make your way right through the crowd 

Invisible eyes are everywhere 
You check your coat, they check your hair 
New line fashion and your put on passion 
Don't seem to get you anywhere 

They're the party crashers
They're the party crashers
They're the party crashers

Yeah, got to send a message across this town 

The DJ is in from overseas 
Your breaking hearts, he's making beats 
Your hands are shaking as you hit the pavement 
Can't catch a break on 13th street 

These days things seems strange
These days things seems strange
These days things seems strange

They're taking over while we think it over
Can't get a message anyway 

They let me down
