Boys, now the times are changing
The going could get rough
Boys, would that ever cross your mind?
Boys, are you contemplating moving out somewhere?
Boys, will you ever find the time?

Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same
Beware, here comes the quiet life again

Boys, now the country's only miles away from here
Boys, do you recognize the signs?
Boys, when these driving hands push against the tracks
Boys, it's too late to wonder why

Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same
Beware, here comes the quiet life again

As you turn to leave
Never looking back
Will you think of me?
If you ever, could it ever stop?

Quite life

Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same
Beware, here comes the quiet life again
