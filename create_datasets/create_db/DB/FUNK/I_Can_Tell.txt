Ah, oh
He, heh you're not foolin' me
Listen

By the way you dress
By the way you talk
By the friends you keep
That Benz you bought
How you treat ya ex
How you treat your child
I peeped your style from half a mile
Would you think of me?
Sleep with someone else?
Would ya take the time and protect yourself?
Have you lied to her?
Would ya lie to me?
I can tell if it's meant to be

[Chorus]
I can tell when guys are all the same
I can tell it when you're playing games
I can tell what kind of guy you are
I can tell it, I can tell it
I can tell what you really want
I can tell when it's all a front
Gotta know before I go too far
I can tell it, I can tell it

Would you raise your hand?
Would you raise your voice?
Do you act brand new in front of your boys?
Did you finish school or did you drop out?
Have you opened up a bank account?
Cause if I hang out at the end of the week
Do I detect a jealuos streak?
Do you go for self?
Or you aim to please?
Cause I can tell from what I see

[Chorus]

Boy I can see what you try to conceal
And boy I can tell when you're keeping it real
If I'm gonna love you
I gotta see straight to your heart

[Chorus until end]
