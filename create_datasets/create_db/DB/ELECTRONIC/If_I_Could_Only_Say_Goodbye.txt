I remember the day you came into my life.
I remember how time stood still.
You were my lover, my friend, my joy.
You were my life.
I loved you then and I always will.
 
How time has its way with things,
And all the changes it brings, baby.
 
If I could only say goodbye.
There will always be a part of me for you.
If I could find the reason why.
If I could only say goodbye.
 
I remember the day you walked out of my life;
Thought the sorrow would never end.
Then the tears came, and all the joy
Was out of my life.
Felt the heartbreak would never mend.
 
Seems times like a stormy sea.
Look what it's done to you and me, baby.
 
If I could only say goodbye.
There will always be a part of me for you.
If I could find the reason why.
If I could only say goodbye.
 
Did we ever live a lie?
Could I ever call you my friend?
Will you always be a part of me?
How can real love ever end?
 
If I could only say goodbye.
There will always be a part of me for you.
If I could find the reason why.
If I could only say goodbye.
 
If I could only say goodbye.
I know the love will never die.
If I could only say goodbye.
