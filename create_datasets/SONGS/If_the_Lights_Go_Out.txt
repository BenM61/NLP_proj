They say the world must end somehow
They say the end's not far from now
I think they're wrong
Don't worry your life away
Start living for today
Don't think about tomorrow

And if the lights go out on all of us
In just a year or two
And if the sky falls down like pouring rain
Then I'll be here with you
I'll go down with you

Well, I'm gonna try for all I'm worth
To stay with you till the end of the earth
Don't let me down
Don't let your feelings win
Don't give out and don't give in
Don't think about tomorrow

'Cause if the lights go out on all of us
In just a year or two
And if the sky falls down like pouring rain
Then I'll be here with you
I'll go down with you

And if the lights go out on all of us
In just a year or two
And if the sky falls down like pouring rain
Then I'll be here with you
I'll go down with you

And if the lights go out on all of us
In just a year or two
And if the sky falls down like pouring rain
Then I'll be here with you
I'll go down with you
