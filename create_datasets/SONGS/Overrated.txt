Making memories take me
How horrible they can make me
See it over freezing
Puffing and wheezing

We all know
When we have acted low
Can feel it from below
A belt of luck come over

And the pain's overrated, composed
But I don't know do you
And the chain's so serrated
And the proof
Well, I don't know do you

Will I ever loose
These old catholic blues
That direct my shoes
Give me the strength to choose

I feel all low
The fear won't grow
If I show, it just went and go
But I don't know

And the pain's overrated, composed
But I don't know do you
And the chain's so serrated
And the proof
Well, I don't know do you

Everything you fed me
I take it on delivery
Waved it of to lift me
Your all far too slippery
What you gonna give me
(What you gonna give me)

What I have
To get through

And the pain's overrated, composed
But I don't know do you
And the chain's so serrated
And the proof
Well, I don't know do you

And the pain's overrated, composed
But I don't know do you
And the chain's so serrated
And the proof
Well, I don't know do you

Everything you fed me
I take it on delivery
Waved it of to lift me
Your all far too slippery
What you gonna give me
(What you gonna give me)

Everything you fed me
I take it on delivery
Waved it of to lift me
Your all far too slippery
What you gonna give me
(What you gonna give me)

Everything you fed me
I take it on delivery
Waved it of to lift me
Your all far too slippery
What you gonna give me
(What you gonna give me)
