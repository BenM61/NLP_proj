Ooh, ooh, ooh

Come on, baby, and sit down
We've been dancing all night long
Come on, baby, get close to me
We never danced to a love song

Disco music is fine sometimes, yes, it is
I wanna dance to a love song

I love music
No matter what the style
Ooh, I wanna get close to you, baby
For just a little while
And ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

The party's almost over, ooh, it won't be long
I wanna dance to a love song
Cut the lights down low, ooh, it's almost time to go
I wanna dance to a love song

What a lovely way
Ooh, what a lovely way to end the night
When I hold
When I hold my baby ever so tight, well, well
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you

Please Mr. Dj, slow the music down
I wanna dance to a love song
I wanna feel, ooh, I wanna feel your body next to mine
I wanna dance to a love song

Come on and just dance, dance, dance, dance
come on, come on and dance with me, girl, yeah
You know I wanna dance to a love song
You got to dance, dance, dance, dance
come on dance, come on and dance with me, girl
You know I wanna dance to a love song

Come on, baby, get real close to me
I wanna dance to a love song
I wanna feel, ooh, I wanna feel your body next to mine
You know I wanna dance to a love song, yeah

I wanna feel, you know I wanna feel your body next to mine
I wanna dance to a love song
You got to dance, dance, dance
dance, come on, come on dance with me, girl
You know I wanna dance to a love song, yeah
