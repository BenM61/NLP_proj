Curtain opens, spotlights the gentleman
Signing his love letter best wishes, Simpleton
Dialogue swam from his pen like pollywogs
He knew better that perfume was gravity
Pulling him closer to what could be tragedy

Love is blind, deaf and dumb, but never mind
You better catch me when I fall
I'm on my roller skates
Cause any ol' way that I fall
I land in your arms even though it's wrong
'Cause I love my new mistake

Intermission gave way to a miracle
The birth of an accident grew to a spectacle
That couldn't wait the mother was three weeks late
So Father Mason clutching his crucifix
Baptized the baby in whiskey and licorice
What a lovely way drowning sins in tooth decay

Looks like our hero's gonna fall
The bow's about to break
'Cause any ol' way that I fall
I'll be in your arms as we lie awake
With our lovely new mistake
You better catch me when I fall
My sugar trampoline
'Cause any ol' way that I fall
I land in your arms even though it's wrong
'Cause I love my new mistake

The ending turned tragic when many years later
The baby had grown up and married a pop singer
I think it was her turn to make her first mistake
Any ol' time at fall
Any ol' way that I fall
I just lie awake with my new mistake
