I am colorblind
Coffee black and egg white
Pull me out from inside

I am ready
I am ready
I am ready
I am...

Taffy stuck and tongue-tied
Stutter shook and uptight
Pull me out from inside

I am ready
I am ready
I am ready
I am fine

I am covered in skin
No one gets to come in
Pull me out from inside

I am folded
And unfolded
And unfolding

I am colorblind
Coffee black and egg white
Pull me out from inside

I am ready
I am ready
I am ready

I am fine
I am fine
I am fine
