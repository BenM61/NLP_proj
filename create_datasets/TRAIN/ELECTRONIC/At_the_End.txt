When you're away, I'm feeling empty 
I lose my mind 
But when you're around, I take for granted 
Most of our time 

Honey you say that I'm cold 
And sometimes I'm out of control 
Baby, you know how I am, at the end, you're always mine 

I don't mean to when I hurt you 
But I need you, I can show you 
Just let me be when I'm crazy, 
At the end you're still my only. 
At the end (x3) 

Right when you're gone, I really miss you 
You got my heart. 
When you come back, I just want to kiss you 
And it tears you apart. 
Honey do make me stay, 
Believe me it's better this way. 
Baby I'm true and I'm real. 
I'm giving you all that I feel. 

Sweety, I'm trying my best, 
To give you the most and the less. 
Darling, I'm true and I'm real, 
I'm giving you all that I feel. 

Sweety, I'm trying my best, 
To give you the most and the less. 
Darling, I'm true and I'm real, 
I'm giving you all that I feel.
