Turn up the sound
And play it loud so that everyone who comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild

'Cause we getting crazy
We burning down the town
We burn it down so that everyone who comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild
Wild, wild, (wild)

We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born born born
(We're born to get wild)

We were born, we were born to get wild

I came with my people, my people
So we can get crazy and get in some shit
I came make it loopy, get stupid, call cupid
'Cause I want love me a chick
I came to get dizzy, get tipsy, who wouldn't
Hey baby, co-come take a sip
Just sip on some vodka, some vodka
Some vodka, some vodka
(Until you fall asleep)

As soon as I stepped in the scene
All the bloggers they like "ah ah"
My status is fucking supreme
So fresh and so clean (Wow, wow)
I'm feeling like I am the king of the club
'Cause the honeys are lovin' my style
I'm up in this mother, this mother
I'm up in this bitch to get wild

Ay, turn up the sound
And play it loud so that everyone who comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild

'Cause we getting crazy
We burning down the town
We burn it down so that everyone who comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild
Wild, wild, (wild)

We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born born born
(We're born to get wild)

We were born, we were born to get wild

(We're born to get wild)
(We're born to get wild)
(We're born to get wild)
(We're born to get wild)
(We're born to get wild)

We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, (We're born to get wild)
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born (We're born to get wild)
