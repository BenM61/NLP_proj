What we gon' do now (oh lord, try some if you like it)
Is slow it down on the floor, floor (you know you like that)
(Try some if you like that)
Uh oh
Uh oh, yeah, come on

When you look from outside
All you see is videos and shows (yeah)
But there's more to my life than people could ever know (uh huh)
Sometimes I gotta smile (smile)
When I don't feel like smiling
Sit back and ride (ride)
When I feel like driving
Nobody understands but you girl (fo sho)
I can always be myself with you girl
That's why I'm singing

Oh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
Ain't nothing like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Uh oh
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (uh oh)
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now (right now)

Since you been in my life
When I'm away from you I hurry home, aww yeah (aww yeah, I hurry home)
You live in my mind so I never feel like I'm alone, yeah (alone)
Sometimes I gotta go (go)
Where I don't feel like going
And when it gets too fast (fast)
And I feel like slowing down (slowing down)
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you

Oh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
Ain't nothing like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Oh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
Ain't nothing like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way (come follow me now)

Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (come now)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (girl come follow me now)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now (oh)

Ain't nothing like the other girls I meet everyday (from around the world)
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Ooh I can't believe it
