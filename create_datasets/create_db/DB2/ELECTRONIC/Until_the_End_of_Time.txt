Break with the past, this time I will make it last.
Your love is free, waste your precious youth for me.
Until the end of time, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time.

Until the clocks stop turning,
until the stars fall into the sea,
until the worlds come tumbling down,
until we all die in misery,
until the sky is burning.
until the dawn of eternity,
we will be forever...
There is always you and me.

This is it how it ends,

Erase your whole existence.
Go down with me, waste your precious life on me...
Until the end of time, till the end of time.
Until the end of time, till the end of time.

Until the world is ending,
until our thoughts are history,
until we stop pretending,
until we ignorant can finally see,
until we'll meet in the next life,
until whatever will be, will be.
We will live forever, there is always you and me...
