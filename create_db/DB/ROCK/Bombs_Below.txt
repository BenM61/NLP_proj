We sit calm
No we sit stoned
We're the monkeys
We're the show
But if you come along
Yea, you'll be alright

Some say that we're back in school
Back in school we break the rules
We break the rules but we'll be alright
We salute you

[Chorus]
Where do all the dead boys go... go... go... go... go
No solutions just bombs below
Where do all the dead boys go... go... go... go... go
No solutions just bombs below

Padded down and we're black and blue
Padded down we pray for you
We're gonna win the war
That's what you kids are for

we salute you

[Chorus: x 2]

We sit calm
No we sit stoned
We're the monkeys
We're the show
And if you come along
Yea, you?ll be alright

[Chorus: x 2]
