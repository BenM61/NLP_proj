Melancholy serenade every time I hear it played
Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made
Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in my room I watch the ghost of you
Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear
