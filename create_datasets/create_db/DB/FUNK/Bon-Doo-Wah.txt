[Chorus]
Bon doo wah bon doo wah bon doo wah
Bon doo wah, baby I don't know

You're treating me like a plaything
You're treating me like a toy
That's why I call you a bon doo wah
It means you're a big bad boy (Hit it hard)

[Chorus]

I give you lovin' (you give me nothin')
I give you kissin' (you keep on missin')

[Chorus]

Well, you give me nothin' but trouble
You give me nothin' but shame
I'm gonna put you in misery
You're scandalizin' my name

(Everybody) 
[Chorus]

I give you lovin' (you give me nothin')
I give you kissin' (you keep on missin')

[Chorus]

(Ease it now) Bon doo wah bon doo wah bon doo wah
Bon doo wah, say you'll love me so

(Hit it hard) 
[Chorus]
