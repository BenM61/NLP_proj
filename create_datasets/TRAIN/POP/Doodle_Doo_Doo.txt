I've just heard a melody
That is always haunting me
Funny little strain 
Running thru my brain
It's as sweet as can be
It has such a pleading way
Tho' it's with me night and day
When I hear someone playing
I walk right up and say
 
Please play for me 
That sweet melody
Called doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
I like the rest
But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
Simplest thing
There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing
Just doodle doo-doo it
I love it so  
Wherever I go  
I doodle-doo doo die doo doo
 
I've heard all the melodies
From the blues to rhapsodies
They all come and go 
But there's one I know 
That'll linger and tease
I've found all the blues a pest
Rhapsodies to me a jest
So if you want to please me
Just take this one request
 
Please play for me 
That sweet melody
Called doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
I like the rest 
But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
Simplest thing
There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing 
Just Doodle doo-doo it
I love it so  
Wherever I go  
I doodle-doo doo die doo doo
