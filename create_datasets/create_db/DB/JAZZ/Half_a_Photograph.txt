I saw half of a photograph
And it took my breath away;
On that face on that photograph
Was my love of yesterday.

It was only half a picture,
There was still another part,
But somebody tore that picture
Like the way he tore my heart!

Somewhere I'm on the other half;
If you find it you will see
That this half of that photograph
Has a smile that he meant for me!

It was only half a picture,
There was still another part,
But somebody, somebody tore that picture
Like the way he tore my heart!

Somewhere I'm on the other half;
If you find it you will see
That this half of that photograph
Has a smile that he meant for me
