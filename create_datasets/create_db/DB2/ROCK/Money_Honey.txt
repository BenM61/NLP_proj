You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, "Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me."

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, "I'd like to know what you want with me."
I said, "Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me."

She screamed and said, "What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through."
I said, "Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?"
She said, "Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me."

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
(If you want to get along) Well, make some money
(If you want to get along) Well, I ain't jivin' you, honey
(If you want to get along) You better give up some money
If you want to get along with me.
