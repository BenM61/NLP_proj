You pull up outside with your hot headlights
And your walking up the stairs with a girl on each side
Go in the door like a thunder storm goin'
Crash boom boom with the lights on the dance floor
We get down, we get down, we got down
We get down, we get down, we got down

All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go

Taking her time cause he's on the chase
And she's stringing him along
And she's getting in his head space
Clinical form with their jaws on the floor
And the girls keep score
While the boy's in back burn
So cool down, cool down, just cool down
We get down, we get down, we get down

All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
Well all the boys want someone to let them go
All the boys want, all the boys want

Scientific in my brain
Filling dance inside my veins
Twist me like a hurricane
Numb me up like Novocaine

Scientific in my brain
Filling dance inside my veins
Twist me like a hurricane
Numb me up like Novocaine

All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
Well all the boys want someone to let them go
All the boys want, all the boys want
