There's a hole so deep and cold, it will never see the light of day

Until you feel the skin break
Eyes are always falling on you
But that itch, it keeps calling, calling
Yeah, eyes are always falling on you 
And that itch, it keeps calling, calling

I need more than just blood and air to survive

Until you feel the skin break (those eyes)
Eyes are always falling on you (that itch)
But that itch, it keeps calling, calling (those eyes)
Yeah, eyes are always falling on you (that itch)
And that itch, it keeps calling, calling
