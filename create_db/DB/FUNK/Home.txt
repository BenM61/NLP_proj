Seems like I'm going nowhere
Streaming traffic lights
Seems like I'm going nowhere
Streaming traffic lights

Going nowhere
Hold tight
'cos I don't know man
I ain't lying
Got a place to rely on
To get you home in ivy

Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home
Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home

Seems like I'm going nowhere
Streaming traffic lights

Going nowhere
Hold tight
'cos I don't know man
I ain't lying
I ain't lying
Hadn't told me
No one ever told me

Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home
Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home

Don't worry girl I haven't changed
