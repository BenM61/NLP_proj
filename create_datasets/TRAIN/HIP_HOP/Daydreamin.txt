Sittin' here on the job, and 
Hopin' that you would call me 
My eyes, my eyes are tired from us sittin' up and just talking, all night 
My supervisor noticed im kind of slow for today 
My girlfriends also noticed I'm joyful 
What can I say 
It only been two months but 
I'm prayin' that your the one 
Please baby be the one 
Please baby be 

Keep replaying your kisses 
Can't get them out of my mind 
I try 
My work is piling up and 
Who'd guess that I'd get behind 
But that's fine 
Its only 12:07 
I take my first break at two 
It seems I have a message 
I hope to god that its you 

It only been two months but 
I'm prayin' that your the one 
Please baby be the one 
Please baby be 

No, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no, 
No, no, no, no 
No- no 

Its 2:15 I'm smiling 
I hear your voice on the phone 
Oh my, 
Tell me you wanna see me 
Can't wait until I get home, tonight 
My mind says slow it down girl 
This thing right here is so new 
But my heart says keep it movin' 
Two thoughts but I'm not confused 
It only been two months but 
I'm prayin' that your the one 
Please baby be the one 
Please baby be
