You know it's never easy putting anyone down
It's not the same when you wear the crown
The heart is what you've found
Yeah, hey, hey

It's understood, 
But it's never ever good
You know you won't, 
But you know you should
And I know that you could
Yeah, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a brand new day, ah ha
Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a brand new day

You cannot leave when you really want to go
You know the road better than the show
And darkness makes you glow
Yeah, hey, hey

It's in my head, but you'll never get my soul
'Cause I've got love and it makes me whole
So hear me when I say
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a brand new day, ah ha
Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a new day

Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a brand new day, ah ha
Hey hey, hey, it's a new day

I know it's silence 
That will kill us in the end
Shadows on the wall 
Keeps dancing 'round my bed
This paper moon, the sirens, 
Please I can not mend

Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a brand new day, ah ha
Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a new day

Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a brand new day, ah ha
Hey, hey, hey, hey, 
It's a new day

A brand new day
