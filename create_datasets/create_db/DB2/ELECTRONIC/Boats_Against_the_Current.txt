I know it's over
You know it's over
We're just goin' through the motions
But we're sailin' separate oceans world's apart
And you know it's breakin' my heart

I was a dreamer
You were a dreamer
But perfection is consuming
And it seems we're only human after all
And we've both been takin' the fall

But tomorrow
We'll run a little bit faster
Tomorrow
We're gonna find what we're after at last
Feelings that we left in the past
There's romance in the sunset
We're boats against the current to the end

Maybe we're older
Maybe we're colder
So we disregard solutions
While we cling to our illusions once again
And we keep rememberin' when

Seasons are changin'
Reasons are changin'
But the story isn't ending
So we find ourselves pretending one more day
While the years keep slippin' away

But tomorrow
We'll run a little bit faster
Tomorrow
We're gonna find what we're after at last
Feelings that we left in the past
There's romance in the sunset
We're boats against the current to the end
