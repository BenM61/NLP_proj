Take a chance dream a dream
Lay a bet down on me
I will see you with my heart
Raise you with honesty

All the love I share with you
Is too priceless to lose
For your loving I will gamble
And I'm gambling on you

All the odds are on our side
And I know you're worth it
Gonna take it
Go for it

Can I play, deal me in
I'm a man who likes to win
Though I can't foresee the future
With you I don't fear a thing

All the odds are on our side
And I know you're worth it gonna take it
Go for it
