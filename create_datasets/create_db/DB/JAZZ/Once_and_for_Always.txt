Once and for always,
Let's have it understood,
We will be together,
Just the way we should!

Let's not wait and hope
For something more sublime,
Don't you know that always
Isn't too much time?

So, once and for always,
Let's say that it's agreed
Wishing days are over,
This is all we need!

And tonight we'll notify the stars above
That once and for always,
And no less than always,
You and I will be in love.

And tonight we'll notify the stars above
That once and for always,
And no less than always,
You and I will be in love,
We'll be in love.
