Don't mess with my toot toot
Don't mess with my toot toot
Now you can have the other women
But don't mess with my toot toot

She was born in a birth suit
The doctor slapped her behind
He said you're gonna be special
Hey you're gonna be fine

You can look as much
But if you much as touch
You're gonna have yourself a case
I'm gonna break your face 

So don't mess with my toot toot
Don't mess with my toot toot
Now you can have the other women
But don't mess with my toot toot

Don't mess with my toot toot
Don't mess with my toot toot
Now you can have the other women
But don't mess with my toot toot

She was born in a birth suit
The doctor slapped her behind
He said you're gonna be special
You're gonna be fine

Now you can look as much
But if you much as touch
You're gonna have yourself a case
I'm gonna break your face 

So don't mess with my toot toot
Don't mess with my toot toot
Now you can have the other women
But don't mess with my toot toot

Now you can have the other women
But don't mess with my toot toot!
