You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked and you say, who is that man
You try so hard but you don't understand
Just what you gonna say when you get home
Yes, because you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones

You walk in so politely and say, is this where it is
And somebody points to you and says, it's his
And you say, what's mine and somebody else says, well, what is
And he says, oh my God, am I here all alone
Yes, but you know something is happening
You don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones

You hand in your money and you go watch the geek
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak
And says, how does it feel to be such a freak
And you say, impossible as he hands you a bone
Yes, but you know something is happening
Is just that you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones

You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
You to all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations

Ah, you've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks
With lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well-read, it's well-known
Yes, 'cause something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones

The sword swallower, he walks up to you and then he kneels
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice, he tells you how it feels
And he says, here is your throat back, thanks for the loan
Yes something is happening but you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones

Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word now
And you say, for what reason and he says, how
And you say, oh my God, what that means
And he screams back, you're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home
Yes, and now you're positive something's happening
And you wish you knew what it was
Don't you, Mr. Jones

You walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law against you comin' around
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone
Yes, 'cause something is happening and you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones
