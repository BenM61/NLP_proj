Speak my children you will rise
You'll find the light before you die
You will take the crystal stair
Ascend the holy atmosphere

You will speak the truth and you will survive
You will shout out my name, wipe the tears from your eyes
You will drink from the cup whether it's water or wine
You will sow what you sow with a thread gold and fine

Speak my children find the time
Don't sacrifice your love divine
You'll never know the sky so fair
If you're afraid to climb up there

If the days make you weary then let's make you run
From the secrecy, fear and anticipation
Find your strength and your spirit and the life you love
To your mother you'll always be the righteous one

You will speak the truth and you will survive
You will shout out my name, wipe the tears from your eyes
You will drink from the cup whether it's water or wine
You will sow what you sow with a thread gold and fine
