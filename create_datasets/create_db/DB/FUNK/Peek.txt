Every single day
As you pass this way
I know just what to say
But I can't find the words to tell you
Each and every day
My love grows and grows
More than before 
So maybe, I'll just say

Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's watching you?
Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's loving you?
Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's watching you?

Can't you realize
As you pass me by
The love that's in my heart
So what's keeping us apart
Even though I know
I will win your heart
I'll wait just one more day
Just to see you

Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's watching you?
Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's loving you?
Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's watching you?

I'll wait just onne more day
Just to see you

Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's watching you?
Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's loving you?
Oh peek-a-boo
Guess who's watching you?
