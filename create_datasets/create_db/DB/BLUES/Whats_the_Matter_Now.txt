Papa, Papa, treetop tall
Hear your lovin' mama call
You ain't doin' no good
You ain't treatin' me like you should

Papa, Papa, hear my plea
Stop mistreatin' me
You stay, stay away
That's why you hear me say

What's the matter now?
What's the matter now?
Ain't seen you, honey
Since well last spring
Tell me, pretty Papa
Have you broke that thing?

What's the matter now
That we can't get along somehow?
I ain't had no sugar in a long time
Tell me, what's the matter now?
Daddy, tell me what's the matter now?

What's the matter now?
What's the matter now?
You never give me lovin'
Like a daddy should
Tell me, do you really think
I'm made o' wood?

What's the matter now?
Cruel Daddy, we can't get along somehow
Mama wants some honey from that honeycomb
Tell me, what's the matter now?
Daddy, tell me what's the matter now?
