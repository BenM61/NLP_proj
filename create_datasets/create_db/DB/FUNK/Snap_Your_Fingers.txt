Snap your fingers, I'll come runnin'
Back to you on bended knee
Snap your fingers, I'll come runnin'
I'll be true, take a chance on me

Let your light turn green
Baby, I've gotta know
Give me some kind of clue
Should I stay or go?

Let me love you like the lover
That you used to know
Turn the key and let me in
Through that same old door

Oh I had it, but I lost it
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
But I don't care what the cost is
I've got to find my way back in

So you just snap your fingers
Baby, I'll come runnin'
I'll do anything
To get back again

Oh oh,I had it
(I had it)
Oh, but I've lost it
(I lost it)
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
(Heart to mend)
Baby listen, I don't care what the cost is
I've got to find my way back in

So you just snap your fingers
And baby I'll come runnin'
I'll do anything
To get back again, yeah
