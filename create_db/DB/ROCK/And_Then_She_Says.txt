I call her up at midnight
Say I'm feeling scared
Boy you've got to let it go
I tell her what we've got is so right

Can it last out there
In this world you never know
Then I close my eyes and I wait
Imagining what she might say
Here comes your goodbye

[Chorus]
And then she says
She believes in dreaming
And then she says
She talks to the stars
And then she says
She can see forever
From where we are

I see myself in her eyes
And my mind plays games
What if this all comes apart
Everyone around me turning

Promises to pain
History loves a broken heart
Then I see a smile on her face
And I wonder how long will it stay
True romance has died

[Chorus]

Then I think of all the lonely people
All thinking about
Why they're the ones that live without
Then I see a smile on her face

And I wonder how long will it stay
True romance has died

[Chorus]
