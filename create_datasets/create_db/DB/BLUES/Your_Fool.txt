Yes I'm changing my ways baby
I ain't gonna be like I used to be
My past is behind me baby
I ain't gonna be like I used to be
I used to give you all of my money woman
And I wouldn't save a dime for me

You used to treat me like a fool baby
Still I loved everything you done
I was just your fool, I was your fool baby
And I worshipped everything you did like a king
Yes if you ever, if you ever loved me woman
Yes I tell you baby you must have kept it hid

Yes you can go...out of your tears
And get that mistreated look off your face
Yes you know I feel what I feel baby
I tell you I just won't be no more
And then that you realise woman
Everybody's jumpin' down the...
Comin' down the...
