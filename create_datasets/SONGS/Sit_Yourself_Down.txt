When I get restless, what can I do?
When I need someone, I think about you
I got to move on, not fade away
I'm only just growin' a little each day

(Hold it) I got to quit this runnin' 'round
(Hold it) Never gonna get rid of these blues
(Hold it) I got to find somebody to love
(Hold it) Slow me down, yeah
(My, what a time) Look out now

Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around

When I get older, mellow down
Get myself settled on a patch of ground
Takin' it easy, live every day
Me and the raven, we make our way

(Hold it) I got to quit this runnin' 'round
(Hold it) I'm never gettin' rid of these blues
(Hold it) I got to find somebody to
(Hold it) Make me slow down, yeah
(My, what a time) Look out

Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
