Lover, when you don't lay with me
I'm a huntress for a husband lost at sea
If I had you here, better here together
I'd be boy and you'd be girl, beautiful

Calling moon and moon
Shoot that big bad hand
It'll drag me to your door
And I won't see you no more

When this wild world
Is a big bad hand
Pushing on my back
Do you understand?

When I get home
Down in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey

Calling moon and moon
Shoot that big bad hand
It'll drag me to your door
And I won't see you no more
I won't see you no more
