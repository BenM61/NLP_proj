Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know my wrist be dancing crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's f*ck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

200k and VVS, yellow diamonds
They wanna run up but they won't ever find me
Sit right next to the F&N, motherfuck the government
Sit down and I'm plottin'
100 bands on my body
F*ck with them boys, touch a body
Lil mama just want my pocket
'Rari take off like a rocket
Hold up, you too close
I don't know, I don't know ya
Had to run it, run it up
I will roll, I will roll ya
It's like how do you pop off
They all act like they know ya
And Young Post be like potluck
And they all love to blow ya, yeah

I know my wrist be dancing crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's f*ck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

200, swerving, dipping, dodge on the highway
You make contain me but you won't ever stop me
On the way to my residence
Try message your boo again
She pull it, no problem
Yeah, sturdy inside of that Benz
Yeah, come take a tatt on my Bentley
Yeah, people acting too friendly man
They tryna get dividends
This shit is a problem
Yeah, you just be talking shit but ain't no minute man
Fucked your bitch and now you resent me
I know them people but they don't represent me
Them boys, man, we gon' make 'em all pay
They will never stop the plan
Haters jumping on my hand
Rolling, rolling, rolling
Bust it open
Holy moly

I know my wrist be dancing crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's f*ck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, woahh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woahh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woahh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
