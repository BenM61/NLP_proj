Here you come again
And you say that your my friend
But I know why your here
She wants to know how I feel
Tell her that I am happy
Tell her that I am gay
Tell her I wouldn't have it
Any other way

People have been talking
Since we been apart
And when I pass I hear them whisper, (ha, ha)
There he goes with a broken heart
But when you see my baby
Here is what you say
Tell her I wouldn't have it
Any other way

That's all I got to say my friend
Now we better say good-bye
I think you better go right now
Or you might see me cry
But when you see my baby
This is what you say
Tell her I wouldn't have it
Any other way
No other way
I wouldn't have it baby
No other way
I just won't have it baby
Any other way
