You touch my fingertips and my heart is aglow
You bend to kiss my lips and I can't let you go
Maybe I should resist, I'm a fool, I know
But at a time like this, my resistance is low (your resistance is low)
 
Your eyes have magic, they seem to say
Come closer, come closer, my darlin', come closer
And somehow I can't break away
 
Can't you see that I wanna be adored
More than you'll ever know
And I'm goin' overboard with a capital "O"
 
So don't be persistent
Please keep your distance
You know my resistance is low

(You touch my fingertips and my heart is aglow)
(You bend to kiss my lips and I can't let you go)
Maybe I should resist, I'm a fool, I know (resist me, baby?)
But at a time like this, my resistance is low (I know, I know)

(Your eyes) your eyes (have magic), have magic, (they seem) they seem (to say) to say
They're sayin' come closer, come closer, my darlin', come closer
And somehow I can't break away
 
Can't you see that I wanna be adored
More than you'll ever know
And I'm goin' overboard with a capital "O"
 
So don't be persistent
Baby, keep your distance
You know my resistance is low

(Please keep your distance, you know my resistance is) low, hah
