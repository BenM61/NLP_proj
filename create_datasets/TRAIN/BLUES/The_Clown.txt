Oh you won't see the tears
Falling down my face
And you won't see the sleepless nights
I won't leave a trace
You won't feel the endless pain
Burnin? me inside
Baby, I won't let it show
Not through my disguise

'cause I'm the clown
Yes, I'm the clown
I said, I'm the clown
Now you don't want me anymore
I'm just a clown
Said, I'm a clown
And when I'm down
I pick myself up of the floor
Just like a clown

And you won't see the rain
Fallin? from my eyes
You won't see me walk away
That's my foolish pride
You won't hear me cry out loud
Each time I call your name
Baby, I won't let it show
That's part of the game

'cause I'm the clown
Yes, I'm the clown,
Oh, I'm a clown
Now you don't want me anymore
I'm just a clown
Yes, I'm the clown
And when I'm down
I pick myself up of the floor
Just like a clown

Guitar-solo

'cause I'm the clown
Yes, I'm the clown,
Oh, I'm a clown
Now you don't want me anymore
I'm the clown
Yes, I'm the clown
And when I'm down
I pick myself up of the floor
Just like a clown
