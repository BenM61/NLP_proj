I hear you're driving
Someone else's car now
She said you came and
Took your stuff away
All the poetry, and the trunk
You kept your life in
I knew that it would
Come to that someday
Like a sad hallucination,
When I opened up my eyes, 
The train had passed the station,
And you were trapped inside
Yet I never wonder where you went,
I only wonder why,
I wonder why

Oh Caroline
Oh, whoa-oh Caroline
Oh, oh Caroline
Whoa whoa whoa, Caroline

Well I hear you're using someone else's number;
She said she saw you in the store today.
It doesn't matter whose address
You're listed under,
I only know they'll never make you stay.
Like a memory in motion,
You were only passing through
That is all you've ever known of life,
That's all you'll ever do.
There's a dream I have where I sail away;
Looking back I wave at you,
And I wave goodbye

Oh Caroline
Oh, oh whoa oh, Caroline
Oh, oh Caroline
Oh

In another life I see you
As an angel flying high,
And the hands of time will free you 
You will cast your chains aside 
And the dawn will come and kiss away
Every tear that's ever fallen
From your eyes
Behind those eyes,
I wonder

Oh, Caroline oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, Caroline
Sometimes I wonder
Oh, Caroline
Sometimes I,
Sometimes I wonder
