I want you back again
Yeah

Your ain't too short
You ain't that tall but you're heading for a fall
You ain't too young to look that old
You're worth your weight in gold

Come back Suzanne, come back Suzianna now
Baby, baby, please come back
Come back Sue, come back Suzianna
Can't you leave the man? I want you back again

You're such a heart breaker, such a heart breaker
And you got a lot of gold
Folk town living make me sing
And move my back against the wall

Come back Suzanne, come back Suzianna now
Baby, baby, please come back
Come back Sue, come back Suzianna
Can't you leave the man?

'Cause the kitchen needs cleaning and the dishes in the sink
The clothes need washing and the washer's broken down
The lawn needs cutting and the gardener's quit in
And the cats having kittens and the dog's gone

Please come back Suzanne, come back Suzanne
Come back Suzanne, can't you leave the man?
Come back Suzanne, come back Suzianna now
Baby, baby, please come back

Come back Sue, come back Suzianna now
What am I gonna do?
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

The gold fish are dying and the bowls gone green
I've got rings around the toilet, been laughing on the phone
The sheets need changing and the bed's begun to squeak
The parrot's stopped talking and it's only been a week

Come back Suzanne, come back Suzanne
Come back Suzanne, can't you leave the man?
Come back Suzanne, come back Suzianna now
Baby, baby, please come back

Come back Sue, come back Suzianna
What am I gonna do?
Come back Suzanne, come back Suzianna now
Baby, baby, please come back
