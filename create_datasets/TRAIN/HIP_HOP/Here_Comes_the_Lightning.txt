A 9 to 5 ain't ringing my bell
I'd rather go there then go straight to hell
And hell when I'm headed
With the gun full of lead
A Cadillac bed and a pocket full of dip
All my 12 friends came to party
They can't help it, they ain't hungry
I got something, they ain't like me
So here comes the lightning

Rain, rain, go away
Please don't bring me down today
Sometimes all there is to say
F*ck it, bring that storm my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

These motherfuckers don't have no class
Done everything but drunk them off and wipe their ass
Living in a town full of smoke and mirrors
We real ass hoes and fake superheroes
We get up from way down under
All this talk just makes me wonder
They just always sound like thunder
But here comes the lightning

Rain, rain, go away
Please don't bring me down today
Sometimes all there is to say
F*ck it, bring that storm my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (But here comes the lightning)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So when the waters calm and the sun comes out
Doesn't it seem like they're always around?
Watch 'em all scurry as they run for cover
We used to stick together and look out for one another
(Hey hey) We gotta try to live every day (day)
And nothing is common so see ya, see ya, see ya
So here comes the lightning

Rain, rain, go away
Please don't bring me down today
Sometimes all there is to say
F*ck it, bring that storm my way (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Rain, rain, go away
Please don't bring me down today
Sometimes all there is to say
F*ck it, bring that storm my way

Here comes the lightning, here comes the lightning
