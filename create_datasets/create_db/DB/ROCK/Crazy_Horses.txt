There's a message floatin' in the air.
Crazy horses ridin' everywhere.
It's a warning, it's in every tongue.
Gotta stop them crazy horses on the run.

[Chorus]
What a show, there they go smokin' up the sky, yeah.
Crazy horses all got riders, and they're you and I.
Crazy horses
Crazy horses 
Crazy horses 

Never stop and they never die.
They just keep on puffin' how they multiply.
Crazy horses, will they never halt?
If they keep on movin' then it's all our fault.

[Chorus]

So take a good look around,
See what they've done, what they've done,
They've done,
They've done,
They've done,
They've done.

Crazy horses. 
Crazy horses. 
Crazy horses. 
Crazy horses. 
Crazy horses.
