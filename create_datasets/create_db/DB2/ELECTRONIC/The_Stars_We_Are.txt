Do you remember those hazy amber days?
We were but children having the time of our lives
We had no regard or respect and a floor was a bed
And a bed held the mysteries of life

They had to end but so soon
And to sit in the dark of my lonely room
Made it all seem so cruelly real

Say no goodbyes, no regrets
For the things that we said and how we said
That we only wanted an answer to our dreams
We wanted an answer to our dreams

Ignorance is bliss
When adulthood we can't resist
To embrace the years with grace
What a waste, what a waste

The fun we had, the fun we'll have
Reckless immaturity

Woh, for stars we are and stars we'll be
Just you and me
Woh, for stars we are and stars we'll be
Just you and me

Woh, for stars we are and stars we'll be
Just you and me
