(Written by Bebel Gilberto, Masaharu Shimizu, Marius De Vries)

After all, all I have in my mind
Is just silence all around
A thousand times I have tried to find
Pieces of dreams. visions and sounds
And then I pray for better days

Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone?
Don't let it go
Never forget that when
I think of you
You're not alone

After all, all I have in my heart
Are the pieces, that I found
Shades of blue, swimming in the moon
Counting the stars all around
I say a prayer for better days

Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone?
Don't let it go
Never forget that when
I think of you
You're not alone

Do you know how it is without anyone
Do you know anyone at all?
