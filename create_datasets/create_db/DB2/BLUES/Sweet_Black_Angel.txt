I've got a sweet black angel, I likes the way she spread her wing
I've got a sweet black angel, I likes the way she spread her wing
When she spread her wings over me, I gets joy and ev'rything

If my black angel should quit me, I believe that I would die
If my black angel should quit me, I believe that I would die
If you don't love me black angel, please tell me the reason why

Well all right man... (guitar solo)
Ask my black angel for a nickel, and she give me a ten dollar bill
Ask my black angel for a nickel, and she give me a ten dollar bill
Told I want a small drink of liquor, and she bought me a whiskey still
