How can you take back my pride
and shout at me until I hide
but what makes me so dumb inside
is waiting for my heart to die

make me shout
make me shout
content to sit and pour it out
going to take that situation
and do it right, and put it right
and do it right, and do it right

make me shout
you're too late
I let you get back in a state
take my blame and take a break
before you end this sorry state
going to take that situation
and do it right, and put it right
and do it right, and do it right

I tried and knew that something
was to keep me down
it's all over with the justice of an
empty clown
sadness is the reason why I can't stand out
from the crowd
I only need a minute to look
up and proud

how can we just sit about
and not begin to work it out
the trouble is with your old friends
is one who blames and just complains
take that situation
and do it right

come on and shout
and poru it out
on a day that left me back in doubt
take my blame and dance and shout
'cause i'm still saying you make me shout
take that situation
and do it right

take that situation!
