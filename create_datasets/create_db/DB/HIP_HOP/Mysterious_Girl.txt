I stop and stare at you, walking on the shore,
I try to concentrate, my mind wants to explore,
The tropical scent of you, takes me up above,
Girl wen I look at you, oh, I fall in love.

Oh, no doubt you look so fine
Oh, girl I want to make you mine,
Oh, I want to be with a woman just like you.
Oh, no doubt I'm the only man
Oh, who can love you like I can
Oh, so just let me be with the woman that I love.

Oh, mysterious girl,
I want to get close to you,
Oh, mysterious girl,
Move your body close to mine.

Watchin' the sun go down,
The tide is driftin' in,
We can get close enough
And feel the warmth within,
'Cause I'm lookin' in your eyes,
Feelin' so alive,
And girl when you touch me,
It's time to take it through the night.

Oh, girl I want to be with you,
Oh, I want to spend the night with you,
Oh, I need to be with, a woman just like you
Oh, I want to do to you
Oh, all the things you want me to,
Oh, I need to be with the woman that I love

Oh, mysterious girl,
I want to get close to you,
Oh, mysterious girl,
Move your body close to mine.

Oh, mysterious girl,
I want to get close to you,
Oh, mysterious girl,
Move your body close to mine.
