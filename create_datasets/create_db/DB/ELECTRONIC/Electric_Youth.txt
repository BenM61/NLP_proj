Ho whoa

Zappin' it to ya
The pressure's everywhere
Goin' right through ya
The fever's in the air
Oh yeah, it's there!
Don't underestimate the power
Of a lifetime ahead

Electric youth
Feel the power, you see the energy
Comin' up
Coming on strong
The future only belongs
To the future itself in the hands of itself
And the future is
Electric youth
It's true you can't fight it
Live by it
The next generation

It's electric

We've got the most time
To make the world go round
Oh, can you spare a dime?
Place your bet on our sound
Come back to town
Don't lose sight of potential mastermind
Remember when you were young

It's electric

We do what comes naturally (naturally!)
You see now
Wait for the possibility
Don't you see a strong resemblance
To yourself? (oh)
Don't you think what we say is important?
Whatever it may be
The fun is gonna start with me
'Cause I'm bringing it back

Electric youth
Feel the power, you see the energy
Comin' up
Coming on strong
The future only belongs
To the future itself in the hands of itself
And the future is
Electric youth
It's true you can't fight it
Live by it
The next generation

It's electrifying
Take it fred!
