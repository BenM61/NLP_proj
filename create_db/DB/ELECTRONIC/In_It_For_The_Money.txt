I'm glamour glitz and Ritz
Shaking those hips
I'm milking the honey
I'm in it for the money
I've got a high end job
sucking corporate rock
On my hands and knees if you please

Just give me love
just give me sex
just give me money

Just give me love
just give me sex
just give me money

I'm a girl 
on a mission 
in any position
For the easy life
for the best in life

Just give me love
just give me sex
just give me money

Just give me love
just give me sex
just give me money

work hard
why should i?

I'm not your honey, honey
I'm in it for the money

Just give me love
just give me sex
just give me money

Just give me love
just give me sex
just give me money

work hard
why should i?

Just give me love
just give me sex
just give me money

work hard
why should i?
