Angel on the street, with my headphones on
Going to wherever I'm going
Now I'm on my way, can't nobody stop me
From getting to my destination

Jammin' in the club with my rave head on
I'm alone with the music, I'm flowing
Lost in the lights, shadows darken my view
I don't mind, oh

We gon' keep it going 'til the beat dun drop
'Til the beat dun drop
We ain't ever gon' stop

We gon' keep it going 'til the beat dun drop
'Til the beat dun drop
You don't know what we got

We gon' keep it going 'til the beat dun drop
'Til the beat dun drop
We ain't ever gon' stop

We don't give a damn about what you say
