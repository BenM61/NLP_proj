The anniversary waltz with you 
Tell me I may always dance 
The anniversary waltz with you 
Tell me this is real romance 
An anniversary dream come true 
Let this be the anthem to our future years 
To millions of smiles and a few little tears 
May I always listen to 
The anniversary waltz with you 

The anniversary waltz with you 
An anniversary dream come true 
Let this be the anthem to our future years 
To millions of smiles and a few little tears 
May I always listen to 
The anniversary waltz 
The anniversary waltz 
The anniversary waltz with you
