Here I am, waiting for a sign, I never seem to know.
If you want me in your life, where do I stand?
I just don't know
I never feel I know you
'Cause you blow hot and you blow cold.
It seems I've grown attached 
Though we're nit the perfect match 
I just can't explain

Should I stay
Should I go
Could I ever really stand to let you go? 
Can you now find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way

I feel your warmth, got me wanting more, you've left the door half open
I'm in two minds to explore
But then again, am I being honest, being truthful to myself
Can I see my life without you
Could I be with someone else?
It seems I've grown attached 
Though we're not the perfect match
I just can't explain it

[Chorus] 

Should I stay
Should I go
I really think it's time you let me know
Can you now find the right words to say
That maybe I'm getting in your way

It seems I've grown attached 
Though we're not the perfect match
I just can't explain

[Chorus]
