So long I've waited for you to come to me 
Anticipated what I would say. 
And no one could know how it feels to be 
In your embrace again 
So tender. 
Yes 
There were times I could not hold on 

Each day that came a little more hope was gone. 
I'd look into my heart to see what I had done 

And now I can't believe 
The day is finally come! 

I am walking over the bridge of spies today 

Freedom is only one more step away 
You only have to hold me. 

Take me to you! 
Now the things we wanted 
They're so far away it seems 

Your love is a distant thing that I kept deep inside of me. 
Now if I could show you where I lived in my fantasy 

On the continent of dreams you'd be with me. 
I don't know if I could go through it all again 
For what's the point if you are never free to say. 
This is what I believe 
This is a part of me 

No hero 
No regrets 
But only meant to be. 

I am walking over the bridge of spies today 
I am walking over the bridge of spies today 

Hold me 
Hold me! Hold me 
Hold me!
