Please forgive me
I know not what I do
Don't restrain me now, not in the mood
Standing naked in the rain
One step closer to insane
No one left here to blame

I'm moving forward, doing the best that I can
I'm moving forward, doing the best that I can
I won't begin to understand how this happened
What state am I in?

Now you're changing
Your tune to set the mood
Rearranging everything you do
Sweeping up after my shame
Hoping, praying to be saved

I'm moving forward, doing the best that I can
I'm moving forward, doing the best that I can
I won't begin to understand how this happened
What state am I in?

I won't begin to understand how this happened
What state am I in?
