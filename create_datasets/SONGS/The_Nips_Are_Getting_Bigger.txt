Started out, just drinkin' beer 
I didn't know how or why 
Or what I was doin' there 
Just a couple more 
Made me feel a little better 
Believe me when I tell you
It was nothin' to do with the letter 

I ran right out of beer 
I took a look into the larder 
No bones, nothin'
I'd better go and get somethin' harder
Back in a flash 
I started on a dash of Jamaica rum 
Me and Pat Malone 
Drinking on our ow-ow-ow-own 

Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger 
Woh-yeah, the nips are gettin' bigger 
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger 
Yeah-eah-eah, mmm they're gettin' bigger 

Sometimes I wonder 
What all these chemicals 
Are doin' to my brain 
Doesn't worry me enough 
To stop me from doin' it agai-ai-ain
Wipin' out brain cells 
By the millions but I don't care 
It doesn't worry me 
Even though 
I ain't got a lot to spare-are-are

Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger 
Woh-yeah-eah, the nips are gettin' bigger 
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger 
Yeah-eah-eah, they're gettin' bigger
