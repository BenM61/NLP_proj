What happened to me?
I'm just a girl
Only a girl wanting to be someone
And if I try, oh
And if I dream, oh
And if I see
My heart inside of me

Let's go flying together
Let's go fly like a bird, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go skating the sky
To hear my voice and your cry

I just want to be free in this world
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
And smell all the flowers in my heart
I want to feel the love in me
I want to go, go, go, go away

I'm feeling real love
Only for you,
You opened my eyes and I saw the world
It's time to live, oh
You can be mine, oh
And we can journey to paradise

Let's go flying together
Let's go fly like a bird, yeah, yeah, yeah

I just want to be free in this world
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
And smell all the flowers in my heart
I want to feel the love in me
I want to go, go, go, go away

If I had a wing to fly
If I had a tear to cry
I would give my soul
To the angels of the sky

I just want to be free in this world
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
And smell all the flowers in my heart
I want to feel the love in me
I want to see the liberty
To share the feelings in my heart
Uh, uh, what happened to me?
