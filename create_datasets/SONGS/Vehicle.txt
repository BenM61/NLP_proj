Hey well
I'm a friendly stranger in the black Sedan
Won't you hop inside my car?
I got pictures, got candy
I'm a lovable man
And I can take you to the nearest star

I'm your vehicle, baby
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
I'm your vehicle, woman
By now I'm sure you know
That I love ya (love ya)
I need ya (need ya)
I want ya
Got to have you, child
Great God in heaven you know I love you

Well, if you want to be a movie star
I'll get a ticket to Hollywood
But if you want to stay just like you are
You know I think you really should

I'm your vehicle, baby
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
I'm your vehicle, woman
By now I'm sure you know
That I love ya (love ya)
I need ya (need ya)
I want ya
Got to have you, child
Great God in heaven you know I love you
Oh, you know I do
