I just can't get my self together
Its the love we make o-o-o-o-o-o 
Every breath we take 
I'm a soul in motion 

And the show just might go on whatever 
Its the latest news o-o-o-o-o-o
We could never lose 
Its a celebration

And we couldnt change our destination 
On this road of facination for love 

And we couldnt change our destination 
On this road of facination for love

I just can't get my self together

And we couldnt change our destination
On this road of facination for love

On this road of facination for love
