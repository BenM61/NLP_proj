From my nigga Diddy view I think I see his vision too
Purple Rain over Central Park; chillin' with my goons
Big Pop's and Sade's, Cirocs and Chardonnay
My Cassie's sassy, so my penthouse's my balloon
We doin' it big, it's goin' down, nine-eleven
I'm doin' it big, pullin' up in a nine-eleven
I been tryna f*ck for months, baby girl, it's now or never
Got the condo on the beach, hope through our storms we shall weather
We shinin' when it's pitch dark
Yeah, this bitch a movie, but this time I play a big part
Uh, f*ck the marketing, look at what I'm accomplishin'
I'm beatin' niggas by margins bigger than Fran Tarkenton

All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me
'Cause we are, we are, super high
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Bring your sexy ass here, baby

I wanna buy my bitch every bag
And she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back
I wanna take my bitch around the globe
Hawaii, hand glidin' in the mountains, shittin' on these hos
Rare bottles by the barrel
Poppin' Giuseppe tags like it's American Apparel
20,000 up in Barneys, haters'll never harm me
Rick Owens on me, bombers for my whole army
Andale, andale, baby, move fast
She drop it down and bring it back; I like that
I wanna buy my bitch every bag
So she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back

All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me
'Cause we are, we are, super high
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine

Women of a caliber
Only seen in magazines and calendars
And I'm sitting with Miss October
'Cause my birthday's in October
Strawberry and her Rose on
I can see it in her eye as she wink and she toast me
And later on we gonna mosey
To a place where less populated and get cozy

If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss; take a look

Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
'Cause we are, we are super high
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine

Super high
