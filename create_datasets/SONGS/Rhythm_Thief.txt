I am the rhythm thief
Say goodbye to the beat
I am the rhythm thief
Auf wiedersehen to the beat

Oh no, where did the groove go, where did the groove go, where did the groove go?
Lights out, Ibiza
Where did the groove go, where did the groove go, where did the groove go?

You'll never get it back, you'll never get it back,
The rhythm thief has got it and you'll never get it back
You'll never get it back, you'll never get it back,
The rhythm thief has got it and you'll never get it back
You'll never get it back, you'll never get it back,
The rhythm thief has got it and you'll never get it back

Lights out, Ibiza
I am the rhythm thief
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
