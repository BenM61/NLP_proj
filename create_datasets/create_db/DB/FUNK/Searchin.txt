Do you hear what I hear 
Can you see what I see
Everybody's crying out
And yet we have no unity
My friends always ask me
Mary? tell me why do you weep
'Cause I'm trying to get over 
All the negativity
That's why I'm searching

We are living in a world
Of "who has what?" and "who is who?"
But I'm telling you my friend
The answer's right in front of you
We are searching for a peace
Piece of mind is what we need
We are searching for the love
That comes with the unity

Oh ooh oh (oh)
Oh ooh oh (everyday)
Oh ooh oh (it rains)
Oh ooh oh (can you stand the pain?)
Oh ooh oh (why do we live the way we choose to live?)
Oh ooh oh
Oh (I'm telling you my brother right now that we got to be)

Oh ooh oh (oh)
Oh ooh oh (why are we still searching)
Oh ooh oh (when the answer's right in front of you)
Oh
Oh ooh oh (I'm telling you)
Oh ooh oh 
Oh ooh oh (you better look straight a head of your path)
Oh (because the love is always there)

I don't wanna fuss n' fight
I just wanna make it right
What can we do to be strong
If we try to get along
I'm not trying to preach to you
But I am still searching too, yeah
Me and you can do it, oh
I don't ever wanna be stressed out
I just wanna live my life
The way I feel that I should be
'Cause I wanna be happy, happy
What about you and me
