If you tear down the dancehall places
Where're we gonna see the beautiful faces?
Come in wearing their new dresses
Thick mascara on thin eyelashes

We'll be back to brand new races
And their boyfriends who love the chase us
I don't see why they have to hate us
It's not our fault we make them jealous

If you tear down the dancehall places
Where're we gonna see the beautiful faces?
Come in wearing their new dresses
Thick mascara on thin eyelashes

We'll be back to brand new races
And their boyfriends who love the chase us
I don't see why they have to hate us
It's not our fault we make them jealous

Dancehall places
Beautiful faces
Dancehall places
Beautiful faces
