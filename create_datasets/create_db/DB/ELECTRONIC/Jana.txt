She hears his footsteps, he walks up the path
And when the letter drops her heart beats fast
She picks up the envelope then she turns her face away
She'll check out her results another day
Refusing to accept what they might say

Jana cry "I've got so much to give"
Jana sigh "I've got so much to live"
Jana's mind, positive or negative
Jana died

I watch her shiver by the fireside
From time to time she just breaks down and cries
Her cat curled in her lap and she's secure in a place that she calls home
Flicking through postcards and brochures of Rome
Dreaming of places that she'd like to go

Jana cry "I've got so much to give"
Jana sigh "I've got so much to live"
Jana's mind, positive or negative
Jana died

Her friends bring her soup each day
And she takes an array of bright coloured pills
From a.z.t. to vitamin c but still she wastes away
Forcing down food but still she wastes away

Jana cry "I've got so much to give"
Jana sigh "I've got so much to live"
Jana cry, Jana tested positive
Jana died
Jana died
