Yeah once again presenting  
Kid Capri 
Ras Kass the waterproof M.C. 
Punchline 

These fagot M.C's be on skis with the microphone though 
But it's all downhill hitting trees like Sonny Bono 
Name a nigga I couldn't burn and he probably created the Earth in six days 
I shot at Jesus with a tech fives times 
Hanging the pope with six strings  the name is Ras Kass 
Might eat a little pussy but I don't kiss ass homeboy 
I'm righteous and wicked and this acquisition of riches is like 
Selling bean pods and still fucking white bitches 

I rap crazy, you better get fifty niggas to blaze me 
Or ace me, been rhyming since 220 AD 
You feel gazy?, I'm top ten with the raps 
Off the list you scratch, like serial numbers on gats 
I lace tracks with ill lines 20 bar rhymes 
My verses got long sentences like jail times 
Press rewind, listen to jams when I cool out 
I only f*ck a bitch in the park if she juiced out 
Going new routes to maintain my composure 
Anticipated while you still screaming to get exposure 
Rap soldier in the cipher I'm first to set it 
My lyrics get the U.S. Open without playing tennis 

Vindictive my voice pitch is beyond John Blaze 
I'm John Cremation, you conversation with aspirations 
Of me leaving blood stains from Earth to Venus 
Them so-called rap stars will still be living 
with they moma like an unborn fetus 
As soon as you step on stage I'ma destroy you with the truth 
Like the Ricki Lake show, don't come out the soundproof booth 
Or poof, plucked in your bubblegoose 
A lost angel, I strangle at an angle that's obtuse 

Yo, my styles viscous, put niggas before bitches 
Collect riches, bone chickens without trickin' 
And stay spitting mad rhymes in your direction 
Always repping get you open like seasections 
I rhyme greata set it off without Jada 
My flava' leave a nigga shook like vibrators 
Rap composer of the hit your styles over 
I make an M.C. cry just like Robin on Ophra 
Give you the cold shoulder guess who rhymes slicker 
I gross figures, shed light on shady niggas 
And write rhymes, roast niggas that take mine 
Gave birth to so many styles I should have my tubes tied 
One time, when rappers need concentration 
Embarrass I nigga, like getting caught masterbating 
I'm fascinating, I make you wallow in your sorrow 
Clutch the bottle you get your childish style fondled 
My rap tactics make you want to go home and practice 
Match this, drop jewels like Biago Rackis 
I come rough for all niggas that front 
I'm all that five mics and quotable for the month 

I be on some bullshit like the unamits and vigorous rhyming 
And until Buchwhick Bill starts dunking on Kobe Bryant 
I'm applying pressure, check out my melody 
The eighteenth letter, the first letter 
the nineteenth letter for cheddar 
And get a barrette explosive tip shredders to make the rum-redder 
To make the deader then Coretta 
Scott King's husband who had a dream 
I get in you with no Vaseline 
And burn rubber so I tap that ass like Savion Glover  

That the sedative cause your shits repetitive 
And played out, tried to run game but it got rained out 
Wasn't thinking about this style until we came out 
Took a detour when some of y'all went the same route 
Thoughts about doing Punchline make me tickle 
When my flow changes like pennies, dimes and nickels 
Organized rhymes we make the girls realize 
We humiliate niggas like a small dick size 
Now you want to click nines, front and sip wines 
Take mine, can't mess with Ras and Punchline
