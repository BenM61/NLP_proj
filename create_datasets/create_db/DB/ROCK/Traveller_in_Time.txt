Every day I have to look to the sun
To see where it was that
I have come from
I have a feeling that
There must be a time

When I'll get a chance to go home
'Cause I'm so tired
Of being here alone
But I'm just a traveler in time
Trying so hard to pay for my crime

If I could go back
The same way I got here
And see the people that
I once held so near
I'd do my best to
Find an answer for you

But first I must wait till I'm set free
And I don't know
How long that's gonna be
'Cause I'm a man with 
A whole lot on his mind
Just out there somewhere 
Traveling in time
Traveling in time

I've tried for so long to find
Some way of helping mankind
