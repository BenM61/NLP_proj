When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil spoiled bitch 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave we the wave typhoon
Take her out of the heels to f*ck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room

I put the fours on 'em
Came from juggin' with bowl homie
Now look all this rose gold gold yellow gold gold gold on me
Yeah mob ties, frog eyes
What a time to be alive
No neighbors
House on the hill with the acres
Don't date her
Running through the squad slave her
I'm the mayor
President Huncho a player
Twin chopper Sonic and Tails
Twin chopper Sonic and Tails
Niggas love when the birds sing
White cocaine, pinky and the brain
Love when the box hit the mail
I love when the player wanna bail
I hate when a nigga want problems
But I love to give a nigga shells
God protect me from the evil
Take the squad out the cheetah
Streets crawling like beetles
But the stainless steel keep me cleaning
You got it out the mud I got it out the oil
You heard the cash prince niggas on Forbes
I'm the plug
Extension cord
Got your favorite model on drugs If you ain't know it

When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil spoiled bitch 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave we the wave typhoon
Take her out of the heels to f*ck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room

Ay, I ain't tryna save 'em
Momma said don't let 'em no where you lay at
Old bitches back in the day use to play bad
I'm a pull up flexing in the Maybach
Northside nigga but we brought the A back
I'mma beat her mouth up and maker her face flat
Hit it from the back back baby throw it back
Have a heart attack
Can you handle that?
Maison Margiela dabbin' on everybody
I'm on the codeine moving like a dead body
Bad bitch went to college but she real thotty
That's the reason I can't even trust nobody
Celine and Supreme I'm the dab daddy
She coming home with me when she mad at ya
Sucking on me buckling my knees throw a bag at ya
Molly feel like Hercules when a nigga jab at ya
Hold on wait, hopping in the Wraith
Stars in the ceiling like I'm living out of space
Manoeuvre like a boss we don't ever leave a trace
Dirty Diana the chopper keep a nigga safe
Fucking a model bitches big booty little waist
I'm putting the money over these bitches any day
This for the people that taking drugs everyday
F*ck what they say let the pain go away

When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil spoiled bitch 2000 on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave we the wave typhoon
Take her out of the heels to f*ck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room

Pinky codeine and mushrooms
Sweep a nigga like I was a broom
I be going up like a balloon
Chop a nigga with the bamboo in Cancun
20 bitches runnin' 'round nude
I f*ck about 'em, we fuckin' them by the two
I got water drippin' out my jewels
If it ain't Actavis nigga it ain't approved
Migo the gang we will never lose
So many bitches might catch me on Shade room
Got a Pit bull thinking 'bout copping a Baboon
Free all my niggas like a movie they coming soon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like I'm in a cacoon
Ten bitches ready up at the boom boom room
Packin' the John but I ain't Tune
Takeoff!

When I take drugs I go to the moon
