Don't keep me dreaming
If all the hope is gone
If it's all over
Don't keep me hanging on

I can't stay
And dream my life away
In some kind of wonderland
Better to hurt me honestly
Than make a fool of me
My heart will understand

Make it easy on me
Just walk away, set me free
Don't try to do it gently
Just to please me
Make it easy, easy on me

If it's the time to go
If it's the last goodbye
Never turn around
Don't want you to see me cry

Don't make me stay
And wish my time away
In some fool's paradise
Don't give any hope to me
Spin any lines for me
Make the truth plain to see

Make it easy on me
Just walk away, set me free
Don't try to do it gently
Just to please me
Make it easy, easy on me

Better to hurt me honestly
Than make a fool of me
My heart will understand

Make it easy on me
(Easy on me)
Just walk away
Don't try to do it gently
Just to please me
Make it easy, easy on me
Easy on me Make it easy on me
Just walk away, set me free
Don't try to do it gently
Just to please me
Make it easy, easy on me

Just walk away
Don't try to do it gently
Just to please me
Make it easy, easy on me
