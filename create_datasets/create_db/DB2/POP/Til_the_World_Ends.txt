Seasons change and summer's gone
Another year of love I've known
Fades like a dream
Rearrange, boy, make yourself strong
You're not the first or last who's lost everything

And you can bundle up your feelings
Hang them in some closet
Until you need them again
All of us brokenhearted young lovers
Oh, we'll search for one another
'Til the world ends

Frosty window, scribbled name
Stabbing sad refrain of
What's come to pass
The candle glows, so follow the flame
The light of hope can ease the pain of loneliness

And you can bundle up your feelings
Hang them in some closet
Until you need them again
All of us brokenhearted young lovers
Oh, we'll search for one another
'Til the world ends

You know we all live for once
Using is a part of living your life
Daylight always follows the night
Looking at life as it's always been
It will be that way here
'Til the world ends

'Til the world ends
