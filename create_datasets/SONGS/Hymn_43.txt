Our father high in heaven, smile down upon your son
Who's busy with his money games, his women and his gun
Oh Jesus save me

And the unsung Western hero, killed an Indian or three,
And then he made his name in Hollywood
To set the white man free
Oh Jesus save me

If Jesus saves, well He'd better save Himself
From the gory glory seekers who use His name in death
Oh Jesus save me

If Jesus saves, well He'd better save Himself
From the gory glory seekers who use His name in death
Oh Jesus save me

Well, I saw Him in the city and on the mountains of the moon 
His cross was rather bloody 
He could hardly roll His stone
Oh Jesus save me
