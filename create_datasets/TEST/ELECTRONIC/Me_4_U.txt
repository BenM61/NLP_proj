I've got a man with the heart of a giant
And I couldn't ask for more
He makes me feel like a beautiful woman
So glad he's mine, I'll never let him go
I spend my days tryna hold things together
I pay the bills on time
And I give my all 'cause I know she deserves it
She couldn't be better for me, no no

Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me

I love waking up to his face every morning
And hold him when we fall asleep woah
And she looks the best in the dress that I gave her
She wears it just for me

Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me

Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me

Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
