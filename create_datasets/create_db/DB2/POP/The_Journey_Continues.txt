Waiting at the station
Feel no hesitation and begin the ride
Still pretty young,but time?s already come and I begin to slide
I?m turning down, down looking down now
I got you dazey little hazey
I get the feeling, just leaves me reeling I begin to cry

Then the rain came down ... teardrops
Then the rain came down ... teardrops
Then the rain came down ... teardrops
Then the rain came down
I hope it doesn?t rain all day

So later on, thought I was on my own and twilight filled the sky
Voice drifted through, it sounded just like you and I remember why
I ran away from the celebration, another year by, a fly-by
Out the door, I?ve been here once before, forgot to say good bye

Then the rain came down ... teardrops
Then the rain came down ... teardrops
Then the rain came down ... teardrops
Then the rain came down
I hope it doesn?t rain all day

I know, now you know
What we?re gonna do about everything
I know, now you know
What we?re gonna do about everything
I know, now you know
What we?re gonna do about everything
I know, now you know
What we?re gonna do about everything

Teardrops ? teardrops
Teardrops ? teardrops

I been gone to long
It?s time I bought a ticket home
It?s time I got myself back home to you
