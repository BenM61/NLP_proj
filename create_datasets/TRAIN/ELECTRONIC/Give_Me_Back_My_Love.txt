I waited all night long
Just to see your face
But your didn't show
Now I hate this place
Never had the luck
To find a man so true

AII I had was faith
To meet a man like you
Give me back my love

AII I want from you
Is to give me back my love forever
I let it slip away
There was nothing I could do

Give me back my love again
People learn to write
People learn to take
AII I learned in life
Somehow it's all fake
As a child I saw
What was going on

Tears were there each day
But tears could make me strong
Give me back my love

I always wanted to know you
as a friend
Those little things that you told me

In the end
Give me back my love
