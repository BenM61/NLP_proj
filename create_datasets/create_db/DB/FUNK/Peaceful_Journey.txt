Well well, are you ready
I'd just like to take ya on a little trip, come on

How would you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
Wouldn't you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
How would you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
Wouldn't you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
Just let me take you by the hand
I promise to lead to you a better land
Give me your heart and I will be your guide
People there live in harmony side by side
I've been searching for a long time for a place like this
There you'll find peace, love and happiness
So why don't you, so why won't you
Come go with me on a peaceful journey
Come go with me on a peaceful journey

Just let your mind be free and follow me
There is no place like this, it's heavenly
Don't be afraid to put your hand in mine
Just take this trip with me and spend some time
I've been searching for a long time for a place like this
There you'll find love, peace and happiness
So why don't you, so why won't you
Come go with me, come go with me
How would you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
Wouldn't you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
