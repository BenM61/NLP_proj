I just gotta put 'em on
My city askin' me to put 'em on
My day one's gotta put 'em on
Family I gotta put 'em
Shawty askin' me to put 'er (on)

Feeling like I'm one of the best and erbody ain't trippin'
Like an Aventador on full flats but the paint's drippin'
To the people making it up and sayin' that I'm done, I can't slippin'
I'ma taint this with not a saint mission with the imagery to make you faint, Christian
I'm a killa, for my city, nigga
It ain't only me, it's so many grittas
Serving weak cats, makin' 'em take a seat in they kitty litter
Keep something pretty with us
And that's dames and dumpers
They shame to bump us
'Cause we're upper echelon
Yes, I'm dark, I am Megatron, go Decepticon
Whenever Tech is on
Steady reppin Misou ha
That's right, that's right, I can't think of nothing better to do ha
Yes I, yes I gonna be the one say the soo
Stretch all the way to the loo
So you careful when speaking ill of my crew ha

We all came up from nothing
We all lookin' for something, yeah
You want them finer things in life
Don't act like you don't want this

I got family dependin' on me
Hatin' niggas bring envy on me
Get the game and I get the homie
Got plenty on me

Better view from my day ones
Win or lose, there's a bitter feud
Nigga, I'ma be the liaison
Talk now, I'm delegated
Hept outed, then elevated
Call the fam like "Hey we made it"
Buy ma the crib with a elevator like
They know, came up with like no dough
Prayed up I never changed up, I start the game up I got bank roll
Head forth, get mo'
Me and my niggas keep it lit so
Buy my mama that new Benzo
