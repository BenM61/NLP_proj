It's not my imagination
It's a no win situation
There's no way to get away from
From my love

I've got you cornered with my devotion
I've got you captured by emotion
It's impossible to go on
Without love

Surrender your heart to me
Surrender your heart to me
Surrender your heart why can't you see
It's the only way that it can be
Surrender your heart I don't know why
But you never give in to me

My decision is a strong one
And I know that I can hold on
How much longer can you go on
Without love
