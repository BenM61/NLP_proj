Even
My heart is broken in two
Now I feel no sense of certainty
Can there ever be any guarantees in life?
Tell me

You ask yourself what do you know...
I know I'll always love you, baby
And you'll ask me how I feel about you... (I'll tell you)
I know I'll always love you!

Even
I feel unloved and lost
I feel no sense of safety,
Can there ever be any guarantees in life?
Tell me,
Oh tell me...

You ask yourself, what do you know...
I know I'll always love you, baby
And you'll ask me how I feel about you...
I know I'll always love you!

I will take you away from yourself (Yes I will, I'll take you, baby)
For a while, back to each year
That I have loved you
