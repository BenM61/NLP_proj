When I see that girl go walking by
I know a boy shouldn't cry
Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again

When I see her look into his eyes
No matter how I try
Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again

I find I'm cry-why-why-why-in over you
I know it's nothing to do-o-o-o-
Now I'm on my own, I walk alone
A heart without a home
Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again

When love walked out a fire went out inside of me
It wouldn't hide those tears inside of me

Then there's nothing left for me to say
You no, you no, you no you broke my heart
Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again

I find I'm cry-why-why-why-in over you
I know it's nothing to do-o-o-o-
I know it's not the thing to do

Now I'm on my own, I walk alone
A heart without a home
Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again
Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again
Here it comes again, that feeling
Here it comes again
