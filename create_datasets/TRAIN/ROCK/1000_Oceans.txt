These tear I've cried.
I've cried a thousand oceans.
And if it seems I'm floating
In the darkness...
I can't believe that I would keep,
Keep you from flying;
And I would cry a thousand more
If that's what it takes to sail you home,
Sail you home.

I'm aware what the rules are.
But you know that I will run.
You know that I will follow you
Over Silbury Hill,
Through the solar field.
You know that I will follow you.

And if I find that you
Still remember
Playing at trains,
Or does this little blue ball
Just fade away?
Over Silbury Hill,
Through the solar field, 
You know that I will follow you.
I'm aware what the rules are,
But you know that I will run.
You know that I will follow you.

These tears I've cried.
I've cried a thousand oceans.
And if it seems I'm floating
In the darkness...
Well, I can't believe that I would keep,
Keep you from flying.
So I will cry a thousand more
If that's what it takes to
Sail you home,
Sail you home,
Sail you home.
