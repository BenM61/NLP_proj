Come on, tell me what you're gonna do
Come on, tell me what you're gonna do
All the people want to know, what's the matter with me an'you

I can't sleep, I can't eat,
Doctor done told me, stay off-a my feet
Come on, tell me what you gonna do
All the people want to know, what's the matter with me an' you

Baby, baby, baby, run it all back home to me
Baby, baby, baby, run it all back home to me
Now that my heart is achin', an' I'm in misery
