Pickin' up the pieces of my life 
You know what I'm sayin' 

It's going from good to bad and bad to worse 
And now I got you so mad it hurts 
Here's some advice, check it 
To find yourself, you have to search 
Pick up the pieces, know your worth 
Now let me hear you say 

I've got to pick up the pieces 
Get myself back together, for whatever the reason 
I still deserve better 
I've got to pick up the pieces 
Get myself back together, for whatever the reason 
I still deserve better 

I try to fall and get up 
Now you better 
Always seem to remember 
That without you I would 
Die if you ever say goodbye 
You know I'm here alone 
I'm lonely and so sad 
Each day I cry 
I only cry for you, die for you 
I live for you 
Without you here 
I stay adore you 
I'm waitin' for you 
I'm lonely for you 

I never thought I'd feel this way 
The one I love has caused me pain 
I'm waking up everyday hoping the sun will shine 
The rain will go away 

I've got to pick up the pieces 
Get myself back together, for whatever the reason 
I still deserve better 
I've got to pick up the pieces 
Get myself back together, for whatever the reason 
I still deserve better 

Too bad, so sad 
Now you wanna come back in my life 
But I told you not once 
I told you more than twice 
That you would realize that I am everything you're gonna need 
New girl out there, will never ever love you more than me 
And I did the sacrifices so why put up with 
Like we never met 
'Cause I can't continue to go on hurting like this 

I never thought I'd feel this way 
The one I love has caused me pain 
I'm waking up everyday hoping the sun will shine 
The rain will go away 

I've got to pick up the pieces 
Get myself back together, for whatever the reason 
I still deserve better 
I've got to pick up the pieces 
Get myself back together, for whatever the reason 
I still deserve better 

Rob G, let's go 
I know I deserve better 
I just wanna earn cheddar 
I wish I'd learn never trust what I say when I burn letters of love 
You used to write me telling how much you like me and like me 
I could see you as my wifey 
You show a dark sign like the night the moon covers 
Guess you'd never known 'til they show the true colors 
A few of us pay no attention and let it flow 
But not me, baby, I'm sorry you gotta go 
It's taking us toll 
You kinda breakin' my soul 
It's like I'm sitting in a desert and I'm waitin' for it to snow 
Hit the road 
I'd rather be wrong than mistreated 
Now beat it, leave me here 
I'll get to pickin' up the pieces of my life 

I've got to pick up the pieces 
Get myself back together, for whatever the reason 
I still deserve better 
I've got to pick up the pieces (tell 'em) 
Get myself back together (here we go), for whatever the reason (yeah) 
I still deserve better (uh huh) 

Chyea, chyea 
Chyea, chyea
