Dear God
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can

Spinning round
Falling down
World just keeps on turning
Chaos breeds
People's needs
When we should be learning
And I want something more
For you and me to dream on
Oh I've been looking for something to believe
So now it's time for letting go
I've got to let my feelings show
I won't be coming back
I'm calling out around the world, calling out

Calling out around the world
I'm telling everyone I see
Time to take a chance again
And free the dream, the dream in me

Dear God
I'm doing the best I can

Love me now
Show me now
I forgot the feeling
Take me there
Anywhere
Hatred turns to healing
'Cause I want something more
That I can put my faith in
Oh I've been looking for
Something to believe
And now it's time for letting go
I've got to let my feelings show
I won't be coming back
I'm calling out around the world, calling out

Chorus

Dear God
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can
