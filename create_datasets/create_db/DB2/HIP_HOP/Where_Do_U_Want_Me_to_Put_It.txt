Time to get off
Let's get it on
Anytime you're in the mood to groove give me a call
Just say the word
I'll be right there
Baby I'm gon fill you up with tender love and care
It's all to make you feel good
To carry you to ecstasy
If you give me directions
Communicate to me

Where
Do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do
Cause you're startin to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
O tell me where
Do you want me to put it

It's time to come closer
Cause we got the urge
So can we do it once or twice just to rehearse
When can we work it out
When can we work it out now
Oh do you like it when I get my groove on
Round and around and around
It's all to make you feel good
In love even the blind can see

If you give me directions
Communicate to me

Tell me where
Do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
Cause you're startin to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
O tell me where
Do you want me to put it

If it feels good to you say yea
If it feels good
Sure feels real good
Let me hear you say yea
Work it on down
Down

Down
Is it right here
Is it where you want it
We were makin love
I love to get you off

Baby tell me where
Do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do
Cause you're startin to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
O tell me where
Do you want me to put it
