Let me love you down
Love you down
Love you down

Scene around and around tonight 
You're feeling so hot
Trying to think of ways 
How can I get you here to my spot
Oh what am I gonna do
'Cause I'm still wanting you
That night we spent was forever
And baby let me love you down
All the way down
Oh, and that's what I say
I'll be damned if I sit here alone
And you are killin' me softly 
With your sexy sex appeal girl

1 - Let me love you down, baby
 Early morn' 'till the break of dawn
 I want to hold you, kiss ya
 Squeeze ya, touch you
 Love you down

 Let me love you down, baby
 Early morn' 'till the break of dawn
 I want to hold ya kiss ya 
 Squeeze ya, touch you
 Love you down
 Said

Come on in, sit on down
Let me just relax you
Blazin' to the sexy sounds
Tell me what you want to do
Can I get a kiss
Can I get a hug (Please)
Damn do I have to get down on my knees girl
And you know and I know and we know
Where we want to go so 
Oh, lets get down to business
'Cause I've been waiting too long
It's gotta go down now with you

Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Oh, let me love you slow
Oh, let me stroke gently
You know I know
Oh you know I want to
You know what I need
I'll be loving you down

Ad lib until fade
