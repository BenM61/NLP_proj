[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, damn mom
It's gone be alright, don't worry about it
Know what I'm saying, I'ma just go
I'ma just pack my shit
Peace out, alright
Don't worry about it
I still love you though

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
I'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)
I'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)
The things you put me through (Oh)
I tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)
But you'll never understand, no
Now it's time that I move on (Move on!)

[Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo I gave you everything and you still fucked my head up
Children (I'm sorry Ghost) Not now, shut up
Got back off the road, heard you sleeping with fam
The whole hood ran up on me, I was like "Damn!"
So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently
Arguments, face up in the air like you hating me
Ask you one question, was it good?
He have you on the wall like me, was it hood?
You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top
Grabbing the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot
I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out
That night I cried with the kids, I was out
And my man, I'ma do him in
And the Lord knows best what I'ma do to him
And you can keep the crib, all I'm saying is,
let me find out you got men around my kids

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
It was the beauty that caught me and held my soul hostage
'Member those days had you smelling my boxes
Old Gold up in the hood and Big Dup
We could push through the grimiest streets, then throw it up
Like "That's my nigga!"
Anybody got something bad to say, son'll come through and deliver
Brushing off his 88 clocks, y'all can't touch him
I bet a wad on it, y'all can't f*ck with him
Semi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats
Heard ya water broke I was like "Phewww" and ran back
I ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix
To find out that bird nigga tapping my shit
It's alright 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough
Bigger dick, I don't know, must have been the best flow
This thing here, ever man in the world goes through
But f*ck that, I put a lot of money up, I'm hating!

[Chorus]

[Carl Thomas: x2]
It was like ecstasy girl
Found out it was dizzin' ya world
Had us living in a fantasy world
I wish we never broke up girl

[Raekwon]
Hey yo you killed me with that
"Who bought this?" I bought that
Knowing damn well in reality you bought jack
You ain't lift one finger, but you claiming what's yours
Running all through the house, bugged out, slamming doors
We used to dress like twins, sweats, baby blue Timbs
You even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in
You think that I'm the biggest bird in America?
Catch me on TV, I'm come back, never the

[Chorus: x2]
