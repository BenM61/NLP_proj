I like it!

Ooh, I'm thinking about some things
I've done when I was so wild
Things that I should not have done
Just trying to be the man
The man, man, man, man, man
Ooh, then something happened to me
Love told me to calm right down
The last thing I was thinking
Enough, make me become a man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, yeah, yeah
I found love I can feel
It's like walking in sunshine
This is it something real
Let's get all blown away
Time, I found love
And I know it's something to beat me
I don't wanna be the same
Cause I feel the need deep in me

Oh, my baby has this thing she does
And she holding go down
Makes my imagining shoot us
Makes me for quite the man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's nothing that can take us down
We got too much out
This ain't no stuff that's ticking no
You know we gotta plan
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, yeah, yeah
I found love I can feel
It's like walking in sunshine
This is it something real
Let's get all blown away
Time, I found love
And I know it's something to beat me
I don't wanna be the same
Cause I feel the need deep in me

Don't you be afraid to rely on me
I don't have to walk no more me
Set me free
It's my time if eel loved
And I want ya right by my side
No no no no

And I know it's something to beat me
I don't wanna be the same
Cause I feel the need deep in me

Wanna be the man, be the man
