I gave you all of my love
But you treated me like a fool
I gave up the right for the wrong
Tryin to get along with you
When I wanted to hold you close, you gone always too tight
Or you had some place to go - and listen to me honey

Im walkin out the door, tellin you good-bye
I cant take it no more
Its your time to cry - its your time to cry

Oh, I tried to stay with you because of our kids
But you just wouldnt do right
You leave home late in the morning
I wouldnt see you till late, late at night
Baby, also I still love you Im afraid to survey

I cannot go on to make that same mistake again
And listen to me honey

Im walkin out the door, tellin you good-bye
I cant take it no more
Its your time to cry - oh its your time to cry

Mmh mmh, its all over - your time to cry, its all over
Your time to cry, its all over ...
Its all over - its all over
Im walking out the door tonight, cant stand it no longer
I cant stand it hear the telephone ring, its breaking my heart
Im leaving home ...
