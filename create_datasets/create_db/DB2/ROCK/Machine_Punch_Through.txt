You came to rape me of my intellect
I give you pieces of my pride
Lay down naked and play with you
Posing quietly looks a lot like me
Your fucking pistols not so dangerous
Stick it any place you please
Rip me open cause you're dead inside
What you thought you'd find, it looks a lot like me 

And you believe that I'll believe
In all she said
One little trick she said
But it was lost on me
Machine punch through
Through all she said
One little word she said
But it was lost on me
Machine punch through
Punch through
Machine punch through
Machine punch through
Machine punch through
Hey-la hey-la 

Another schoolboy goes to hell
For believing everything he reads
Sell my soul out one nickel at a time
Turn the last page down
I'm not that far behind
Your cigarettes become a torch for me
Burn it deep into my arm
Watch the welts rise come blistering through
What you thought you'd see it looks a lot like you 

And you believe that I'll believe
In all she said
One little trick she said
But it was lost on me
Machine punch through
All she said one
Little word she said
But it was lost on me
Machine punch through

Hey-la 

I'm bent out of shape
Desperate to whine
Screamin' so loud that I don't make a sound
Strung out on speed
Maxed out on lies
I know you're the one to blame
But I can't say why 

You believe that I'll believe in you
And it's not so hard
And you believe that I'll believe in you
And it's not so hard
And you believe that I'll believe in 

All she said
One little trick she said
But it was lost on me
Machine punch through
All she said
One little word she said
But it was lost on me
Machine punch through 

Hey-la 

So cut your name into my chest
See my mind exploded
Please don't ask
And I won't offer any more
