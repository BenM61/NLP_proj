It was late
I didn't have a special date
I was sitting on a park bench
By the lake
I heard a cry
Aand very much to my surprise
Someone kissed me,
Made me open up my eyes
I turned around to solve this mystery
And who d'ya think was sittin' next to me

My sweet Rosalie
Though she always plays around,
She never brings me down,
My sweet Rosalie.
Sweet Rosalie she is always full of fun
I'm the only one for my Rosie,
My sweet Rosalie.

We started home,
It was almost time for tea.
It's been a good day for me and Rosalie.
It's fun together
'cos we're such a perfect pair
And when I want her I know she's always there.
She's ev'rything a guy could ever need
I love her
Oh I love her yes indeed.

My sweet Rosalie
Though she always plays around,
She never brings me down,
My sweet Rosalie.
Sweet Rosalie she is always full of fun
I'm the only one for my Rosie,
My sweet Rosalie.
Though she always plays around,
She never brings me down,
My sweet Rosalie.
Sweet Rosalie she is always full of fun
I'm the only one for my Rosie,
My sweet Rosalie.

She's the only one for me
The cutest little puppy dog you'll see.
