Summer, you old Indian Summer 
You're the tear that comes after June time's laughter 
You see so many dreams that don't come true 
Dreams we fashioned when summertime was new 

You are here to watch over 
Some heart that is broken 
By a word that somebody left unspoken 
You're the ghost of a romance in June 
Going astray, fading too soon

That's why I say, 
Farewell to you, Indian Summer!
