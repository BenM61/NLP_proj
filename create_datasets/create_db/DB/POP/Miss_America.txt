I love America
Her secret's safe with me
I know her wicked ways
The parts you never see

Oh Super girl
You'll be my Supermodel
Although you have a reputation
Can I afford?
Are you above my station?
I'm not the only heart you've conquered.

I love America
But boy can she be cruel
I know how tall she is
Without her platform shoes

Oh Super girl
You'll be my Supermodel
Although at time it might seem awkward
Don't run away
Oh don't you recognize me?
I'm not the only heart you've conquered.

I kissed America
When she was fleecing me
And she know I understand
That she needs to be free

I miss America
And sometimes she does too
And sometimes I think of her
When she is fucking you

I love America
Siempre Confiado en ti
I love America
Porque me trates asi?

Oh Super girl
You'll be my Supermodel
Although you pants are 'round your ankles
And when you're down
I'll be your Dirty Harry
It will be just like in the movies.

Oh Super girl
You'll be my Supermodel
Although at time it might seem awkward
Don't look away
I'll be your teenage fanclub
I'm not the only heart you've conquered.
