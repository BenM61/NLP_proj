I'm getting hotter when you slam the door
Cause we'll be screaming when you're back for more
Alright

Teacher, teacher
I'm the student now
Being bad
So you can kick me out
Come on

You know you really turn me on and off and on and on

Cause you can be cruel
So true
It's gonna take all night

Hear the neighbors go,
Uh-uh-oh Uh-uh-uh-oh
Uh-uh-oh
Come on baby get it while it's (hot)
We need a love fight

Doctor, doctor
Said that we should stop
But he don't understand how we get off
Alright

Burn some rubber
Baby cop a feel
Come on

You know you really turn me on and off and on

Hear the neighbors go,
Uh-uh-oh Uh-uh-uh-oh
Uh-uh-oh
Come on baby get it while it's (hot)
We need a love fight

Hear the neighbors go,

Heavy petting always make me feel
Like I'm Lois with the man of steel
Come on
