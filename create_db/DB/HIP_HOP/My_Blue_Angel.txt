You're such a serious girl 
You've got the weight of the world on your shoulders 
You hide away in your room 
And every day you get just that much older 

Your mind is filled with politics 
Global trends and dirty tricks 
Let it breathe let it be 
Find a little heaven (find a little heaven with me) 

[Chorus] 
My blue angel it's no crime 
To make sweet love in the moonlight 
My blue angel there's a time 
A time for saving the day 
And time to fly away 

You've got a beautiful face 
Oh but you're wearing the saddest expression 
You know that life is too short 
For only seeing your darkest obsession 

You're so consumed with social views 
Conspiracies and hidden clues 
Give it up set it free 
Came and spread your wings (come and spread your wings for me) 

[Chorus]

The Middle East, Bejing Square, guncontrol, polluted air, 
The right to life, the CIA, the mystery of JFK 
Brutality and acid rain, homelessness and so much pain 
Crazy times, violent crimes, its enough to blow the mind
