Breach of my rights, what am I left
After you've taken from me
My freedom of speech
Or the light through my window
Just because you can't see

Should be heard by the deaf
Seen by the blind
Those who are too frightened to lose, so

This is a letter
A letter to both sides
You're stuck in the middle
(It's) a middle with no left or right

What do you feel, how would you say
To the men that sit at the top
That you don't give a damn
But you still need your land, so

This is a letter
A letter to both sides
You're stuck in the middle
It's a middle with no left or right

This is a letter
A letter to both sides
You're stuck in the middle
It's a middle with no left or right

Some don't have time to see
Man and his wrongs
Others just expect to lose
If you don't have belief
To take hold of yourself
How can you expect to choose, so

This is a letter
A letter to both sides
You're stuck in the middle
(It's) a middle with no left or right

This is a letter
A letter to both sides
You're stuck in the middle
(It's) a middle with no left or right
