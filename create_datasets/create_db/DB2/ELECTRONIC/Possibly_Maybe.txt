Your flirt finds me out
Teases the crack in me
Smittens me with hope

Possibly maybe possibly maybe
possibly maybe

As much as I definitely enjoy solitude
I wouldn't mind perhaps
Spending little time with you
Sometimes
Sometimes

Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love

Uncertainty excites me
babe
Who knows what's going to happen?
Lottery or car crash
Or you'll join a cult

Probably maybe possibly love
Probably maybe possibly love, possibly

Mon petit vulcan
You're eruptions and disasters
I keep calm admiring your lava
I keep calm

Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love

Electric shocks?
I love them!
With you, dozen a day
But after a while I wonder
Where's that love you promised me?
Where is it?

Possibly maybe probably love, possibly
Possibly maybe probably love, possibly

How can you offer me love like that?
My heart's burned
How can you offer me love like that?
I'm exhausted
Leave me alone

Possibly maybe possibly maybe
Possibly maybe

Since we broke up
I'm using lipstick again
I suck my tongue
In remembrance of you
