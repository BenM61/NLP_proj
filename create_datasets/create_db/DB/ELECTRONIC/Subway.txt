ooh, take me to the subway
It ain't far away, but the night is mine, like it fine, gonna stay
See you in the morning, gotta rush, et a bus, make a fuss
Gimme some loving in the morning 

Ooh, she makes me feel so good, instant reaction and ready for love (Geez!)
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train
so take me to the subway

Ooh, city life is bittersweet
I don't care, take me there on the sstreet, freedom in the city
Gotta ride, goin' down underground, watch me slide, loving in the city

OOh, she makes me so complete, heavy in love and light on my feet
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train
So take me to the subway
ooh take me to the subway.
