Go tell all your friends that this is the end
Go tell all your friends that this is the end
Go tell all your friends that this is the end
This is the end

I don't understand a word you're saying
What are the clouds running from?
There's something in the air tonight
Something is wrong, spit it out!

I just fell from the mother ship
(they said that)
Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed

there's something in the air
There's something in the air
(in the air, in the air)
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
(in the air, in the air, woah...)
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake

and I'll plead with a thousand voices

I am sane! I am sane!
My soul felt so save up there
No self centered natives destroying our earth

I just fell from the mother ship
(they said that)
Your answers, were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers (your answers, your answers), were always lying on the ocean bed

walk the plank! walk the plank! walk the plank!
Walk the plank! walk the plank! walk the plank!
WALK THE PLANK!

your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
