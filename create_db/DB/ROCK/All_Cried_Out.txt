You took your time to come back this time
The grass is growin' under your feet
And your absence are changed with mine
Someone else is sitting in your seat

And I know that I said they'll be no one else
I know that I said I'll be true, yeah
But baby I've got a cupids arrow and he just shot an arrow
I've nothing left to offer you

Now all cried out
Whole lot of lovin' for a hand full of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when you're pushing me, yeah

So don't look surprised, there was no disguise
You knew where I stood from the start
So stop look around you, you're right back where I found you
Take back your cold and empty heart

And all cried out
Whole lot of lovin' for a hand full of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when you're pushing me, yeah
Hey baby, hey baby

You go your way I'll go mine
I won't stay around you, don't you waste my time

All cried out, all cried out
It's hard to give you something when you're pushing me, yeah
It's hard to give you something when you're pushing me, yeah
