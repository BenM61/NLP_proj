One night the moon was so mellow
Rosita met young Manuelo
He held her like this, this lovely miss
Then stole a kiss, this fellow
He said he was glad that he met her
And soon he would come and get her
But she said "No, no, I cannot go
Until I know you better"

Ti-pi-ti-pi-tin ti-pi-tin
Ti-pi-ti-pi-ton ti-pi-ton
He kept on a-stealing and he had a feeling she was satisfied
Ti-pi-ti-pi-tin ti-pi-tin
Ti-pi-ti-pi-ton ti-pi-ton
She was saying "Go sir" so he held her closer, that's how he complied

Ti-pi-ti-pi-tin ti-pi-tin
Ti-pi-ti-pi-ton ti-pi-ton
He kept on a-stealing and he had a feeling she was satisfied
Ti-pi-ti-pi-tin ti-pi-tin
Ti-pi-ti-pi-ton ti-pi-ton
He will always do so, for she has a true soul and he has a bride
