Co-Co would dream of dancing 
At midnight beneath the stars 
'Cos when it comes to dancing 
Co-Co's a star! 
He danced in a ring of fire 
That circled the island shore 
And as the flames got higher 
They'd all call for more and more 

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chika-ka-ho go go Co-Co 

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho go go Co-Co 

Across the silver water 
The sound of the island drums 
Echoing Co-Co's laughter 
Yeah, Co-Co's the one 
He moves with the cool of moonlight 
Under a tropic sky 
Then into the morning sunlight 
he'd still hear them cry and cry 

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chika-ka-ho go go Co-Co 

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho go go Co-Co 

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co 
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho go go Co-Co...
