May never be who you want me to be 
May never see you again 
Please don't turn away from me now 
'Cause I wanna look into your eyes one last time 
Paint a picture in my heart home? 
I don't wanna go tonight 

Don't be looking at the past 
I won't be there 
Don't get lost in photographs 
'Cause I won't be there
When you wake up from your dreams 
I won't be there 

Where you don't know where to go 
I'll be right here
When you need me on the phone 
I'll be right here 
When you need someone to love you 
I'll be right here 
Waiting for you 

I want you to smile when you think of me 
Wanna know that you care 
I just wanna hold you 
Sometime, somewhere 

Don't be looking at the past 
I won't be there 
Don't get lost in photographs 
'Cause I won't be there 
When you wake up from your dreams 
I won't be there 

Where you don't know where to go 
I'll be right here
When you need me on the phone 
I'll be right here 
When you need someone to love you 
I'll be right here 
Waiting for you 

I'm not looking in the past 
I'm not lost in photographs 
And when you wake up from your dreams 
I wanna be there 

Don't be looking in the past 
I'll be right here
Don't get lost in photographs 
I'll be right here 
When you wake up from your dreams 
I'll be right here
Waiting for you
