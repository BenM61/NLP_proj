Love is the reason you were born
Love was the gleam in papa's eye

People suddenly meet
People suddenly fit
People suddenly hit
And brother, that's it

Personally
Love is a kick right in the pants
Love is the aspirin you buy

If you're flappin' your fins
If you're climbin' a wall
There must be a reason for it all
What is the reason for it all?
Love is the reason for it all

Love is the night you can't recall
Love is the extra drink you drank

Love's a shot in the arm
Love's a poke in the ribs
Buyin' bottles and bibs
And fillin' up cribs

Obviously
Love is an old established trap
Ten million suckers walk the plank

If you land on your tail
Every time that you fall
I can't see the reason for it
Who needs a reason for it?
Love is the reason for it all

All night the teasin' in the hall
Hallways are lovely for a call
Call it the season
I say, "Love is the reason for it all"
