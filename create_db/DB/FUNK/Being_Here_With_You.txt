It's so wonderful
Being here with you
Ohh, it's marvelous
Being here with you
Can't think of anything I, rather do
Than to be here making sweet, sweet
Love with you
It's wonderful
Being here with you

I get a thrill
When I'm in your arms
Don't know how it makes me feel
When the feeling starts to build
Loving you, baby, stays on my mind
Just want to give it to you, baby, all the time
It's wonderful, being here with you

When we're loving, I get, oh-so high
Sometimes I feel can touch the sky
It's wonderful, being here with you
Oh, it's marvelous
Being here with you
Ooh, it's wonderful
Being here with you
Baby, it's marvelous...
