Oooh... Heyy...
I can't wait to get to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way
And bells start to ring
And angels start to sing:
"Hey that's the girl for you
So what are ya gonna do?"
Hey little girl!
I LOVE YOU! (I love you so...)

All I do is think of you
Day and night (day and night that's all I do)
I can't get you off my mind
Thinking back (all the time)
All the time

I begin to take the long way home
Just so I can be alone
To think of how to say:
My heart's here to stay
(Hey I'm in love with you
I think the world of you)
So won't you please...PLEASE be mine?
(Oh please be mine mine mine)

All I do is think of you (baby)
Day and night (day and night that's all I do)
I can't get you off my mind
Thinking about (thinking about you all the time)
All the time
