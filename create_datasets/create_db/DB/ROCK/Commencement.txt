We gather today, with ill invitaion.
To commence here under the sun, a black congregation.
Some know me the hellion, the stranger among us.
Some know me the maggid, in moments the malign Alumnus.
Throughout my tenure, my time in the mansion, a coven arose,
Descendants truly Urantian.
Now please listen close, divide your attention.
An honor presides the
Negus has yet failed to mention.
We've altered the premise and renounced the maxims.
Low and behold the first row tears the Gog,
Alas the sky falls, rain the angels.
