I've got a new friend
She's hanging on my wall
She's not like the others
She's the fairest of them all

When the world it brings me down
And life don't go my way
I'm thinking I should end it all
But I got a new solution
I got a new solution

I'm gonna pick up some beer, and stay at home
And stare at my Claire Danes Poster

Sometimes, my stomach hurts
Early in the day
But one look in her direction
And the pain just goes away

When I toss and turn at night
And I can't go to sleep
There's too much shit swimming in my head
But I got a new solution
I got a new solution

I'm gonna pick up some beer, and stay at home
And stare at my Claire Danes poster
She looks so bitchin', she always listens
She never tells me I'm a loser
I'm a loser

She is so beautiful, and she always understands
Every once in a while I pretend she's my hand
