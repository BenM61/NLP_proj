And in my room, I'm alone in my room
And may staying here for just a while
And in my casket, I'm alone in my gloom
And may staying here for a while

Oh can't you see, light is only in your eyes
Would I be guilty or would I be
The sound you bring is an antiquated thing
So please don't look to me for guidance

Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand

My splendid art, oh my sad profession
Now stick with me and I'll betray you
For should I lose my bad depression
My splendid art I will betray you

Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand

Haul me out of the water, haul me onto the land
Beneath the sky there is an open fire
I do understand

Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand

Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand
Charlotte Anne, I do understand

Charlotte Anne
Charlotte Anne
Charlotte Anne
Charlotte Anne
Charlotte Anne
