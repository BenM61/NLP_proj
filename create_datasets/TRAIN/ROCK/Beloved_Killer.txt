Pain and satisfaction, you're dying day by day
Savoring every moment of torture and ecstasy

Most beloved killer
Such a beautiful vice

Love and hate in one, the fix is so divine
Feasting on your essence while clouding your mind
No need to turn from the gun in you mouth
The taste is so delicious, death with a doubt

Most beloved killer
Such a beautiful vice
Enticed by comforting fear
Such a beautiful vice

Pain and satisfaction, you're dying day by day
Savoring every moment of torture and ecstasy

Can't stop destroying
Everything you've loved
While craving the end

Most beloved killer
Such a beautiful vice
Enticed by comforting fear
Such a beautiful vice
