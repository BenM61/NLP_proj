I was a loner cruisin with the wind
I wasn't looking when you pulled me in
I had to leave you, like I always did
You knew damn well I'd come again

Now I'm falling, where I've never been
My resistance is wearing thin
Somewhere in the distance
Like a long lost friend
Woa, woa wo wo yea again, come again
Lord here I come again

It's been so long since I've seen you girl
Swear I've been around the world
Every room is an empty space
In the darkness I see your face
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo, wo wo wo

When I finally get my hands on you
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Lay you down strip you bare
Make love to you 'til the morning comes around

I wasn't looking when you pulled me in
Wo wo wo wo, yea yea yea
Lord here I come  again
Come again, come again, I say lord 

I wasn't looking when you pulled me in
Wo wo wo wo, yea yea yea
Lord here I come  again
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo, wo wo wo

Wo wo wo, wo wo wo, wo wo wo

I wasn't looking when you pulled me in
Wo wo wo wo, yea yea yea
Lord here I come  again
