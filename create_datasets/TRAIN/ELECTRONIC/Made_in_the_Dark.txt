Since we fell apart I've been nothing but blue
Longing for a night-time to bring back my youth
Every night in motion, together, apart
Apart from the moments so dear to my heart

We were made in the dark
We were made in the dark
We were made in the dark
We were made in the dark

Since I stole this song we have made a new start
My premonition hits hard as our start is apart
Every night the motion must be fixed by glue
But babe, be careful, what's fixed as one breaks in two

We were made in the dark
We were made in the dark
We were made in the dark
We were made in the dark
