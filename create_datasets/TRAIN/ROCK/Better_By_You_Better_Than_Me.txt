You can find a way to be my passion
You listen to the blood flowin' in my vein
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her what I'm like within
I can't find the words my mind is dim
It's better by you better than me

Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak the thoughts of hell so long inside
Tell her now I've got to go
Fight in the streets and guide the sword
Tell her the world's not much fallin' for
It's better by you better than me

It's better by you better than me
You can tell her what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you better than me

Guess I'll have to change my way of livin'
Only really know the way I've been
Guess I'll lean to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
Finds my blood upon her window sill
It's better by you better than me

It's better by you better than me
You can tell her what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you better than me
It's better by you better than me
You can say what I can see
You can tell her what I want it to be
It's better by you better than me
It's better by you
You know better than me
Yeah you can say what I only can see
