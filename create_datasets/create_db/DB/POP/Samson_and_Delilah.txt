Samson and Delilah lived
A long long time ago, she was undecided
But man, that hair just had to go
Na, na, na, na, na

Ain't no glory in this fable
Like the story Cane and Abel
Samson's gonna turn the tables

Samson had a feeling
That God would guide his feeble hand
Man you should've seen him
Pushin' pillars from the stand

On the Friday evening
Things were going mighty fine
Then he started sleeping
'cause she slipped something in the wine
Na, na, na, na, na

Samson neatly turned the tables
Ain't no glory in this fable

Samson had a feeling
Like the story Cane and Abel
Samson neatly turned the tables
