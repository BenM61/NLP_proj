I orbit around the way that you are
Can't help but be drawn because you're a star
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Won't you please navigate to me, to me?

I love the way you open my heart
I feel you around me like Venus and Mars
So baby, baby, baby, baby
Please stay and navigate to me, to me

Eventually you will proceed to give me what I need
Oh, w-w-w-w-woah
And that's how it should be
You leave and return
You're just like Saturn to me, to me (Saturn to me)

Oh, no, no, no

Your constellation circulating me, ooh-ooh
Like a Capricorn, you're hard to release
So maybe, maybe, baby, baby
Would you please find your way back to me, to me? Oh-ooh

Eventually you will proceed to give me what I need
Oh, w-w-w-w-woah
And that's how it should be
You leave and return
You're just like Saturn to me, to me
Eventually you will proceed to give me what I need (What I need)
Oh, w-w-w-w-woah
And that's how it should be (How it should be)
You leave and return
You're just like Saturn to me, to me (Saturn to me)

You return like Saturn to me
You return like Saturn to me
You return like Saturn to me
You return like Saturn to me

Eventually (You return like)
You will proceed (Saturn to me)
To give me what I need, oh yeah (You return like Saturn to me)
And that's how it should be (You return like)
Leave and return (Saturn to me)
You're just like Saturn to me (You return)
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah
