I wanna be faithful
I wanna be believable
I wanna be grateful
I wanna really please You Lord
I wanna be emotional
I wanna be responsible
I wanna be a laborer
I wanna live in favor

Bless me to walk in the light of You, Lord
I wanna be personal
I wanna be inseparable

[Chorus]
I wanna be all You want me to be
(I'll take it to the street)
I'll do it, I'll do it
Just send me Lord I'll go
I wanna be all You want me to be
(I'll tell it on the mountain)
I'll tell it, I'll tell it
Just send me Lord I'll go

I wanna be special
I wanna be a clean vessel
I wanna be powerful
I wanna see Your miracles
I wanna be dependable
I wanna be an example
I Wanna be the one You use
Bless me to walk in the light of You, Lord
I wanna be personal
I wanna be inseparable

[Chorus: x2]

(I'll start it all home)
I will do Your mighty work
(I'll take it to the streets Lord)
I will do Your mighty work
(I just wanna serve You Lord)
I will do Your might work
(Stay in Your will)
I will do Your mighty work
(I know You're depending on me)
I will do Your mighty work
(I wanna be pleasing in Your sight)
I will do Your mighty work
(Oh)
I will do Your mighty work
(A living sacrifice)
I will do Your might work

Spread the news through the land
To every woman, boy, girl, and man

Spread the news through the land
To every woman, boy, girl, and man

[Chorus: x2]
