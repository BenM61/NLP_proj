I was crawling through a festival way out west 
I was thinking about love and the acid test 
But first I got real dizzy with a real rocking gang 
Then I saw the Coma Girl and the excitement gang 

And the rain came in from the wide blue yonder 
Through all the stages I wandered 

Coma Girl and the excitement gang 
Mona Lisa on the motorcycle gang 
Coma Girl
Coma Girl 
Coma Girl was beating with the Oil Drum gang 
Some fast food fanatic was burning down the burger van 
Somebody was wailing off their head 
Nobody was ripping the teen scene dead 

And the rain came in from the wide blue yonder 
I thought you and me might wander 
Chorus 

As the 19th hour was falling upon Desolation Row 
Some outlaw band had the last drop on the go 
Let's siphon up some gas let's get this show on the road 
Said the Coma Girl to the excitement gang 

Into action everybody sprang 
The oil drums were beating out dulang dulang 

Coma Girl and the excitement gang 
Mona Lisa on the motorcycle gang 
Coma Girl
Coma Girl
