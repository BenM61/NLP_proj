There's probably a lot of you girls out there hung up on a man
And you're caught in that old familiar way of wanting someone
Who don't want you
You know, men are full of schemes
And they're masters of getting control of our minds and making
Us dependent on them

As I look back to the day you left me
I felt that love had forsaken me
As time went by, tears began to dry
Now I see you never really cared
Life is wonderful when love is shared

The day that I lost you, that's the day I found myself
The day that I lost you, that's the day I found myself

Your love controlled, but never consoled me
I was in love, but so unhappy
So many nights I was in the cold
When you left, you opened up the door
To a world I'd never seen before

The day that I lost you, that's the day I found myself
The day that I lost you, that's the day I found myself

I found love with someone who needs me
I'm loving life the way it should be
I gave you love, you only used me
And when you left, you hurt yourself
I found identity with someone else

The day that I lost you, that's the day I found myself
The day that I lost you, that's the day I found myself
 
Don't you know that you only hurt yourself
I'm so glad you're gone, cause you made me so... 

Oh, bless the day you left, cause that's the day I found myself...
