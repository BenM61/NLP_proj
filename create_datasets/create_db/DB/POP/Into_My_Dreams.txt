We're standing here all along knowing just what to do
I'm always moving closer dear out of love for you
Now you tell me that it's time to find something true
But I've never really seen quite the likes of you

Come into my dreams, come into my dreams, come into my dreams

I had long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you every night
I had long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you every night
Long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you

You're touching me, telling me, you have no promises that lie
No more empty lonely nights, no more wondering why
Now I'm moving close to you, hoping nothing will change your mind
Cause you move right through my dreams, leaving burning desire

Come into my dreams, come into my dreams, come into my dreams

I had long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you every night
I had long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you every night
Long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you

I had long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you every night
Long nights, long dreams, I will wait, I will wait for you

Long nights, long dreams, I will wait for you every night
