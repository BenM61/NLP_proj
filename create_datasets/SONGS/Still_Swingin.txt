Number one, step it up
Spit the fire, I'll back it up
Count me in, I'll turn it out
I'm killing it, you're burning out
Never change, never break
I'm the real, you're the fake
Set it off, go underground
You feeling it, this future sound

Nonstop, devastating everything
On top, never coming down
I-I've got my hands in everything
Nonstop, I'm never coming down

We're just living for today
Keep on light on in the haze
Yeah, forever we will stay
We are the ones still swingin'
We are a beacon in the dark
A lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swingin'
Yeaow

I'm dangerous, passionate
Watch your back, they're stabbin' it
Hold on and hold tight
I slash your faces every night
We don't belong, never will
Never cared, we always kill
Sow me up and I will attack
Because P Roach is a new black

Nonstop, devastating everything
On top, never coming down
I-I've got my hands in everything
Nonstop, I'm never coming down

We're just living for today
Keep on light on in the haze
Yeah, forever we will stay
We are the ones still swingin'
We are a beacon in the dark
A lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swingin'
We are the ones still swingin', swingin'

We-We are the ones still swingin'

Nonstop, devastating everything
On top, never coming down
I've got my hands in everything
Nonstop, I'm never coming down

We're just living for today
Keep on light on in the haze
Yeah, forever we will stay
We are the ones still swingin'
We are a beacon in the dark
A lighthouse risen from the heart
We've been here from the start
We are the ones still swingin'
We are the ones still swingin'
We are the ones still swingin'
