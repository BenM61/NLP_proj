what's the go with all these new set of rules that you live by?
'fraid you might die? watch them go by...

what's the go with all you scene suckin' fuckers you so high?
yeah your so high? watch em watch em go watch em go by

sleeping orders won't get you through the door,

cos science in golden, science is golden,
watch your soul cos science is golden,

i don't know why you lay me out to follow,
i don't know why you lay me outside,
cos science in golden, science is golden,
watch your soul cos science is golden,

science science science is go-olden, science science science is go-olden,
science science science is go-olden, science science science...

watch em go by, watch em go by, watch em go by, watch em go by,

i don't know why you lay me out to follow,
i don't know why you lay me outside,
cos science in golden, science is golden,
watch your soul cos science is golden.

i don't know why you lay me out to follow,
i don't know why you lay me outside,
cos science in golden, science is golden,
watch your soul cos science is golden.

science science science is go-olden, science science science is go-olden,
science is golden, science is golden.
