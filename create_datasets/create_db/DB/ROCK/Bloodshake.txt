From the valley of the jungle, to the bottom of the sea
You're a river in Bongo, just a heart in ecstasy
From the forest in Arden where I reside, blood will be blood
Back in Arden, you twist, deprive blood to be

You vibe so hard
And you live this forever

We spit blood in the sun, we spit blood in the ocean
We spit blood in the sun, we spit blood in the ocean

As we plunge into the ocean, the waves they pull us down
For a moment I'm open, for blood to be

You vibe so hard
And you live this forever

We spit blood in the sun, we spit blood in the ocean
We spit blood in the sun, we spit blood in the ocean
