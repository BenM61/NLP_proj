Sometimes I remember the old days
When the world was filled with sorrow
You might have thought I was livin'
But I was all alone

In my heart the rain was fallin'
The wind blew and
The night was callin'
Come back, come back, I'm all you've ever known

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you my friend
You're like a rainbow comin' around the bend
And when I see you smilin'
Well, it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you 
As you are to me

There were friends who could always see me
Through the haze their smiles would reach me
Saying okay, saying good-bye, saying hello
Soon I knew just what I was after 
Was life and love, tears and laughter
Hello, my good friend, hello my darlin'
What do you know

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you my friend
You're like a rainbow comin' around the bend
And when I see you smilin'
Well, it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you 
As you are to me

I used to think it was only me feeling alone
Not feeling free to be alive to be a friend
Now I know we all have stormy weather
The sun shines through when we're together
I'll be your friend right through to the end

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you my friend
You're like a rainbow comin' around the bend
And when I see you smilin'
Well, it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you 
As you are to me
