Please allow me to be your anti-depressant
I too am prescribed as freely as any decongestant

We kick back and let the pills do the talking
People hear a distinct rattle when we're walking
Then there's the extra two stone that's our only guarantee

Our vivid dreams are just like big production movies
They get entangled well within our daily routines
So please re-think or use my trademark strategy

And please allow me to be your anti-depressant
I too am prescribed as freely as any decongestant

It's hard to smile when you're as flattened as a pancake
The only tears come from our heads when we concentrate
Perhaps I'm being unjust or perhaps you agree

Still I've thrown away my citalopram
I needed more than what was in those 40 milligrams
So cast away with the doctor's plans

And please allow me to be your anti-depressant
I too am prescribed as freely as any decongestant

Still I've thrown away my citalopram
Although I felt as grim as the reaper man
So cast away with the doctor's plans
Like me
