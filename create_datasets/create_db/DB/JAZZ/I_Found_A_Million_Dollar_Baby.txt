It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

Incidentally
If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store.
Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all.

Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place.
For example, take my case.
(Bing scats.)

Incidentally
If you should run into a shower
Oh, step inside my cottage door
And meet my million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store.
