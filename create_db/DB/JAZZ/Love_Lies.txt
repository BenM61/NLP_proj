Love lies have a way of sounding true, 
When love lies comes from one as sweet as you,
I know I'm not an angel, dear, 
But when you say that I am, 
How I love to hear you.
Tell me, are you thrilled each time we meet, 
And tell me, how I sweep you off your feet,
Although I don't believe a word, 
They're the sweetest love lies that I have ever heard.
