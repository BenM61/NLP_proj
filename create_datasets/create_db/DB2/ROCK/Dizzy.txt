Dizzy,
I'm so Dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy

The first time that I saw you, girl
I knew that I just had to make you mine
But it's so hard to talk to you with fellas
Hanging 'round ya all the time

I want you for my sweet pet,
But you keep playing hard to get
You're going round in circle all the time

Dizzy,
I'm so Dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy

Finally got to talk to you,
And I told you just exactly how I felt,
Then I held you close to me,
And I kissed you, and my heart began to melt

Girl you've got control of me
'Cause I'm so dizzy, I can't see
I need to call a doctor for some help

Dizzy,
I'm so Dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you girl, making it spin
You're making me Dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you girl, making it spin
You're making me Dizzy

I'm Dizzy
I'm Dizzy
Like a whirlpool
Dizzy
Dizzy
Dizzy
