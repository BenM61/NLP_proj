Where do I begin?
Is my story still untold?
Left to be unwritten
Like memories to unfold
And I don't believe the truth
It doesn't make me feel alive
The truth's just overrated
We've all got something to hide

'Cause lies make it so much fun
So sing the praise of insincerity

Make this your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint
No use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame
Life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will Put a bullet in his head

Pay me no more mind
Have I really come undone?
I left the world this evening
Just to kill the sun
And I've got no more to bleed
All that's left will soon be gone
Especially before my mind fades like the stars at dawn

Well I bet you got a lot to say
So have it your way and crucify me

Maybe is your your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint
No use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame
Life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will
Put a bullet in his head

Breathless kiss to end all this
I fall, I say goodbye to all
Close my eyes oh sweet demise
A love that no one understands

And I don't believe in redemption
And no one will be spared
There's thirty-two ways you can die here tonight
It's a fucking family affair

I'm not your savior or a saint
No use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame
Life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will
Put a bullet in his head
