Something in my heart died last night
Just one more chip off an already broken heart
I think the heart broke long ago
That's when I needed you
When I needed you most
That's when I needed you
When I needed you most

I run around like a spirit in flight
Fearlessness is fearlessness
I will not forget this night
Dare my wild heart
Dare my wild heart

Where is the reason
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on my wild heart
As to the seasons
You fought from the beginning
Long before I knew it
There was a danger
And the danger was
To fall in love

In dark sorrow
They gaze down into the darkest heart
If I leave you
You say not even you can tear us apart
Say you're leaving
You say you don't even know
How to start how to start how to start
Well believe it then
And don't blame it on my soul
Blame it on my wild heart
Oh on my wild heart oh

Fire on fire rain on my face
Fever goes higher what can you do
Wild in the darkest places of your mind
That's where I needed you
Where I needed you most
That's where I needed you
Where I needed you most

Where is the reason
Well don't blame it on me
Blame it on my wild heart
There is a reason
Why even the angels 
Don't give up at all
Where are the children
Well are they hopelessly enchanted
Blame it on the angels
Where are the reasons
Don't blame it on our wild hearts
Wild heart wild heart wild heart

On my wild heart
On my wild heart
Even in the darkest places of your mind
Whoa are the children are they hopelessly enchanted
Wild in the darkest places of your mind
No don't blame it on me, baby
Blame it on my wild heart
Blame it on my blame it on my blame it on my
Blame it on my wild heart
Even in the back of your even in the back of your mind
