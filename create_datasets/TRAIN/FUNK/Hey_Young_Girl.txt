Hey young girl how you feelin' today
Girl your body just brighten my day up
See you have now been approached by a playa'
But baby I won't play ya, lets have a conversation like
Is you in school? What is your major?
Shawty give me your number 'cause I'm dyin' to date ya
Ain't got a lot of time so I ain't tryin' to chase ya
Just store it in the memory of my three way pager (Ooh)

Adrenaline rush like ooh
Can't explain what I want to do to ya
I need some vegetable stew
'Cause shawty got me feelin' weak
Hey young girl (the world is yours)
Hey young girl  (the world is yours)
Young girl young girl

Now rollin' wit' me, believe these girls gon' hate ya
See they just jealous 'cause they know Ima lace ya
Wit' loads of clothes made sweet as Mary Kay in the
Middle of May trips to Montego Bay
Girl your hips make me want to change religions
Just as long as you ain't no pigeon
Shawty we could be country livin'
Funktified lets keep it deep fried like that

Ooh Adrenaline rush like ooh
Can't explain what I want to do to ya

There's no place in the world that's quite like the dirty south.
So give me your information so we can work it out.

See shawty got flavor like a peach lifesaver
Won't you come down to the studio later?
Kyle can rhyme keep the beat tight, we can chill underneath the street light.
She's from the south so she's fine, and classy
Skin is smooth and she's never ashy
Roll her dro, gotcha fresh and clean and In the Coupe Deville gangsta leanin'.
Hey young girl
That's how them country boys roll
