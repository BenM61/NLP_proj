I listened to your album, and I watched your favorite film, 
Hey hey hey, I missed you today. 
I let those early letters I fulfilled with early dreams. Some of them 
Materialized, others never seen. 
We used to watch the world walkin' by 

The truth is you're not here, here I am. 
I'm screwed up again. 
No matter what which way I turn, how my feelings slowly 
Bleeding here for you. 
I'm spending time with hope, and I don't know why it is. 
It's just the way it is

What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you! 
What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you! 

I made your favorite dinner, and I wore the shirt you love, 
Hey hey hey, just in case you came. 
My friends still ask about you, when I say you're just fine. 
And have you seen the world walking by...

The truth is you're not here, here I am. 
I'm screwed up again. 
No matter what which way I turn, how my feelings slowly 
Bleeding here for you. 
I'm spending time with hope, and I don't know why it is. 
It's just the way it is.

What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you! 
What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you! 

The truth is you're not here, and I'm screwed up again. 
And I don't know the reason why, I don't know why it is. 

And will I ever say, I just need your love. 
I want you back again, I want you back again!

You said that this isn't yet a time, so give me time...to get you 
Back again.

What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you! 
What am I to say? What am I to do? What am I alone without you!
