Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Underneath the green veranda
Singin' a song for mad Miranda
They call me the Midnight Moses
Everything I touch is comin' up roses

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Tell me where I'm goin'
I've got no way of knowin'
I wish I was a forest ranger
Danger, danger, danger

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I had an afternoon fever
When I flew off to Geneva
I just took me a notion
To fly right across the ocean

They call me the Midnight Moses
Everything I touch is comin' up roses
I had an afternoon fever
When I flew off to Geneva
