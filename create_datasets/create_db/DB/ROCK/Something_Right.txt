I've seen my chances come and go
How they escape me I'll never know
I've had the answers there in my hand
I just didn't understand

Now Lady Luck has smiled at me
And given me another try
To meet up with my destiny
To find a way to fly

I want to do something right for once in my life
Before it's too late and I give up the fight
Gonna bury my fears and save a few tears
Because I did something right

I see you standing there by the door
I get the feeling we've been here before
Watching emotions like runaway trains
We shouldn't miss again

But Lady Luck has smiled at me
And given me another try
To meet up with my destiny
And do something right

I want to do something right for once in my life
Before it's too late and I give up the fight
Gonna bury my fears and save a few tears
Because I did something right

I don't want to sit back waiting
As I watch my ship go by
Tomorrow won't wait for you and I

I've seen my chances come and go
How they escape me I'll never know
I've had the answers there in my hand
Now that I understand
