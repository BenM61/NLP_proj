Disappear into the dust 
Lost on your horse 
Blown away by your gust 
Lost on your horse 

Desert land under the sun 
Lost on your horse 
Like a grain of sand 
Lost in your storm 
On the crossroads take a left 
Lost on your horse 

Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes 

Riding on, getting lost 
Lost on your horse 
Disappear into the dust
Lost on your horse 
Racing on the desert dunes 
I chase you like a moon 
But on the crossroads take a left 
Lost on your horse 

Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
