The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style boy
You know what I'm sayin'?

R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P A see, R.I.P n****s that wanna OD
Aiyyo, the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize n**** I'm straight from the street

These industry n****z startin' to look like somethin' to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, "You wanna see her again?"
Get your a** down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of f***in' an' are 'n' be, b****

And I'll wake up early and bounce with all your s***
When I apply pressure, son it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that n**** anytime

Have Keith sweatin' starin' down the barrel from my nine
Since these Harlem World n****z seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, "Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now"

The only excuse for being broke is bein' in jail
An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks

Plottin' to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin' to live for
Don't want no n**** puttin' four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Mariah like, "B****, get on the ground"

You ain't with Tommy no more who gonna protect you now?
I been skeamin' on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum s*** around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick

I'm 'bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school s***
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight a** mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
This n**** weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?

This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal, so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry n****?

I'll catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies
And Will Smith and Jada a** down in Miami
Run up on Timberland and Missy the pound
Like you gimme the cash and you put the hot dog down

I figured it out
Been robbin' Joe before that's why his a**
Don't wanna be a playa no more
Mad at you I'm robbin' J.D., f*** you, pay me

Had Da Brat with 'em, shoulda had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down well you tell homey
I'm on that Treach s***, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue man, his s*** did well

I wanna stick TQ but his s*** ain't sell
I hit the studios, take s*** and leave
Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny a** rings
Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three

I'll beat your a** like that white boy on MTV
Cannibus wanna battle while I'm stickin' them up
N**** get capped coroners pickin' 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his s***, n**** try to stall ya

He said, "Why you robbin' me I got nuttin' but love for ya"
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, "Even my gold teeth?"
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep

One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?

And walk off with your s*** like it's mine?
I'm a keep stickin' n****s until I'm livid
I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins

Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real I'm 'bout to stick Mister see
That n**** still eatin' off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor

He asked me if I had enuff I told him, "Gimme some more"
Is you feelin' this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin' Gods People

This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal, so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry n****?

This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal, so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry n****?

For real, yo, you know what I'm sayin'?
N****s got to get stuck up that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry n**** or a regular n****
It don't matter, if you got it and I need it I want it
50 Cents ain't f***in' around

Track Masters ain't f***in' around
Crazy Cat ain't f***in' around
The Madd Rapper ain't f***in' around
So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets
Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus
'Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not
