Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
He once was a true love of mine

Tell him I'll make him a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needlework
Then he'll be a true love of mine

Take him to find us an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Between salt water and the sea strand
Then he'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then he'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
He once was a true love of mine.
