Finally got myself together (now I know)
Now I know just who I am (I'm a changed man)
Finally got myself together (but now I know)
Now I know just who I am

Felt uptight and so confused
Felt unloved and I felt abused
I didn't know what was wrong with me
I felt like the skid row was my destiny
And I'm a changed man

Finally got myself together (and now I know, know, know, yeah hey)
Now I know just who I am (I'm a changed man baby)
Finally got myself together (and now I know, know, know)
Now I know just who I am (listen to me baby)

A little smoke, get a little drink,
Kept my head bad, so I couldn't think
Love came along late one night
And I finally see the light
I'm a changed man

Finally got myself together (and now I know, know, know, yeah hey)
Now I know just who I am (I'm a changed man baby)
Finally got myself together (and now I know, know, know, yeah baby)
Now I know just who I am (just look at me now)

Look at the smile on my face (just look at me now)
Just look at the smile on my face (just look at me now)
Don't just glance as you walk by (look at me now)
Look me straight in my eyes (hey, I'm changed, yeah baby)

Finally got myself together (and now I know)
Now I know just who I am (baby, I'm changed, baby hey)
Finally got myself together (and now I know, know, know, yeah baby)
Now I know just who I am (Things I use to do baby)

Finally got myself together (come on baby, I don't do no more,)
Now I know just who I am (the places I used to go baby)
Finally got myself together (come on girl, I don't want no more)
Now I know just who I am (come on, come on baby)

Finally got myself together (come on baby, come on baby, come on baby)
