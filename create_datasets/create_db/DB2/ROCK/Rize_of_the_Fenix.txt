When the pick of destiny was released it was the bomb
And all the critics said that the deed was done
The sun had set and the chapter had closed
But one thing no one thought about
Was he d wound rise again
Just like the phoenix

We'll rise again
That's right the phoenix will rise again
'Cause the fiery heart of the champion
Can not be quenched
By a failure or an embarrassment, no way, no

And the critics all agreed it was a stinky pile of cheese
But that does not mean that our hearts are not strong
Just like the phoenix
We'll rise again
Just like the phoenix
We'll rise again

Rolling thunder, when will it end?
Rolling thunder, there's a monster on the bed
There's a monster on the bed
Rolling thunder, when will it stop
Rolling thunder, will it take us to the top?
Will it take us to the top?

But what if it's true
That tenacious d has died, what will we do?
And what I'll we do
About all the fans that have the d tattoo?

They'll have them removed
They'll have to laser off the d tattoos
Tattoos
They'll have to laser off the d tattoos

Hold it cage, what's that on the horizon?
It's a big old fireball of hope
We can still make it to the top cage
All we need is our friendship
And I'll stick to it if ness
And one hit, just one, one, one, hit
One hit
Yeah we're hoping this is it
One hit
Top 10 hit
Top 40 hit
Top awesome hit
I don; t care how we get there
We'll sell the mule
And you can get a d tenacious tattoo
