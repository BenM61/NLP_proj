Here's a dance you should know
When the lights are down low
Grab your baby, then go

Do the hucklebuck
Do the hucklebuck
If you don't know how to do it
Boy, you're out of luck
Push your partner out
Then you hunch your back
Start a little movement in your sacroilliac
Wiggle like a snake, waddle like a duck
That's the way you do it when you do the Hucklebuck

Everybody's looking for a-somethin' new
It could be cars, it could be clothes
Or just a stylish shoe
But if you like your dancin'
Better take my tip
Get set, warn the band and let 'er rip

You go a little to the left
A little to the right
Get hold of your partner
Tell him, "No need to fight"
Push your partner round
And then you hunch your back
Start your movement in your sacroilliac
Wiggle like a snake and then you waddle like a duck
And that's the way you gotta do it when you do the Hucklebuck

There you go
You got it now
It's the Hucklebuck!
