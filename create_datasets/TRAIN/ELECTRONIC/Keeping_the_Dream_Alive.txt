Tonight the rain is falling,
Full of memories of people and places.
And while the past is calling,
In my fantasy I remember their faces.

The hopes we had were much to high;
Way out of reach, but we have to try.
The game will never be over,
Because we're keeping the dream alive.

I hear myself recalling
Things you said to me the night it all started.
And still the rain is falling.
Makes me feel the way I felt when we parted.

The hopes we had were much to high;
Way out of reach, but we have to try.
No need to hide, no need to run,
'Cause all the answers come one by one.
The game will never be over,
Because we're keeping the dream alive.

I need you - I love you.

The game will never be over,
Because we're keeping the dream alive.
The hopes we had were much to high;
Way out of reach, but we have to try.
No need to hide, no need to run,
'Cause all the answers come one by one.

The hopes we had were much to high;
Way out of reach, but we have to try.
No need to hide, no need to run,
'Cause all the answers come one by one.
The game will never be over,
Because we're keeping the dream alive.

The game will never be over,
Because we're keeping the dream alive.
The game will never be over,
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm.
