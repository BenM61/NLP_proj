You'll be given love
You'll be taken care of
You'll be given love
You have to trust it

Maybe not from the Sources
You have poured yours
Maybe not from the directions
You are staring at

So twist your head around
It's all around you
All is full of love
All around you

All is full of love
You just ain't receiving
All if full of love
Your phone is off the hook
All is full of love
Your doors are all shut
All is full of love
In any language

All is full of love, all is full of love
All is full of love, all is full of love
