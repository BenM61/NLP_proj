See we ain't worried 'bout (damn thing, damn thing)
Hear you talking it but you not about a (damn thing, damn thing)
So whatchu doing about it? Not a (damn thing, damn thing)
Keep it movin', I'm overdoing my (damn thing, damn thing)

You see I'm here now, that's right you not the man
They say I spit coke, supply the block with grams
And I ain't with waiting, I'm taking lots of grands
'Cause I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor fam
My niggas get it crunk, chump rep what side you from
Smokin' somethin nigga, light your blunt
Ain't got your gun, you better find you one (why?)
'Cause this is Pistolvania, where them apes crawl
Bunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of 8 ball
And you never gonna see one of my niggas sleep until they cake long
Aye whatchu mean man? Something like the Great Wall
As far as rap go, yeah its in the bag
Of course the haters wanna do me bad
Probably mad 'cause of the shit I have
I never let 'em slow me down dawg I'm living fast
Niggas on swole 'cause they chick wanna get with the youngin' that's all about makin' this cash
I'm still a youngin' but niggas respect the flow
And don't check me, you better check ya hoe 

See we ain't worried 'bout (damn thing, damn thing)

I'm in the studio, making classic heat
You niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see
And you chumps can amount out for them ones
And I'm 'bout done with you punks and you clowns wanting to come for the crown
I hear a lot of talk, I gotta let 'em know
I put the business on a nigga, really thinking or be feeling that he wanna come and test the flow
'Cause I'm not for the game, ahk you will not do a thing
See I was smart you gotta walk it to talk if you sane
And its 4-1-2 'til I fall to the grave
They don't know what to do with the boy to this day
'Cause I'm always pimpin' if I put my voice on track the whole world gon' listen
Some niggas player hate but you can say I get away with murder like OJ Simpson
I'm into all day grinding, don't nothing come easy, I'm puttin' the time in
The youngin' keep rhyming, so that one day I can sit back and reclining 
I see you stressed out, man we do this shit for fun
Call me the best out, Khalifa get it done (yes)
