I want to beat you up
I don't care, cause I won't feel sorry
I want to take you down
I know that you will see in glory

I want to beat you in
I'll make you feel my sorrow
I want to take you out
I'll come find you tomorrow

Every time you leave
I go down
I'll just wait for you to turn around
And kick your head in

I want you to let it drop
I don't care, 'cause I won't feel sorry
I want to mess you up
Keep on spending time with glory

I want to beat you up
You make me feel so hollow
I want to take you down
Every word you said you said you'll swallow

Every time you leave
Well I go down
I'll just have to wait till you turn around
And kick your head in

I want to beat you up
I don't care, 'cause I won't feel sorry
I want to take you down
I know that you will see in glory

I want to beat you in
I'll make you feel my sorrow
I want to take you out
I'll come find you tomorrow

Every time you leave
I go down
I'll just wait till you turn around
And kick your face in

To fix the gash in your head
To fix the gash in your head
To fix the gash in your head
To fix the gash in your head
To fix the gash in your head
To fix the gash in your head
To fix the gash in your head
To fix the gash in your head
