Crystal core
Your mind has been divided from your soul
Now you say you are that stranger on your shore
Grief it brings need the naked freeze caught in the frost
Numb unbearable thoughts your inner need fire not lost
No way, not lost

I've just come from the Reindeer King
He says, "your purity of soul, crystalline"
Gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You, you, you, you, you

Crystal core
You are at the still point of the turning world
The divide fearing death desiring life
Ice you were the one most tender with the rivers
You the roof of the waves layer after layer
After layer

I've just come from the Reindeer King
He says, "your purity of soul, crystalline"
Gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you

You know that I would skate
Skate all the way just to hold your hand
To take away your pain
You know that I would skate
From Scandinavia
All the way to the moons of Jupiter

With you
You, you, you, you
Gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you
You gotta get you back to you
Get you back to you

I've just come from the Reindeer King
