After the fire the fire still burns
The heart grows older but never ever learns
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns
After the fire the fire still burns

I heard a voice asking what happens after the fire
And then the sound of a breaking window and the scream of a tire
And then the sound of a distant gun and the cry of a hungry child
The night is hot
But nothing's gonna stop
This gang going wild

After the fire the fire still burns
The heart grows older but never ever learns
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns
After the fire the fire still burns

I saw Matt Dillon in black and white there ain't no colour in memories
He rode his brother's Harley across the TV while I was laughing at Dom deLuise.
Now I'm cycling all my video tapes, I'm crying and I'm joking
I've gotta stop drinking
I've gotta stop thinking
I've gotta stop smoking

After the fire the fire still burns
The heart grows older but never ever learns
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns
After the fire the fire still burns

The fire still burns, raging through the pain
Blackening the promises the tears and the rain
The fire will burn
'Til the wind begins to turn
And it all begins again

After the fire the fire still burns
The heart grows older but never ever learns
The memories smolder and the soul always yearns
After the fire the fire still burns
