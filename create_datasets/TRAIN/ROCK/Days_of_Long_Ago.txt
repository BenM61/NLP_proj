When I wasn't looking I found you
And the nights they don't seem so long
There are moments when I just can't believe
That I've waited so long
So take me and love me don't ever let me go
Oh take me and hold me you know I want you so
Cause you're so precious like the days of long ago
And I feel now that I can make it
Like the sunshine of a new day
All these times of so much confusion feel them drifting away
Feel them drifting away
So take me and love me don't ever let me go
Yeah take me and hold me you know I love you so
Cause you're so precious like the days of long ago
