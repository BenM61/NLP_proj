Analyze the devices
War with thee
Pieces of your destiny corrupted
Rise
Thriving
Can you verify the last contents
The gravel lodged in your throat
A flesh box cavity
Gradual eruption probe
One that feeds
Hands that caress a crooked spine
Absorbing bi-products
Prompt exchanges
That will deconstruct
Move on forward
Signs that will pierce like labor pains
Sharp
Ways of a drunkard
The dogs shall devour and lap up their blood
Stains
Persist
The prime suspects will now restrain
With affection
Recession
Final effects of a broken hope
Of a broken shell
Of a broken yoke
Walk and learn from these
Deviant
Loss of wealth
Subservient
Guarantine divisions
The double edged sword
Depth incision
Glutton eat your fill
Divination is that of a swine babbling in their filth
Beware of the things hibernation in your skull
Reeking havoc
Malignant cells still active
Schemes that will inflict my son
Schemes that run rampant
If the disease of self
Leaves a heavy burden on your spirit
It must be removed
Like bricks in the belly
You will sink into the depths
