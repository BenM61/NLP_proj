Don't you think it's perfect and the feeling's worth it
When we're getting down down down down down,
Everything you've searched for is right here on the dance floor
And you want it now now now now now.
Don't know what you're there for
Bring it over here in the middle of the crowd inside my sound
Seeing through your eyelids
I know that you like it when the music gets loud

And I never, I never want another
Come back, come back to me, my lover
I never, I never want another
Bring back, bring back, bring back the summer

Bring back, back the summer
Bring back, back the summer

Baby, we can get hot, maybe it's a long shot
We should throw it back right now now now
And in a little while I see you start to smile
And here you thought you forgot that you knew how
Baby, I can't help it
Nobody else can burn me up like you've got me up in flames
From our very first kiss to our very last wish
You'll be running through my veins

And I never, I never want another
Come back, come back to me, my lover
I never, I never want another
Bring back, bring back, bring back the summer

Bring back, back the summer
Bring back, back the summer

Take a chance, and touch the stars
Start to dance to the beat of your heart
Take a chance, you've come this far
Lift up your hands, and touch the stars
Touch the stars
And touch the stars
Touch the stars
Touch the stars

And I never, I never want another
Come back, come back to me, my lover
I never, I never want another
Bring back, bring back, bring back the summer
