From the moment you see
The moment you breath
The moment I touch you

From the moment you crawl
The moment you fall
The instant I loved you again

From the moment of darkness
The moment of light
The second I kissed you

From the moment I enter
The moment I leave
In this moment of rapture

One mirror too many gonna tie you up
A life forever empty has got to be tough
To many starless night gonna leave you blind
Can never make it right

From the moment you stumble
The moment you run
In your presence I crumble
From the moment it happens
The moment you know
There's no life without you
