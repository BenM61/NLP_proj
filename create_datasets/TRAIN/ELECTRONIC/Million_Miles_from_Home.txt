A million miles from home
I could shoot myself today
Set my soul free to roam
Upon this beach I lie today
Speeking to the sea
Dancing with the waves
Slipping throught your net
And there's nothing you can say
A million miles I know
Yesterdays frowns were just a phase
When my sadness starts to show
Yesterdays nouns are verbs today
Kissing with the moon
Dancing with the sun
Blessed is the one
Who knows where we'are all from
A million miles, a million miles, a million miles
A million miles from home, from home
A million miles to go
In the trees I hear the breeze
And when my madness starts to show
Try the truth you will succeed
If you're fishing out for me
We'll see what's cool today
'cause if you're afro's obsolete
Then your skin is turning grey
A million miles from home
A million miles, yeah
I hope you find your way, or the way will find you
Hope you find your way, your way.
