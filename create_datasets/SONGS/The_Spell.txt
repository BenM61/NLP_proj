I've been thinking about you lately
You're on my mind
You do something to me baby
In ways I can't define

Whatever you're doing
You're doing it well
What is your secret
Won't you please tell

'Cause my head is spinning
Spinning around
You let me know boy
I won't let you down

You put a spell on me
I don't know what to do
It's an ability
That drives me closer to you
Your magic
Has got me where I want to be
Your magic
Is happening in front of me

There's a power within you baby
It's controlling me
I know there's no way to fight it
I'll let it be

Whatever you're doing
You're doing it well
What is your secret
Won't you please tell

'Cause my head is spinning
Spinning around
You let me know boy
I won't let you down

You put a spell on me
I don't know what to do
It's an ability
That drives me closer to you
Your magic
Has got me where I want to be
Your magic
Is happening in front of me

You put a spell on me
I don't know what to do
It's an ability
That drives me closer to you
Your magic
Has got me where I want to be
Your magic
Is happening in front of me

Can you feel the power lurking baby girl
I think the spell is working, o-ooh
Can you feel the power lurking baby girl
I think the spell is working ooh

You put a spell on me
I don't know what to do
It's an ability
That drives me closer to you

You put a spell on me
I don't know what to do
It's an ability
That drives me closer to you
Your magic
