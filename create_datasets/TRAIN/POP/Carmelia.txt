Seems there's always some tragedy
That's tearing at our precious world
Wish sometimes we could just lighten up
Let's take a look around us
Turn off the TV oh let's open our eyes
Look at the stars in the sky

Carmelia, let's dance away the night together
Let's dance until this crazy world disappears
Girls in the morning we will still be here
Carmelia, let's celebrate our lives together
Let's dance until the stars tumble from the sky
There's music pounding from the radio

Just lean your body into mine
Girl you take me to a better place
There's no one else just you and I
Hold on to me, I'll hold on to you
Tonight we've got nothing to prove

Carmelia, let's dance away the night together
Let's dance until this crazy world disappears
Girls in the morning we will still be here
Carmelia, let's celebrate our lives together
Let's dance until the stars tumble from the sky
