I got a mouth full of dirt
A hand full of charms
Got a rusty old spade
Don't care who I harm

Take you down to the dirt
Drag you through the mud
Drag you through the mud

Got a trip for two on a one-way ride
I'll take you anywhere, there's no place to hide
Oh

I got a belly full of ooze, oh
A head full of hurt
I'll be digging your treasure, baby
See what I unearth

Take you down to the dirt
Drag you through the mud
Drag you through the mud
Drag you through the mud

Got a trip for two on a one-way ride
I'll take you anywhere, there's no place to hide

You've seen better days
Before you saw me
That's lost in a haze
You've got nowhere to be

Take you down to the dirt
Drag you through the mud
Drag you through the mud
Dray you through the mud

Got a trip for two on a one-way ride
I'll take you anywhere, there's no place to hide
I've got a trip for two on a one-way ride
Watch your world collapse as our worlds collide
Got a trip for two on a one-way ride
Take you anywhere, there's no place to hide
Oh
