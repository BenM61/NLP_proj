O mellow my dreams you've gone away
O empty belly it's good to see you
O my dreams of these quiet people
O you and me dancing on my grave.

But oh lord, I know what I've done
And oh lord, I ain't afraid.

Hold me baby, cause your eyes are
Hold me baby, cuase your eyes are
The prettiest eyes I've ever seen in my life, honey we're
Bound for the night.

O mellow my son you've gone away

O empty belly it's time to feed you
O my future with these quiet people
O you and me dancing on your grave.

But oh lord, I know what I've done
And oh lord, I ain't afraid.

Hold me baby, cause your eyes are
Hold me baby, cause your eyes are
The prettiest eyes I've ever seen in my life, honey we're
Bound for the night.
