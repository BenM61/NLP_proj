For a long time I felt 
Without style and grace
Wearing shoes with no socks 
In cold weather
I knew my heart 
Was in the right place
I knew I'd be able 
To do these things

And as we watch him 
Digging his own grave
It is important to know 
That was where he's at
He can't afford to stop
That is what he believe
He'll keep on digging 
For a thousand years

I'm walking a line
I'm thinking about empty motion
I'm walking a line
Just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way (no time to begin) 
This isn't the time (so nothing was done)
Not talking about (not many at all)
I'm turning around (no trouble at all)
You notice there's nothing around you, 'round you
I'm walking a line
Divide and dissolve

Never get to say much
Never get to talk
Tell us a little bit
But not too much
Right about then
Is where she give up
She has closed her eyes
She has give up hope

I'm walking a line
I hate to be dreaming in motion
I'm walking a line
Just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way (no time to begin) 
This isn't the time (so nothing was done)
Not talking about (not many at all)
I'm turning around (no trouble at all)
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
I'm walking a line
Divide and dissolve

I'm walking a line
I'm visiting houses in motion
I'm walking a line
Just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way (no time to begin)
This isn't the time (so nothing was done)
Not talking about (not many at all)
I'm turning around (no trouble at all)
Two different houses surround you, 'round you
I'm walking a line
Divide and dissolve
