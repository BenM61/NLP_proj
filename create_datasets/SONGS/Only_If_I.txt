Happy days past by much faster. 
As every single moment that I spend with you. 
Somehow we let our feelings die, slipping? away without a try. 
Bring me back to when we met and start all over 


If I could turn back time I know I'd do it all again, do it all again wow! 
Cause you where the summer of my life. 
Only if I could turn back time I know I'd give it again, give my love again wow! 
Memories that keeps me warm inside 
Only if I 

Could see yesterday tomorrow. 
Say the things you never heard from me before. 
I could have loved you once again. 
Only a heart can not forget. 
Bring me back to when e met and start all over 

Only of I... 
You where the summer of my life 
If I could turn back time I know I'd do it again, do it again wow 
If I could turn back time I know I'd give my love again
