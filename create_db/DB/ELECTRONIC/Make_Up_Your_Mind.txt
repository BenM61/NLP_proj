Long time, girl, I have got feelings for you 
I know it's been hard what I put you through 
I've only been thinking 'bout myself 
I never intended to hurt you being with someone else
My heart is yours and I'm here to let you know 
Keep holding on, baby girl, don't let go, oh 

I wanna love you, girl, I don't want to fight 
Just wanna love you, won't you make up your mind 
Woah, woah, woah

I wanna love you, girl, I don't want leave
Just wanna love you, won't you say it's for keeps? 
Woah, woah, woah
