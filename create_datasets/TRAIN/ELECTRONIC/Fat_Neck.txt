There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply.
Oh just remember a don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find us
Out to lunch

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
We're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A-vacant

Don't ask us to attend
Cause we're not all there.
Oh don't pretend 'cause I don't care
I don't believe illusions 'cause too much is real
So stop your cheap comment
Cause we know what we feel

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
We're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A-vacant

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
Ah but now
And we don't care

There's no point...(etc.)
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
We're vacant

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A-vacant

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
Ah but now
And we don't care

We're pretty a-pretty vacant
We don't care
