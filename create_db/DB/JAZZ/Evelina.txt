VAUGHN MONROE AND HIS ORCHESTRA
VOCAL BY VAUGHN MONROE
ORCHESTRA PLAYS THE SONG. THEN;
EVELINA, AIN'T YA EVER TAKE A SHINE TO THAT MOON?
EVELINA,AIN'T YA BOTHERED BY THE BOBALINK'S TUNE?
TELL ME, TELL ME HOW LONG
YA GONNA KEEP DELAYIN' THE DAY.
DON'T YA RECKON IT'S WRONG
TRIFLING WITH APRIL THIS WAY?
EVELINA, WON'T YA PAY A LITTLE MIND TO ME SOON?
WAKE UP! WAKE UP!
THE EARTH IS FAIR, THE FRUIT IS FINE,
BUT WHAT'S THE USE O' SMELLIN' WATER MELON
CLINGIN' TO ANOTHER FELLA'S VINE?
EVELINA, WON'T YA ROLL OFF THAT VINE AN' BE MINE?
