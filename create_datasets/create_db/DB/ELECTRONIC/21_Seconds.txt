Ha, ha, ha, whatcha laughin at?

Megaman up first and he won't second no shit
I ain't got the time to smoke this, hold this
Yo G, roll by in a blacked out TT, Megaman carry two gats easy
Seeing stars, and a mister wanna jack me
Jack me say come step to me, the last
Thing that you saw was icy, bitch
Say nigga wanna see Mega get rich
But niggas don't really want Mega to be rich
Say nigga wanna see Mega get rich
But niggas don't really want Mega to be rich

Asher D's never fading
Strugglin' stay strong 'til I'm bathin'
The A to the D's never phasing
I run a drum of enemies if you're racing (chasing)
So Solid are amazing
An' you G's are bound to be lacing
Addicted to this life that we're tastin'
You blame me for the life you been wasting
Your hating, but there's money to be making
Actor, MC and now I'm rakin'
Smoking mad g's like a jamaican
So when you're looking at me you start takin', creating

Thug of the family, who could I be?
M with the A to the C that's me
Thug of the family, who could I be?
M with the A to the C that's me
M - A - C still thuggin
Shot Benz in a rave when I'm clubbin
Ladies come around and they buggin
Make g's like if I was robbin
Player haters they are
Watching and they're plottin and they're watchin my stocks
Watching and they're plottin and they're watchin my stops
Watching and they're plottin and they're watchin my crops
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
