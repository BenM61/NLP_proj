By the harbour I harbour the strangest memories,
Over land I could ever be,
Stranded in nostalgia,
So tonight I'll try harder,
But it's hard to fix this floodlight on me,
In a cast that's taken to places,
I'm unsure of where I want to be,

Stand up,
Stand up,
And stand down,
I'll climb El Capitan,
And jump off to cheers from the crowd,

Stand up,
Stand up,
And stand down,
And I hope you take your camera,
To photograph my tears as they hit the ground,

No one even listens,
The same way that no one ever laughs,
I'm taking the car out of the snow,
I'm wondering where the summer went to,
Circled by your secrets,
I'm hoping they don't include me,
At least I'm in good company,
Because there's no one else around,
Except me,

Stand up,
Stand up,
And stand down,
I'll climb El Capitan,
Just to watch the world slow down,

Stand up,
Stand up,
And stand down,
And I hope you take your camera,
Silence makes the loudest tap,

It seems far too easy to say the same things,
I'll choose my own way to use my life up,
Finally found a new way,
Say the same things,
In imaginary ways,
I'll use my life up,

You were looking at pictures in the distance,
Hoping to see the future in your pictures,
Of the distance hoping to see,
The future looking at pictures in the distance,
Hoping to see the future through your pictures,
Of the distance,
Hoping to see,
The future in your pictures of the distance
