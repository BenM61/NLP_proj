Almost heaven, West Virginia, 
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River 
Life is old there, older than the trees, 
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, mountain momma, 
Take me home, country roads

All my mem'ries gather 'round her, 
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water 
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, 
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma, 
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, mountain momma, 
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me, 
The radio reminds me of my home far away, 
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' 
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, mountain momma, 
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, mountain momma, 
Take me home, country roads

La la la (hey, hey)
La la la (hey, hey)
La la la (hey, hey)
La la la

West Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home, country roads 

La la la (hey, hey)
La la la (hey, hey)
La la la (hey, hey)
La la la
West Virginia, mountain momma, 
Take me home, country roads 

Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
