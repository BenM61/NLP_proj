In a perfect world
You would never let me down
There'd would be nothing to figure out
In a perfect world
We could just erase the day
Never say the things we said
Two things you can't get back, are words and time
Alright

Tell me how to find somebody
Who gon be on time on time
It's too late for you and I
Thank God I left you right on time, on time
Time, time
Kissing you goodbye
And I did it right on time
On time

In a perfect world
You would try to prove your love
Take me to the stars above
In a perfect world, perfect world, perfect world
We would put each other first
Make it so it never hurts
Two things you can't get back, are words and time

Tell me how to find somebody
Who gon be on time on time
It's too late for you and I
Thank God I left you right on time, on time
Time, time
Kissing you goodbye
And I did it right on time
On time

Second hand, minute hand
Clock is winding down, every second counts
What's your plan? where you stay?
Here I go again, worrying about you before me
This time I'm a get everything that I need
Always mad, baby, why you always mad?
I just need a break from that tit for tat

Tell me how to find somebody
Who gon be on time on time
It's too late for you and I
Thank God I left you right on time, on time
Time, time
Kissing you goodbye
And I did it right on time
On time
