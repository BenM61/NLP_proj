New town and a new home to save your skin
This is where the new life should begin
Still after weeks, you toss and you turn in your sleep
And you know that whatever you do
Someone keeps looking for you

New life and a new view to save your soul
This is where you dig the hole
And you know that whatever you do
Looking for you

No one believes that it's true, what that fucker can do
Aw, you know what that sucker can do
Yeah, you know what that mother can do
Yeah, you know what that fucker can do

You know what that fucker can do
Aw, you know what that sucker can do
Aw, you know what that mother can do
Yes, you know what that fucker can do
