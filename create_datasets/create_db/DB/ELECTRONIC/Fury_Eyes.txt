Punch me judy make me cry
You'll disapear and then I'll die
A love that lost always returns
To feed the fire of a heart that burns
There's no sleep for fury eyes
So deep are the eyes of fury
Watching faces changing places
Running rings around the moon
Exchanging glances taking chances
Did we laugh and see to sing too soon
Our stomach turn on a fever stream
But with no mosquito bite
Rabid kisses in a dream
Still we can't escape the site
There's no sleep for fury eyes
So deep are the eyes of fury
Tonight they exorcise the ghost
Of love from its unyielding host
If that don't suit you scream and shout
It thine offend thee pluck it out
Alone in love with the other one
The one who doesn't know
And when we dance with the other one
The eyes of fury glow
Tonight they exorcise the ghost
Of love from its unyielding host
If that don't suit you scream and shout
It thine offend thee pluck it out
Who'll weep for the fury eyes
Beholding love a thing of beauty
There's no sleep for fury eyes
So deep are the eyes of fury.
