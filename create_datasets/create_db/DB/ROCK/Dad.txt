I was a kid  you were my dad 
I didn't always understand 
I wanted freedom  you got mad 
You were concerned  I got upset 

I didn't recognize you yet 
And did you cry  I know I did 
When I lied to you 
I didn't want to hurt you 

I just never knew I did 
You never told me that you loved me 
I know you didn't know how 
I guess that shows we're much the same 

'Cause I love you too and until now 
I've never said those words out loud 
I hope you're proud 
To be my dad

What are your secrets, do you pray 
Is there a god that shows your way 
I wish I knew
Do you have crazy fantasies 

What happens in your dreams 
I want to know
I guess you'll always be a mystery to me 
But you taught me how to value life 

And what else do I need 
I have a dad who watches over me
