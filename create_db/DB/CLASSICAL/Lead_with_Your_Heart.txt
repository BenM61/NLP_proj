In this world 
It's hard to tell the shadow from the light 
What is real 
Can find a way to hide behind the lies 
Don't be fooled 
Or ruled 
By voices all around you 
'Cause your road, will always be revealed

If you lead 
Lead with your heart 
It's the one thing you can trust 
To always come from love 
And it will shine 
Right through the dark 
Like a northern star 
To show you what is true 
You'll never lose 
If only you 
Will lead with your heart 

You have been 
The truest friend that anyone could have 
And the love 
You always give, I want you to get back 
Been knocked down, and found 
Not everyone is what they show you 
What is true, will always be revealed

If you lead 
Lead with your heart  
It's the one thing you can trust 
To always come from love 
And it will shine 
Right through the dark 
Like a northern star 
To show you what is true 
You'll never lose 
If only you 
Will lead with your heart

It takes the beautiful I've known 
And somehow makes you feel 
You're home again 
Finally home again 
And there's no longer any doubt 
What the mystery's about for you 
Or what you should do

Lead 
Lead with your heart 
It's the one thing you can trust 
To always come from love 
Lead 
Lead with your heart 
It's the one thing you can trust 
To always come from love 
And it will shine 
Right through the dark 
Like a northern star 
To show you what is true 
You'll never lose 
If only you, lead with your heart
