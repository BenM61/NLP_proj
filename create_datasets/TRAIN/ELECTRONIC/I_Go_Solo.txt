Everyone has problems
I'm sorry for you
I too hurt when you hurt
Because I care for you

But you have no reason
To take it out on me
Not worth it, I resign
Set myself free

Next time I'll be gone when
The shit hits the fan
Find someone else than me
I'm not your garbage can

I listen if you're sad
When you're mad or such
One time is ok
But a billion time is a bit to much

I can never be
What you want me to be
I can never do
What you want me to
So I go solo

I'm too proud to let you
Take a seat on me
I choose to wise up and
Set myself free

Maybe you don't mean to
Act the way you do
Your problem, not mine
Trapped I suffer, free I'm fine

Remember way back when
The trouble began
Turned slowly from lover
Into your garbage can

I can never be
What you want me to be
I can never do
What you want me to
So I go solo

Oh la la, time to go
Oh la la, I go solo
