You know the girl you love, don't treat you right sometimes
(Should be mine, should be mine)
You know the girl you love, don't treat you right sometimes
(Should be mine, should be mine)
That's the stuff you gotta watch 'cause your girl is a liar

You know, the girl you love stays out all night long
(Should be mine, should be mine)
You know, the girl you love stays out all night long
(Should be mine, should be mine)
That's the stuff you gotta watch 'cause your girl's treatin' you wrong

Get my hat
(Get my hat)
I need my coat
(Need my coat)
'Cause I just found out baby you don't want me anymore
That's the stuff you gotta watch, that's the stuff you gotta watch
That's the stuff you gotta watch if you don't wanna lose your girl

You know the girl's no good, don't you make no change
(Should be mine, should be mine)
You know your girl's no good, don't you make no change
(Should be mine, should be mine)
That's the stuff you gotta watch 'cause you all are just the same

She spends your dough, she drink your gin
Then she'll roll and she'll tumble, then she's ready to go again
That's the stuff you gotta watch, that's the stuff you gotta watch
That's the stuff you gotta watch if you don't wanna lose your girl
