Yeah it's over,
You can bet in mid-October,
I will still be ranting bout most early may.
Yeah he's a winner
He's a god damned sinner.
While he dines I'm on the wrong side of the day
And I said,
I don't understand why I'm fumbling after
You're the reason
I cannot forget this season
Or the letter when you first referred to eight.
And I said

It's a Calypso, but it's not easy to know.
You walk around with your shoulders down
Frowning.
It's not easy to know

Yeah it's over,
You can bet when mid-October ends,
I'll still be ranting bout most early may.
So yeah, he's a winner,
He's a goddamn sinner,
While he dines I'm in the wrong side of the day
And I said,
I don't understand why I'm fumblin' after
Yeah you're the reason i cannot forget this season.
Or the lesson how an Ape shall not kill Ape
And I said...

It's a Calypso, but it's not easy to know.
you walk around with your shoulders down
Frowning
It's not easy to know

It's just a tango
But it's not easy to choke,
I walk around with my horns down now,
But it's not easy to know

I'm going under
You can trust a man who's a governor,
Ape can't trust man.

You can trust a man with a gun at all,
Ape can't trust man.

It's a Calypso, but it's not easy to know.
you walk around with your shoulders down
Frowning
It's not easy to know

It's just a tango
But it's not easy to choke,
I walk around with my horns down now,
But it's not easy to choke

How could you win?
If you know he's back to blame
Knowing you're right, won't you wait?
