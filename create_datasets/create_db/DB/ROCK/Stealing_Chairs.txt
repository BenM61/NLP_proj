Out of everyone
You were the last I expected to leave
So much potential, yeah
So much left to achieve

Thanks so much for warm receptions
And your clear perceptions
Thanks so much for stealing chairs
For seeing light in darkened places
I thank you most for being there

I had a dream, I had a dream last night
And I think you know 'cause you were there

And there's not much I can say
But we miss you every day
And I'm bitter 'cause it's unfair
We'll be drinkin' in the sun
Playing music having fun
'Cause one day I'll see you there

Out of everyone
You were the last I expected to grieve for
It seems my place is to be the bereaved
To find the light in darkened places
To see the gift that you were there

I had a dream, I had a dream last night
And I think you know 'cause you were there

Out of everyone
You were the last I expected to leave
So much potential, yeah
So much left to achieve

Thanks so much for warm receptions
And your clear perceptions
Thanks so much for stealing chairs
For seeing light in darkened places
I thank you most for being there
