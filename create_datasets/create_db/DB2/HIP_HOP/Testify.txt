She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he need hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustler so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

Fear in her chest her face in tears, had her mans back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They trying to take everything except the kids
But years she been through scuffles and fights
While he trying to hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The judge yelled for order court reporter makin' her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him, she could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him, using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder, and gun possession
As they read back her confession she screamed

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime
The queenpin

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

You accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse
Please let me testify, you accuse me of a
