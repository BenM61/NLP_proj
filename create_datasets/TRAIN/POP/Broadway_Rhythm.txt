Gotta dance! Gotta dance! Gotta dance! Gotta dance !
Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance!
Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance!
Out on the gay white way in each merry cafe
Orchestras play, taking your breath away
(With a ) Broadway rhythm   
It's got me everybody sing and dance!
 
Oh that Broadway rhythm oh that Broadway rhythm
When I hear that happy beat
Feel like dancing down the street
To that Broadway rhythm writhing beating rhythm
 
Gotta dance! Gotta dance! Gotta dance! Gotta dance !
Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance!
Broadway rhythm It's got me Everybody dance!
Out on the gay white way in each merry cafe
Orchestras play, taking your breath away
(With a ) Broadway rhythm
It's got me!
