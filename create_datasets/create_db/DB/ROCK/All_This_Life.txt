I couldn't see in front of my old face
Like a butterfly upon a wheel
Going to find another bed to break
Instead of changing the way we feel

In all this life
All this life
All this life
There's no love
There's no love
There's no love
Without light

Disappointment walking around
Trying to make it in the modern feel
Didn't think we'd turn it around
Ohhh
We were shipwrecked without steel

In all this life
All this life
All this life
There's no love
There's no love
There's no love
In all this life
All this life
All this life
There's no love
There's no love
There's no love
Without light

There's no love now
There's no love
Without light now
Without light
There's no love now
There's no love
Without light now
Without light
