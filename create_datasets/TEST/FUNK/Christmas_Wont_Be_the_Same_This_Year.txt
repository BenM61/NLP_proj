Merry Christmas everybody
Yeah, Merry Christmas everybody, big deal
Hey man, what's wrong with you Jermaine?
Yeah, that's no kind of attitude

This only happens once a year
Hey, fellas, don't bug him
He and his girl just broke up, so get off his back
Can't you see there's tears in his eyes?
Yeah, he's cryin', look he's cryin'

Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

Christmas won't be the same this year
Without her loving arms holding you so near
Christmas won't be the same this year (no, it won't now darlin', no, no)
Without her loving arms, holding you so near

I see the lights
But they don't shine for me
I see the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
Our house decorated
My friends are celebrating

Christmas won't be the same this year (no, no, no)
Without her loving arms, holding you so near (it won't be the same this year)
Christmas won't be the same this year (the things we used to do, my darling)
Without her loving arms, holding you so near (it's all over)

The neighborhood kids
Are having so much fun
Counting off the days
'Til Santa Claus comes

And I see the Mistletoe
Hanging from my door
I wish I could kiss you again
Like I did before

Christmas won't be the same this year (no, no)
Without her loving arms holding you so near (yeah, yeah)

So, go on girl
And have your fun
Don't spoil your time
Thinkin' about me

This time next year
My darling dear
Hopefully, you'll be having dinner with me

Christmas won't be the same this year (no, no)
Without her loving arms, holding you so near (no, no, it won't, it won't be the same)
Christmas won't be the same this year (without you, darling)
Without her loving arms holding you so near (no, no, no, no, it won't, it won't be the same)
(Christmas won't be the same this year) (without you, darling)
