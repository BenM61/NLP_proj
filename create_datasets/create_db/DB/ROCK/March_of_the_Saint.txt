You're the youth bangers fight forever more 
Raise your golden hammer bring it down like Thor 
Ooh the force is going to bring us victory 
No foe or rival will stop the energy 
It's a vital mistake 
To try to brawl with the brave 
The storm just breaks out in rage 
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind 

It's the march of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint, march of the saint 

Clench your fist a battle's on the way 
Shout the truth metal's here to claim the day 
Hear the crowd's mighty roar 
It verifies assurance that we won another war 

It's a vital mistake 
To try to brawl with the brave 
The storm just breaks out in rage 
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind 

It's the march of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint, march of the saint 

It's a vital mistake 
To try to brawl with the brave 
The storm just breaks out in rage 
Oh then it's time to release the martyrs on your mind 

March of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint, march of the saint 
March of the saint
