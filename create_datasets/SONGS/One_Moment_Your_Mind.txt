Do you remember all the ways, we've been in love
I know you better now, but still there's not enough
Please find a way, to fuse your thoughts with your actions
If I get closer, will you fly in my direction
And if I'm asking for a sweet dream to come true
Then please tell me what to do

Give me one moment your mind, give me reason to shine
(One moment your mind)
Is this the way you wanna be, the world you want to see
Give me one moment your mind
(Your mind)

I wanna your love, but I don't want to borrow
Have it today, and give it back tomorrow
You're making me feel so incomplete, when you're in silence
Begging my patience, don't let love turn into violence
I miss the talk that I've been looking for long ago
Make my ice melt away

Give me one moment your mind, give me reason to shine
(One moment your mind)
Is this the way you wanna be, the world you want to see
Give me one moment your mind
(Your mind)

I miss the talk that I've been looking for long ago
Make my ice melt away
Just give me, give me, one moment your mind
One moment your mind, your mind
(One moment your mind)
Is this the way you wanna be, the world you want to see
Give me one moment your mind
Your mind
