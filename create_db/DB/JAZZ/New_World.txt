Raised the prices yesterday
At the grocery store
Reckless man hanging out front
Always against the bard
Can we ever solve these problems
In our changing world
Will our children ever get to play out in the yard

There's a new kind of world that's taking over
It's got devils, it's got angels,
Sitting on my shoulder
It's a new kind of world that's taking over
Yet no more second chances
Ain't no turning back

Living in this epidemic, population surge
Will the future of tomorrow, hoe what they deserve
How much further can we go with all these spinning wheels
And will my children recognize the world that we all build

There's a new kind of world that's taking over
It's got devils, it's got angels,
Sitting on my shoulder
It's a new kind of world that's taking over
Yet no more second chances
Ain't no turning back 3x
