We flying in space, one [?] make a thousand numbers
Leaving no trace, my hair a billion wonders
Now I'm riding away, the moon penetrate me
Whisper sweet, in my ears, words made of reasons

Sown in the sand, smelt like the first kiss
A touch with no hands

I'm living life golden, got no need for gold
Got a wicked time comin', man these stories untold
I'm living life golden, never getting old
While my pocket's stay empty, my heart is full

It's perfect for me, but looking like a wrong direction
Now make up your mind, if you win or lose in rough affection
The summer's stay young, fresh like a frozen flower
Slowly I wake, crack my brow, see the dirt break

Sown in the sand, smelt like the first kiss
A touch with no hands

I'm living life golden, got no need for gold
Got a wicked time comin', man these stories untold
I'm living life golden, never getting old
While my pocket's stay empty, my heart is full

My heart is full, my life is golden
My heart is full, my life is golden

I'm living life golden, got no need for gold
Got a wicked time comin', man these stories untold
I'm living life golden, never getting old
While my pocket's stay empty, my heart is full
