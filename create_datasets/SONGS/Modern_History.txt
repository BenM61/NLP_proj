Well the desk porter laughed
News of our legend and our exploits
Travelled far
From bell-hop to hired car
All this and more
Modern History
On the third floor

So is this where he died?
Spend your life cutting up words
With a knife
I light a candle for each night
You waste your life
Modern History
On the third floor

Well they're never gonna forget us
We're the most famous
People that they know
Went to a party
I didn't say a word
You don't know how lucky you were
You don't know how lucky you are

So we set fire to your room
And we bandaged up your
hands and your arms - now
Where's your beauty gone

Modern History
On the third floor
