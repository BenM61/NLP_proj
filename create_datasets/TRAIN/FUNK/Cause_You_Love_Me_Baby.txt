There's nothin' better that I like to do
Than sitting here cuddled up next to you
'Cause you love me, baby
Just the way I want to be loved

It's so nice lying here in your arms
Your personality has that charm
And you love me, baby, 'Cause you love me, baby
Just the way I want to be loved, yeah, yeah

When I'm here with you
Are you happy too
I can plainly see
That you care all about me

Ooh, I could stay here for the rest of my life
I wanna be your lover, woman, maybe your wife
'Cause you love me, baby, 'Cause you love me, baby
Just the way I want to be loved

Your personality has that charm
And you love me, baby, 'Cause you love me, baby
Just the way I want to be loved, yeah, yeah

Tell me are you happy too

That you care, you care about me

There ain't nothin' better than I wanna do
Than sit here, baby, cuddled up, cuddled up next to you
'Cause you love me, baby, 'Cause you love me, baby
Just the way I want to be loved, yeah, yeah
