well you're one black cat, some day you'll find your tree
Well you're one black cat, some day you'll find your tree
Then I'll hide my shoe somewhere near your sherry tree

Well I take you down in town, I paid your doctor bill
When I'm in some trouble, you're tryin' to get me killed
Well you're one black cat, some day you'll find your tree
Then I'll hide my shoe somewhere near your sherry tree

Well I took you in my home, you ate up all my bread
I left there this mornin', you tried to mess up in my bed
Well you're one black cat, some day you'll find your tree
Then I'll hide my shoe somewhere near your sherry tree

Well I woke up this mornin', the same thing on my mind
I was thinkin' 'bout you baby, you were walkin' down the line
Well you're one black cat, some day you'll find your tree
Then I'll hide my shoe somewhere near your sherry tree
