(m. riperton - r. rudolph)

If simon says be glad today
I surely do what simon say
And if youl like to see me smile
Then you're in luck cause that's my style

My pretty bird up in the tree
I hear the song you sing for me
The sky's fantastic blue or grey
And here we are alive today

Hey...
The simple things
The lovely simple things
The sunset and the dawn
The simple things
The lovely simple things
I could go on and on and on

For the simple pleasures
Are worth more than treasures
That your paper money ever bring

This song is old, this song is new
This song is me, this song is you
I like to play out in the rain
I like the sun to shine again
And again and again

Each day so many things to see
And I'm so glad I am me
And you, my friends, are pretty too
And I'm so glad that you are you
