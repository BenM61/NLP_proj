If only I didn't want the world
I wouldn't make you feel so sad
I'm sure my shame would be gone
Is it human to adore life?

If only I'd hidden my lust
And starved a little bit more
If only I didn't ask for more
Is it human to adore life?

I adore life

If only I'd lived beyond regret
I wouldn't feel guilt for what I take
Is it human to ask for more?
Is it human to adore life?

I know evil when I see it
I know good and I just do it
If I hadn't been so starved
Is it human to adore life?

I understand the urgency of life
In the distance there is truth which cuts like a knife
Maybe I will die maybe tomorrow so I need to say

I adore life

If only I had been more shy
And hid every tear I cried
If only I didn't wish to die
Is it human to adore life?

If only I didn't care so much
For the feel of your cold, cold touch
In every bed I leave behind
Is it human to adore life?

I understand the urgency of life
In the distance there is truth which cuts like a knife
Maybe I will die maybe tomorrow so I need to say

I adore life

I adore life
Do you adore life?
