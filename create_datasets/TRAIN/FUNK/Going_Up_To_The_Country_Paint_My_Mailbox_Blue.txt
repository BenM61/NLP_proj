Gonna move up to the country
Paint my mailbox blue
Gonna move up to the country
Paint my mailbox blue
Put some flowers on it baby
Paint some trailin' vines and dew

You know I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog's got me down
I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog has got me down
I'm goin' up to the country
Where there ain't no doggone smog around

Well, come here baby
Sugar, let your papa take you by the hand
Well, come here baby
Sugar, let your papa take you by the hand
Well, you be my woman
And I'll be your city-boy, country man.

I'm gonna move up to the country
Gonna paint, gonna paint, gonna paint, my mailbox blue
Move up to the country
Gonna paint my mailbox blue
Put some flowers on it honey
Paint some trailin' vines and dew
