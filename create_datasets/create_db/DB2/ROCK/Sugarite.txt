Sugarite, sugarite
You're on my mind
Sugarite, sugarite
Yeah, all of the time

Stumbling on my knees through this big world
Pondering which direction I should take
When every sign seems like the right one
Am I following my instincts'
Am I making a mistake'

Sugarite, sugarite
You're deep in my soul
Sugarite, sugarite
I'm already home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Following darkness
It's feelin' more like home
Pining for the lightning
I keep reaching through the rain
I can't help but call your name

Sugarite, sugarite
It's been a long, long road
Sugarite, sugarite
I'm growing old
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Sugarite, sugarite
You're on my mind
Sugarite, sugarite
Yeah, all of the time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
