Welcome to real life
What's in the cards?
Reason has folded
Passion departs

Cause you picked your poison
In the words of tainted hearts
There's a truth behind this folly
End is a start

So break off the bough
You want it all but you don't know how
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me

What was the point of going insane?
Looking for solace, but nobody came
And the world waits on notice
Cause the time is running out
And this plan will get you nowhere
By yourself

So break off the bough
You want it all but you don't know how
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me

Wake up the town
Show them all just what you're about
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me

No more chasing ever after all
So long wasted life
Now it's your call

So break off the bough
You want it all but you don't know how
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me

Break off the bough
You want it all but you don't know how
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me

Turn the page, feel like you could own this day
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me
You're shakin' on an autumn tree
You take a little part of me
You take a little part of me
