Don't you see?
It wasn't meant to be
Keep on till you die
When lying down
We kick the crying clown
And there's never a thought
Of how he lifts a frown

The longer you love
The longer you live
The stronger you feel
The more you can give

It's dying like sand, sand in a sieve
Where is the time to remain?

Well don't forget
The day you ever met
Trying to believe
It wasn't wasted time
You sipping gin and wry
You had to walk away
It haunts you every day

The longer you love
The longer you live
The stronger you feel
The more you can give

Floating away, day in the rain
The lady you love can't sustain

The longer you love
The longer you live
The stronger you feel
The more you can give

We're dying like sand, sand in a sieve
Where is the time to remain?

The longer you love
The longer you live
The stronger you feel
The more you can give

Floating away, day in the rain
The lady you love can't sustain

The longer you love
The longer you live
The stronger you feel
The more you can give

You're floating away, day in the rain
The lady you love will sustain
