From standing to crouching 
Silently falling 
Falling from nowhere to nowhere 
Nothing between 
Nothing beyond 
Nothing behind the stars 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

Remain for some time 
Down here below 
Allowing the doubt to feed upon me 
And even the ones 
Who've never been 
Are climbing the wail up ahead 

I get up start crawling 
Into the same 
Over and over and over again 
Smelling the plastic 
Smelling the spit 
And smelling my own breath 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

The presence convincing 
The most of what I've written is false 
I mention this 
'Cause I'm talking in the light of what's known 
I get out of the sun 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

All together now 
Everybody
