Just another day 
Just another day 
Just another day
Just another day 

Wake up early in the mornin' man
Runnin' kinda' late I gotta' catch my plane 
Feelin' kinda' funny from the weed and things
Kinda' glad I woke up so I can't complain
I really need a break from this paper chase
But my girl ain't gonna' wait for the diamond ring 
My son ain't got to wait for no proper clothes
So I'm gone take a trip and do a couple of shows
So many different things be runnin' through my head
It's mandatory that I keep my family fed
On come the stompin' boots and I'm out there again
Seems like this crazy pace is never gonna' end.

Just another day 
Just another day 
Just another day
Just another day 

I'm on a mission man, I'm fired up 
They let me taste it man 
And now I'm hooked 
Ain't nobody standin' on the wall
I bust the way I bust because the feel it y'all
People got opinions all about me y'all 
Got a lot of girls so they call me dogg
Constantly around me is friends and foes
Say the wrong thing bet I bust your nose
I gotta' give give it up to niggaroes
Even thought at times we f*ck the same hoes
All the other niggas I'ma let you know 
Ain't no player hatin' go for what you know 
And if you see a girl that I'd like to lay 
Feel free to send her my way

Just another day 
Just another day 
Just another day
Just another day 

If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna like. 
If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna like.

And we can do it all night 
I bet I hit it just right 

Just another day 
Just another day 
Just another day
Just another day
