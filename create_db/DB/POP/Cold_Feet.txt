Saw you in the street
Left me in a state of wondering
If you even notice(d) me
Acting like a nervous tic

Got you undermined
Like a dream to have you on my arm
But even if you wanted to
I was gonna need a bit of proof

There's a space for me
On the edge of your seat
Where you wanted me to sit
Where you wanted me to sit

But my will is weak
And I'm tired of cold feet
Thought you wanted it to last
Thought you wanted it to last

In the golden afternoon
I can hear you in the other room
Fixing things with sellotape
Bound together by the myths you made

No-one ever seems
You're blowing faiths like a stolen beam of the sun
You know I don't need anyone
I just wanna have a drink or two

There's a space for me
On the edge of your seat
Where you wanted me to sit
Where you wanted me to sit

But my will is weak
And I'm tired of cold feet
Thought you wanted it to last
Thought you wanted it to last

There's a space for me
On the edge of your seat
Where you wanted me to sit
Where you wanted me to sit

But my will is weak
And I'm tired of cold feet
Thought you wanted it to last
Thought you wanted it to last

And the world you live
Is so convincing
Will the audience laugh?
Will the audience wilt?

Going home next week
And I'm tired of cold feet
Thought you wanted it to last
Thought you wanted it to last
