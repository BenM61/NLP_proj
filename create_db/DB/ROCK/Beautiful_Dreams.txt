Beautiful dreams we had at night 
All children have to dream at night 
Eyes closed in sleep of innocence 
Sandman had come to us alright 
Beautiful dreamers lost in some never-never dream 
Beautiful dreams we had 
Just beautiful dreams 
Beautiful dreams we had alright 
Now we had found the golden key 
Door to a secret world 
Of chemical dreams 
Beautiful dreamers of beautiful dreams 
Beautiful dreams we had 
Such beautiful dreams 
We'd like to find a cure 
For every known disease 
There's no such thing you say 
The answer's there to see 
Colorful dreams we have at night 
Of nuclear purity 
This is the final twilight 
This is the final cure it seems 
Beautiful dreamers drifting in never-never dreams 
Beautiful dreams we had 
Such beautiful dreams 
Dreams
