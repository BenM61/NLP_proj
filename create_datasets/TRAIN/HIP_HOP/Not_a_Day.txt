Oh...Oh...Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh...

I don't know why I need you,
all the time, I needed you...
Girl it seems I need you all my life...

Oh, not a day goes by, not an hour goes by, yeah...
Not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you...
Woah! Not a day goes by, not an hour goes by, yeah...
Not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you...

This is more than a sexual feelin', (oh yeah)
to me you're more appealin',
not just your mind, but your body, and your soul!!!

Oh-oh, not a day goes by, not an hour goes by,
not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you!
Oh, not a day goes by, not an hour goes by!
Not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you!

Every time I close my eyes, you are right there,
in my mind, in my mind, there's a special place for you!

Teddy, Teddy, play it for me! Play it 'til you feel it, Teddy!
Oh, oh, oh!!! Diddy sing it!!! 

Oh!! Not a day goes by, not an hour goes by, yeah,
not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you, oh...
