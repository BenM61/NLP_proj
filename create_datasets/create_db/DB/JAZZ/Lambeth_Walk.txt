Any time you're Lambeth way
Any evening, any day,
You'll find us all
Doin' the Lambeth walk.
Ev'ry little Lambeth gal
With her little Lambeth pal,
You'll find 'em all
Doin' the Lambeth walk.
Ev'rything free and easy,
Do as darn well pleasey,
Why don't you make your way there'
Go there, stay there,
Once you get down Lambeth way
Ev'ry evening, ev'ry day,
You'll find yourself
Doin'the Lambeth walk.
