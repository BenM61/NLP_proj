Like the moon tonight
Behind that cloud you're hiding
There you stand but you're not there
Once again the words have left me
Second guessing, is it fair?

Tell me why should it be that
We can't say what we mean?
Well, I've had enough
I've had enough

I saw the truth in your lies
I see a veil of disguise
Can't do this any longer
I've finally opened my eyes
It's left me nowhere to hide
Yeah, I've been getting stronger

Must follow my star
And you need to find out who you are
See I understand, I know who I am

Fear of emptiness was feeding this illusion
And I don't need it any more
Time is moving on, erasing all confusion
And now I'm sure
Gonna learn to be free, I'm rediscovering me
See I've had enough, I've had enough

I saw the truth in your lies
I see a veil of disguise
Can't do this any longer
I finally open my eyes
It's left me nowhere to hide
Yeah, I've been getting stronger

Must follow my star
And you need to find out who you are
See I understand, I know who I am
I know who I am

How many people let life pass them by
'cause they're in the same old place
And the truth is hard to face
I'm coming back up that one way road
I've found within a new beginning

Yeah, a new beginning
A new beginning
Yeah

I saw the truth in your lies
I see a veil of disguise
Can't do this any longer
I finally open my eyes
It's left me nowhere to hide
I know who I am

It shouldn't be that I can't say what I mean
No more lies
It shouldn't be

I know who I am
I know who I am

Rediscovering me
I'm getting stronger
