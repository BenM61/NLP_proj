alk to me baby I'm listening

Hook
Lay down and tell me what's on your mind
What exactly did he do to make you cry this time
Well I will be your comforter I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart and I will bring back your light

Come in I see he's hurt you again
When you are in pain I'm in pain
That's part of bring a friend
But this is a special case
I held my feelings back because of him
And now I can see it more than ever
I made a big mistake

Hook

I don't mean to disregard your feelings
But I think he's a fool
He don't know how sensitive you are
And baby that just ain't cool
I'm just glad I can be there for you
When you need a helping hand
Deep inside my heart from the start
I know I should've been your man

Hook
