I was sold up the river to the red slave trade
The stores were gathered, the plans were laid
Synchronised watches at 18:05
How many dead or alive
In ninteen fifty-five?

The pink flags was screaming
Bugle boys sucked and blew
No time for expression, orders given
Books were cooked, on the fourth or the third
How many seen or heard
On the twelfth of the third?

How many dead or alive? (how many)
How many dead or alive? (how many)
How many dead or alive? (how many)
How many dead or alive? (how many)
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many?
Yeah!
