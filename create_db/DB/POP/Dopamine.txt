I aspire to you rockabilly heart
All animals and engine
But I always fake the part
My side of the bed
I want push of the ledge
'Cause I cant get you to feel it
'Till your out there on the edge

You say give it give it give it give it to you
And then you take it till there's nothing left

So put your hands where you want to
Start screaming across the city
I'm making it pretty
But I know I mean nothing
I'm just drugs to you
Still I'm jonesing like a fiend
So line me up that dopamine
Ah ah ah nah ah ah ah

We had to break up
But I cant get you to feel the break
Call this what you will
Just don't call it a mistake
Call it addiction
Say that we were not in love
I don't really care now
When your all I'm thinking of
Yea your all I'm thinking of

So put your hands where you want to
Start screaming across the city
I'm making it pretty
But I know I mean nothing
I'm just drugs to you
Still I'm jonesing like a fiend
So line me up that dopamine

I go out the way that I feel
You think I'm just a fiend
I'm just a chemical in your head
I'm just that dopamine
So come on line me up
Come on line me up
Come on line me up that dopamine
Come on line me up that dopamine
Come on line me up that dopamine
Come on line me up that dopamine
Come on line me up that dopamine

So put your hands where you want to
Start screaming across the city
Line me up that dopamine
And I'm jonesing like a fiend
So line me up that dopamine
Come on line me up
Come on line me up that dopamine
Come on line me up
Come on line me up that dopamine
Come on line me up
Come on line me up that dopamine
