Healing holy man, once upon a time
He lived for his wife up until the crime

Hunting high and low to seek revenge
Brand new moral code, got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls when he avenged
Evil spirits flowed he drank the blood like lemonade

Cozy campfire crowd with a case of wine
Im feeling fine
Bounty hunter now and it crossed the line
Cross that line

Hunting high and low to seek revenge
Brand new moral code got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls when he avenged
Evil spirits flowed he drank the blood like lemonade

In the border town down in Mexico
They let him go
Law and order now 'cause he runs the show
So now you know

Hunting high and low, exact revenge
Brand new moral code got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls when he avenged
Evil spirits flow he drank the blood like lemonade

Hunting high and low, exact revenge
Brand new moral code got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls when he avenged
Evil spirits flow he drank the blood like lemonade

He drank the blood like lemonade (x3)
