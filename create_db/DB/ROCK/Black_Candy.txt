Drip my blood,
Fall in love,
To my see you,
Mess my head,
Crush my heart,
Molten led,
Read my palm,
Give me some,

Black candy [Repeat x2]

Spinning straw,
Into gold,
As she strikes,
Every soul,
Joan of Arc,
Upon hay,
Fallen chain you'll break,

Black candy [Repeat x4]

Jack hammer,
Can't stand her,
Can't live unless I have her,
Sin, drippin' down my chin.

Black candy [Repeat x6]

Burn baby, burn baby, burn baby, burn, baby burn, baby burn, baby burn, baby burn.

Black candy [Repeat x4]

Suck my blood,
Join the club,
Breakfast dud,
Cross my heart,
Hope to care,
Pull my hair,
Take me there, (take me there!)

Black candy [Repeat x7]
