Well I'm a gangster 1934, junkies, winos pimps and whores.
And all you men women and kids, best get out the way
I just left your town took all your loot 
Bought a pink carnation and a pin-striped suit. 
Hopped up the V-8 Ford, and some two-tone shoes.
And I'm already gone, I left a pool of blood and sorrow
I got the machine gun blues.

I'll be out of here for the break of dawn
I hit the highway, smoke a big cigar
Gotta stop and bury the cash and then get some more
There's only one thing on my mind
That's make it across that old state line
I'm a hell of the avenging bullets
Waiting there for me.
And I'm already gone, I left the path of pure destruction. 
I've got the machine gun blues.

Already gone, my life will soon be through. 
I've got the machine gun blues.

Public Enemy, number one, I'm sorry for all the things that I've done
If indeed we do cross paths, it's nothing personal.

And I'm already gone, I left a path of devastation
I got the machine gun blues.
And I'm already gone, my life will soon be through
I got the machine gun blues
