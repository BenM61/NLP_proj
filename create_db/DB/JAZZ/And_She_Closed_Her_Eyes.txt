And she closed her eyes and said
No I'm not in love
"I'm not in much
For real"

And the hood fell off her head
And her face got wet
I held my part
Of the deal

I've been growing older he thought
And he smiled and said
You've got the saddest face
I've seen

And when she didn't seem to listen at all
He said I'm getting wet
You held your part
Of the deal
