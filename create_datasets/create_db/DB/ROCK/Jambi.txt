Here from the king's mountain view
Here from a wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan I do
On treasures and flesh, never few

But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day

The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabble in all the way down
Up to my neck soon to drown

But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me round
So I
I
I
I
I would
I would
I would
Wish this all away

Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long
Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along

But I
And I would
If I could
And I would
Wish it away
Wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away
No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away
My center

So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away
You're my peace of mind, my home, my center
I'm just trying to hold on
One more day

Dim my eyes
Dim my eyes
Dim my eyes if they should compromise our fulcrum
Wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone

Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun

Shine on upon the broken
Shine until the two become one

Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun

Shine on upon the severed
Shine until the two become one

Divided I'm withering away
Divided I'm withering away
Shine on upon the many, light our way
Benevolent sun

Breathe in union
Breathe in union
Breathe in union
Breathe in union
Breathe in union
So as one survive
Another day and season

Silence, legion, save your poison
Silence, legion, stay out of my way
