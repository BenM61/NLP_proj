I got a flair of the hair on my shoulder
It's apparent it's there and it's bolder
Like I show you my cards, I'm no folder
Yes imma soldier
Against everything square and I'm sightly
Yes I know I look good so don't fine me
All I need is a clip or scrunchy
And then I'm ready

Because I rock a side pony
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
Rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
Who doesn't love a side pony?
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony

'Cause I met ya, ya been in my stable
And I see you whenever I'm able
Though we're keeping it under the table
It ain't a fable
Why can we hide in away in your derby
We're having fun and we're keeping it flirty
Everybody might say that it's dirty
But don't you worry

Because I rock a side pony
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
A side pony
Who doesn't love a side pony?
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony

Because I rock a side pony - yeah
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony

Who doesn't love a side pony?
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony

'Cause I rock a side pony
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony
I rock a side pony

'Cause I rock a side pony
Baby I'm just living my life
Because I rock a side pony
I rock a side
I rock-rock a side
Pony
