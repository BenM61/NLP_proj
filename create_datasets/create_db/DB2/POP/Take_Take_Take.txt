Don't be bashful, don't be shy
You're so pretty, ya get so high
You're jumping up to me, you don't understand
So don't be bashful, take me by the hand

Take, take, take, take it now give me that song
Take, take, take, take it now move it right along

So don't be crazy you gotta keep your hat on
Gonna get it ready now, gonna get that song
Some dance together, some fly together, some stick together
And they don't know why

Take, take, take, take it now give me that song (some stand together)
Take, take, take, take it now move it right along (some dance to fly)
Some stand together - Some dance to fly
Some stick together

Give it to me, give it to me
Do you understand why

Don't be bashful, don't be shy
You're so pretty, ya get so high
Keep jumping to me, you don't understand

So don't be bashful, take it by the hand
Take, take, take, take it now give me that song
Take, take, take, take it now move it right along
I gotta take it down and gimme that dance
Take it now, take it now

Hey, hey, hey yeah
Take, take, take, take it now give me that song
Take, take, take, take it now move it right along

Hey, hey
