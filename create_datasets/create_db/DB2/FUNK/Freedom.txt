Ain't got no halo, no wings to fly away
I've got to labor, for many many days
I'm on a journey, I'm looking for a place
To rest by burdens, far from this tyranny

From the shores of Africa
Up to the doors of America
With voices to heaven praying for liberty
We cry freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)

We marched in 'Bama
We marched in Tennesee
Brown men and white men
Stood for equality
We kept our chin up
We kept our dignity
And our proclamation
Let everbody sing

From the shores of Africa
Up to the doors of America
With voices to heaven praying for liberty
We cry freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)

Up on Golgotha, hanging upon a tree
They say the God-man, died for my liberty
He heard me crying, from my captivity
And so he came down, down to deliver me
Woah woah woah woah

From the shores of Africa
Up to the doors of America
With voices to heaven praying for liberty
We cry freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)

Our hearts cry freedom
My heart cries freedom
Your heart cries freedom
His heart cries freedom
Woo
