Do you believe in something beautiful
Between chaos and the light
You gave it all for something you once sold
The truth be told you lied

If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight
Yeah we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

Are you receiving nothing once again
Is there shame for what's been done
It screams so loud that you can't begin
'Cause you're always on the run

If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight
Yeah, we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

Oh
Yeah
Oh
Yeah

Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will
Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will
Do with me what you will
