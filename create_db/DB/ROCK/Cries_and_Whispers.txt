Below the surface, this day, I need it light
Inside dimension, lies another sacrifice
Once out of reach, we never speak, we never compromise
As they turned to gold, the edges froze, it seemed to turn to ice

All flight departures, assembled, returned
Left in these passions, I looked but never learned
There's hope, you've heard, there's life in another world
Sometimes you'll find that truth is never kind

In the ghost lies a portrait of space that time is never here
In the mind of a fallen man, a new day in another land
Ship sails out to sea, away from me, I just stand and stare
Assassin clears his hands, I know that and I wasn't even there

One day it came to mind, we even leave the rest behind
Some day, I know you get where you should go
There's hope, you've heard, there's life in another world
Sometimes you'll find that truth is never kind

One day it came to mind, we even leave the rest behind
Some day, I know you get where you should go
There's hope, you've heard, there's life in another world
