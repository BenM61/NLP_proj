Well, I wrote my number down. 
I'd never wrote it down before. 
I was gonna bring over like something from a film but 
I didn't have the bottle at all. 

Well I had a look and you kept staring. 
Your head pairing up with mine 
Cos your so pretty and I'm so shy. 
You proper did give me the eye though im sure you did 
Well I went outside, couldn't say i tried. 
And I felt regret. 
But in a flash yeah i'd dashed back in. 
Cos the ship had'nt sailed yet. 

And when i did I couldn't see your face 
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do. 
I dashed around to find you 
But you were nowhere to be seen 
Oh no no 

na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na nooooo 

Well yeah she flew away. 
She seemed like weeks or months away. 
(missing lines) 

Yeah but i learned my lesson though. 
Your so pretty and i'm so shy
