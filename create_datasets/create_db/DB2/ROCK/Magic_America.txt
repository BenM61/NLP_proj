Bill Barret has a simple dream
He calls it his plan B
Buildings in the sky and the air is sugar-free
And everyone is very friendly
(Well) Plan B arrived on a holiday
Took a cab to the shopping malls
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore
Then found love on channel forty-four

La la la la la
He wants to go to magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all those magic people

Bill barrett sent his postcards home
To everyone he'd ever known they read
Fifty nine cents gets you a good square meal
From the people who care how you feel

La la la la la
He wants to go to magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all the magic people
With all the magic people

La la la la la
He wants to go to magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
La la la la la
So nice to be in magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all the magic people
With all the magic people
With all the magic people, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh
With all the magic people
Oh, the magic people (with all the magic people) all the people
All the people, all the people
All the people (with all the magic people) all the people
All the people (with all the magic people) all the people
All the people (with all the magic people) all the people
