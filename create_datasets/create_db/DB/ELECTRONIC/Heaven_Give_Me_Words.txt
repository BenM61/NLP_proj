Take these words they come out wrong
They won't express this old emotional thing
If you could see inside my mind
You'd know the love and feel this passionate thing
You stepped into my locked out world
I felt your touch on my shoulder
You turned my mind right over
Like a child before it learns to speak
I turn to stone, I turn to stone
Heaven give me words to tell you 
How I am feeling
What I am needing
Heaven let this message reach you
This desperation
Will stop my heart from beating
I won't be giving in
I'll die if I don't tell you just how I feel
I'll make you truly understand
What kind of man could live with feelings 
Of steel
I used to be so self contained 
When I thought about love
A conversation heart to heart
I must confess this old emotional thing
Before you think that I'm a fool
There's a flame that burns here
Here's a feeling that's so rare
It's my nightmare when I go to speak
I turn to stone, I turn to stone
Heaven give me words to tell you
How I am feeling
What I am needing
Heaven let this message reach you
This desperation
Will stop my heart from beating
Heaven give me words
Heaven give pride
Heaven let this message reach you
You've seen a heart worn on my sleeve
I must express this old emotional thing
Please be a witness to my dreams
Or I'll wake up and say now 
Can this be real?
Before you think that I'm a fool
There's a flame that burns here
Here's a feeling that's so rare
It's my nightmare when I go to speak 
I turn to stone, I turn to stone
Heaven give me words to tell you
How I am feeling
What I am needing
Heaven let this message reach you
This desperation
Will stop my heart from beating
Heaven give me words to tell you
How I am feeling
What I am needing
Heaven let this message reach you
This desperation
Will stop my heart from beating
Heaven give me words
Heaven give pride
Heaven let this message reach you
