The birds they sang at the break of day 
Start again I heard them say
Don't dwell on what has passed away 
Or what is yet to be

Yeah the wars they will be fought again 
The holy dove she will be caught again 
Bought and sold and bought again
The dove is never free

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in

We asked for signs the signs were sent 
The birth betrayed, the marriage spent
Yeah the widowhood of every government 
Signs for all to see

I can't run no more with this lawless crowd
While the killers in high places say their prayers out loud
But they've summoned up a thundercloud 
And they're gonna hear from me

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in

You can add up the parts
You won't have the sum 
You can strike up the march
There is no drum 
Every heart to love will come
But like a refugee

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
