Can you look me straight in my eyes?
And tell me love is forgiven
Beneath it all she cries
That what's not safe is hidden

You know what's wrong now
You can't deny this

All the pretty horses roam and the morning roosters crowing
All the final seeds have grown and the summer wind is blowing
You know what's wrong now
You can't deny this

Another day fades away
Into the midwestern haze
A duster plane flies away
Over pastures of cattle

You know what's wrong now
You can't deny this

Can you look me straight in my eyes?
And tell me love is forgiven
