It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She'll put on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, do I look all right?
And I say, yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, do you feel all right?
And I say, yes, I feel wonderful tonight

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes

And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed

And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, my darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight
