You are harvest, You are golden sun
You are cool rain, You are all in one
And in all my deepest thoughts
And in all my battles fought
You are within
You are within
You are crimson, You are midnight blue
You have called me to discover You
You have warmed my heart of stone
You have borne my pain alone
Speak to me now, speak to me now, speak to me now
Breath of heaven, hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven, lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy
Breath of heaven
I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am longing to be with You there
And with every fading fear
There is healing in my tears
Now I belong, now I belong, now I am strong
Breath of heaven, hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven, lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven, hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven, lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy
Breath of heaven
