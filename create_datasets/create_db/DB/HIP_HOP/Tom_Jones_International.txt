Refugee camp
Turn me up give me some more
Tom Jones your ready baby
Yeah that's it
Let go

One, two toms coming for you
Three, four gonna bust through your door
Five, six you better lock up your chicks
Seven, eight before its to late

Act right ladies seem forgot body 
Feels like pussycats come out
Late night no matter where they roam
They always gonna come home to Tom Jones

Thirty years strong never went wrong
Still in the game I decide when I'm gone
Now I'm gonna set the whole house on fire
I won't stop rocking till I retire

You know and I know you gotta move on the dance floor
Were blowing up this party with this sex bomb
Take my hand understand I'll rock for years all across the land
So let me see you shake it till the sun comes

One, two toms coming for you
Three, four gonna bust through your door
Five, six you better lock up your chicks
Seven, eight before its to late

Now your in the mood
So let me see you move
I got you hypnotized with the sound of the groove
From London to L.A.
And back to the N.Y.
Turn on your satellites so we can see it worldwide

You know and I know you gotta move on the dance floor
Were blowing up this party with this sex bomb
Take my hand understand I'll rock for years all across the land
So let me see you shake it till the sun comes

One, two toms coming for you
Three, four gonna bust through your door
Five, six you better lock up your chicks
Seven, eight before its to late
Pussycats come out late night
Girl you make me want to holler

Tom Jones international baby (3*)

One, two toms coming for you
Three, four gonna bust through your door
Five, six you better lock up your chicks
Seven, eight before its to late
