When I was young, lying in the grass
I felt so safe in a warming bath
Of sunlight
Of sunlight.

Vast open sky
Could do no harm
Like an embrace
From mother's arms
In sunlight
In sunlight.

In sunlight
In sunlight.

With every year that came to pass
More clouds appear until the sky went black
And there was
No sunlight,
No sunlight.
And there was
No sunlight,
No sunlight anymore.

You disappeared at the same speed
The idealistic things I believed
The optimist died inside of me
No sunlight,
No sunlight.

No sunlight,
No sunlight.

You disappeared with the same speed
The idealistic thing I believed
The optimist died inside of me
No sunlight,
No sunlight.

No sunlight,
No sunlight.

No sunlight,
No sunlight,
No sunlight,
No sunlight anymore.
