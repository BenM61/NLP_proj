I don't need a whole lots of money
I don't need a big fine car
I got everything that a man could ever want
I got more than I could ask for

Yeah , yeah
And I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got a sweet, sweet loving woman
And she knows just how to treat me right

My baby she's all right
My baby she's clean out of sight
Don't you know she's a some kind of wonderful
Yes she is, some kind of wonderful

Now hold it Buddy's gonna tell you one more thing

And when she holds in her arms
She sets my soul on fire (sets my soul on fire)
Lord when my baby kisses me people
My heart becomes filled with desire

When she wraps her loving arms around me
Almost drives me out of my mind
I get funny little feelings inside of me
Chills run up and down my spine

My baby she's all right
My baby she's a clean out of sight
Don't you know she's a some kind of wonderful
Yes she is, some kind of wonderful

Now hold it let me tell you one more thing

Tell me is there anybody
That's got a sweet little woman like mine
There's got to be somebody
That's got a sweet little woman like mine

Now tell me
Can I get a witness (Can I get a witness can I get a witness)
Got to get a witness (Can I get a witness)
Can I get a witness

I want to talk about my baby (Some kind of wonderful)
Talkin' about my baby (Some kind of wonderful)
Talkin' about my baby (Some kind of wonderful)
Talkin' about my baby (Some kind of wonderful)

She's everything I need
So much more than a man can want
Some kind of wonderful
In her high heeled shoes
