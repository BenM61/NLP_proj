At the dark end of the street
That's where we'd always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me
I know that time's gonna take it's toll
We've got to give back all the love that we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh but our love keeps coming on strong
Steal away, to the dark end of the street

They're going to find us
They're going to find us
They're going to find us
Oh someday
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me

And if by chance we walk downtown
If you should see me just walk on by
But darling, please don't cry
Tonight we'll meet, at the dark end of the street
