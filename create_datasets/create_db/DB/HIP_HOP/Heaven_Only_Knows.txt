Turn this up
Turn this up
Uh huh
No beat
Uh huh
No no no beat
Uh huh uh huh

[Chorus:]
Heaven only knows
Uh uh
Cause I don't understand
Understand
Won't you tell me please
Tell me please
What's the master plan
Master plan
Spent so many days 
Many days
Sitting on a cloud
Sitting on a cloud
Heaven only knows
Only God knows
So I'll just move the crowd 

Yo tell 'em
Tell 'em
Now
Now
Now

I break out my physical shell
And excel past the so called body
Used to go to the party
But now I sit and chill with the pen and the pad
Dropping ill philosophical science
Me and my dad we talk about life
And how it started
How we departed from lights path
And probable right math
The task at hand is making people understand that we're not who we think we are
Within this land of lost the cost of souls could be so high
People be getting high wondering why we die
But it's all planned
To get your fear take the hand
We keep on returning because the lessons need learning
Concerning the fact
I sing and I rap
I hold this mic contact
Critics can step back and analyze
I energize with cosmic rays of days
There ain't no ??? ??? of the sun

[Chorus]

Yo
Riddle me this
Riddle me this
Like this

Melodical prodigal flows 
Hypnotical blows to brain pieces
Telekinesis
When I reach this pinnacle cynical clinical
Microphone autobots waiting on lotto spots
Trying to rock
But yo they can't understand
There's only one plan
The time is at hand
In the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to free the righteous children
Now!, I know you want to be on top of the world
Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl watching your jacuzi swirl
Seems like material lust
We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust
Me!, it's kinda hard when you rhyme sometimes
Everybody wants to scrutinize
Redefine who you are
But every person is a star
So let your light shine far
And praise God

[Chorus]

If you feel this
Sing it with me like
Sing it with me like
Sing it with me like

La la la lala lala
I'll just move the crowd for now

Gotta move the crowd
Gotta move the crowd
Gotta move the crowd

La la la lala lala
I'll just move the crowd for now

Somebody told me
They said uh
 
If you free them
They will start revolution and Babylon cannot defeat them
(right and they don't want that and they don't want that and they don't want that)
If you free them
They will start revolution and Babylon cannot defeat them
(mind revolution
mind revolution)

And so uh uh
My sister sage
And my girl graf
You know the time
The shadow thorn
And s love
And ??? gel
The figure four
And uh
The rascals 
And uh
And Kardinal
And uh
My mom and dad
And uh
My brother a
And uh 
My brother J
Uh huh
The t dot [go Toronto woo!]

Uh huh
You get love
Uh huh
