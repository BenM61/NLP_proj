I made mistakes when I played with your mind
Gave you excuses with each story line
If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real

Watching you wondering what I feel inside 
Deep in my soul I've got nothing to hide
If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real 

So baby please don't worry 
I wanna make it better 
I wanna be your only love

This time I'll understand you
I'll never leave your side
This time it's got to be for you

Let's put an end to these long lonely nights
Things that were once wrong now turned out all right
If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real 
If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real 

You told me, you loved me 
You said that 
I need you, you want me
I told you

So baby I won't tease you
I'm gonna make it better
I wanna be your only love
This time I'll understand you 
I'll never leave your side 
This time it's got to be for you 

If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real
