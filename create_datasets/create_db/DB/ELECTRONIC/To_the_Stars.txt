Now that you've gone to the stars
Now that the storm has finally come
So now that you've gone to the stars
Now that the storm has finally come

When these colors fade to gray,
You're a million miles away.
You're a million miles away.
You're a million miles away.
When these colors fade to gray

Now that you've gone to the stars
Now that the storm has finally come

So now that you've gone to the stars
Now that the storm has finally come
Now that the storm has finally come
Now that the storm has finally come

When these colors fade to gray,
You're a million miles away.
You're a million miles away.
You're a million miles away.
When these colors fade to gray...

So now that you've gone to the stars
Now that the storm has finally come
Now that the storm has finally come

Now that you've gone
