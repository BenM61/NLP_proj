yeah
all's right
we've wallowed in
and worked blind sight
feel
numb well
hone edge of love
cushion truth sell
so rise and shine
in california phase
rise and shine
in california phase
dark
cool night
we lose our way
recover bleak bright
peace
long last
the war is balance
ever and past
so rise and shine
in california phase
rise and shine
in california phase
fear follow tongue into dissolve
into the symphony of none
tune our heart to channel sun
and luna see sight gather calm
so rise and shine
in california phase
rise and shine
in california phase
so rise and shine...
