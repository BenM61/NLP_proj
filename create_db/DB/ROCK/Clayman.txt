Your self control makes me feel alone 
I've tried confidence, had it for breakfast today 
I've lost the perfection, a mess without words 
(And) As the seasons change I'll continue to ignore 
The image I project - me without me 
The picture that I scanned is borrowed 

After the education you stopped making sense to me 
Seems to me that it's all the same, time and time again 
Slowly, all that I believed in, turning into a lie 
To aim and miss, my supernatural art 
Spending too much time with myself 
Trying to explain who I am 

How come it's possible 
I wish there was a way 
(Suddenly) I feel so invincible 
I'm the sculpture made out of clay 

I need someone to break the silence 
Before it all falls apart 
I need something to cling onto 
Before I break you in parts 

So afraid of what you may think 
And all the plastic people that surrounds me 
I have to find the path to where it all begins 
To teach the world my supernatural art
