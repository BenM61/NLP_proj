All the boys are loving all the girls
Who screen the sun, can't stand the rain
Moving under not over time
The sun will shine on

Red rust wreck is off his mind
Down on the highway there to die
Got a Toyota of another kind
God built these hands to drive

Plastic bag woman must wait
While nylon men walk out in space
Africa will turn to dust
In LA LA land we give out trust

We'll set the place on fire
And watch the memories fry
Go someplace don't recognize
You can't lose if you don't try
Ain't gonna slave for a Cadillac
Turn my back, burn the place to ash
I can't speak so I don't mime
I won't seek so I won't find

Who needs the pyramids
We got a photograph
Down on the left hand side
You can see mum and dad

Pull down the monuments
And send a postcard back
For nineteen ninety five
I will have the starter pack

My M16 was in my prayers,
'How is the world now I ain't there?
Are they wearing flowers in their hair?'
The rich kids school while I am here

We'll set the place on fire
And watch the memories fry
Go someplace don't recognize
You can't lose if you don't try
Ain't gonna slave for a Cadillac
Turn my back, burn the place to ash
I can't speak so I don't mime
I won't seek so I won't find

This map shows where to start
Move across the grid and down
When the lines are far apart
You will find you're out of town

At ninety miles an hour
Insects crash into the screen
The rear view mirror blurs
Home is just a memory

Aeroplanes fall from the skies
Life crafts sinking in the night
It stops if I close my eyes
Memories will hold me tight [Repeat: x3]
