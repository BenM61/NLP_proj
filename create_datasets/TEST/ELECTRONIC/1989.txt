Well, I'm afraid of that picture
From 1989
Faded colors and worn out texture
From 1989

Well, I've been young and I've been stupid
But it's left behind
I regret the things that I did
And I feel fine

We can't go on like this
Don't go on yourself like this
We can't go on like it's
1989

Let's go back, I'll be your angel
I'll make a deal with time
But I don't know if that would change you
Or give you peace of mind

1989,1989,1989,1989
1989,1989,1989,1989

We can't go on, we've gotta move on
We've gotta move on now
We can't go on, we've gotta move on
We've gotta move on now
