This big old car, gonna take us home
This big old car, gonna take us home
Gonna take us home, to what we know so well
This big old car, gonna take us home

Gonna take us all the way to Brisbane
Take us all the way to Cairns
Take us back across to Katherine
To the Fitzroy River sands
Gonna see the Indian Ocean
And we'll turn around and then
This big old car'll take us home again

This big old car, gonna take us home
This big old car, gonna take us home
Gonna take us home, to what we know so well
This big old car, gonna take us home

Ain't got no rattle free transmission
Ain't no good around the town
There's no fitted air condition
We just roll the windows down
And slam another tape in
And turn it up and pray
This big old car gonna take us all the way

This big old car, gonna take us home
Gonna take us all the way and back 
However far we like to roam
Gonna take us all the way to heaven
Take us all the way to hell
And then this big old car gonna get us home.
