Last night I laid with you
'Twas like a dream come true
I've never felt so right
I want you for the rest of my life

Maybe we should settle down
And raise a family
A girl for you
And maybe a boy for me
'Cause that is how much
That is how much
How much I love you girl

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You turn the darkness to light
And you brighten up the corners of my mind

You really do, yeah

Last night I prayed for you
That you would forever be cool
'Cause you brought back love in my life
And I gotta tell ya baby
The feeling it's so nice

So maybe we should just settle down
And raise a family
A girl for you
And maybe a boy for me
'Cause that's how much
That is how much
How much I love you girl

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You turn the darkness to light
And you brighten up the corners of my mind

Maybe we should settle down
And raise a family
A girl for you
And maybe a boy for me
That is how much
That is how much
How much I love you girl

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You turn the darkness to light
And you brighten up the corners of my mind
