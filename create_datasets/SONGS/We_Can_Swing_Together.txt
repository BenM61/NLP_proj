No-one came to criticism, no-one to complain,
Just to pass a little bit of time, play some human games.
Some were smoking 'roll your owns', while others they had none,
Everybody was holding hands, and singing this little song.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

Then when things were happening, around about ten to four,
There was a screeching of brakes, dogs barking outside, and a hammering on the door.
Then the voice of officialdom, saying 'Open in the name of the law',
But we just kept on holding hands, and singing this song some more.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

Then they broke down all the doors, and kicked the windows in,
They let their doggies off the leads, and they ransacked everything.
They stood us all against the wall, their faces split with grins,
And then they linked each others' handcuffs and they merrily began to sing.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

They took us to see the County Judge, with a wig-hat on his head,
He heard our case with a smile on his face, and this is what he said:
I'll have to send you all to jail, for doing this terrible thing.
And as I walked down to the cells, I swear I heard him sing.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.
