I saw your eyes
And you made me smile
For a little while
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes
And they touched my mind
Although it took a while
I was falling in love
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes (I saw your eyes, I saw your eyes)
And you made me cry (and you made me cry, and you made me cry)
And for a little while (a little while, a little while)
I was falling in love

I was falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
