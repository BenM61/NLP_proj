You feel lonesome don't you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

So bang your head against the wall
But no one wants to see you fall down
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you

Put your hands over your eyes
And stumble your way through the night
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you

You feel lonesome don't you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

So shout until your hear no more
But don't you ever ask yourself why
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you

Dig yourself a bottomless hole
But don't you ever lose that light
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you

This is a repetition of words, dancing needs a
Repetition to work

You feel lonesome don't you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you

This is a repetition of words, dancing needs a
Repetiton to work
