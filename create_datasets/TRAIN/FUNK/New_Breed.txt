Well gather around girls, and take a look at me,
'Cause I got something that you gotta see
You can call me for whatever you need,
I was a part of the new breed
Part of the brand new breed
I got 2 strong arms, which used to hold you tight
I got some good love, and it's outta sight
You can call me for whatever you need,
I was a part of the new breed
Part of the brand new breed
I got 2 strong arms, which used to hold you tight
I got some good love, and it's outta sight
Hey now mama, now let me be a man
'Cause I got a thing going, fed up, and hold up your act, hey
You make the sunshine, up from the pouring rain,
'Cause I got the power, to do anything
You can call me for whatever you need,
I was a part of the new breed
