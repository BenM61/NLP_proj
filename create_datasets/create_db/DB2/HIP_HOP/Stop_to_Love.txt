Lately love keeps keeping me wake at night 
Tossing and turning, my love 
Wanna kiss you, wanna hold you so tight 
Oh but I wonder love whether you know or not 
When you just hurry away, leaving me laying there in shock 

I just wanna be the one that you wanna see 
I just wanna have you near me 
But you fly away almost everyday 
You work a lot but you never stop to love 

(Stop) I love you stop (stop)
Come home from the road 
(Gotta stop to love)
And let's celebrate (celebrate) the love we got (stop)
Say you're coming home 

(Gotta stop to love)
You say my love has always been on your mind 
But how can I ever love you, when you keep working overtime? 
Too many empty nights, could make almost any guy 
To look for the love he don't get whenever he's alone at home

Awaiting the day that you're coming to stay 
I hate to see you go away baby, but you couldn't rest 
Had to do your best to reach the top 
But you did not stop to love 

(Stop) I love you stop (stop)
Come home from the road 
(Gotta stop to love)
And let's celebrate (celebrate) the love we got (stop)
Say you're coming home 

(Gotta stop to love)
And one day you'll discover I'm the one who love ya 
(Gotta stop to love)
No one loves you better 
Can't you stay forever? 
(Stop to love)
I can hardly stand the loneliness 
Come on home, that's what it's all about 
You really turn me out 

I love you stop (stop)
Love you stop (stop)
Come home from the road 
(Gotta stop to love)
And let's celebrate (celebrate) the love we got (stop)
Say you're coming home 
(Gotta stop to love)

I love you stop (stop)
I still love you stop (stop)
Come home from the road 
(Gotta stop to love)
And let's celebrate (celebrate) all the love we got (stop)
Say you're coming home
