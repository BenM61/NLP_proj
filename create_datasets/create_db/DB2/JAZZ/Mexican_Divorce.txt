Down below El Paso lies Juarez
Mexico is different yes like a travel folder says
Cross the Rio Grande and you will find
An old adobe house
Where you leave your past behind

One day married, next day free
Broken hearts for you and me
Takes no time, and all you to get
A Mexican divorce

As I came into this empty house last night
Looked at all my windows, yes I did but I couldn't find one light

I found you on that road to Mexico
And now, my love, I beg
Please, oh, please, don't go

One day married, next day free
Broken hearts for you and me
Takes no time, and all you to get
A Mexican divorce

Finding love takes so long
Walking out must be wrong
It's a sin for you to get a Mexican divorce

One day married, next day free
Broken hearts for you and me
