In my dream, I see you there
Your eyes fixed in a vacant stare
A little laugh, a crooked smile
Don't lift a finger while I lay dying

Bone dry
You drank all the blood
My heart is bone dry
Can't give you more 'cause you took all of it (Sha la la)

Was a day when I did believe
The things you say are what you mean
Dear sweet, innocent me
How much you took from me to finally see

Bone dry
You drank all the blood
My heart is bone dry
Can't give you more 'cause you took all of it (sha la la, sha la la)

Sha la la
Shouby dooby dooby doo
Shouby dooby
Shouby dooby dooby doo

What becomes a man like me
Drifting off, lost at see
I'll set a fire look up for it
Lookin' for me, I'm a pink sunset

Bone dry (sha la la)
You drank all the blood
My heart is bone dry (sha la la)
Can't give you more 'cause you took all of it (Sha la la)

Bone dry, who!
(Sha la la) bone dry, whoo!
You took all of it (sha la la)
Sha la la
Sha la la

Sha la la
