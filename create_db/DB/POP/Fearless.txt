I took a walk along the sea
Lost in thoughts of you and me
Just like the moon turning the tide
I feel a pull from so deep inside

So many questions haunting us
So many doubts attacked our love
Dangerous thoughts of what could go wrong
Against the odds we must carry on

Must be strong and fearless
We must be fearless
Ooh, counting on help from above
Trusting the power of love
We must be fearless fearless, fearless

For so long I was afraid
To step from the shadow of my mistakes
Your love has given me the courage I need
Together I know nothing can stop you and me

If we are fearless
We must be fearless
Ooh, counting on help from above
Trusting the power of love
We must be fearless, we must be fearless

We must stand in the light, willing to fight
Whatever may come between us

And be fearless, we must be fearless
Ooh, counting on help from above
Trusting the power of love
We must be fearless, fearless, fearless
Fearless, fearless, fearless
Fearless, fearless, fearless
