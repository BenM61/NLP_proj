I can see a sky in the place where we're happy
I can see it all now, our friends are all there
I close my eyes and I know that you're actually with me
I'm going in, i'm going into a dream state
As it real as it feels
No, no, don't turn back
Can't just turn around
???
And my heart beating faster

I go anywhere to find you
Any place beside you
I gonna stay right where I found you
I look around me
I go anywhere to find you
Any place beside you
I stay right where I found you
I look around me
It's just astounding

We're not apart
No, we're just a part of the landscape
I can see it all now

I go anywhere to find you
Any place beside you
I stay right where I found you
I look around me

I go anywhere to find you
Any place beside you
I stay right where I found you
I look around me

Imaging me a landscape
I can see it all night
Your dancing in the devils line feels right
Bab ba badab aba a

I go anywhere to find you
Any place beside you
I'm gonna stay right where I found you
I look around me
I go anywhere to find you
Any place beside you
I stay right where I found you
I look around me
It's just astounding
