Rain fell down 
You were there 
I cried for you when I 
Hurt my hand 
Storm a-rushing in 
Wind was howling 
I called for you, you were there 

Whenever dark turns to night 
And all the dreams sing their song 
And in the daylight forever 
To you I belong 

Beside the sea 
When the waves broke 
I drew a heart for you in the sand 
In fields where streams 
Turn to rivers 
I ran to you, you were there 

Whenever dark turns to night 
And all the dreams sing their song 
And in the daylight forever 
To you I belong 

I ran to you, you were there 

Whenever the dark turns to night 
And all the dreams sing their song 
And in the daylight forever 
To you I belong 

To you I belong 
To you I belong
