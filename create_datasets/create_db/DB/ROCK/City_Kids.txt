Nobody knows,
I know nobody cares what goes on in here,
We have this door,
Nobody gets in until I'm really sure,
Don't creep up behind me,
You know where to find me I'm always around,
Turns out if you need us, before you lead us astray

Don't care who we meet,
We're orphans here on Easy Street and we feel real mean,
Cruising on speed,
We've got more than we'll ever need, ain't life sweet?
We won't turn your pay down,
City kids don't lay down, we don't call so,
Better get some more of that,
City kids we don't give that to you, oh no

Bombs go off at night,
Searing heat, blinding light, you like it fine,
Park the car and run,
Dance all night, it was for fun, we're nasty, hahahaha!
Why do we do it,
No-one can get through it we know where to run,
You hear what we're saying,
Time that you were praying 'cos,
City kids time, won't be long,

Won't be long, no it won't be long!
