You and I, blurred lines
We come together every time
Two wrongs, no rights
We lose ourselves at night

From the outside, from the outside
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try?

Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

Wait on, the thunder sky
Wherever there's smoke, there'll soon be fire
And what could bring bad luck
I've been looking at you too much

From the outside, from the outside
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try?

Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

In the middle of it
We walk, we walk the line
Looking back I miss it
Our wildest moments
Are you thinking what if
What if we ruined it all?
My wrecking ball

From the outside, from the outside
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try?

Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
