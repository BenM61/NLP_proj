I'm goin' where those chilly winds don't blow, oh baby;
Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow;
I'm goin' where I've never been before, oh baby;
Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow.
*Chilly winds are driving me away, oh baby;
Chilly winds are driving me away;
I'll go and find the sun again someday, oh baby;
Chilly winds are driving me away.
I'm goin' where I'll never have the blues, oh baby;
Goin' where I'll never have the blues;
I'm gonna leave this hammer, leave this line and you, oh baby;
Goin' where I'll never have the blues.
Chilly winds are driving me away, oh baby;
Chilly winds are driving me away;
I'll go and find the sun again someday, oh baby;
Chilly winds are driving me away.
Who's gonna love you when I'm gone,
When I leave this lonesome town?
I'm goin' away to find my home,
Where those chilly winds don't blow.
I'm goin' where those chilly winds don't blow, oh baby;
Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow;
I'm goin' where I've never been before, oh baby;
Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow.
Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow.
Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow.
*Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow.
