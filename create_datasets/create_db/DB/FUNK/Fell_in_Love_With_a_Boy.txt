I fell in love with a boy 
Fell in love once and almost completely 
He's in love with the world, 
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading 
He turns and he says, "Are you alright?" 
Oh I must be fine 'cause my hearts still beating, 
Come and kiss me by the riverside 
Sarah said its cool she don't consider it cheating, 
Red hair with a curl 
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping 
Can't keep away from the boy 
The two sides of my brain need to have a meeting 
Can't think of anything to do my left brain knows that all love is fleeting 
He's just looking for something new 
Yeah I said it once before but it bears repeating 
(aaaaa,aaaaa,aaaaa,aaaaaaa) 
Can't think of anything to do 
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting 
He's just looking for something new well 
I said it once before but it bears repeating 
Fell in love with a boy I fell in love once and almost completely 
He's in love with the world 
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading 
He turns and asks are you alright? 
Oh I must be fine because my hearts still beating 
Come and kiss me by the riverside 
Sarah said it's fine she don't consider it cheating now 
(aaaaaaaaa,aaaaaaaaa,aaaaaaa,aaaaa) 
Can't think of anything to do 
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting 
He's just looking for something new 
Well I've said once before but it bears repeating now
