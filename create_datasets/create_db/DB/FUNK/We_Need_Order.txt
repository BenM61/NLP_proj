The world today is in so many pieces
People searching for so many ways
Of releasing their disappointments and fears
So, come on with the pills and the tears

We need order, we need order
Yeah, hey, we need order
We need order, hey, hey

Oh, the flowers and the trees
Those that are left are so very beautiful
Oh, the birds and the bees
Have been forgotten, almost a used to be

Man is tempted to take
If not for himself then for his children
But, they can't help themselves
But rely on a prayer and a little religion

We're hung up on the knowledge of war
Something, that most of us have never seen
But, how sweet it would be to wake up in the morning
And find it was all a dream

We need order, we need order
Hey, hey, we need order
We need order, hey, hey
We need order, hey

Oh, the flowers and the trees
Those that are left are so very beautiful
Oh, the birds and the bees
Have been forgotten, almost a used to be
