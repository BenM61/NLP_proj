What have you done my brother?
I don't know, I don't know
I said, what have you done my brother?
I don't know, I don't know

You done wrong to the one who loved you
Brother, you took no heed to the one above you
Say you chained away, away on Sunday
And you, you turn around this way and you wonder on Monday

Listen y'all, at the end you won't no have to run
Oh, you shoulda gone and payed for what you done

You better ask yourself
What have you done my brother?
I don't know, I don't know
I said, what have you done my brother?
I don't know, I don't know
Said you told your lie, without no shame
That you worn out and scuttle
Relies on somebody to blame
You twist it well, thought you was clever
But you see your wicked tongue
Come on, can't twist forever, no, no

So listen y'all
At the end, oh, you got nowhere to run
Well, you shoulda gone and payed for what you done

You better ask yourself what have you done? (What have you done? Have you done?)
What have you done? (What have you done? Have you done?)
Have you shown any love? (What have you done? Have you done?)
As you travel around, brother (What have you done? Have you done?)
Have you showed any kindness? (What have you done? Have you done?)
Are you still around them on down the road (What have you done? Have you done?)
I'm not just talking to the brothers too(What have you done? Have you done?)
I'm talking about me and you (What have you done? Have you done?)
What have you done? (What have you done? Have you done?)
Call it no shame (What have you done? Have you done?)
Create another pain (What have you done? Have you done?)
You'd better take time to get it ride, yo (What have you done? Have you done?)
Time is running out, yes, you and me (What have you done? Have you done?)
