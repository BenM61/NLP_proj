Oh, who does she think she is?
I don't know

Do you reckon they're real?
Nah! too little

Hi girls!
Hi Louise!

Alright, How's it going?
Good, yeah, great

Oh, oh, twisted and deceitful
All those two faced people
Taking me for some kind of fool
Oh, oh, pretending to be so nice
Let me give you my advice
I don't need you, oh

Friends in disguise
Dressed up in lies
It's a knack that you're playing
Oh, oh, first you recognize me
Then you criticize me
What's going on?

Stop your bitching
'Cause you're so sad
Bitching behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the kerb because
I heard you're two faced
Trying to get in my face
Worked too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitching on me

Oh, oh, they're so narrow minded,
Truth is so one sided
They're just counterfeit
Oh, oh, hot and cold you're blowing,
Sheep in wolves clothing
Who are you trying to kid-id?

Two faced people are so shallow
Put your self in my place
Oh, oh, the fairy tells you're spinning
Sounding so convincing
But I'm at a loss so

Stop your bitching
'Cause you're so sad
Bitching behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the kerb because
I heard you're two faced
Trying to get in my face
Worked too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitching on me

Poison words are spoken
My faith in you is broken
But I'll make it on my own

Ow, ow, twisted and deceitful
All those two faced people
Taking me for some kind of fool
Ow, ow, they're so narrow minded,
Truth is so one sided,
But honey you rock (so)

Stop you're bitching
'Cause you're so sad
Bitching behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the kerb because
I heard you're two faced
Trying to get in my face
Worked too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitching on me

'Cause you're so sad
Bitching behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the ker because
I heard you're two faced
Trying to get in my face
Worked too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitching on me

Stop this hyprocrisy
You're crictising me
'Cause I don't want to be
With two faced people, yeah

She's probably talking about us behind our backs right now
Yeah she probably is, she's like that
Yeah she's two faced, (yeah, bitchy)
I'll never trust anything she says again

I can't believe you said that about me!

Believe it honey!
