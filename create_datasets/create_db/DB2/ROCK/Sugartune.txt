I wrote for you this sugartune
To help you through what you've gotta do
When you're on the ground, and keep fallin' down
Remember how I made this sound
Sound, sound, sound, sound 

When you're on your own, feeling all alone
Remember that you've always got a home
I'm outside, tryin' hard to hide
The fact that I'm scared to be by your side 

I know when everybody's got one
You want one too
I know when everybody's got one
You want one too 

I know when everybody's got one
You want one too
I know when everybody's got one
You want one too 

I wrote for you this sugartune
To help you through what you've gotta do
When you're on the ground, and keep fallin' down
Remember how I made this sound
Sound, sound, sound, sound
