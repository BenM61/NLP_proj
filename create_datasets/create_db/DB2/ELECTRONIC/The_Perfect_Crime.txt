You find your secret in me
You find yourself in this moment of truth
When the stranger wants again
Just a touch of this fascination
And with a might in your best intention
All your difference is breaking down
With our witness built of shame
Soul hiding in a term of game
You surrender this love like a child
With your innocence of pain
And you called it imagination
Hypnotized by your own reflection
It's a treat to make it right
Nothing ventured, no one blamed

Oh but it's the perfect crime
Temptation to the friend of mine
There's a point of no return
Oh but it's the perfect crime
Temptation to the friend of mine
There's a point of no return
I lose those ways

You might have known where to be sure
You find yourself in this moment of truth
Where the strangers standing there
You turn away from his invitation
And you bury your indecision
In the part of all these resistance
Satisfied with nothing more

Oh but it's the perfect crime
Temptation to the friend of mine
There's a point of no return
Oh but it's the perfect crime
Temptation to the friend of mine
There's a point of no return
I lose those ways
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
