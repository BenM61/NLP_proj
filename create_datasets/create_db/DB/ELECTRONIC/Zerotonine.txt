She was born fat to believe to be wed
Is a blessing with doubt without believe
Matrimony, so phony
Her up bringing real gloomy
Like a church mouth to his pouch
Before filling a duty
Counting out to all around
Left room shadow
When thoughts about pout
Outlays with sulk
In disgust she's filled with void
She said 

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Rings are gold and funds are mould
The story turns all to inconsistent, so bold
Now rise and unfold
All awhile I focus in the fiftieth mid
Wrapped to a person that could
Only be my dad
Mom's bliss's a chocolate but
Versus regret
She said, she said 

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

The girls next door
Slaves to explore
Gets more than she's looking for
Adventure k.o. no quid pro quo's
Gonna make her feel down and low
What a faint make up
(It's) Hard to keep the face up
Many partners come and go
Before she wakes up
Those who stay
Make it tempo-free
Made a wish she said
If you buy yesterday
Who's faster, faster each day
And I stay on her finest array
Then I heard her say
I heard her say

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Talked to the one who had no fun
From the day of their own prom
Hide behind quibbler lunch
Heard the one of great importance

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind
