When I feel like I'm about out of hell 
I feel my cage is shrinking 
I can see the light from a prison cell 
I can feel the world weeping 
Understand me 
Understand me 

Release - Acceleration 

When I feel like I'm about out of hell 
I can feel my cage shrinking 
I see the light in the cancer cell 
I can feel the world weeping 

Understand me 
Understand me 
White light inside of me 
Acceleration all around 

'Til it don't seem 
Like I'm moving at all 
'Til it don't seem 
Like I'm moving at all 

Got caught raping an angel 
Got caught stealing 
Fire from the sky 
Got caught raping an angel 

Caught, released and I cry 
Release - Acceleration 
Into the arm 
The feelings are 

Into the arm 
The feelings are 
Down
