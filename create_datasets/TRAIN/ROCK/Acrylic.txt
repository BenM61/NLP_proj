You're just like plasticine
Being molded into a libertine dreamer
I feel so sorry for you
If you were thirteen I'd let you off
But you're not and you should know better
Gather my thoughts on a notepad with a parker pen
And write you a letter but
There's not enough paper in the world
There's not enough paper oh have you heard all your friends go

Dadada dadada oh
All the words they seem to know
All the words in your songs go
Dadada dadada oh
You got an okay jacket
But you've got no spine
Please vacate this city of mine

I only wish you had the song
To back-up, you're what took you so long
But we know that's not the case rather show your face
In an ancient bar that nobody goes in
Because they serve substandard gin
Nobody goes in there did they win
Did you ask well no-one cares

Dadada dadada oh
All the words they seem to know
All the words in your sons go
Dadada dadada oh
You got an okay jacket
But you've got no spine
Please vacate this city of mine

You're just like plasticine
Being molded into a libertine dreamer
I feel so sorry for you
If you were thirteen I would let you off
But your not and you should know better
Gather my thoughts on a notepad with a parker pen
And write you a letter but
There's not enough paper in the world
There's not enough paper in oh have you heard your friends they go

Dadada dadada oh
Dadada dadada oh
Dadada dadada oh
Dadada dadada oh

You got an OK jacket but you've got no spine
Please vacate this city of mine
OK jacket, but you've got no spine
Please vacate this city of mine
