Wicked little doll, lovely to look at
Wicked little doll, lovely to hold
Wicked little doll, you are not human
Wicked little doll, you have no soul

Wicked little doll, I'm not your victim
Wicked little doll, you need me too
Wicked little doll, I'll be your partner
Wicked little doll, can I play too?

Wicked little doll, collapsing buildings
Wicked little doll, cities in flame
Wicked little doll, devil or angel?
Wicked little doll, they're both the same.

Wicked little doll, we're chained together
Wicked little doll, I'm just like you
Wicked little doll, it's human nature
Wicked little doll, you love me too

Way-oh way-oh way-oh, we're one big happy family
Way-oh way-oh way-oh, so take me with you
Way-oh, way-oh way-oh, I love my wicked dolly
I surrender

Wicked little doll, your perfect body
Anyone can see, you're never wrong
There's a little world, we're takin' over
There's a little doll in everyone

Make a little love, some parts are missing
Any little song the hurts will do
Wicked little doll, you speak my language
I will always be in love with you
