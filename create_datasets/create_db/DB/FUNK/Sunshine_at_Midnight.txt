It's getting kind of heavy, yeah, yeah
It's getting kind of heavy

See, I was raised in a good home with morals and all
Got my degree, made mama proud, and worked really hard

You can say that it's wrong but it won't change my mind
Thug and all, I'm with you, so tell me what you wanna do, baby
I believe in you and that's the truth, and I don't care what anybody thinks 
'Cause I love...

(Love this man, and I can't stop)
He's like a force of nature (nature) 
I don't know, but I need you, baby 
(In love and with a thug, and proud of it)
He's like a force of nature (nature)
(Keep me from him, no, no)
