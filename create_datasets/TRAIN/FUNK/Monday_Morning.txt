Have you heard the news today
I'm leaving town
I'm cashing out
This towns to small for me to stay
The time is now
I'm heading out

Baby I still need ya
But if you stay i'll leave ya
Cause I gotta get away
And if I ever see ya
My heart is gonna bleed
But i'm leaving either way

My darling baby
This is a warning
Said that I'm leaving
On Monday morning
You'll get no answer
No use in calling, me
Cause i'm leaving on Monday morning

This flower needs somewhere to go
No room to grow
All these dusty roads
I got two tickets and a dream
8:15 i'll save you a seat

Baby I still need ya
But if you stay ill leave ya
Cause I gotta get away
And if I ever see ya
My heart is gonna bleed
But I'm leaving either way

My darling baby
This is a warning
Said that i'm leaving
On Monday morning
You'll get no answer
No use in calling, me
Cause I'm leaving on Monday morning

Monday morning
Monday morning
Monday morning (not on Tuesday baby)
Monday morning

Baby I still need ya
But if you stay ill leave ya
Cause I gotta get away
And if I ever see ya
My heart is gonna bleed
But I'm leaving either way

My darling baby
This is a warning
Said that I'm leaving
On Monday morning
You'll get no answer
No use in calling, me
Cause I'm leaving on Monday morning

Monday morning
Monday morning (this is your warning)

On Monday morning
