Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whooa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa (oww)
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

And I believe it don't affect
Nobody else but me
Ya'll been telling me what to do
Since I was old enough to walk
Old enough to talk
Never let me speak or move
Do my own thang
But now I'm growin' wiser now
Brighter now
A little bit tighter now
Now ya'll can't hold me down
I know you hate to hear
But things have changed in

My life
It's been a while but
Me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they
Momma tryna do it
My life
I've done that been through that
So there ain't nothin
That you can tell me
My life
On a good night if I feel like
Me and my girls hit the club and tell
It's my life
It's my life
And I believe that it don't effect
Nobody else but me me me me

Being sick and tired of folks
Who wanna come around
Claim they gon get down
But all they wanna do is
See me make a wrong move (yeah)
I don't care what you hear in the news
To see who I choose to do the late night creep wit
I'm gonna do just what I wanna do
It's my life

My life
It's been a while but
Me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they
Momma tryna do it
My life
I've done that been through that
So there ain't nothin

On a good night if I feel like
Me and my girls hit the club and tell
It's my life

Whoa whoa whoa

Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
And I believe that it don't effect nobody else but me

Sometimes I might get a little crazy
And sometimes I might seem
Out of hand but I'm sayin
Life's too short for me to let you dictate
What I say and the moves I make
Sick of people tryna tell me what to do
It's my life and I'ma live it like I want to

Check it
Another day another dolla
Is the reality of my mentality
Otherwise don't even botha
You see my father was a wise old man
Always creatin the plan
For me to conquer this land
He said I am what I am
So be the best that I can
And if them others don't like it
Then why should I give a damn (huh)
Maybe so cause when his life wasn't right
My mother picked up them pieces
And continued on with the fight
So now it's plain to me
It ain't no game to me
See mom and dad corrected math
1 and 1 equal 3
4 and 5 I count my sister and brother
Stay alive till we die
And don't you ever be worried
Cuz I'm down with a ride
Through peaks and valleys to Cresent Hills
Tumble down I'll set a new ground for Jack and Jill
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes
Take a look and you'll find a sunshine

My life my life my life

My life
It's been a while but
Me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they
Momma tryna do it
My life
I've done that been through that
So there ain't nothin
That you can tell me
My life
On a good night if I feel like
Me and my girls hit the club and tell
It's my life
It's my life
And I believe that it don't effect
Nobody else but me me me me
