Couple more minutes
Couple more hours
This conversation
Tell me your secrets
Tell me your powers
Can we be patient?

It's getting late 
But what does it matter?
We can just lay here
We can just stay here

I know that there's doubts 
Do they run through your mind?
Then why don't we put 'em to bed tonight?
I fall into your honesty

So we 
Talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Tell me how you're happy 
Tell me why you're afraid
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Now we got each other, hope it's always this way
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east

The curtains don't open until the evening 
Never time wasted
Sunlight can wait when it's you I'm facing
Can we be safe here?
Gone are the days when I can be vacant
Now that we've made it
Let us be sacred

Just let go of insecurity
You'll never know
You're always more to me
I fall into your honesty

So we 
Can talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Now we got each other
Hope it's always this way
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east

'Cause we talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Tell me how you're happy
Tell me why you're afraid
We can build our trust beneath the sheets (sheets)
Talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Now we got each other, hope it's always this way
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east
Talk until the sunrise in the east
