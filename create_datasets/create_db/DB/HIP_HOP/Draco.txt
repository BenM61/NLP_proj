You better not raise your voice at me
You know I got a pimp degree

Pluto

Draco season with the bookbag
Rat tat, got a little kick back
Hundreds on hundreds got a good batch
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back

Lamborgini doors but I never stop
F*ck around got a nigga pissed off
Nice little thot got stiff arm
Did the Heisman on the hoe got the stiff arm

F*ck up that body like Tyson or Holyfield wo wo wo wo wo
A couple of pills and I got my soda filled wo wo wo wo wo

Break out a sweat I go head over heels for these meals wo wo wo wo wo wo
She thinks she the one but to me she ain't nothing but a thrill wo wo wo wo wo

I've been drippin like a god with her
I been dodging all the fly what else
I been fillin up garages what else
I gave her a French menage what else

Close your eyes eyes eyes
I'm about to slide slide slide
Wonder why why why
I stay in the sky sky sky

Pink molly let me dance with her
Freestylin let me dance with her

Sky Dweller it was sentimental
Rose gold it was sentimental

Draco season with the bookbag
Rat tat, got a little kick back
Hundreds on hundreds got a good batch
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back

F*ck up my bitch by the change
Brought me from trap house to stage
I wanna jump in the air
You know the love ain't fair

You killin then show us the proof
I already got the juice
Chain different colors like fruits
I like to hang out the roof

I got to train my bitches
I'm putting chains on my bitches
I'll put some chain on some snitches
I'm focused im back on my mission

Flex on a nigga no apologies
Matter how white done gotta me
Playing hockey with the ice in the major league
Thirty five bitches at the Saint Reg

Fall back shooter like KD
Back in the kitchen with the curry
Pourin' up zan can't hurt me
Pineapple drink lookin' syruppy

Fifty six night I was 30
Stirofoam cups and patient
Heard you been talkin' bout the kid
Knowing damn well that's a flagrant

I cancel two bitches
I got me some new bitches
Come check out how I'm living
I got me some new drippin'
I got me some new dripp
Ain't got nothing to do with it
I'll give my bitch to you
If that what she mean to you

Yeah I cruising in the deep
I'm twisted up I got geek
Misbehaving with ya freak
Can't tell she got teeth

I was in her mouth like veneers
Start comparing my career
'Cause I was flooding through the crib
Business furniture for real

I bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mill for the gig
Middle fingers up f*ck the pig
Diamonds fallin' off my let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga hot to six

Who was rapping diamonds in the zone
I was chargin 10 for the strong
Keep on goin in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born
