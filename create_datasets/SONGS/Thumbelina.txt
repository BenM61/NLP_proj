Thumbelina, Thumbelina tiny little thing
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing
Thumbelina what's the difference if you're very small?
When your heart is full of love you're nine feet tall

Though you're no bigger than my thumb
Than my thumb, than my thumb
Sweet Thumbelina don't be glum
Now now now, ah ah ah, come come come

Thumbelina, Thumbelina tiny little thing
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing
Thumbelina what's the difference if you're very small?
When your heart is full of love you're nine feet tall

Though you're no bigger than my toe
Than my toe, than my toe
Sweet Thumbelina keep that glow
And you'll grow and you'll grow and you'll grow

Thumbelina, Thumbelina tiny little thing
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing
Thumbelina what's the difference if you're very small?
When your heart is full of love you're nine feet tall
