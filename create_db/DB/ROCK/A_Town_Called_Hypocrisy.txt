Can you take this broken boy
And put the pieces back as one?
Though he has all of his toys
He is never having fun

Because its not enough
Now we're growing up
We had given up
We're moving on

Because its not enough
We were growing up
We had given up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who'd you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me
To a town called hypocrisy

Save your sympathy
Who'd you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me
To a town called hypocrisy

A town called hypocrisy

Can you take this lonely girl
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And pick her up from off the ground?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cause there's no pride to be found
When you follow sheep around
And no future here
No future for us in this town

Because its not enough
Now we're growing up
We had given up
We're moving on

Because its not enough
We were growing up
We had given up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who'd you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me
To a town called hypocrisy

Save your sympathy
Who'd you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me
To a town called hypocrisy

La, la, la, la la la la la la la
La, la, la, la la la la la la la
La, la, la, la la la la la la la
La, la, la, la la la la la la la

Because its not enough
Now we're growing up
We had given up
We're moving on

Because its not enough
We were growing up
We had given up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who'd you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me
To a town called hypocrisy

Save your sympathy
Who'd you think you're fooling
Everything is dead
Now you welcome me
To a town called hypocrisy
