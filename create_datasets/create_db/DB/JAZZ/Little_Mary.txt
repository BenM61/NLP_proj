Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
You got me reeling and rocking, don't know what to do, what do do

I want you, I need you, you got me spinning like a top
I want you, I need you, you got me spinning like a top
If you don't love me I believe my heart will stop, it will stop

I'm crying, the sun is shining, but it's raining in my heart
I'm crying, the sun is shining, but it's raining in my heart
You got me reeling and rocking, since we've been apart, been apart

Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
Little Mary, my baby, don't you hear me calling you
You got me reeling and rocking, don't know what to do, what do do
