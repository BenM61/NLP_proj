Saying goodbye to friends
Saying goodbye to loneliness.
I am on my way to Rio
The place where I want to be.
You know that I soon will leave
So don't try to make me stay.
I'm on my way to Rio
I'm coming back some day.
Don't you ask me why
Got to live a little longer

Don't you start to cry
Got to be a little stronger.
Don't you ask me why
Got to live a little longer...

Rio de Janeiro - Rio

Land of sun
Samba and wine -
Rio de Janeiro - Rio
I feel fine.
Do you believe in love? Do you believe in happyness?
Come with me to Rio
The place where I want to be.
Dancing the night away
No time for tears and sorrow.
I'm going there tomorrow
I'm coming back someday.
Don't you ask me why
Got to live a little longer...

Rio de Janeiro - Rio...
Rio de Janeiro - Rio...
