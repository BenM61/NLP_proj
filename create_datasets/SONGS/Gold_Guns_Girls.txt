All the gold and the guns in the world (couldn't get you off)
All the gold and the guns and the girls (couldn't get you off)
All the boys, all the choices in the world

I remember when we we're gambling to win
Everybody else said better luck next time
I don't wanna bend, let the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough

All the lace and the skin in the shop (couldn't get you off)
All the toys and the tools in the box (couldn't get you off)
All the noise, all the voices never stop

I remember when we we're gambling to win
Everybody else said better luck next time
I don't wanna bend, let the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Why you giving me a hard time? 
I remember when we we're gambling to win
Everybody else said

Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough

More and more, more and more, more and more 
More and more, more and more, more and more and more and more
More and more, more and more, more and more, more and more and 
More and more, more and more, more and more and more and more

Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
Is it ever gonna be enough
