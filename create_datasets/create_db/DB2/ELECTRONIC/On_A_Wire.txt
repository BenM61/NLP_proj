I am waiting for the clouds to divide 
I am willing my subconscious to pay up
I must admit that I am passing it on
I never thought that I would have to give up

I am sharing knowledge that I cannot explain
Feel forced to express my intent
It's not my fault that you're not listening
I'm coming through clear across the long descent

Out on a limb, on a wire, by a thread you collide
Out on a limb, on a wire, by a thread you collide
Through your eye
With your mind and your soul

I must measure miles, distance and time
All solid form and light reflecting shape
Despite the trip this is bending my mind
I need to find a route of escape

Those savage nights bring relief in the dawn
All subtleties are lost on you
There are links missing in this chain
Are you falling for the broken man again?

Out on a limb, on a wire, by a thread you collide
Out on a limb, on a wire, by a thread you collide
Through your eye
With your mind and your soul
