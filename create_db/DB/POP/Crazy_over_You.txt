Can't you tell, by the spell that I'm under
This fella's wonderin' if you'll let me get next to you
Is there a chance of gettin' through
Well you never seem to notice me, no matter what I do
And everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you

Does it show, there's no cure for your kissin'
Doctor says this is the last thing I'll ever do
My heart will break right in two
Well you never seem to notice me, no matter what I do
And everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you

Everybody knows that I've been after you girl
Come on sweet baby let's give it a whirl
Give it up darlin' I'll make you all mine
And we can be together lovin' all the time

Can't you tell, by the spell that I'm under
This fella's wonderin' if you'll let me get next to you
Is there a chance of gettin' through
Well you never seem to notice me, no matter what I do
And everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you
You turn your pretty head away, I'm acting like a fool
And everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you
Crazy over you
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
