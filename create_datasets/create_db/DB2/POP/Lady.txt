Lady, you bring me up when I'm down,
Maybe you're gonna change my life around.

You came to me when I was lonely and no one cared.
You made me see that I was only, just runnin' scared.
I saw your face and somethin' told me, you were the one.
You smiled at me and now I see: My life's begun.

Lady, (pretty lady) you bring me up when I'm down,
Up when I'm down
(Maybe you're gonna change my life around) 
Gonna change my life around
Lady, you brought me in from out the rain, yeah
Maybe my life will never be the same.

Once I was filled with desperation, a solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration, like only true love can.
Now I believe in what you're sayin', I'm ten feet tall.
This love don't need no explainin', we've got it all.

(Lady, you bring me up when I'm down)
Up when I'm down
Maybe (Maybe you're gonna change my life around)

Oh lady, you bring me up when I'm down,

(Maybe yeah you're gonna change my life around) 
Gonna change my life around
Lady, pretty lady you brought me in from out the rain
Maybe my life will never be the same
It'll never be the same
