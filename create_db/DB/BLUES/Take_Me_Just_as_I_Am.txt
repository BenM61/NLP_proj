Some folks think I'm a millionaire
But they don't really know
All the bills, the burdens
And problems I bear

But only you alone
You're the one that's
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.
Given me the courage and
Strength to go on and on
And for you, I sing this song

My pockets ain't filled with money
The old car I drive runs funny
And I don't have much to offer
A sweet fine girl like you

But here's my heart, please take it
You see, I need your love
If I'm gonna make it

Come on, take me
Oh, darling, take me
Take me, take me as I am
Just as I am

Now listen to this
Wilson Pickett found himself
Someone to love, Joe Tex did too
And Otis Redding said
I've tried and I've tried
He found someone to love

But I believe there's different
Strokes for different folks
And if you give your woman
What she wants when she wants it
How she wants it, where she wants it
And every time you think she wants it
You won't ever have to
Worry about anything

And that's why, darling, to you
I can stretch out my arms
Baby, I'm yours and yours alone

(Take me) take me, take me
(Take me) right now, right now
Just as I am, you got it, baby
I'm all yours, come on

Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Everybody, clap your hands one time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) feel alright

Oh. my, my, my, my, my
Makes you wanna moan a little bit
