We go down to the indie disco every Thursday night
Dance to our favourite indie hits until the morning light
At the indie disco, the indie disco
At the indie disco, yeah

We've got a table in the corner that is always ours
Next to the poster of Morrissey with a bunch of flowers
We drink and talk 'bout stupid stuff
Then hit the floor for Tainted Love
You know I just can't get enough
Of the indie disco, the indie disco
At the indie disco, yeah

Give us some Pixies and some Roses and some Valentines
Give us some Blur and some Cure and some Wannadies
And now we're moving to the beat
And staring at each others feet
I wonder if she fancies me
At the indie disco, the indie disco
At the indie disco, yeah

And when it's over and I'm freezing on the night-bus home
I think of her and I sing the words to my favourite song (Oh Yeah)
She makes my heart beat the same way
As at the start of Blue Monday
Always the last song that they play
At the indie disco, the indie disco
At the indie disco, yeah
