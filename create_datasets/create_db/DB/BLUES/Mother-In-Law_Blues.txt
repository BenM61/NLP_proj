It was early in the mornin'
I heard a rooster crow for days
It was early in the mornin'
I heard a rooster crow for days
I looked out my window
And saw my baby walk away

I thought, "Lord, please stop him
Ain't gonna get drunk no more"
I thought, "Lord, please stop him
Ain't gonna get drunk no more"
I hollered out my window
"Come back baby please don't go"

I know he heard me callin'
He looked back and waved his hand
I know he heard me callin'
He looked back and waved his hand
I could hear him tell his momma
"That's one no good woman"

Well, I watched my baby leave
His momma had him by the hand
Well, I watched my baby leave
His momma had him by the hand
I'd give anything I have
Just to see my man again
