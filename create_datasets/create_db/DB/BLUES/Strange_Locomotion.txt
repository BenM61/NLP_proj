Oh yes, now

Strange locomotion
Over the ocean, baby
You can't find no better place
Strange locomotion

If you got the notion, baby
Get on over the ocean
Take yourself a big fat plane
Get some strange locomotion

Oh well, up and down, way off the ground
Strange, strange, strange locomotion
Up and down, way off the ground
Strange, strange, strange locomotion

Way over the ocean, baby
We've left the land and sea
Got some strange locomotion
Oh oh, alright now

Oh well, up and down, round and round
Strange, strange, strange locomotion
Up and down, way off the ground
Strange, strange, strange locomotion

Over the ocean, baby
We found new land, new sea
Strange locomotion

I've got a notion, baby
Take some strange locomotion, baby
It'll be just for you and me
Take some strange locomotion, alright

Strange locomotion, baby
Strange locomotion, baby
Strange locomotion, baby
Strange locomotion, baby

Strange locomotion, baby
Strange locomotion, baby
Strange locomotion, baby
