Tuck me in
I need to sleep now
I need dream how
I used to dream 

Look me in
Look me in the face now
Help me believe how
I used to believe

Now do you see how
They're in the margins
Below and up above
I'll see now
How life wins
When all that's left is love

Rope me in
Lasso my heart, love
Loosen my soul, love
Spirits and dreams

Hope begins
Right at the start of
The search for the gold, love
In the driving rain

Now do you see how
We're in the margins
We're below and up above
I see now
How life wins
When we're all that's left is love

We're all that's left
Of love
We're all that's left
Of love

Tuck me in
I need to sleep now
I need dream how
I used to dream

Look me in
Look me in the face now
Help me believe how
I used to believe

Now do you see how
They're in the margins
Below and up above
I see now
How life wins
When all that's left is love

All that's left is love
All that's left of love
