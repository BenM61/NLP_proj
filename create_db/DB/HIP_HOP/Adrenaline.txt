[Chorus] 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain, 'gain 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain, 'gain 
Yo, adrenaline 

Yo, I'm in the eye of the storm where the pressure's on 
And MC's are dressed funny like a leprechaun 
I chop rappers like chicken suizceiun 
Send a squad off like a slave auction 
Yo my zodiac sign read caution 
On stage, I'll make your seed to an orphan 
Yo, my agent have to break equation 
Niggas want some? I hit 'em with a portion 
Son of fifth foursome, armed at the door, son 
In milita, Dice Raw quick draw, son 
You don't want no more son? That's when more come 
And drag a nigga Eerie avenue to Oregon, you're all done 
Ladies and Gentlemen, select a weapon at the gate 
Upon enterting The Roots' instruemtalin' 
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit 
We hit 'em like The L on 60th and Market 
South Philly click will hold it til a nigga park it 
Take sneaks, chains and rings and braclets 
Split back, just like we the therapist 
Adrenaline, fifth mic terrorist 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

Nigga, nigga, niggas tryin' to get a grip 
Bu still slip, so lift me up 
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt 
You get to know me, you'll poke me slowly 
When caught fussin' 
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't 
Punked 'em with the dozen 
The pellets all in they skellet 
Transform from the norm, start the brainstorm 
Yeah, Malik be	 from The Roots, he ain't gone 
I took the wrong exit, the sings to lay on 
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls 
Shouts to armour and ??? whose name Jahlil 
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand in 
Demandin', taking you back like Knots Landing 
And Ralph Cramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton 
Yo, what what what what what what the...? 
I get wicked on this concrete earth until I rot 
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet 
But still I rock once again 

[Chorus] 

Beans passed the mac and we held 'em, like hostages 
Rappers see me hide they face, like ostriches 
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages 
Under water rap, you know who the bosses is 
North Philly, baby, that's where that raw shit is 
You get blown out the sky once you get talkin' it 
Hey, take the vibe raw, I fathered it 
And when you see me on the street don't bother kid 
Just be on your merry way or you might get slit 
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did 
Lay you on floors like you gettin' carpeted 
You need a special kind of mic, for retarded kids 
Me against you's like Kang vs. The Partridges 
Want to battle? change your name to the forfeiters 
Cause that's what you do, faced to face with raw niggas 
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

They used to talk shit, but I'm a quiet 'em 
Kick in the door with my boys, stick to fryin' 'em 
First nigga that flinch, I'm a fire him 
Tape him up, grip his hands, and plyer them 
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em? 
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in 
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em 
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him 
Paid a front row seats, watchin' Iverson 
First class air crash when I'm flyin' in 
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them 
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them 
Used to shotgun in cars that I'm drivin' 'em 
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' 'em 
Run all up in yo' spot with Rob and 'em 
Grew up, two-four, with Pry and 'em 
But do my dirt, twenty first, with Kyle and them 
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them 
Brother knews, nigga schooled Marly Park and them 
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em 
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them 
Tore their body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em 
To sharp for them, move out in the dark on 'em 
These Illadel' foul streets when I'm stompin' 'em 

[Chorus]
