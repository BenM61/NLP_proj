Please don't break me
Please don't let me fall
Please don't break me 
And leave me nothing at all

'Cause this was my one last chance to breathe
This is my one last chance to breathe 
This is my one last chance to breathe
This is my one last chance, my one last chance to breathe

Please don't break me 
And leave me nothing at all

'Cause this is my one last chance to breathe (to breathe)
This is my one last chance to breathe (ah)
This is my one last chance to breathe (to breathe)
This is my one last chance, my one last chance to breathe
