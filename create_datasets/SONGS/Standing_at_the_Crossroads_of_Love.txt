I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Standing at the crossroads
I'm standing at the crossroads of love

Don't know which way to go
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't know which way to turn
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Though the love I give is not returned,
For that boy, my heart still yearns

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Standing at the crossroads
'Cause when I'm with him
He mistreats me

Runs around and causes me misery
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But I love him, I can't deny
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And without him, I'd surely die
It hurts to be with him
And it hurts to be without him

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Standing at the crossroads
Just standing at the crossroads of love
Don't know which way,
Don't know which way to go,
Don't know which way,
Don't know which way to turn
Oh!

There's always tears on my pillow
Tears, tears, tears
'Cause I'm always in the middle of,
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Heartache and emotion,
Heartbreak and devotion,
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Love and caring,
When it's despairing
Trying to be true,
Though it makes me blue

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Standing at the crossroads
I'm just standing at the crossroads of love
Standing at the crossroads
Don't know which way to go,
Standing at the crossroads
Don't know which way to turn,
Standing at the crossroads
I'm standing at the crossroads
Standing at the crossroads
Which way should I go?
Standing at the crossroads

He runs around and causes me misery
