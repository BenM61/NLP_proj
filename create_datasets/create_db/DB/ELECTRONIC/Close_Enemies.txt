There's light at the end of the tunnel 
There's fight at the heart of a struggle 
You're smile should've told me you're trouble 
No more, no more, no more 
You owned me You buried all my worth with a shovel 
You're smile should've told me you're trouble 
No more, no more, no more 

No more goodbyes
So so long
So so long
So so long
Now 
No more white lies 
You used to be the one true thing in my world 
You told me that you loved me 
You're in love with yourself 
Shoulda listen to my mother 
You messed around the others 
Now you're dead to me 
I've been sleeping with the enemy 
Should keep your best friends close by 
Should keep your best friends close by 
You should keep your best friends close by 
But keep your enemies closer 
But keep your enemies closer 

So many evil talents you juggled 
It's fair to say you didn't act subtle 
Your smile should've told me you're trouble 
No more, no more, no more 
Came crashing down I'm staring at rubble 
They need to send you into space in a shuttle 
Your smile should've told me you're trouble 
No more, no more, no more 

No more goodbyes
So so long
So so long
So so long
Now 
No more white lies 
You used to be the one true thing in my world 
You told me that you loved me 
You're in love with yourself 
Shoulda listen to my mother 
You messed around the others 
Now you're dead to me 
I've been sleeping with the enemy 
Should keep your best friends close by 
Should keep your best friends close by 
You should keep your best friends close by 
But keep your enemies closer 
But keep your enemies closer 

Strange and deranged 
Seek fame was the name of the game 
Defeat rivals Abel and Kane 
Get trophies they'll look great in a frame 
What would you have done, take all the blame? 
With your hands held firm over naked flames 
Being grilled now you're shaking again 
Faking the pain, dark visions of Satan 
Contemplating, talking man to man 
She was a girl on film Duran Duran 
She called me her ape man orang-utan 
Me Tarzan, she Jane 
Take all the blame I'm the bloke in the chorus 
We were sweet once everybody saw us 
I ain't flawless still unsure 
I loved us but I loved me more 

You used to be the one true thing in my world 
You told me that you loved me 
You're in love with yourself 
Shoulda listen to my mother 
You messed around the others 
Now you're dead to me 
I've been sleeping with the enemy 
Should keep your best friends close by 
Should keep your best friends close by 
You should keep your best friends close by 
But keep your enemies closer 
But keep your enemies closer
