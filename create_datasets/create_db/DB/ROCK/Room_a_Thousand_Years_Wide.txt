Listen, hear he is inside
One who lives while others lie
I close my eyes and walk a thousand years
A thousand years that aren't mine, hey
It seems he's near me when I walk
One who loved what love denied
He lives these years that I walk blind
All these years can not be mine

Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Tomorrow begat tomorrow

A thousand doors a thousand lies
Rooms a thousand years wide
I walks in the cold sun and wind
All these years can not begin

Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Tomorrow

Tomorrow begat tomorrow

Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
