Forked tongues flicker in signification, my eardrums ringing again
Poised to strike, receptive eyes comply to shades of light

Gossip whores with retracting claws seek invasive social ties
Smiling face to masking disgrace deceit your way of life

Bleed the fifth
Face smashed fist
Bleed the fifth
Case dismissed

Oh

Fools abusing their silver spoons of a false entitlement
Spoiled seeds that feed from their knees, turn their nose up, toward the world

Bastardized by celebrity, it doesn't mean a fucking thing to me
Show respect, face me with common human decency

Bleed the fifth
Face smashed fist
Bleed the fifth
Case dismissed

Look into their eyes
They're serpents in disguise

It's time to face the sentence

Now I will make you fucking bleed the fifth
Face smashed fist
What is this session of voting consent?
Case dismissed

Oh

No, no, no, no, no
