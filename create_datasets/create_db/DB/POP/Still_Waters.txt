Still waters run deep.
Just remember when we lie to each other.
No one wins and losers weep.
Reflection will show
This connection, we can lean on each other,
This is all we need to know.

Now I admit I've been a fool sometimes.
I believe I may be losing you.
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed.
Under your spell and over my head.

You took me in your arms and you told me
We don't need to worry, but you,
You never say you're sorry.

Keep this love alive for us, it's all I feel.
How can we survive if we change what is real?

Still waters run deep,
Just remember when we lie to each other.
No one wins and losers weep.

Reflection will show
This connection, we can lean on each other,
This is all we need to know.

I see the angel and the devil in your heart.
I confess, either one is my addiction.
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight.
Out of the darkness and into the light.
But living in your arms, I can take it.
Please don't make me shiver.
I know together we deliver.

Let the gods decide
Who finds the sweetest thrill.
Who can justify the truth?
God, I love you still.

Still waters run deep.
Just remember when we lie to each other.
No one wins and losers weep (losers weep).

Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection (ah),
This is all we need.

Oooh
Don't let him get too close to you.
(you've got a stranger on your mind).
The dream is free.
I know I'm only human if I cry
(Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye).

Ah. Girl. I love you still.

Still waters run deep.
Just remember when we lie to each other (ah).
No one wins and losers weep (no one wins).

Deception will show (show)
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know.

(Still) Still waters run deep.
Just remember when we lie to each other.
No one wins and losers weep.

Reflection will show
This connection, we can lean on each other,
This is all we need to know.
