Dreams are real all you have to do is just believe

There is nothing that should ever take your heart away
From what it is you want to to do
You should always go with what you love
Don't follow no one else just do what's good for you, tell them

Dreams are real all you have to do is just believe

Sometimes people try to bring you down
They want to see you frown just keep your faith in you,
doesn't matter if they try to tell you that you'll
Never make it this is what you do, tell them

Dreams are real all you have to do is just believe

Tell them

Dreams are real all you have to do is just believe

Dreams are real all you have to do is just believe

Dreams are real all you have to do is just believe

Dreams are real all you have to do is just believe

I believe in myself and my dreams will come true.
