(Originally by The Business)

But for you where would they be
In a society claiming democracy
Nothing in the press or the radio
Only the fanzines that give em the go

So keep the faith
We'll break though one day
Keep the faith
Our music's here to stay

TV pundits total lies
All the people that we despise
Come on tour and you will see
Street music as it should be

So keep the faith
We'll break though one day
Keep the faith
Our music's here to stay

Radio stations chosen playlists
Say that it's just the way it is
They only have their financial say
From the profits punk will pay
