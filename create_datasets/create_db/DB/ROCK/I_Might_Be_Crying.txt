What didn't know back then
Was that I might be crying
It is such a simple sentiment
To steal the show
And what I didn't know back then
Is that I might be losing you
And still I wouldn't know

And now I suck up to the pale moonlight
Like it's gonna lead me home
And I shiver in my tired clothes
As if that could keep me warm
And now I stare across the dirty river
And I'm sure upon this bridge I'll see you
'Cause I dreamt I'd kiss you up there

What I didn't know back then
Is how great the sin
How time goes so slowly
When you're cheating on a friend
And what I didn't know back then
Is that I might be needing you

Yeah I might be needing you
The need it doesn't end
And now I stare across the dirty river
And I breathe the dirty air
And I'm sure upon the bridge I'll see you
'Cause I dreamt I'd kiss you there

What I didn't know back then
Was that I might be crying
It's such a simple sentiment
To steal the show
