As life goes on
You learn to hold on
You learn to appreciate 
The finer things in life, the finest

If I had a chance
I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real

My friends say I'm lucky
To have someone as good as you
My love's understanding
Understanding how to hold on to you

After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know (finest I ever)

If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I want to be in love
But with nobody else, uh

Time flies when you're with me
Goes so slow whenever you're away
Make up my mind and I'm positive (a better love)
A better love will never come my way

After all that we've been through (mm, hm)
Time won't change the way I feel about you (mm, mm)
Out of all the loves before (mm, hm, hm)
You're the finest I'll ever know (finest I ever)

After all that we've been through (that we've been through)
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know (finest I ever)

Know (know)
You keep me in love (you keep me in love)
I'm lost (you're lost)
Just call me, I'll come (just call me and I'll come)

No other love before (no other love)
Could do what you do (could do what you do)
A little so much (oh)
So much more from you (much more)
No one else will do (no one else will do)
There's no substitute
Your love's the finest love I've ever know, oh, oh, oh.

Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me

Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me

Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me (oh)

After all (oh) that we've been through (that we've been through)
Time won't change (change) the way I feel about you (no, no, no, no)
Out of all (hm) the loves before (the finest love)
You're the finest (uh huh) I'll ever know (finest I ever)

After all (oh) that we've been through (that we've been through)
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before (out of all the loves I had before)
You're the finest (yes, you are) I'll ever know (finest I ever)

Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest one for me

Oh, baby, you're the finest
The finest I've seen
Oh, baby, you're the finest
