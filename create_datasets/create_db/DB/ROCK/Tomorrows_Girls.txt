Well I got a little girl, she only lives down the street
And she's got a little something, it's gonna knock you off your feet.
Well I said I wanna buy some and she told me that I could,
Said first you better try some, 'cos it may not do you good.

Well I feel a lot better than I did before.
A whole lot better when I'm out on the floor.
Feel so good, I don't know when,
Look out girl, here it comes again.

Well Tomorrow's Girl, she ain't pre-programmed,
'Cause you took a liberation that she won't understand
And she ain't preconditioned, like some android slave.
Well Tomorrow's Girl, there's a sign for change

Well I feel a lot better than I did before.
A whole lot better when I'm out on the floor.
Feel so good, I don't know when,
Look out girl, here it comes again.

Well Tomorrow's Girl, she ain't no factory girl
And she don't wanna live in a nine to five world.
You're out there slaving on your factory floor,
Well Tomorrow's Girl, she wants a lot more.

Well I feel a lot better than I did before.
A whole lot better when I'm out on the floor.
Feel so good, I don't know when,
Look out girl, here it comes again.
