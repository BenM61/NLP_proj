All simple monkeys with alien babies 
Amphetamines for boys 
And crucifixes for ladies 
Sampled and soulless 
Worldwide and real webbed 
You sell all the living 
For more safer dead 

Anything to belong
Anything to belong

Rock is deader than dead 
Shock is all in your head 
Your sex and your dope is all that were fed 
So f*ck all your protests and put them to bed 

God is on the T.V. 

Rock! Lalalalala
Rock! Lalalalala
Rock! Lalalalala
Rock! Lalalalala

A thousand mothers are praying for it 
We're so full of hope 
And so full of shit 
Build a new god to medicate and to ape 
Sell us ersatz dressed up and real fake 

Anything to belong
Anything to belong

Rock is deader than dead 
Shock is all in your head 
Your sex and your dope is all that were fed 
So f*ck all your protests and put them to bed 

God is on the T.V. 

Rock! Lalalalala
Rock! Lalalalala
Rock! Lalalalala
Rock! Lalalalala

Rock is deader than dead 
Shock is all in your head 
Your sex and your dope is all that were fed 
So f*ck all your protests and put them to bed
So f*ck all your protests and put them to bed
