Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray my soul to take

Come on in
Come on in
Take me home tonight

Now in perfect peace I rest, now I lay me down to sleep
In full salvation blest, I pray my soul to keep
For thy grace that keeps me still, if I die before I wake
Safe from every ill, I pray my soul to take

Come on in
Come on in
Take me home tonight

Now in perfect peace I rest, now I lay me down to sleep
In full salvation blest, I pray my soul to keep
For thy grace that keeps me still, if I die before I wake
Safe from every ill, I pray my soul to take
