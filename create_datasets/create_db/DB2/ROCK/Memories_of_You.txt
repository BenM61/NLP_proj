Waking skies
At Sunrise,
Ev'ry sunset too,
Seems to be
Bringing me
Memories of you.

Here and there,
Ev'rywhere,
Scenes that we once knew,
And they all
Just recall
Memories of you.

How I wish I could forget
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears.

Your face beams
In my dreams,
Spite of all I do!
Ev'rything
Seems to bring
Memories of you.

How I wish I could forget
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears.

Your face beams
In my dreams,
Spite of all I do!
Ev'rything
Seems to bring
Memories,
All those memories of you.
