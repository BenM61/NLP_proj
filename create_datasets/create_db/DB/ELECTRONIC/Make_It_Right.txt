Someday we're gonna make it right
Someday we're gonna win this fight
Someday we're gonna make it right'
Someday we're gonna win this fight

Broken are their little wings
Fallen from above
What am I supposed to think
I don't think I know enough
Hurry don't be late today
Not for what is lost
Hurry don't delay a thing
You've almost got a lot

Ooh I know you'll be coming 'round
With fire in your eyes

Yeah we're gonna make it right
We're gonna win this fight
And I don't know why
It took me oh so long to get here
We're gonna make it right
We're gonna win this fight
And I don't know why
It took me oh so long to get here

Broken are the little strings
They can't hold you up
Waiting on your patron saint
I don't think he'll be enough
Hurry don't be late today
You know what you've done
Hurry don't delay a thing
Look what you have won

Ooh I know you'll be coming 'round
With fire in your eyes

Yeah we're gonna make it right
Someday we're gonna win this fight
And I don't know why
It took me oh so long to get here
Yeah we're gonna make it right
Someday we're gonna win this fight
Yeah and I don't know why
It took me oh so long to get here

Ooh I know you'll be coming 'round
With fire
With fire in your eyes

We're gonna make it right
Someday we're gonna win this fight
And I don't know why
It took me oh so long to get here
Yeah we're gonna make it right
Someday we're gonna win this fight
Yeah and I don't know why
It took me oh so long to get here

Yeah we're gonna make it right
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Yeah we're gonna make it right
And I don't know why
It took me oh so long to get here
