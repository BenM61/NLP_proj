Under the weather
I never got better
Wrapped up in my disease
Mile away, she want to count my day
Look a little older in the light

Under the weather
Feelin' very heavy
Never up for no air

Sea legs start to wigglin'
And sick I'm still feelin'
Just know I never cared

Don't you want to feel it
Don't you want to stare it cold
Don't you want to feel it
Don't you want to stare it cold

Never thought about it
And never no questions
Seein' where I've gone wrong

No kiss made it magic
'Cause that old girl has had it
Then it's time for me to run along
