Seven in the morning
When they wake, you gotta be ghost
Let me tell you one thing
I'm about to overflow
Boy, you don't know my bed
Well tonight you might find out
Open up my window
Once you're in, there's no way out

I'm a river
And this river's slowing down
Know where you'll wind up
Cross my water 'til you drown
I feel it, baby
Tell me what so I know how
I've been up, baby

So you can take me apart

Waited up all night
Take me apart
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

Afraid of falling knowing that I could never live without
Try to tell you one thing
And then you just read my mind
Where are you going, baby, without kissing me goodbye?
Try to fight it, baby
And now we're going back

My river's slowing down
Know where you'll wind up
Cross my water 'til you drown
I feel it, baby (I feel it, baby)
Tell me what so I know how
I've been up, baby

You better take me apart 
Take me apart (take me apart)
'Cause I'm waited 
Take me apart
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

Now I can't keep my head up
'Cause we're talking later tonight
Started a song then I gave up
So I hope this comes out right
Don't say you're in love, baby
Don't say you're in love, baby
Don't say you're in love until you learn to take me apart

I wait up all night (I wait up all night)
Take me apart (I wait up all night)
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

Take me apart
I wait up all night

Take me apart (I wait up)
I wait up all night
