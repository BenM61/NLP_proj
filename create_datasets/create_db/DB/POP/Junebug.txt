Junebug, I remember everything
The blue carpeted floors, the tall wooden doors 
I held you in my arms
Junebug, I'd burn down a picture of a house 
Say it was ours, when we didn't need it anymore 
And that was when I loved you best
We were kids then
We shouldn't think about the rest

You'd put the moon in a basket on your bike front by the coast
The way your fixed it up, in pale grief you were a ghost
You liked to play with darkness, all the universe could give
I was the home you once tried to escape, the dark in which you lived

Soon they'd find you laying there on several different homes
They'd find you laying on their porches, did you need to use the phone? 
And lure you into their rooms
That was the last I heard of June
And that was the love I could not allow

You were beautiful then, you're just a coke jaw now

I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything
Oh

You were beautiful then, I'm still in too deep
