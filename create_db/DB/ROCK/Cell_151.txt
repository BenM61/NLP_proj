My lucky number is on a prison door 
And it's found on everything I wear 

And I've got to get away 
From 151 
Cell 151 

Sharing with me is a man who shot his wife 
And I'm afraid to fall asleep at night 

And I've got to get away 
From 151 
Cell 151 

And it makes me sad 
Thinking about the past feeling bad 
I know I've been blind 
All I need's a space to unwind 

But I can't stay 
In 151 
Cell 151 

Hear me when I cry 
I can't see the sky 
Too much time 
I left the world behind 

And I've got to get away 
From 151 
Cell 151 

And it makes me sad 
Thinking about the past feeling bad 
I know I've been blind 
Now all I need's a space to unwind 

But I can't stay 
In 151 

151 - I gotta get away from 151 
151 - Ooh yeah 
151 - Gotta get away 
151 - Ooh 
151
