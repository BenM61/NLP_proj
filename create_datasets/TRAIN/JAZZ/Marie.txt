Marie, Marie, Marie

Marie, the dawn is breaking
Marie, (ooh, Marie) you'll soon be waking
To find you heart is aching
And tears (and tears) will fall (will fall) as you recall
The moon in all its splendor
A kiss (ooh, a kiss) so very tender
The words, "Will you surrender
To me, (Marie), Marie, (Marie-ee)?"
