Well I don't know
Why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that
Something ain't right
I'm so scared in case
I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering
How I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
Yes I am stuck in
The middle with you
And I'm wondering
What it is
I should do
It's so hard to keep
This smile from my face
Losing control
Yeah I'm all
Over the place

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Well you started out
With nothing
And you're proud that
You're a self made man
And your friends
They all come calling
Slap you on the back and say
Please
Please

Tried to make
Some sense at all
But I can see that
It makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go
To sleep on the floor?
You don't think
That I can take anymore

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
(Stuck in the middle)

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
(Stuck in the middle)

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
(Oh yeah)

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Well you started out
With nothing
And you're proud that
You're a self made man
And your friends
They all come calling
Slap you on the back and say
Please
(I say)
Please

Well I don't know
Why I came here tonight
(Came here tonight)
I got the feeling that
Something ain't right
(Something thing
Don't feel right)
I'm so scared in case
I fall off my chair
(I am so scared)
And I'm wondering
How I'll get down the stairs

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Stuck in the middle with you
(Oh yeah)
Stuck in the middle of you
(Here I am)
Stuck in the middle with you
(With you, with you)
