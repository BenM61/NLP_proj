I sit right here baby, baby and sit down on my knee
Yes, right here darlin', baby and sit down on my knee
I want to tell you babe
Abut the way you've been treatin' me

You're the mean mis-treater darlin'
And you don't mean no man no good
Yes, a mean mis-treater
And you don't mean no man no good
Yes, I'm goin' to quit you darlin'
And live like a wise man should

Yes, I'm goin' away to leave you darlin'
Babe and your cryin' won't make me stay
Well, I'm goin' away to leave you
Baby and your cryin' won't make me stay
Yes, I'm gonna leave you darlin'
Some day, you will change your way
