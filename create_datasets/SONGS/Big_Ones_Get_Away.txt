Hey, Baby I just got back from town 
Where the bribes are paid 
Honey, they turned my offer down 
They say the deal's already made 
So now I gotta stand and watch 
While it all comes down 
And the buzzards and the hawks 
And the judges and the mob 
Circle round 

Now if I were the queen of all the world 
I would go in chains just to see you free 
Of the ropes that bind you 
And the role you play 
And the pride that hooks you 
While the big ones get away 

Love junkies wanna change the world: 
It quickly stays the same 
Money junkies hire all the smart ones 
Power junkies run the game 

One step at a time 
Polarity Hill 
If the bad guys don't get you, baby 
Then the good guys will 
With angels on the take 
And the gangsters in the yard 
Hey don't the wars come easy 
Hey don't the peace come hard 

Now if I had a way to reach the sky 
I'd grab that crescent moon 
Wield it like a knife 
Save you from the lies 
From the ropes that bind you 
And the role you play 
And the game that hooks you 
While the big ones get away
