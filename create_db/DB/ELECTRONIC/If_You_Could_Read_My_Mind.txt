If you could. If you could. If you could read my mind.
If you could. If you could. If you could read my mind.

If you could read my mind love, 
What a tale my thoughts would tell. 
Just like an old time movie 
About a ghost from a wishing well.
In a castle dark or a fortress strong 
With chains upon my feet.
You know that ghost is me 

I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind, yeah!

If I could read your mind love, 
What a tale my thoughts would tell.
Just like a paperback novel, 
The kind the drugstores sell.
When you reach the part where the heartache 
Comes the hero would be you. 
Heroes often fail.

Never thought I'd feel this way
And I got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelings gone
And I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind

If you could. If you could. If you could read my mind.
If you could. If you could. If you could read my mind.
