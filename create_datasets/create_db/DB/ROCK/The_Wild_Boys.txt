Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys

Wild, wild, boys, boys

The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In August moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise

Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world
They tried to break us 
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing
While you're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels

Now the figureheads of have fell
And lovers war with arrows
Over secrets they could tell
They tried to tame you looks like they'll try again

Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys

Wild boys
Wild boys
Wild boys

Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always

Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always

Wild boys (wild boys) never lose it
Wild boys (wild boys) never chose this way
Wild boys (wild boys) never close your eyes
Wild boys always
Wild boys
