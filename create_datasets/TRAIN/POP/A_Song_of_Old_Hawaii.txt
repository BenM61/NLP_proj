There's the perfume of a million flowers
Clinging to the heart of old Hawaii
There's a rainbow following the showers
Bringing me a part of old Hawaii

There's a silver moon
A symphony of stars
There's a hula tune
And the hum of soft guitars

There's the trade wind
Sighing in the heavens
Singing me
A song of old Hawaii
