I shall give the vision of what is meant to be
All you have to know is that I hold the master key
I know your weakness and I can see your pain
You scream deliverance and I will pave the way

I'll set the world on fire
It's your time to retire
Because sooner or later
You're going to meet your maker

I'll give you what I think is best and what I know is right
And those who follow me, I'll give you strength and might
You pledge allegiance and I'll prevent your fall
I am your leader and know I'll rule you all

I'll set the world on fire
It's your time to retire
Because sooner or later
You're going to meet your maker

Your people are dying
Your people are crying out
That you must go down
Down, down, down, you must go down
Lets take them down
Now that it's over and all is said and done
You've turned the sky to black, no sign of the sun
Do you think the free world is going to wish you well
No god can save you now, you're going straight to hell

We've set your world on fire
You are now retired
Because sooner or later
We have to meet our maker
Set the world on fire
