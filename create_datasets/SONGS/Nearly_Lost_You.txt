Did you hear the distant cry
Calling me back to my sin
Like the one you knew before
Calling me back once again

I nearly, I nearly lost you there
And it's taken us somewhere
I nearly lost you there
Let's try to sleep now

Drag me far enough to know
I'm blind every mile that you burn
There's a rider that's fallen and
It's clear there's no time to return

I nearly, I nearly lost you there
And it's taken us somewhere
I nearly lost you there
Well let's try to sleep now

Did you hear the distant lie
Calling me back to my sin
Like the one you knew before
Calling me back once again

I nearly, I nearly lost you there
And it's taken us somewhere
I nearly lost you there
Well let's try to sleep now
I nearly lost you there
I nearly lost you
I nearly lost you there
I nearly lost you there
I nearly lost you there
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah oh 
Nearly lost you there
