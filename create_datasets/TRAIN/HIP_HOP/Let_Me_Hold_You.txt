This what you need to do girl

Let me hold you

I been watching you for a minute 
Come through here so sweet scented
In life girl you need me in it
I'm determined to win it 
I know what you need
I know what's wrong
I know how to make it tight
Everything will be all right
If ya
Let me hold you
And introduce you to my world
And introduce you to the better side of life 
That you ain't been seeing girl
I'm a show you where its at 
And I'm a show you how to get it
All you got do is be with it and
Let me hold you
Down like a real man's supposed to
I never would have approached you
If I ain't have intentions on doing good
See dude you with is so fooled
To me girl you're so cool
And all I'm asking you to do is
Let me hold you
Down like a best friend and two homies in a gang
When you cry I wanna feel your pain
No secrets, no games
All excitement, nothing plain
Keep you happy
That's my aim
And all you gotta do girl is 
Let me hold you

In my arms in my mind all the time 
I wanna keep you right by my side till I die
I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everything is right with you 
You can never go wrong if you 
Let me hold you
Down like a real friends supposed to I'm trying to show you
The life of somebody like you should be living
Oh baby baby 
You could never go wrong if you let me hold you

I'm keep you up on what's popping and shake you fresh to death
When we hit the mall we can ball till there's no more left
I know you ain't used to it but you gonna get used to it
Cause that's the only way I'm a do you and just
All my hommies think I'm tripping cause I got you a pad
See they just mad cause they ain't get you 
They ain't get you
Scorpio is your sign and girl your so fine
And I would do whatever in no time
Let me hold you
No shine
It's what you're coming with but I'm a change all that
Rearrange that
Put you in the range all black
With the rims to match 
Phone attached 
TV's in the back
How you gonna say no to that? huh
Let me hold you
Niggas look at me like now here you go 
Really bout to blow some doe
But ain't nobody did it before so why is you so go hold it
Cause I believe this was meant to be
I just gotta work at it 
Like a crack addict up in rehab

In my arms in my mind all the time 
I wanna keep you right by my side till I die
I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everything is right with you 
You can never go wrong if you 
Let me hold you
Down like a real friends supposed to im trying to show you
The life of somebody like you should be living
Ooh baby baby 
You could never go wrong if you let me hold you
