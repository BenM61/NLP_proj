More than they need to put us all in chains
Genocidal misfits killing us in vain
Lusting for power, they play a losing game
Turn earth into hell
Stupidity is to blame

Die helplessly
In torment and agony
Falling in defeat
Crying as death we meet
Annihilation is complete

Absolute destruction killing you and me
Power hungry eyes, blind, they'll never see
Devastation takes us all, atomic holocaust
F*ck 'em all F*ck 'em up, everything is lost

We're sitting on death row waiting 'til it's done
Present and past are twisted into one
Pushing it too far
Now the time is late
Destiny will fall
It seems that we've sealed our own fate

Man playing God
Deciding what is right
Upon is a veil
The deadly black of night
The end has come
And taken it away
A fight without a victor
Sanity has gone astray

Absolute destruction killing you and me
Power hungry eyes, blind, they'll never see
Devastation takes us all, atomic holocaust
F*ck 'em all F*ck 'em up, everything is lost
