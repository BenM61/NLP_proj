Dark rose, dark rose
Dark rose, the door's never closed

Dark rose, dark rose
Dark rose, pieces shows, she comes and goes

Got a room, got a room
Got a room in search for a brand new home

Got a road, got a road
I'm carrying a heavy mixed up load

Dark rose, dark rose
Dark rose, the morning she 'rose
My mind she blows
She blows my mind
She's blowing my mind
I want my dark rose
Talk of my dark rose
Oh rose, I want my dark rose
