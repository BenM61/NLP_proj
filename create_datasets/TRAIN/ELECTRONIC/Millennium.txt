Into precision 
Into the light we fade
Into submission
We all hallucinate
Into the ground
We all dissipate
Into delusion
We all segregate

Amid all this confusion
We lose sight of the enemy
Like evil gods of destruction
They move through liquid transparency

Disposable heroes
Men of yesterday
Disposable heroes
Are never here to stay
Like gods of destruction
They seek to violate
Like machines of seduction
They will regenerate

The countdown to certain extinction
Will now transform reality
Slowly the universe grows dark
You slip into a final dream

Into the wavelength
Comes conspiracy
Into the wavelength
A planet never free
In through the future
Times grows weak
Into the future
The strong will inherit the weak
