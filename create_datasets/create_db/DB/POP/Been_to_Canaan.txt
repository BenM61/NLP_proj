Green fields and rolling hills
Room enough to do what we will
Sweet dreams of yestertime are running though my mind
Of a place I left behind, been so long, I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I want to go back again

Been so long, I'm living till then
Cause I've been to Canaan and I won't rest until
I go back again. Though I'm content with myself
Sometimes I long to be somewhere else
I try to do what I can, but with our day to day demands
We all need a promised land.

Been so long,I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I want to go back again
Been so long, I'm living till then
'Cause I've been to Canaan and I won't rest until
I go back again. Oh I want to be there in the wintertime
With a fireplace burning to warm me
And you to hold me when it's stormy

Been so long, I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I want to go back again
Been so long,I'm living till then.
