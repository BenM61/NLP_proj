Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl
Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
You know understanding is a mighty powerful thing,
that's why it makes me so sad

When I see my friends wandering around through the world,
Never knowing the meaning of the word
Understanding, so in the next few minutes, I'm gonna
Try to explain just exactly what it means
Now wait a minute, listen, for instance, you take me
And my old lady, we gotta good thing goin'

Because I know If I don't work and pay the rent and the
Bills and buy her fine pretty clothes to wear well,
There are fifteen other guys just waitin' round the
Corner, and I don't care how much that woman loves me,
She's gonna go out and find herself one of them who
Will and that's why I believe that
Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl

Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
Now listen I don't want you to think that this is a
One sided affair, no no
Because my old lady also understands that a man must
Have respect

What I mean is, if she must play around don't let me
Catch her, because what I don't see can't hurt me, you
Understand? but on the other hand, If I should ever
Catch her I'm not gonna talk about-a
And call her a bunch of bad names like you all might
No no 

What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go down-town to the
Hardware store and buy myself a double blade axe,
Come back, square off, and believe her soul's gonna
Belong to the good lord

Because her head's gonna belong to me, and I
Guarantee she'll know what I mean when I'll say
Understanding is the best thing in the world,
Between a boy and a girl

Boy and girl and even a woman or a man,
It's always better when you really understand
