Early morning, I'm so horny
I just had it, still I want it
Ride up on it whenever you come around
And I can't stop thinking what I'm gonna do
As soon as I set these eyes on you
And you know I'm not playin', listen to what I'm sayin'
Girl you dominate my thoughts, 'cause baby

You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
Sweet as paradise
And I pray in my heart we will never be apart
Can't wait to paralyze
I can't wait lay on you
Promise I won't waste your time
You know what I need so lets get straight to it
