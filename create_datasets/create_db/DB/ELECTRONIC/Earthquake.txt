I can remember days, things weren't always this way
I used to make you smile if only for a while
But now you can't get through, there's no way I can lose
I know some days are hard but don't you make mine too

'Cause I can't stand it when you come home and we just fight for hours
But I won't show it, no I'll just hold my breath and keep it quiet

Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak going unheard
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand I won't say a word
Every time you hug me I know that it's working, making you mine
Every clap of thunder only makes me stronger on the inside

How many countless nights I try my best to hide
Soon as you slam the door my tears fall to the floor
I know that people change, maybe you're not to blame
But must you burn a hole so deep into my soul

'Cause I can't stand it when you come home and we just fight for hours
But I won't show it, no I'll just hold my breath and keep it quiet

Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak going unheard
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand I won't say a word
Every time you hug me I know that it's working, making you mine
Every clap of thunder only makes me stronger on the inside

Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand
Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand
Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand

Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak going unheard
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand I won't say a word
Every time you hug me I know that it's working, making you mine
Every clap of thunder only makes me stronger on the inside

Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand
Every little earthquake, every little heartbreak
Every little landslide, catch it in my hand
