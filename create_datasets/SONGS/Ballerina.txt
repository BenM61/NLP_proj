Dance on ballerina
Dance the night away
Romance on ballerina
Give yourself to-oday

We are so far apart
At each end of the rainbow
But you've stolen my heart
Now I believe in tomorrow

Turn 'round ballerina
Turn yourself to-oo me
I learn now, this ballerina
Holds the golden key

No you're never alone
Got your heart in my pocket
As you're walking on home
Wear my face in your locket

I remember the day
You caught my eye
I had nothing to say
I let you pass by
Like two ships in the ni-ight
Sailing blind 'cross the waterways

I remember the day
You caught my eye
I had nothing to say
I let you pass by
Like two ships in the ni-ight
Sailing blind 'cross the waterways

Dance on ballerina
Dance the night away
Romance on ballerina
Give yourself to-oday

Dance on
