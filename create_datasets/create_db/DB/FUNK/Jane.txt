Jane is in a group
And Jane's groupie loves every group
Hurray hurrah, they shout for all the bands
Their standing ovation is to help them catch a man

Sitting there at the show on the front row
On the side, trying to hide, whispering, "Go, baby, go"
Sitting there at the show on the front row
On the side, trying to hide, whispering, "Go, baby, go"

Someone surely loves the drummer
She jump out of the seat on every beat
The one with the slightest smile, she loves the guitar
She's packed for her trip no matter how far

Sitting there at the show on the front row
On the side, trying to hide, whispering, "Go, baby, go"
Sitting there at the show on the front row
On the side, trying to hide, whispering, "Go, baby, go, baby, go"

Jane brought the tickets too
To enjoy the show just like me and you
So hurray hurrah, we salute all our fans
Hurray hurrah, I hope you'll get the start

Sitting there at the show on the front row
On the side, trying to hide, whispering, "Go, baby, go"
Sitting there at the show on the front row
On the side, trying to hide, whispering, "Go, baby, go, baby, go"

I guess we'll see you at the show
I guess we'll see you at the show
I guess we'll see you at the show
I guess we'll see you at the show
I guess we'll see you at the show

I guess we'll see you at the show
I guess we'll see you at the show
I guess we'll see you at the show
I guess we'll see you at the show
