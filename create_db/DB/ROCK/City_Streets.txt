River wind is icy
Chills run through my bones
Tides of life are ebbing out
Between the cobblestones
The streets are on fire
With the burning sunrise
And over the water I look in vain
For love on someone's eyes

Oh
City streets
The stories that they tell 
Oh
City streets
They can be heaven
They can be hell

Winter colored morning
Gray and dirty brown
Reflecting the mood I'm in
Despair is all around
I long for sweet oblivion
To make me from my pain
Maybe bring me dreams of hope and faith
So I can break this chain

Oh
City streets
The stories that they tell 
Oh
City streets
They can be heaven
They can be hell

Lovers with their arms entwined
Silhouettes against the light
A warm bed is waiting as they head home
After staying up all night
For them the city is magic
That's all they've ever know
I wish I could find the magic
But I'm scared and I'm feeling so alone

Oh
City streets
The stories that they tell 
Oh
City streets
They can be heaven
They can be hell

Oh
City streets
The stories they have known
Oh
City streets
City streets
City streets
