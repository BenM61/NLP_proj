Through a long and sleepless night
I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night
Of who is to blame

Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie here and toss about
So alone, so without you
How I wish, my heart with me

My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The Joys we have known
I pray that someday

Our love will see the light' til then
In thick dark silence I beg my heart to replace
All through and oh so long and sleepless night

I pray that someday
Our love will see the light' til then
In thick dark silence
I beg my heart to replace
All through alone so long and sleepless night
