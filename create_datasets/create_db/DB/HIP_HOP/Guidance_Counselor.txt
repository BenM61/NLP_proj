Staring at a hard wood floor feelin' kinda nauseous
Waiting for some guidance at the counselors office
He asked me what I want to do and who I want to be
I told him when I grow up that I want to M.C.
Rock the mic with ease make G's
Rap so dope that the fans say please
Little T can we have some mo
Shakin' that ass on the dance floor
Hands in the air everybody say hoo
The guidance counselor said 
Well sir, hell sir

You slow or something don't you get it
I ain't ever gonna grow to be nothing
Nothing but a super M.C.
Writing dope rhymes ain't nothing to you
But its the only life for me
