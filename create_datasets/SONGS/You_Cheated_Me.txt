I know you've got to go
And I wanted to be afraid to say
But I'm not
I'm scared to death of watch you've become

You were my only ally
Now you're looking around for an alibi
Why don't you go ask her for a second stack of lies

You cheated me and I can't believe it
I've been calling since 4 o'clock last night
You cheated me and I can't believe it
I saw you singing and dancing in the rain
On the way home

You left the keys in the door when you left that night
I don't wanna point the finger but I can't help it
Why don't you run your skinny little ass down the block?
I'll catch up to you when you come back
And you cheated me and I can't believe it
I've been calling since 4 o'clock last night
You cheated me and I can't believe it
I saw you singing and dancing in the rain
On the way home

When all the bills have been unrolled
And your story has been untold
Tell me if it was worth it
To see the whole damn thing unfold

You cheated me and I can't believe it
I've been calling since 4 o'clock last night
You cheated me and I can't believe it
I saw you singing and dancing in the rain
On the way home
