(Lord do it for me)
This is a cry if you love your children
(Lord) lord do it
Do it for me

I believe I will fail again
If you get it in trouble, you can fail (Lord, do it)
Call me a way-maker today
If your sick you can say, Lord do it (Lord do it for me)
Because we know You're a doctor
If your heart is heavy
You can say (Lord, do it)
Do it for me, please sir, right now

If you've read your bible
You've read the story
About the man
That could not see, hallelujah
But he heard that Jesus was coming by
He just inched his way along and cried out
Jesus lay your hand
Please lay your hand on me
And I heard the blind man say 
I know you can do it (Lord do it)
You took two little fish and five loaves of bread and fed five thousand 
(Lord do it for me) I know you can do it oh yes you can

You went to the grave yard one day 
And told a dead man to get up so (Lord do it) I know you can do it
I know you can do it I know you can do it
So here's my little problem Jesus (do it for me) fix it for me right now oh yeah
I'm going to ask one more time
'Cause I know you can do it master 
(Lord do it) I know you can do it
You went to a wedding one night and turned water into wine 
I know you can do it (Lord do it for me) I know you can do it lord do it for me
And then you went one Friday eve and hung on Calvary and died for my sins
I know you can do it master, I know you can do it, so please do it for me right now
Do it for me (do it for me right now)
You see when you ask the lord to do something for you he can do it in a hurry
Do it for me, while I'm still singing, right now
Yes sir, yeah yeah Lord please
Do it for me right now
