I promised you if you'd love me
That I'd never ever go
Want you to know now that I meant that
Just didn't know they'd need me so

My body's here in the city
But my soul is back at home
My people need my education
Pleading eyes won't leave my head alone.

So this is Running Deer running
To the home I left behind
This is running deer running
Before I run out of my mind.

I told you bout the reservation
And the way that I was raised
How my family never had much
Well now I've got some debts to pay

You were born here in the city
You've seen the hunger and the pain
My people lived like that for centuries
That's what I have got to try and change.
