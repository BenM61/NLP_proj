I cried all night just thinking of you
I wonder now what I'm gonna do
Since you left me for that friend of mine
Every second is just crying time

I cry cause my heart is in pain
I cry though I know it's in vain
But knowing this I cry all the same
I wake at night crying out your name

You said that you'd never leave
I never listened that you were a tease
People talk about me behind my back
They don't understand it's the passion they lack

People go around and whisper my name
They think it's a laugh cause I never complain
But to my face they are always the same
They don't understand it's a crying shame

You always said that you needed me
Exactly what for I find it hard to see

I've sat up all night wishing you were still mine
Now I understand there's better things to do with my time

I cried because my heart was in pain
I cry though I know it's in vain
But knowing this I cry all the same
I woke at night crying out your name

I cry each night with tears in my eyes
I can't believe you are telling me lies
People go around whispering my name
But don't they know it's a crying shame

I cried because my heart was in pain
I cry though I know it was in vain
But knowing this I cry all the same
I woke at night crying out your name
