You take from me
So why you holding back? Boy, why you holding back?
So vacantly
But you won't get away with that, no you won't get away with that

They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

Don't wait for me
When you know you did me wrong, I've been holding on too long
Eventually
I'll make the call

They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more

No, I won't play this game

(No, never gonna give you the time)
(No, never gonna give you the time)
(No, never gonna give you the time)
(No, never gonna give you the time)

No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time

Oh right now (No, never gonna give you the time)
(No, never gonna give you the time) Played too many games

(No, never gonna give you the time)
No, never gonna
Telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game
