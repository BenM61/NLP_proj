The more we take the less we give
That's the modern way to live
And someone said live fast die young
But the time runs always faster son
Diseases come diseases go
Welcome to the final show
Let's shake hands with plastic gloves
And watch out for the last white doves

And believe me baby every generation
Got its own disease
And I've got mine so help me pleasebelieve me baby every generation
Got its own disease
And I've got mine so help me please

I think that I'm too young to die
Love that girl and say goodbye
Change the girls like underwear
Using bodies without care
The love has gone and what we've got
Is sweet perfume of sex and blood

And believe me baby every generation
Got its own disease
And I've got mine so help me please believe me baby every generation
Got its own disease
And I've got mine babe so help me please

And believe me baby every generation
Got its own disease
And I've got mine babe help me please believe me baby every generation
Got its own disease
And I've got mine babe help me please

Help me please
Help me please
Help me please

Tell it baby every generation
Got its own disease
And I've got mine babe help me please
And I say every, every, every
Every generation got isn't own disease
Every, every, every
Every generation got isn't own disease
