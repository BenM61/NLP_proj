Scratchin' like a tomcat
Got a monkey on my back
I'm gonna push and pull
And howl like a wolf

And drive my Cadillac
I got medication, Honey
I got wings to fly
I got horse hoof tea 
To buzz you like a bee
Gonna blind the evil eye
Push and pill with me
Funky jammin ' free
Walk it like you talk it, honey
Strut your funky stuff Come on...

I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that jailbird pie (Yeah yeah yeah)

Come on in my kitchen
I got hop head soup for grease
Just shake your hips
And let it rip
And let the spirit free
Ride on, baby, ride on 
Let your crazy horses loose
Give it all you got 
When you're hot to trot
'N' wave bye bye to the blues
Shake it to the East
Shake it to the West
Shake it with the very one that you love the best Come on...

I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that jailbird pie 
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that jailbird pie
