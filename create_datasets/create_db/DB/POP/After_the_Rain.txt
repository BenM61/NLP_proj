Hearing the refrain
Washed up by the rain
Hopeless and low
Silly stories and life goes on
Stand there till the end
Is there enough time to wait
Useless and low
Boring stories and life goes on 
So give me reasons to ignore it
If I stuck hard on it, will you sit quiet?
A couple of different ends to the stories
If I stuck hard on it, will you sit quiet? 

Maybe you will complain, how quiet you go on it
Thinking about the changes
How quiet you go, I stuck hard on it and you sit quiet!
