Oh hit it
Well every time I'm down and out
And I don't know what to do
I drop my load and I hit the road
And play me a job or two
Yes I do

What they're sayin' keeps hitting me
Right square smack in the face
They say that my songs are no good, baby
Why don't you join the human race
You know I've had just all I can take
And I don't know what to do
Guess I'll have to hit the stage
Play me a song or two

You know I've had all I can take
Sitting here at home
I guess I'll have to hit the road
You know I love to roam
(Road fever,) oh don't you know I got
(Road fever) Oooooooo

Go Mr. Guitar

You know this life has taken its toll
And I don't know where to go
And I love this life of a rock and roll
But there's one thing that I know
And every time I'm a down and out
And I don't know what to do
I drop my load and I hit the road
And play me a song or two
Yes I do

You know I've had all I can take
Sitting here at home
I guess I'll have to hit the road
You know I love to roam
(Road fever,) oh don't you know I got
(Road fever) Ohhhhhhhh
