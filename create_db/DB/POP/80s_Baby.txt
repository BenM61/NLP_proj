"You reached 867-5309
At the beep, you know what to do"

For the 80s babies

Hey, it ain't nothing like an old school track
To get the party jumping just like that
A say what, a say what
It ain't nothing like an old school track
Get the party jumping just like that

You're still my 80s baby
You're still my 80s girl

Bamboo earrings in your ear, girl
Stone wash ripped jeans big hair, girl
So shy but you can't hide
Your independent side

IROC on the block top down
Mixtape Salt-N-Pepa hot now
It's like you pressed rewind
And took me back in time

And I can't wait to
Get another taste of you
Feeling like I'm a teenager
Hit the pay phone to sky page ya

So we can do
Those things that we used to do
Take me back to all that fun
'Cause tonight we are still young

You're still my 80s baby
You're still my 80s girl
Sophisticated lady
But you're still my 80s girl

And all the fellas gonna say it now
(Hey, ho)
(Hey, ho)
Ladies!
And you're still keeping me up all night long
(Hey, ho)
(Hey, ho)
It's like we never even left at all

Now we can do the moonwalk, smurf or the whop
Long as the earrings bamboo
The bracelets bangle
Gucci Gucci boots, we splurgin'
Back when Madonna was doing it like a virgin
(On holidays)
Tank tops, ooh that's hot
Boys with Kangols, denim two tones
We gon' wear our leather skirts
To the Salt-N-Pepa, Naughty Kids on the Block concerts

You're still my 80s baby
You're still my 80s girl
Sophisticated lady
But you're still my 80s girl
(All I wanna do is go back)

Baby boy, you still got it
And you're still keeping me up all night long
(Let's come together)
And the way that you rock it
It's like we never even left at all

And I can't wait to
Get another taste of you
Feeling like I'm a teenager
Hit the pay phone to sky page ya

So we can do
Those things that we used to do
Take me back to all that fun
'Cause tonight we are still young

You're still my 80s baby (80s baby)
You're still my 80s girl (you know you are)
Sophisticated lady
But you're still my 80s girl
(All I wanna do is go back)

It ain't nothing like an old school track
Get the party jumping just like that
A say what, a say what
It ain't nothing like an old school track
Get the party jumping just like that
