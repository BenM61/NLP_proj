Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I wanna wake up in a city
That doesn't sleep
To find I'm queen of the crowd
On top of the heap

These little-town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
Old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
New York
It's up to you
New York
