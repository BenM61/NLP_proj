I feel so smoochie
When I hold your hand and look in your eye.
I feel so smoochie
When I touch your lips, then I realize
That to hold you near
Make rainbows appear,
And life is just one long kiss,
While the moon look down
And the stars kind of frown,
And say, "Golly, look what we miss!".

I feel so smoochie,
When the night is cool it's always warm here with you.
I feel so smoochie,
And a seat for one becomes a love seat for two!
And I know my career
Starts and ends right here,
Right in your lovin' arms!
Smoochie little girl me,
Smoochie old gal to you!

I feel so smoochie
When you hold me tight and muss up my hair.
I feel so smoochie,
A romantic song becomes our love affair,
And a ride in our jeep
While the kiddie's asleep
Ends with parking at some dark kerb,
Then a sleepy old bird
Whispers 'round the word,
And says, "Quiet!  Please don't disturb!".

I feel so smoochie
When I dream all day of lovin' you at night.
I feel so smoochie,
Both my feet are wrong but I feel so right!
Then I know my career
Starts and ends right here,
Right in your lovin' arms!
Smoochie little girl me,
Smoochie old gal to you!
