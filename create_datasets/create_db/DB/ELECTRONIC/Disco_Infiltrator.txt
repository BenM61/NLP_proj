But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it owwww
Stop, you cant believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh stupid me, oh stupid me
But still we want it owwww
Stop, we cant shake the waist
Stop, you've got to shake the waist
Stop, what you've been told, is what your told

Oh stupid you, I bet' told the truth
But you don't want it no!
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh stupid you, oh stupid me
And we deserve it owwww

Bare in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
