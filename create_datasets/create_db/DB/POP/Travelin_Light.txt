I'm travelin' light because my man has gone
So from now on, I'm Travelin' Light
He said, "Goodbye", and took my heart away
So from today, I'm Travelin' Light

No one to see, I'm free as the breeze
No one but me and my memories
Some lucky night he may come back again
So until then, I'm Travelin' Light

No one to see, I'm free as the breeze
No one but me and my memories
Some lucky night he may come back again
So until then, I'm Travelin' Light
