Look around you
What do those faces tell you?
Faces, joy and pain
Faces, faces everywhere

Faces
All around different faces I see
Some are happy, some in misery
They express joy and pain

Now two faces are the same
People, people all over town
Some of them are poor and others wear a crown
I've seen a lot of many faces

Joy and pain in different places
Open your mind, set yourself free
Figure it out, what could it be?
Sympatise, understand

Give love and peace to the other fellow man
Faces
Faces, joy and pain
Look around you

Do you see the faces?
What do those faces tell you?
Everywhere I go, different faces I see
Faces

All around different faces I see
Some are happy, some in misery
They express joy and pain
Now two faces are the same

Playing with your life, playing with your soul
You all scream out "I'm the one in control"
Killing of the colors, silly stupid games
You know who you are without no names

Don't mess the world 'cause that the sequal
Open your mind cause we talking about the people
In the world, all kind of places
Different races, different faces

Different faces
Everywhere
Faces
All around different faces I see

Some are happy, some in misery
They express joy and pain
Now two faces are the same
