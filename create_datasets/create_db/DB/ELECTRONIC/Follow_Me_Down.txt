Follow me down
To the water's edge
The sound of the ocean whispers your name
The salt on your skin
The sand in my hair

Follow me down to the shore.
Let's write our names in the sand so the waves
Can wash away the trace of you and me
Let ourselves fall to the ground
The tide takes you out and brings
You in and out in and out in and out and in again

Follow me down, follow me down
Sunshine and water the eyes see your face
Follow me down into the blue
I drop in the ocean
Footsteps on the beach

Follow me down to the sea
Let's write our names in the sand so the waves
Can wash away the trace of you and me
Let ourselves fall to the ground
The tide takes you out and brings
You in and out in and out in and out and in again

Follow me down, follow me down
Let's write our names in the sand so the waves
Can wash away the trace of you and me
Let ourselves fall to the ground
The tide takes you out and brings
You in and out in and out in and out and in again

Follow me down, follow me down
Let's write our names in the sand so the waves
Can wash away the trace of you and me
Let ourselves fall to the ground
The tide takes you out and brings
You in and out in and out in and out and in again

Follow me down, follow me down
Let's write our names in the sand so the waves
Can wash away the trace of you and me
Follow me down.
