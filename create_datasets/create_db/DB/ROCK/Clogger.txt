Hey mister with your iron feet yeah
Never waver from your path
You think you got a way with something boy
See his hand feel his staff
Oh you got away with words alright
An quite a way with the ladies
Your thoughts are troubled
As you hang a left
There ain't no maybees

Come an sing me down
Give my conscience a poundin'
Come an shake my ground
With the sound of heaven's houndin'

You're thinkin' when this is all over
We'll all sit back an laugh
I don't think so see cause
I done the math
Ain't lookin' to gain no honor
No no not among the thieves
I'll be there right beside you friend
In judgment on my knees

Now here you come a draggin'
Jus' couldn't help yourself
Puttin' on your poor mouth an'
Takin' from His wealth you
You come up proper now you
You ride a faithless steed
Took you down the wrong road son
Word an in deed yeah

Come an sing me down
Give my conscience a poundin'
Come an shake my ground
With the sound of heaven's houndin'

Come an sing us down
Give our conscience a poundin'
Come an shake our ground Lord
With the sound of heaven's houndin'

Come an take our crowns Lord
Give our conscience a poundin'
Come an take our crown Lord
With the sound of heaven's houndin'
