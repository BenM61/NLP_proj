Send her my love
Send her my love

Years ago, can you give it to the one my heart belonged
Too many years ago, years ago
Big mistake, didn't say "I'm sorry"
Now the one that I need is a million miles away, miles away

Feel that sorrow to the deepest core
Tried to escape but I drink it more
The fire inside 'bout to burn me down, oh

And if you find
The one that's mine
Please send her my love? (send her my love)
Send her my love (send her my love)
And if you find
Her heart in time
Please send her my love (send her my love)
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love

I was caught up running wild, I didn't care
How much I love her so, I love her so
Not long ago, we had something in common
But the winds kept blowing and changed us both
That's how she

Feel that sorrow to the deepest core
Tried to escape but I drink it more
The fire inside 'bout to burn me down, oh
One last chance gonna stop these tears
Prolly come around for too many years
I'll do anything just to make it clear, oh

And if you find
The one that's mine
Please send her my love (send her my love)
Send her my love (send her my love)
And if you find
Her heart in time
Please send her my love (send her my love)
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love

Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh

Send her my love
Send her my love
