Time stands still and then one day it's gone
Where did it go? Where did I go?
We couldn't wait to grow old
But I can't fight the feeling anymore
You know I tried, I know you tried
We're still waiting to arrive uh uh

Ooh, how much is enough?
Ooh, how can you be sure of?
I start our day so late in the evening
Ooh, how much is enough?

Nineteen hours from my door to yours
I count the miles and all the while
Waiting for the sun to rise
But how come
You can be so sure about everything when
I go to sleep you're waking up uh uh

Ooh, how much is enough?
Ooh, how can you be sure of?
I start our day so late in the evening
Ooh, how much is enough?

Sometimes
Oh, you know it feels like
That we're on the same side 
Of different coins
Somehow I could do more now
If we've gotta struggle
I want to struggle again (now)

Ooh, how much is enough?
Ooh, how can you be sure of?
I start our day so late in the evening
Ooh, how much is enough
Enough, enough
Enough
