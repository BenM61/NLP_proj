You know we flying high
(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)
I got 'em singing like
(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)

Ten bottles today man
Let's drink two and spray eight
Yep, all over the damn place
Or in a haters damn face
Dolce and Gabanna, I ain't into bandana's
Might fly to Barbados, try and find some Rihanna's
I'm running this jungle, can't touch me I'm hammer
And I'm a lion king, hakuna matata
No worries at all, no footy, I ball
I'm on my Apple shit, women I'm macking 'em all
Capital summertime ball
Yeah I can rock a crowd, you saw that hook coming
Let's sing it loud

I'm stacking my cheddar, I've never been better
It's now or it's never, you know we flying high
I'm stacking my cheddar, I've never been better
It's now or it's never, you know we flying high

(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)
I got 'em singing like
(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)
You know we flying high
You know we flying high

Still putting on for my team
And stupid niggas wifey's
And all the girls like me
Including the dikeys
The life of the party
My queen on my body
She smelling my neck, that's Issey Miyake
I keep it so cool, but I am no fool
These niggas with me don't know vocals but they pro-tools
Pour me a glass, toast G
I'm fucking bossy, f*ck being low key (ooh!)
And you know I can rock a crowd
You feel that hook coming, let's sing it now

I'm stacking my cheddar, I've never been better
It's now or it's never, you know we flying high
I'm stacking my cheddar, I've never been better
It's now or it's never, you know we flying high

(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)
I got 'em singing like
(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)
You know we flying high
You know we flying high
You know we flying high

(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)
I got 'em singing like
(Ay ay, ooh, ooh, ay yeah)
