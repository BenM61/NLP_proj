Hush, hush
Baby don't believe a word
Hush, hush
Honey don't believe a word
Well, you don't know nothin'
But believe everything you heard

Hush, hush
Yakkyyak' all the time
Hush, hush
Yakkyyak' all the time
Well, if you don't stop yakkin'
You're goin' to drive me out of my mind

Hush, hush
Didn't hear a word you said
Hush, hush
Didn't hear a word you said
If you don't stop talkin'
I'm gonna leave and I'm mighty 'fraid

Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
Hush, hush
