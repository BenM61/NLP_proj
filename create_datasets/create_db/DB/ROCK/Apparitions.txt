Say hello
Remain
Close to me
No good-bye suicide mystery

The rat
In your brain
Turns a wheel
Connected to your guts and
All your faults are in me
And all your faults in me

What would you say
If we lived on t.v
Besides all the things they told you to
And all the things they told you to

We're stuck
Inside our own machine
Apparitions

Say hello
Well is it strange
Where you are
Where you used to be kind of free
Are they laughing at you
Laughing at you

The rat
In your brain
Rules the world
From the comfort of your living room
Tell me are we leaving soon
The comfort of your living room
Tell me are we leaving soon

We're stuck
Inside our own machine
Apparitions

We're stuck
Inside our own machine
Apparitions
