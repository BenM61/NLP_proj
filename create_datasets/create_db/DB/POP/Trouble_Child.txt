My life is all mixed up
God bless the child
Can't earn a penny for his own cup
Because I'm so untamed (untamed)
And I'm so wild (so wild)
And they call me the trouble child (trouble child)

When I have gone away
They don't worry coz they say
She'll be back someday
Because I'm so bad (so bad)
And I make my family sad (so sad)
And they call me the trouble child (trouble child)

When I have gone away
They don't worry coz they say
She'll be back someday
Because I'm so bad (so bad)
And I make my family sad (so sad)
And they'd name me the trouble child (trouble, trouble child)

Trouble child (trouble, trouble child)
And I'm so wild (trouble, trouble child)
So untamed (trouble, trouble child)
That's my name (trouble, trouble child)
Trouble child (trouble, trouble child)
I'm so wild (trouble, trouble child)
So untamed (trouble, trouble child)
That's my name (trouble, trouble child)
