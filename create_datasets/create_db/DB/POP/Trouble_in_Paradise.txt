Billy's home, he just back from la
Plenty of lines but nothing to say
Seen this movie and it don't end nice
Looks like trouble in paradise

He used to be cool he used to laugh a lot
Down at the brothers in the parking lot
Now he's sick, and he's scared and he's paying the price

Trouble in paradise
Trouble in paradise,
Momma said he always was so nice
Trouble in paradise

American son he's not very old
An american dream that's never been sold
The smile on his face is his last disguise
We've got trouble in paradise

There's a scream inside that shouts here I am
Some people say you we've got to do all we can
Me I don't know you see I've been there myself once or twice

Trouble in paradise
Trouble in paradise,
Momma said he always was so nice
Trouble in paradise
