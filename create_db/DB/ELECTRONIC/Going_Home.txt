We've been searching for so long,
To find the place where we could belong,
We always dreamed of better things to come
And turned our faces towards the sun,
We follow the light that we see in the dark,
Keep on going till it catches spark,
I believe there's a change to come,
We never know if we never run

And all signs are surfacing now again on your mind more

Don't turn around we're going one way,
The time is right we're going home,
And now you're in my mind always,
Forever young, and forever on

There's a distance to go from here,
There's never the weight of the world we fear,
I'll be with you and right beside,
Ever wrong and through the night

And all signs are surfacing now again on your mind more

Don't turn around we're going one way,
The time is right we're going home,
And now you're in my mind always,
Forever young, and forever on

Don't turn around we're going one way,
The time is right we're going home,
And now you're in my mind always,
Forever young, and forever on

Don't turn around we're going one way,
The time is right we're going home,
And now you're in my mind always,
Forever young, and forever on
