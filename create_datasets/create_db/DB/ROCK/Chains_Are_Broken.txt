We used to get drunk and want to fight
Go out lookin' on a Saturday night
You had me runnin' like it was for my life
Drinkin' down fumes like that neon light

But now its chains are broken, I've been set free
I was blind, now I see
When you're treated like a dog that's how you start to behave
You're gonna miss me like the masters miss their

We used take pills and hope to die
Sing ourselves a suicidal lullaby
Nobody drivin' and I'm passenger-side
You made me the master of the long goodbye

But now its chains are broken, I've been set free
I was blind, now I see
When you're treated like a dog that's how you start to behave
You're gonna miss me like the masters miss their

So down and nervous I could die of fright
Felt like I've fallen from the greatest height
I said, I don't need no glasses, I got perfect hindsight
I say we pray for lightnin' and hold onto this kite

'Til its chains are broken, I've been set free
I was blind, now I see
When you're treated like a dog that's how you start to behave
You're gonna miss me like the masters miss their
You're gonna miss me like the masters miss their
