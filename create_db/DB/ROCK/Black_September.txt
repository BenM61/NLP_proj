And you go on a marquee
Watch myself in you
Winds of war had cut into
I tried to fight the truth
In that time I lost my youth
And now I bear the scars
Black September is comin' on
You know you won't get far

Destruction lay before my eyes
Generation beat
Seemed to be too high to see
What was dying in the street
We thought we'd change the world back then
Without becoming hard
Black September is comin' on
You know you won't get far

We thought back then we'd be there now
We thought back then we'd be there now

How could I know what waits for me
How could I be so cruel
To know the best of days gone by
Something I would lose
Watch the tides of summer fade
In memories 'neath the dark
Black September is comin' on
You know you won't get far

Oh, oh oh, black September, yeah
Oh, oh oh, black September, yeah
Oh, oh oh, black September, yeah
Oh, oh oh, black September, yeah
