I can't stop shakin'
The room has a groove and the floor
It's almost earthquakin'
Uhuh

Look what we're makin'
History out on the floor
And it's just awakin'
Uhuh

So get that needle in the core
Scratch that back and gimme more
You know zactly what I came here for
Back it up and do it again

From the middle to the top to the end
Ba dlu dla dlun dloday
Ba dlu dla dlun dloday
Back to the middle to the front to the end
Za dlu dla dlun dloday
Everybody ba dlun dloday
I don't care if he's a friend
From the front to the middle to the back to the end

Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back it up and do it again
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)

Gimme some of that funky
The kind that the Duke used to play
And make it more swingy
Heyey

And then give me some hornay
You know the bub-pu-pa bub-pu-pa-bay
Come on, give it to me, Hmmm hmmm

Slam that bass and make it sing
Give those strings that rip 'n zing
You know zactly what I came here for
Back it up and do it again

From the middle to the top to the end
Ba dlu dla dlun dloday
Ba dlu dla dlun dloday
Back to the middle to the front to the end
Za dlu dla dlun dloday
Everybody ba dlun dloday
I don't care if he's a friend
From the front to the middle to the back to the end

Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back it up and do it again
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna)

Get that needle in the core
Scratch that back and gimme more
You know zactly what I came here for
Back it up and do it again
