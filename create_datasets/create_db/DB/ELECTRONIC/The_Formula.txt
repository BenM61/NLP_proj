It's an interview
But it's a second take
There's a questioner
But your mind's at stake

It's a room designed
For propaganda's sake
He's a rich man now
There's no escape


You can't take it where you're going
You can't take things where you are
... you can't take it with you.
Let's break down the formula
Let's switch off the set
...and be glad we finally met.

I could crash... my car
Through your screen
I could take a match... to your empire
And teach you how to dream

You open the door
Let me into your home
You show me how you cry
You tell me how you scream

And how you watch
When you're alone


You can choose any channel
From your chair
But I've got a better idea
... tear up the guide
Rip down the aerial


Let's play real life
Let's play real life instead...
