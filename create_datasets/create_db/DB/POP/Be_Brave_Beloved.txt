Be brave beloved
Believe me when I say
We'll dream again and kiss again someday
Have faith beloved
Our love will see us through
Though nights are long, be strong
'Til I come back to you

I hear the bugle of freedom blow
And I must join the ranks of marching bands
But there will be a spring
When the birds will sing
And we'll be together again

'Til then beloved,
Be brave, no tears, no sighs
Next time we meet
There'll be no more good byes

I hear the bugle of freedom blow
And I must join the ranks of marching bands
But there will be a spring
When the birds will sing
And we'll be together again

'Til then beloved,
Be brave, no tears, no sighs
Next time we meet
There'll be no more good byes

Next time we meet,
There'll be no more good byes
