Taint the world with black zinc
Pour the blood so our roots can drink
Boys and girls - stay away from the light

Drench the dolls in the cement sea
Sell your soul for the final fee
All face down - now the shackles are tight

'Cause I set for the storm where we destroy
I can hear them scream
For the death of our dreams and for the

King of betrayal and lust
Lord of nothing but dust
Die in the gutter and dirt
We're the perfect cult
Perfect cult

Drag their scalps on the asphalt mile
And let them fight, taxidermied child
Kill the lights - and ignite the fright

Strip the saints with the sinner's eye
Let the models march and witches fly
Sell yourselves - be a part of the night

'Cause I set for the storm where we destroy
I can hear them scream
For the death of our dreams and for the

King of betrayal and lust
Lord of nothing but dust
Die in the gutter and dirt
We're the perfect cult
Perfect cult

King of betrayal and lust
Lord of nothing but dust
Die in the gutter and dirt
We're the perfect cult
Perfect cult

Ashes rain on frozen skin
Suffer the consequence for all that's been

'Cause we enjoy when it burns, cries, cracks, dies
A feast for the shadows when we see it as it
Burns, cries, cracks, dies
A feast for the hollowed when we see the

King of betrayal and lust
Lord of nothing but dust
Die in the gutter and dirt
We're the perfect cult
Perfect cult

King
Lord
Die in the gutter and dirt
We're the perfect cult
Perfect cult
