Hey Santa can you bring me something good, something good, something good.
Hey Santa can you bring me something sweet, something sweet, something, something sweet. 
Like chocolate kisses or candy canes, gumdrops, or butterscotch, fruity flavor, chewy rings.
Hey Santa can you bring me something nice, something nice, something nice.
Hey Santa can you bring me something new, something new, something, something new.
Like a diamond bracelet or a diamond ring, how about a shiny new, baby blue, convertible. 
Hey santa can you bring me everything.

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey Santa can I sing this song to you, sing to you, sing to you.
Hey Santa can you make my wish come true, make it true, make it, make it true.
Can you fill my stocking with lots of treats, 
Boxes with red and green, none to make the christmas tree.
Hey Santa can you bring me everything.
