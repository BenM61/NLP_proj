Do it  
  
 Come on start a fire  
 In my electric chair  
 Baby cross my wires  
 Light up my hair  
 Overload my circuits  
 let me feel the juice  
 make me an offer  
 that I can't refuse  
  
 Blow my fuse  
 (Hey hey)You got nothing to lose  
 Blow my fuse  
 I need a good shot  
 I can't give it to you  
 On electric cruise(?)  
 Blow my fuse  
 You light my light I'll light you  
  
 Baby shake my tower  
 Get it while it's hot  
 Baby feel my power  
 Fifty thousand watts  
 Come on feel the voltage  
 Light thick and through  
 From the whites of my eyeballs  
 To the souls of my shoes  
  
 Blow my fuse  
 (Hey hey)You got nothing to lose  
 Blow my fuse  
 I need a good shot  
 I can't give it to you  
 On electric cruise(?)  
 Blow my fuse  
  
 Hot wired  
 Get fired  
 Ooo baby watch it glow  
 Give me action  
 Satisfaction  
 Babe I'm ready for an overload  
  
 Plug me in like electric light  
 It's a rock and roll show tonight  
  
 Blow my fuse  
 (Hey hey)You got nothing to lose  
 Blow my fuse  
 I need a good shot  
 I can't give it to you  
 Blow my fuse  
 (Hey hey)You got nothing to lose  
 Blow my fuse  
 I need a hot spark  
 I can't give it to you  
 Blow my fuse  
 Got nothing to lose  
 Blow my fuse  
 Can't give it to you  
 Blow my fuse  
 Got nothing to lose  
 Blow my fuse  
 Can't give it to you  
 Blow my fuse
