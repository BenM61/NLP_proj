I feel like I've been lost somewhere
And I find out why I'm here again
And time stretches across my mind
Spins all the way around

And now I find myself alone
My head without a home
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

And where will you be
When all this is coming down?
With time to kill
Where will you be
When all this is coming down?
You're a necessary evil

You lit a fire with the sweetest kiss
I saw the flame and I held my hand to it
And I know that if I ever miss you'll
Burn me to the ground

And now I'm lost within myself
I'm losing self respect
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

And where will you be
When all this is coming down?
With time to kill
Where will you be
When all this is coming down?
You're a necessary evil

You've changed me now
I search for something new
And I hurt myself but I can't see it through

Now I find myself alone
My head without a home
I turn myself to you
But what else could I do

And where will you be
When all this is coming down?
With time to kill
Where will you be
When all this is coming down?
You're a necessary evil
