All the people in the world
Every boy and every girl
Just imagine that we could...
It isn't hard to do.
All the people in the world
Every boy and every girl
Just imagine that we could face our brotherhood.

Give it up!
You've just got to give it up!
Let yourself just give it up!
You've just got to give it up, up, give up give up and
Give it up!
You've just got to give it up!
Let yourself just give it up!
You've just got to give it up,up,give up give up and
Jam it up!!

From the mountains to the sea
Through the valleys follow me
From down below to way up high
Baby we can touch the sky

All the people in the world
Every boy and every girl
Just imagine that we could
Face our brotherhood!!!!
