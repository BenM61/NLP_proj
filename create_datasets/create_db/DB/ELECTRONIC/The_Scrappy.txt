You think that I don't know
What is goin' down
It's time you let your goatee go
And do the new dance in town

Come on come on
We could do the scrappy
Come on come on
Beats could make you happy
What's the matter with your eyes?

Your contacts are so scary
Tired of seeing these guys
They're just too tough to do the scrappy
Come on come on

You could keep the shaggy
Come on come on 
And we could do the scrappy
Come on come on
Beats could make you happy
