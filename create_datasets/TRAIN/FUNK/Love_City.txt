If it's life I would like to be there 
If it's good and you find no despair
Then you'll see 
That the dreams that you dream 
Yes, they're true 
Just for you 
When you say that you're happy to be in that place 
Where the sun's always kissing your face 
And the people and children they play 
And I can't wait 

I'll take a bus or a train to get to love city 
It's the only place I feel at home 
I'll take a car or a plane to get to love city 
It's the only place I feel at home 

If it's love I can see in your eyes 
That you come from a place where eternity lies 
If you please won't you show me the way 
That you go I want to know 
Fade away from the hustle and bustle of life 
To a city where darkness is light 
And the beauty of nature is there, 
It's everywhere 

I'll take a bus or a train to get to love city 
It's the only place I feel at home 
I'll take a car or a plane to get to love city 
It's the only place I feel at home
