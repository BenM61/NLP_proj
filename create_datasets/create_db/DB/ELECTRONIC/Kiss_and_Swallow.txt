Do you pay for your crimes?
Does the punishment fit or drag your style to zero
You're nothing till the weekend
If you think that you're the thrill
Take a look at your life, you kneel before your heroes
You're nothing till the weekend

Could you care for the blind?
Tell me all in all, they're just your kind of zeros
Something for the weekend
If you think that you can spell
Make a list of the cunts you'd send to hell and send them
Send them on the weekend

Echo echo, I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo echo, a kick in the head to kill the hollow
Echo echo, I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo echo, a kick in the head to kill the hollow

Do you care for the blind?
Tell me all in all, they're just your kind of zeros
Something for the weekend
If you think that you can spell
Make a list of the cunts you'd send to hell and send them
Send them on the weekend

Echo echo, I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo echo, a kick in the head to kill the hollow
Echo echo, I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo echo, a kick in the head to kill the hollow

Are you listening?
No, in the narrowest sense
Are you listening?
I can hold you down by candlelight
With indifference
Let the comfort start
I love you on your right side
It happens
Promises broken
Reasons let go
It happens
Are you listening?

I know it a sin but tell me it happens!
I know it a sin but tell me it happens!

Echo, echo, echo, echo
Echo, echo, echo

Echo echo, I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo echo, I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
