Keep on kicking shit, keep running off the rails
Keep on picking the dirt from 'neath your fingernails
'Cause I'm not worried about your state of mind
'Cause you're not the revolutionary kind

Keep on in the jungle with your techno-cality
Keep on lapping up your chemical duty-free
'Cause I'm not worried about your state of mind
'Cause you're not the revolutionary kind

Keep on twisting turning, staring down the sun
Keep on dancing dancing, dance with everyone
You're not the revolutionary kind
You're not the revolutionary kind
You're not the revolutionary kind
You're not the revolutionary kind
