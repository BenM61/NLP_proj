Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

I sit back and reminisce
It hurts to think about it all
We was on top of the world
Whoever thought that we would fall?

Standing by the phone
Alone, ignoring your call
I feel like spider man
You got me flying off of the wall

I ain't wanna leave
But still I had to go
'Cause what good is a rainbow
Without my pot of gold?

And now your beds empty
And your pillow's cold
You never realized the love
Until my love was gone, yeah

When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you

Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

The phone call
Can you stop the free fall?
Can you be the reason
I can see beyond the lies
If I keep holding on?

I hear you (Hear you)
Can you stop the screaming? (Screaming)
Did you stop believing?
I could feel you letting go
I can't be alone tonight

When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you

Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Whoa, I hope that it won't end though, alone

And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
