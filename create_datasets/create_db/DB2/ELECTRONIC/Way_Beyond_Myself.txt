I've been thinking it's about time
To win the war that fights against 
All the lies invading my mind
You have brought me to my senses
Even though You built this world to shake
You still love me in a personal way
So I think it's time to leave my doubt behind

There's so much more than meets the eye
Or what's going on inside
I believe in something way beyond myself
Like the wind that moves the leaves
Lord, You move me to my knees
Even into to something way beyond myself
Even into to something way beyond myself

Oh the way we build our empires hoping to impress our friends
We've forgotten how to inspire those who fall to rise again
Oh my God, You've built this world to shake
You still love me in a personal way
So I think it's time to leave my doubt behind

There's so much more than meets the eye
Or what's going on inside
I believe in something way beyond myself
Like the wind that moves the leaves
Lord, You move me to my knees
Giving into to something way beyond myself
Giving into to something way beyond myself

Storms are gonna come my way, I know
Some things are out of our control 
But there's a hope beyond myself
It's You and You will never let me go
Now I want my life to show 
You got me thinking beyond myself
Way beyond myself

There's so much more than meets the eye
Or what's going on inside
I believe in something way beyond myself
Like the wind that moves the leaves
Lord, You move me to my knees
Even into something way beyond myself
There's so much more than meets the eye
Or what's going on inside
Giving into to something way beyond myself
Giving into to something way beyond myself
Like the wind that moves the leaves
Lord, You move me to my knees
Giving into to something way beyond myself
Giving into to something way beyond myself
There's so much more than meets the eye
Or what's going on inside
I'm giving into to something way beyond myself
I'm giving into to something way beyond myself
Like the wind that moves the leaves
Lord, You move me to my knees
