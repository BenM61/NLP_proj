Every time that I'm with you girl
I can't believe you share my world
But it's real

And every time that I hold you close to me
Forever's all that I can see
How it feels

See I don't give a damn what my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never felt this way before
You leave a brother want more

I hate to see you go
Even though I know when you're comin' back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish you could stay
Every time you go away

From the very first time that I touched you babe
Couldn't find the words to say you set me free
And every time that I kiss your lips
Nothin' ever tasted quite like this
Or got so deep

See I don't give a damn what my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never ever felt this way before
You always leave me want more

I hate to see you go
Even though I know when you're comin' back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish you could stay
Every time you go away

You're the sunshine of my day
You brighten up my night
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you say goodbye

I hate to see you go
Even though I know when you're comin' back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish you could stay
Every time you go away
