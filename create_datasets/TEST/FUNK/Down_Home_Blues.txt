You said your party's jumping
And everybody's having a good time 


You say your party's jumping 
and everybody's having a good time 
you know what's going through my mind
do you mind if I get comfortable and kick off these shoes
While you fixing me a drink play me some of those down-home
She said you know I don't get out much on the town 
and you know I than cut out a lot of that running around 
All night long, I been keeping my cool
She said take off those fast records and play me some of those down-home blue


Down-home Blues, Down home blues 
All I wanted to hear was some down home blues, 
 all night long every other record or two 
She said, I'm going to get my head banged
 And party on the down home blues

She said you know my old man's Gonna want to fight because of the hours I'll be early in tonight
 but I don't care Because tonight I'm gonna do as I choose You see i'm going To get my head banged and party on these down-home blues
