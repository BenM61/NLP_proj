Why know, my homey Treach from Naughty by Nature once said 
"If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the fuckin' ghetto" 
But I'mma let one of our most immaculate tour guides take us all through the ghetto, 
My nigga' Rick James

When I was a young boy, growin' up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners, singin' with the fellas
Lookin' for the cute chicks, tryin' to find me
Lookin' for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy (in the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (in the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (in the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talkin' bout (talkin' bout ghetto life, talkin' bout ghetto life) 
You all know what I'm singin' 'bout (talkin' bout ghetto life)
Ghetto life (talkin' 'bout ghetoo life)

(In the ghetto) Sure we be takin' them chances
While we search for the answers we be smokin' them cancer sticks
Police provokin' motherfuckers, we dancin'
And we be dodgin' them bullets they be poppin' off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood 'til somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry, hey nigga we playin' for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See nigggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle 'til we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doin' crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

[Chorus]
(Talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
Ghetto life (talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singin' 'bout (talkin' bout ghetto life)
Ghetto life (talkin' 'bout ghetto life)

(In the ghetto) that's where we get into that street shit
Hustle hard, try to get money quick (in the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I all got my name from (in the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustlin' as hard as you could (in the ghetto)
Until your cake stackin' shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (in the ghetto)
With them burn out cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And they pis sin elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (in the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothin' like a hood nigga, I don't care
You survivin' in the ghetto, you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

[Chorus]

To my east coast niggas', rep yo' ghetto
West coast niggas', rep yo ghetto
Midwest niggas', rep yo' ghetto
Down south niggas', rep yo' ghetto
To my east coast niggas', rep yo' ghetto
West coast niggas', rep yo' ghetto
Midwest niggas', rep yo' ghetto
Down south niggas', rep yo' ghetto

(In the ghetto) even though they act rude
You'll always find a good hick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street and live by the rules (in the ghetto)
Is where, all of the hood's at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats and some of the most powerful people, I love that
C'mon

(Talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm talkin' 'bout (talkin' bout ghetto life)
(Talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singin' 'bout (talkin' 'bout ghetto life"
Ghetto life (talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
(In the ghetto)

"Never mind who you thought I was, I'm Rick James, bitch!" 

"Cocaine is a hell of a drug"
