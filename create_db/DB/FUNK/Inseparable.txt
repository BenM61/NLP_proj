Inseparable, that's how we'll always be 
Inseparable, just you and me 
It's so wonderful to know you'll always be around me 
  
Incredible, what you are to me 
Incredible, you bring out the woman in me 
With your style of love 
Inseparable, yes we are 
  
Well like a flower to a tree 
Like words to a melody of love 
There's no way we could break up 
No words that can make us 
Blow our thing, we're just 
  
Inseparable, that's how it is 
Inseparable, for the rest of our years 
It's so wonderful to know you'll always be around
