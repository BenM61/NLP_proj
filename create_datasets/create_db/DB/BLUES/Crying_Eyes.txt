It ain't easy drying 
These crying eyes of mine
It ain't easy drying 
These crying eyes of mine

It ain't easy drying 
These crying eyes of mine
What can you do when 
Those tears make you blind

What can you do when 
Those tears make you blind
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
What can you do with 
These crying eyes of mine
