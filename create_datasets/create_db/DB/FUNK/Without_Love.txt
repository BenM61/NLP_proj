Did I say something wrong?
Why are you mad at me?
Is there something you don't like about me?
Maybe it's the way I think.

You go behind my back
Telling all my friends that you hate the way I look
You really can't stand me
You try to bring me down when I'm reaching out my hand
Do you really think that it's worth it in the end?

Without love
Without love
Without love
Without love
We're never gonna make it.
No, we're never gonna make it.
No no-oh-oh-oh.

If I met you face to face
Maybe we could talk it out
If you put yourself in my place
Would you like it if I put you down?

Show me who you are
You don't even know me
When I turn my back
You always talk about me
Pretending you don't hear me
When I set it straight,
You make it more that clear I'm the one you love to hate.

Without love
Without love
Without love
Without love
We're never gonna make it
No, we're never gonna make it.
No no-oh-oh-oh

(Ooh)

How do you sleep at night?

(Ooh)

When you know it isn't right?

(Ooh)

Be careful what you say
Gotta think before it's too late.

Without love
Without love
Without love
Without love
We're never gonna make it.
No, we're never gonna make it.
No no-oh-oh-oh

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
