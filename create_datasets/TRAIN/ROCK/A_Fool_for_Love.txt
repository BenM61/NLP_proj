In days gone by
There was a king
A fool for love
And all it brings

So high and wise
Could read your mind
A fool for love
And love is blind

A crowded street
An empty train
A fool for love
You cry in vain

In days gone by
There was a queen
A fool for love
And all it means

Red ruby lips
Don't touch my eyes
A fool for love
And love is blind

Like flowers in the rain
I'm twisted up inside
I'll never be the same

I hear the same old lines
You played me for a fool
You really hurt my pride.
