When I lay you down
When I lay you down
When I lay you down (when I lay you down)
You know that I've fallen for you when I lay you down
When I lay-ay-ay-ay-ay you down

It's Friday night just got payed 
Fresh as a cube in a glass of lemonade 
I was down in Miami flying back today
To the A, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

I call up Nikki she like to get kinky 
Have a good time every time she with me 
And I'm thinking 
Hey I might just be fallin' for her hey
Hey I might just be fallin' for her

She don't care about what you say 
She just get it how she know 
Half on any bed even get it on the floor oh
What she show me what she know
Now I just be tripping if she dips somewhere 
Maybe I'm dumb or maybe I'm just sprung 
Now I be tripping if she dips somewhere yeah
And I never thought I'd fall for you

When I lay you down (When I lay you down)
When I lay you down down
When I lay you down (When I lay you down)
When I lay you down 
I'm just fallin' for you
When I lay you down (when I lay you down)
When I lay you down down
When I lay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay you down

This girl she's a classic old Reeboks 
A beauty legendary like Biggie and Pac 
She something like a homie 
She bangin on a block 
She acting like my body guard yea she's my body guard yea 
I gotta under my potion 
I bring her to my beach house, view of the ocean 
I already know it slow motion 
I already know it slow motion 

I can't even lie
I love it when I'm in it 
Me I'm trying to win it like I'm going for the pennant
Love it when I in it 
Baby I be mad if she dips somewhere 
Maybe I'm dumb a matter of fact I'm sprung 
Watch how I'll be tripping if she dips somewhere 
'Cause I aint had no better 
Don't want no better 
They asked me when I leave her, never

When I lay you down
When I lay you down down
When I lay you down
When I lay you down 
I'm fallin' for you
When I lay you down (when I lay you down)
When I lay you down down
When I lay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay you down

Uh ah, she make in that sound
All I wanna hear when I lay you down
Fallin in love like I'm teen age now
Cant wait til I hear the bell ring
Studying her like its extra credit
Ask me for a grade its an "A" I'm betting
And I cant wait to get home
I can lay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay you down

When I lay you down
When I lay you down down
When I lay you down
When I lay you down 
I'm fallin' for you 
When I lay you down (when I lay you down)
When I lay you down down
When I lay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay you down
