The sun and sea are smiling
While you're going to bed
Wish Allah would will me
A piece of iron in my head

On my knees and wishing
On my knees and breaking hands

The fish are jumping in Tunis
They change colours in my hands
You don't watch the movies, like the clouds
On a plane to Japan

On my knees and wishing
On my knees and breaking hands

They bring the fish in at Tunis
They're changing blue, green and red
While Allah has willed me
And he's got it to my head

On my knees and wishing
On my knees and breaking hands

On my knees and wishing
On my knees and breaking hands
