It's just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

I know your name
I told you mine
We stop and pass the time of day

You work in town
I work at night
That gives us six until seven to work this out

If I seem a little strange
It's just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

You are the moon
I am the sea
You pull me in and gaze on down at me

I was alone
I thought I was immune
It's good to know it all can still be open wide

If I seem a little strange
It's just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

It's just a state of the heart
I'll wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

We get closer and closer
To fallin' out or fallin' in
I go over and over
But I can't change the state this heart is in

If I seem a little strange
It's just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

It's just a state of the heart
You know I'll wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

It's a state of the heart
(State of the heart)
A state of the heart
(State of the heart)
Whoa-ooh
A state of the heart
(State of the heart)
A state of the heart
(State of the heart)
Whoa-ooh
