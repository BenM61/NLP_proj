Where the sun shines on Loch Lomond.
Where me and tea tree my true love spent many days
On the banks of Loch Lomond.

Too sad we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep sides of Ben Lomond.
Where the broken heart knows no second spring,
Resigned we must be while we're parting.

You'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore you.
Where me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

Ho, ho mo leannan
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach
Ho mo leannan bhoidheach

You'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye.
Where me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

You'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore you.
Where me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

You'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore you.
Where me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

You'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore you.
Where me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks
On bonnie, bonnie banks

Hey, Hey, Hey
