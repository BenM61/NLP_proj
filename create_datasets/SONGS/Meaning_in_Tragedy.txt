I have traveled
So far to find
So little, meaning
In tragedy,or tragedy
In, the search for, meaning

Dark clouds have lead me here

Confined, freedom
Guides us to, security
What if everything
I have been taught is a lie
And all of my, teachers
Have been wrong this whole time
Compelling us
To fight the battles
They would not
They have, already won
And we have, already lost
If we do not learn to change
We have, already lost

We have, already lost
If we do not learn to change
