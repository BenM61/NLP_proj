In the South Land there's a city
Way down on the river
Where the women are very pretty
And all the men deliver

They got music
It's always playin'
Start in the day time, go all through the night

When you hear that music playin'
Hear what I'm saying, it make you feel alright

Grab somebody, come on down
Bring your paintbrush, we're paintin' the town
Honey, there's some sweetness goin' 'round
Catch it down in New Orleans

We got magic, good and bad
Make you happy or make you real sad
Get everything you want, lose what you had
Down here in New Orleans

Hey partner, don't be shy
Come on down here and give us a try
You wanna do some livin' before you die
Do it down in New Orleans

Stately homes and mansions
Of the Sugar Barons and the Cotton Kings
Rich people, poor people, all got dreams
Dreams do come true in New Orleans
