We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

We all wanna feel special...

This special need
That's within us
Brings out the best
Yet worst in us

Follow the passion
That's within you
Living the truth
Will set you free-ee-ee

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

Put others down
To fill us up
Oppressing me
Will oppress you

Outside leave judgement
Outside leave hate
One love's the answer
You'll find in you-oo-oo

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
