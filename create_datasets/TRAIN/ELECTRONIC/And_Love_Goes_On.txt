I would be so willing to give you all I got
You're a special lady, forget me not
I could be so tender, for the likes of you
Let my heart surrender

And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on

Everyday, I'm wishing for that day to come
Feeling superstitious hoping she's the one
One day I'm lonely, next with plenty smiles
Love I find amusing

And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on

Oh, oh, oh, and if we can't work it out
you should know, without a doubt
I will always be the one you can turn to
A friend until the end, no matter where we've been
Sometimes you can't hold on
You got to give it space ? yea yea

And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on

Baby we can work it out
Yes I really love you, and without a doubt
I can make you happy,
plant good memory that will last forever

And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on
