Mary, if you ever want me, I'll be right here
And Mary, this thing we got is too good to throw away
And Mary, I'm just the one to kiss away all your tears
So Mary, I'm gonna keep it right here and keep it warm every day

Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
The one that's too high for you to climb
Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
The rock that you wanted was right here all the time
Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
The one that's too high for you to climb
Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
The rock that you wanted was right here all the time

Mary I know that somewhere, I'm in your mind
Mary there's a mountain rising high behind
And Mary you think you can climb it, go ahead and try
But Mary you go up laughing but you always come down crying

Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
The one that's too high for you to climb
Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
The rock that you wanted was right here all the time
Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
Stop lookin' for your mountain Mary
The one that's too high for you to climb
The rock that you wanted was right here all the time
