I made a wish on a starry night
And then you danced into my life
A lovely girl from a story book
I fell in love with just one look
Midnight girl

Your eyes were filled with such mystery
We held each other tenderly
And just before you spoke your name
The clock struck twelve and you ran away

Midnight girl, was it all a dream
Kissing and holding you next to me
Midnight girl, the story just can't end
'Til you're back in my arms again, come on in

I've got your silver shoes in my hand
A broken heart and shattered plans
But if it takes 'til the end of time
I'll find you girl and I'll make you mine

Midnight girl, was it all a dream
Kissing and holding you next to me
Midnight girl, the story just can't end
'Til you're back in my arms again, come on in

Come on in, come on in
Come on in, come on in

Midnight girl, was it all a dream
Kissing and holding you next to me
Midnight girl, the story just can't end
'Til you're back in my arms again, come on in

Midnight girl, kissing and holding you
Oh, midnight, midnight girl
Oh, midnight, midnight girl
Oh, midnight

It's a crowded place but where's your lovely face
All the flashing lights but it's a lonely night
The music plays and plays but you've gone away

Oh, midnight, midnight girl
Oh, midnight, midnight girl

It's a crowded place but where's your lovely face
All the flashing lights but it's a lonely night
The music plays and plays but you've gone away

Midnight, midnight girl
Midnight, midnight girl
Midnight, midnight girl
