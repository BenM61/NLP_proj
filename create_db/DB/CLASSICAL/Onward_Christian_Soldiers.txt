Onward Christian soldiers 
Marching as to war 
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before 

Christ the royal master 
Leads against the foe 
Forward into battle 
See his banners go 

Onward Christian soldiers 
Marching as to war 
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before 

Like a mighty army 
Moves the church of god 
Brothers we a treading 
Where the Saints have trod 

We are not divided 
All one body we 
One in hope and doctrine 
One in charity 

Onward Christian soldiers 
Marching as to war 
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before 

With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before 

Going on before
