There's a half dressed mama running through the front yard
Waving a briefcase a hollerin'
There's mailman stumbling to his truck
With a dog on his leg that sure could use a collar and

I know there's times that you
Wish you had my point of view

I can see two skin-kneed boys down at the creek
Smoking daddy's cigarette butts
Down there's a man cussing me
'cause he got his car all washed and waxed up

But I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm just a bird singing my song

Looking down on the world below
Here they come and there they go
I'm a people watcher it's been a hobby of mine
For quite some time

And I might go out on a limb
Just to get a better look at them
Oh no, I'm a little too close
Better fly away

There's a See Rock City birdhouse
Where I like to hang out with but Johnny Shoots BBs
And Mrs. Cole's got a cement bowl
Where I'd like to take a bath but the cat might eat me

So I'll just stay up here
At least until the coast is clear

Lookin' down at the world below
Here they come and there they go
I'm a people watcher it's been a hobby of mine
For quite some time

And I might go out on a limb
Just to get a better look at them
Oh yeah

There's a millions stories that I could tell
Some of them I keep to myself
Just remember no matter what you do
Somebody's looking over you, yeah

Looking down on the world below
Here they come and there they go
I'm a people watcher it's been a hobby of mine
For quite some time

And I might go out on a limb
Just to get a better look at them
Oh no, I'm a little too close
I better fly away

Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
