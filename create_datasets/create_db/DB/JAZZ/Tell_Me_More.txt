Tell me more and more and then some
You know what I long to hear
I want more and more and then some
Of that "I Love You Only Dear"

Tell me more and more and then some
The way that you feel and then
When you've told that old sweet story
And you're through, start right in again
I've made that old mistake
Know the awful ache
Of a heart that's double crossed
The waitin's been so long
Hard to believ'in
If I've missed my guess, happiness is lost

Tell me more and more and then some
You know how I love that stuff
Whisper on from now
'Til Doomsday
But I never will hear enough

Tell me more and more and then some
The way that you feel and then
When you've told that old sweet story
And you're through, start right in again
I've made that old mistake
Know the awful ache
Of a heart that's double crossed
The waitin's been so long
Hard to believ'in
If I've missed my guess, happiness is lost

Tell me more and more and then some
You know how I love that stuff
Whisper on from now
'Til Doomsday
But I never will hear enough
