Throw yo' hands up in the air
If ya know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song right here
If ya know he love ya
Let, let, let, let me see you 2-step
If ya know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself
If ya know he love ya

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you

I know you think that I just be trippin' on ya
Boy you see, this ain't how I normally be
But I can't help this jealousy
Ooh it's taking over me, ooh I'm falling way to deep
Without you by my side I feel like I can't eat or sleep

But I, gotta come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I, gotta let you go, but baby I dont wanna
And I, I gotta see, that you and me, ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you

Baby, I can't help but fantasize
Wondering what it might be like
You and I sound so right
But I'mma let it go tonight, Ain't nothin'
Coverin' my eyes
Ain't gotta see it more than twice
I get it, I got it
Baby, baby

But I, gotta come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I, gotta let you go, but baby I dont wanna
And I, I gotta see, that you and me, ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
(Girl you better listen)

Alright, alright, alright, okay
I see ya point, I must admit
I grind, I grind, I grind all day
This paper's what I'm tryin' to get
Now normally when I'm paper chasing, I be having tunnel vision
And if it's really like that lady, just turn on ya television
And there go Young, I said there go Young, you tryin' to get it did
Just know I gets it done, she love the I cheat
She love the way I move, I sho, I show up to her
Shows wit bout 100 goons
Its black this, black that
Black card, black flags
I really hope that's money that y'all got off in them black bags (ha ha)
808's & heartbreak,
State troopers & interstates,
Giving me a bad vibe,
Guess I'm just a bad guy

Throw yo' hands up in the air
If ya know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song right here
If ya know he love ya
Let, let, let, let me see you 2-step
If ya know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself
If ya know he love ya
