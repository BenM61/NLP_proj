Three thousand miles of wilderness overcome by the flow
A lonely restitution of pavement, pomp and show
I seek a thousand answers, I find but one or two
I maintain no discomfiture, my path again renewed

Against the grain, that's where I'll stay
Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain

Here labeled as a lunatic, sequestered and content
There ignored and defeated by the government
There's an oriented public whose magnetic force will pull
But away from the potential of the individual

Against the grain, that's where I'll stay
Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain

The flow is getting stronger with small increments of time
And eddies of new ideas are increasingly hard to find
You need all that the other has, it's your right to seize the day
But in all your acquisitions you will soon be swept away

Against the grain, that's where I'll stay
Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain

There's a common consensus and an uncomfortable cheer
A reverberating chorus that anyone can hear
It sings 'leave your cares behind you, just grab tenaciously'
This lulling sense of purpose will destroy us rapidly

Against the grain, that's where I'll stay
Swimming upstream, I maintain against the grain

Against the grain, against the grain
Against the grain
