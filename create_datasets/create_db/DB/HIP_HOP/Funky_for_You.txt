Alright, Okay
Alright, we'll make it funky for you now

I'm a child of the, The 87
From the streets, get on a beat and go
I could break it down like whatever ya
On some K-are-S be here forever type
You-you-you-you know you shouldn't rhyme like
Let them pussy niggas get in your mind like
Baby boy you could do it take your time do it,
If you get the chance
To be a man in a B-boy stance and advanced from the go
I'll trace outer space with a
The baby-sitter of styles, I've traveled miles with
Bitches and, I've traveled miles with,
I've traveled miles with bitches and brew the ritual
Of the real
Your platinum but real don't feel you
You sampled real and then filtered
I'm built to last, at last I'm free
The Roots and SV be the family tree
SV and the Roots be the family tree
The Roots and SV and the tree is
Come on

As long as it's funky, alright, okay (yeah)
As long as it's funky, alright
As long as it's funky, alright, okay
As long as it's funky, funky for you now

I style for the oh, wild for the oh
Baby girl let's go half on a child for the oh
Lick shot's pop lock and blow for the oh
Like Ra-I'll move a crowd for the oh
You talkin' loud but ain't sayin' oh
Trickin' paper on a, Captain Save-a-oh
I've never been, the type of nigga,
To take, a broad to the courts
As a shorty I was always into sports
Now I talk to drums and walk in slums and thoughts that's oh
Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle
Even when it sound muffled,
I bust through, narrow gates,
With king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped
Before I came up I had to elevate
Let a nigga move where he want to move up to
You don't like how I'm living, well f*ck oh
I stuck to what I was on, a star is born on a cusp
Many angel's fell to the dust
Leavin' me to trust, only a oh
Leavin' me to trust y'all only a h
Leavin' me to trust in a, oh oh oh
Oh
Yo

As long as it's funky, alright, okay (yeah)
As long as it's funky, alright
As long as it's funky, alright, okay
As long as it's funky, funky for you now

Let your, imagination, dance to the
Dance to the, dance to the hey
Like nobody's watching in a B-boy stance to the hey
I'm funky like Africans in France to the hey
Yo hey, kick in the bass you,
Chasing paper like a bitch in a race
Spit on or death, I still ain't picked up the ace
The hundred, styles I run with thick in the race
So let's oh, yeah

As long as it's funky, alright, okay (yeah)
As long as it's funky, alright
As long as it's funky, alright, okay
As long as it's funky, funky for you now
