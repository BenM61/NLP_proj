I been going through some changes
Been running out of maybes
Boy I know ya losing patience
Losing patience with me

Sometimes I get fed up with all the games
Sometimes you all just act the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
That's just how the game goes
When your feeling alone
Everybody got somebody that they mess with on the low

Now I just want you to save me
I just want you to save me, oh

We got options
But I just wanna let you know that I decided
I finally realized that all I want is you

You
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you

I ain't like all them other girls
You can't treat me like them other girls no more
(No more)
You see me like another girl
I've been waiting for you to make a move
(Oh, oh, oh)

You know that I'm fed up with all the games
You all just act the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
That's just how the game goes
Just want someone to hold
Everybody needs somebody to be there when they're alone
I just want you to save me (yea)
Just want you to save me

We got options
But I wanna let you know that I decided
I finally realized that
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooh
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooh

We got options
But I wanna let you know that I decided
I finally realized that
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooh
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooh
