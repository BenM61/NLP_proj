Lead me on girl if you want
Take my heart and my love
Take of me all that you want

And if there's a thing that you need
I give you the breath that I breathe
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever, wherever, whatever baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever
Ba, ba, baby

Wish I knew if I could
Be the one that you would
Love forever and a day baby
Oh yeah, and if there's a thing that you need
For you and your blood that I will bleed, baby
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever, wherever, whatever baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever

Ba, ba, baby
Ba, ba, baby
Ba, ba, baby

And if there's a thing that you need
I give you the breath
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever, wherever, whatever baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever
