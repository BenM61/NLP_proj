These are Los Angeles Times
She is black and white
She is New York Times
With all its torn up streets
In a fashion magazine

Beautiful beautiful times 
I found it in you
Beautiful beautiful nights 
Spending with you
Beautiful beautiful lights 
Shining through you
Beautiful beautiful nights 
Spending with you

We're all shooting stars
So fly me to the moon
Your electricity
Lights up the city to see

Beautiful beautiful times 
I found it in you
Beautiful beautiful nights 
Spending with you
Beautiful beautiful lights 
Shining through you
Beautiful beautiful

I keep running to you
Beautiful beautiful times 
I found it in you
Beautiful beautiful nights 
Spending with you
Beautiful beautiful lights 
Shining through you
Beautiful beautiful times 
Spending with you
Yeah shining through you

I keep running to you
