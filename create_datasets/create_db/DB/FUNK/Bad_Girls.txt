Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking about bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night (walkin')
Picking up on all kinds of strangers 
If the price is right
You can't score if you're pocket's tight
But you want a good time

You ask yourself who they are
Like everybody else, they come from near and far

(Bad girls yeah) bad girls (bad girls)
Talking about the sad girls (sad girls)
Sad girls (sad girls)
Talking about bad girls, yeah

Friday night, and the strip is hot 
Sun's gone down, and they're out to trot (out to trot)
Spirit's high, and legs look hot
Do you wanna get down?

Now, don't you ask yourself who they are?
Like everybody else, they wanna be a star

Bad girl, sad girl
You're such a naughty bad girl, bee-beep uh huh

You're bad girl, you're sad girl
You're such a naughty bad girl, bee-beep uh huh

Now, you and me, we're both the same (both the same)
But you call yourself by different names (different names)
Now, your mama won't like it when she finds out (finds out)
Girl is out at night

With you, you got it, with you
