When I look at you
What I see is my future wife to be
Only God Himself
More important in this life to me

You've been there for me
Nurtured and cared for me
Never left my side
In you I can confide

Love it, love it, love it
(I love it, everything about you)
Love it, love it, love it
(Love it, hey, good and the bad)

You know I love it
(I love it)
Love it
(Can't imagine life without you)
Love it, love it, love it
(Oh)

Give me peace of mind
Conversation be so soothing
Disagree sometimes
But it only shows we're human

'Cause I'll take one for ya
Like you were the president
The love I have for you
One couldn't even measure it

Love it, love it, love it
(Ho, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(Everything about you)

You know I love it, love it
(Can't imagine life without you)
Love it, love it, love it
(Ho, I love it, love it)

Love it, love it, love it
(Everything about you)
Love it, love it, love it
(Love could end the pain)

You know I love it, love it
(Hey, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(I love it)

And your love make this life worth livin'
Give so much of yourself and you keep on givin'
Givin' me everything I need
Baby, what more can I ask for?

Love it, love it, love it
(Baby, and I love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(Good and the bad)
You know I love it
(Whoa, oh)
Love it
(Baby, I love it)

Love it, love it, love it
(Everything about you and I love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(Baby)
Love it, love it, love it
(Whoa, ho, hey, yeah)

You know I love it, love it
(I love it, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(I love it, love it, I love it)

(Love it, love it, love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(Love it, love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
Love it, love it, love it

You know I love it
(I love it)
Love it
(Everything about you, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it
(Hey, hey, yeah)

Love it, love it, love it
(Oh)
Love it, love it, love it
