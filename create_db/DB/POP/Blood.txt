Tell me who doesn't love 
What can never come back 
You can never forget how it used to feel 
The illusion is deep 
Its as deep as the night 
I can tell by your tears you remember it all 
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ 
Though it clouds my eyes 
I can never stop 

How it feels to be dry 
Walking bare in the sun 
Every mirage I see is a mirage of you 
As I cool in the twilight 
Taste the salt on my skin 
I recall all the tears 
All the broken words 

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ 
Though it clouds my eyes 
I can never stop 

When the sunsets glow drifts away from you 
You'll no longer know 
If any of this was really true at all
