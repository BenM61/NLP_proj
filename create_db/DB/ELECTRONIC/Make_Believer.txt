Oh, I love my make believer
Take me on a trip
From fantasy to fever

Oh, I love my make believer
Take me on a trip
From fantasy to fever

Flying high in your starry eyes
Oh I'm never coming down
In a blink I'm hypnotized
And your voice is the only sound

I let you lead me, let you take control
Will you bless my heart or curse my soul
I hope you know that you're the only one
So before too long, dominate my dreams tonight

Oh, I love my make believer
Take me on a trip
From fantasy to fever

And now I'm lost inside your mind
It's a maze in so many ways
You keep me guessing all the time
Lover come now but will you stay

I know you're gonna make your move sometime
It'll be sublime
While you blow my mind
We'll both be shining in your golden glow
And that's all I know
Dominate my dreams tonight

I love my make believer
Take me on a trip
From fantasy to fever

Oh, I love my make believer
Take me on a trip
From fantasy to fever
