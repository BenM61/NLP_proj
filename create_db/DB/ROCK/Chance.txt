All the rain came down
On a cold new town
As he carried you away
From your father's hand
That always seemed like a fist
Reaching out to make you pay
He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
