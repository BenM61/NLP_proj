Can you stop your instincts 
Can you man your thought control, sir? 
Will you give the last command 
Or lie to a good soldier 

I'm a doubter 
I'm a fool 
Let me be 
All that I am 

I am not so sure 
What you want me for 
Either your machine 
Is a fool, or me

Now there is no time to wait 
No time to think it over 
Take the path, believe the math 
You'll tell me when it's over 

I'm a fighter 
I've a question 
Won't you answer me? 

I have earned the right to know 
And tell you what I see 

I am not so sure 
What you want me for 
Either your machine 
Is a fool, or me
