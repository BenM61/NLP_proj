I knew you when
I had a friend
Very deeply
Love lived within
But somehow we got loose
From what was oh so tight
Somewhere we went wrong
When we were oh so right

What's a man to do when he just can't take no more
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door
Now I've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends

[Chorus]
I'm emotional
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you

You seem to hurt me purposely
I didn't understand it
Oh girl, why me
I had no choice
What was best for us
Was to terminate our love and be free

What's a man to do when he just can't take no more
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends

[Chorus: x2]

What's a man to do when he just can't take no more
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends

[Chorus: x2]

I'm emotional
Look at me
I can't stop crying
Inside my heart
It's slowly dying
Oh Oh
Gotta let you let you go
That the love we once shared you know is thorough
