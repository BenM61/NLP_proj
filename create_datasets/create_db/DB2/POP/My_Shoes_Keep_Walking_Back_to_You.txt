I may say that I don't care
Hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through
My heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all

And my arms keep reaching for you
My-why eyes keep searching for you
My-why lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

No matter how much I pretend
I wish I had you back again
For nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die
The day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do

And my-why arms keep reaching for you
My-why eyes keep searching for you
My-why lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
