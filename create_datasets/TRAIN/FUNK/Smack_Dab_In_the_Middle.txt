Pick me a town in any clime
Where people like a rockin time
And stay awake both day and night
Till everybody's feelin good an' right

Then throw me (smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be (smack dab in the middle)
Ahhhhh, smack dab in the middle, boys now
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

Ten Cadillacs, a diamond mill
Ten suits of clothes to dress to kill
A ten room house, some Bar B Q
And fifty chicks not over twenty-two

Then throw me (smack dab in the middle)
Oh, I wanna be (smack dab in the middle)
Ahhhhh, now boys you can see why
I wanna be smack dab in the middle now
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

One hundred beds with chorus girls
A street that's paved with natural pearls
A wagon load of bonds and stocks
Then open up the door at Fort Knox

Then throw me (smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be (smack dab in the middle)
Ahhhhh, now listen boys throw me
Smack dab in the middle right now
So Ray can rock and roll to satisfy his soul

That's all right!

A lot of bread and gangs of meat
Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
Bicarbonated soda by the pound

Then throw me (smack dab in the middle)
I picture it (smack dab in the middle)
Ah, throw me now, smack dab in the middle right now
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

Alright!
