See the white clouds roll in
Spirits lying next to me
Catch the wildflower falling
It's the wound that never bleeds
Hear the Sirens calling
Spinning out their show
Hold, the moment close to me
Take it down too slow

Be mine, be mine, War Babies
Be mine, be mine, War Babies

Can you still keep going?
Shattered pieces left inside
To face the final, knowing
That there's somethings you can't hide

Be mine, be mine, War Babies
Be mine, be mine, War Babies

So will the force let go?
Or will the phantoms stay?
Let the foreteller be your sight
It feels like something's happening today

Some shame's like no other
And nothing feels the same
Nothing feels the same
War Babies
Be mine, be mine, War Babies
Nothing feels the same
War Babies
War Babies
Nothing feels the same
Be mine
Be mine
War Babie
