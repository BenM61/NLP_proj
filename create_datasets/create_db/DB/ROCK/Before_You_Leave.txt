Stay, stay a little longer. 
Do you have to go away?
Stay stay for tomorrow. 
Then I will know, if I'd rather be alone.

Take, take a moment of time and turn it back 
So we can start from scratch 
Suppose, I'll leave all I've got 
Would it make it easier on your heart? 

Well I'll take what I can before you leave
If that is just a smile 
I'll stay up all night, so I can watch you breathe 
If that is alright
Come on and show me that silky skin 
You're oh so fine
I know we could turn it right 
I know we could turn it right 

Throw; throw me a lifeline way out to sea 
Would you save me if it all goes wrong? 
Grab, grab me 'cause I'm yours 
Forever that's for sure
Because that's what I want you to tell me 

Well I'll take what I can before you leave 
If that is just a smile
I'll stay up all night so I can watch you breathe 
If that is alright
Come on and show me that silky skin 
You're oh so fine 
I know we could turn it right 
I know we could turn it right 

But it's all an illusion 
Easier said than done 
Let's make a conclusion 
Is it worth giving it a try? 

Well I'll take what I can before you leave 
If that is just a smile 
I'll stay up all night so I can watch you breathe
If that is alright
Come on and show me that silky skin 
You're oh so fine 
I know we could turn it right 
I know we could turn it right 

Come on and show me that silky skin 
You're oh so fine 
I know we could turn it right 
I know we could turn it right
