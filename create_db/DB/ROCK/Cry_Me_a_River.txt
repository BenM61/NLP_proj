Cry me a river?

Now, you said that you love me
After being so untrue

I want you to cry

(Cry me a river)

Over me
(Cry me a river)
Oh yeah

Now, you say that you're sorry
Oh, for being so unkind

I want you to cry
(Cry me a river)

(Cry me a river)

Want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
Right on me, yeah
(Cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head, never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me

(Cry me a river)
Come on, love
(Cry me a river)
Want you to cry

(Cry me a river)
Down your head
(Cry me a river)
Ow, cry

Cry me a river
(Cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head, ooh, never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me

River, over
