I had a dance with the devil
I couldn't keep his pace
He gave a train my cackle
I tried to hide my face
Tried to stay on the narrow
Strait's come to an end
I seek a prose or a pep talk
I need your help my friend

Woe is me
Just give it up
As the night draws in
We're all seeking love
Woe is me
Just give it up
As the night draws in
We're all seeking love

One step at a time
Tattered on our foot
You gave me food for thought
We're packed in on the tube
Bee's sweat on the mission
Crawling down my cheek
Eyes wide like a flatscreen
I haven't reached my peak

Woe is me
Just give it up
As the night draws in
We're all seeking love
Woe is me
Just give it up
As the night draws in
We're all seeking love

Who gives a f*ck if you be acting a clown?
Pass the queen's head and watch it go down
Tit for tat gets a young girl's passion
Hold it on tight to that glass of fashion
Knocking down the spirits till you're dropped to your knees
Don't sneeze, (?) please
We're dancing 'round the (?) in this whimsical sea
And if I be wicked then woe unto me

Woe is me
Just give it up
As the night draws in
We're all seeking love
Woe is me
Just give it up
As the night draws in
We're all seeking love
We're all seeking love
