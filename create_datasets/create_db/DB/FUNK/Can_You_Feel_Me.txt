Baby, can you feel me?
You know what I wanna do
I wanna kick it with you

Honey, did you hear me?
It's so easy to do
I just wanna spend some time with you

We don't have to pretend
That I just want to be friends
Let's not waste our time
I'll say what's on my mind

Now I step to ya
'Cause one night I'd like to do ya
I don't always act this way
But honey, you're so fine

If you like that I'm saying
We could be parlaying
Girl, you've got to put me on

Give us a chance to have romance
Let me hit it till the morning comes
All night, all night

Baby, can you feel me?
You know what I wanna do
I wanna kick it with you

Honey, did you hear me?
It's so easy to do
I just wanna spend some time with you

I see you looking with that same old smile
Girl, what's on your mind?
Let's disappear for a while
All night, all night

Baby, we're right here
You don't have to be scared
A love like yours should be shared

If you like what I'm saying
We could be parlaying
Girl, you've got to put me on

Give us a chance to have romance
Girl, let me hit it till the morning comes
All night, all night

Girl, you know that I need your love
Come on, baby, come on, yeah

I keep you smiling all night long
With the things I'll do, I'll make it good for you
