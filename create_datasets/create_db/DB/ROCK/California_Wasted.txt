Oh time
Where did time go
What was I thinking
No compass no map
No sail on the mast
This boat is sinking
We're going down
There's too much in my head right now
Got no way to slow it down
No one's gonna pull me out
Oh I still make the same mistakes
Oh California's wasted on me
Stare at the sun
Let the fire fill my eyes
See nothing but light
Endless day banish the night
I have to set this right
There's too much in my head right now
Got no way to slow it down
No one's gonna pull me out
Oh I still make the same mistakes
Oh California's wasted on me
At the line
Where the ocean meets the sky
I've been hoping I can see inside
Hoping I can see a sign
There's too much in my head right now
Got no way to slow it down
No one's gonna pull me out
Oh I still make the same mistakes
Oh California's wasted on me
I still make the same mistakes
I'm wasted out in California 
There's too much in my head right now 
I'm wasted
Too much in my head right now
Oh California's wasted on me
