Everyone had the same rules 
But still they had to cheat and play this game wrong 
Why do they lie? 
Why do they deceive? 

This generation colonized the four corners of this Earth as its playground 
To kill its own genus 
Was trust only a word? 
Who is venom to our truths? 

Where are the "ones" whose rumors have wrong colors? 
Seek these "ones"
Seek these "ones" tear the last knife from your back 

Is there still someone somewhere 
Who is venom to our truths? 

Seek these "ones", tear the last knife from your back 

Was trust only a word? 
One syllable away from attack 
Was trust only a word? 
One fucking syllable away from attack
