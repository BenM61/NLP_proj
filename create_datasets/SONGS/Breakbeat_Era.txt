Underneath the moon
The tumult that forces me to action
'Cause I don't care what car they drive
My ministry's the men who need to play

Underneath the moon
The tumult that forces me to action
There's so much dross
Try me one more time
Before it's really gone forever

'Cause life was talking through you mister
I'm just listening to your system
One and one ennui makes nothing
You and you and me makes something

Life was talking through you mister
Words to hit you like a piston
One and one ennui make nothing
You and you and me makes something

Struggling with realization
I was hoping you would do it for me
Someone backed me in a corner
Grimed me with some slimy stories

Life was talking through you mister
Words to hit you like a piston
One and one ennui make nothing
You and you and me make something

Hey, this new girl, right, right now

Underneath the moon
The tumult that forces me to action
'Cause I don't care what car they drive
My ministry's the men who need to play
