We're just a gleam in lover's eyes, steam on sweaty bodies in the night
One of us might make it through, the rest will disappear like dew
Pressure building, gettin' hot, give it, give it, give it all you got
When that love explosion comes, my, oh my, we want to be someone

Tryouts for the human race, from Burlington to Bonn
Ah, we are a quarter-billion strong
Tryouts for the human race, from twilight time 'til dawn
We just want to be someone

We're the future and the past, we're the only way you're gonna last
We're just pawns in a funny game, tiny actors in the oldest play
It's an angry sea we face, just to get the chance to join the race
Gotta make it, gotta try, gotta get the chance to live and die

Tryouts for the human race, from Burlington to Bonn
Ah, we are a quarter-billion strong
Tryouts for the human race, from twilight time 'til dawn
We just want to be someone

We must, we must, we must leave from here
We must, we must, we must, we must leave from here
Gotta make our play, gotta get away
Gotta make our play, gotta get away
Gotta make our play, gotta get away
Gotta make our play

Let us out of here, let us out of here, let us out of here
We just want to feel the sun and be your little daughter or your son
We're just words that lovers use, words thaat light that automatic fuse
When that love explosion comes, my, oh my, we want to be someone

Tryouts for the human race, from Burlington to Bonn
Ah, we are a quarter-billion strong
Tryouts for the human race, from twilight time 'til dawn
We just want to be someone
