entropy's in, 
embroidered on skin. 
corrupt, 
latch-hook thin for show, 
you're in at dusk, 
they clean you up until you glow. 

absenter. 
absenter. 

secede, recede, 
I'll mark your retreat 
layers at a time. 
get what you need. 
you're: marks on tiles, 
piss in the flowerbed, 
scabs on knees. 

absenter. 
absenter. 

save a little bit. 
save it, 
send it back to me. 

absenter. 
absenter. 
absenter. 
absenter. 
absenter. 
absenter.
