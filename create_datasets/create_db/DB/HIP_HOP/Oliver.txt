For what you are about to receive
May the lord make you truly thankful.
Amen
Please, Sir, I want some more.

What?!
Please, Sir, I want some more.
More!?

Catch him!
Snatch him!
Hold him!
Scold him!

Pounce him!
Trounce him!
Pick him up and bounce him!

Wait!
Before we put the lad to task
May I be so crious as to ask
His name?

O-li-ver.
Oliver! Oliver!

Never before has a boy wanted more!
Oliver! Oliver!
Won't ask for more when he knows what's in store.

There a dar, thin, winding stairway
Wit out an bannister
While we'll throuwhim down, and feed him on
Cockrouches served in a canister

Oliver! Oliver!
What will he do when he's turned black and blue?
He will curse the day
Somebody named him
O-li-ver!

Oliver! Oliver!
Never before has a boy wanted more!
Oliver! Oliver!

Won't ask for more
When he knows what's in store.
There's a sooty chimney
Long overdue for a sweeping out
Which we'll push him up,
And one day next year with the rats he'll be creeping out.

Oliver! Oliver!
What will her do?
In this terrible stew?
He will rue the day somebody name him.
O-li-ver!

Oliver!
Oliver!
Never before has a boy asked for more
Oliver!
Oliver!

Pray some decorum restore, I implore
Let us face this case, it's
Unpreedented, qute utterly

He's disgraced this place.
Encouraging others to swallow in gluttony.

Oliver! Oliver!
Lock him in jail
And then put him on sale,
For the highest bid
Glad to be rid
Off
O-li-ver!

Lock him up
Collect his belongings then bring him back to me
when you've done.
To bed, all of you
