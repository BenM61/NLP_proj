Baby I was born to give you all of my love 
Baby I was born to give you all of my time
Just so we can be together
And share a love, to last forever baby (to last forever)
The best thing you gave was sent to me
That we should spend some time apart
Why did you go and do that
Baby I just came to get
If you don't want me tell me

Girl if you don't really love me 
Just let me know you would see
On the way it shouldn't be
Girl if you don't really love me 
Just let me go let me be
So I can find someone to love me

To let you play with my heart
And what kind of fool do you take me for baby
