Oh dang.
What is it dawg?
I forgot it's Mothers Day.
Didn't get a gift for her.
Other plans got in the way.
She'll be so disappointed.
Damn I forgot it too.
This could have been avoided.
What the hell are we gonna do?
My moms been so forlorn ever since my daddy left.
Cold.
No one to hold her tight.
Life has put her to the test.
I know just what you mean,
My moms been so sad and gray.
Word
My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom ever since he passed away.
Hold up!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too.
Slow up!
What time is it dawg?
It's time for a switcharoo
We both love our moms, women with grown women needs
I say we break em off
Show 'em how much they really mean
'Cause

I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should f*ck each others mothers
F*ck each others moms
Pushin' that place that you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy
Fuckin' each others moms

'Cause every Mothers Day needs a Mothers Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin on you cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover

I'm layin' in the cut waitin' for your mom
Clutchin' on this lube and roses
I got my digital camera,
I'm gonna make your momma do a million poses
They will be so surprised
We are so cool and thoughtful
Can't wait to pork your mom
I'm gonna be the syrup, she can be my waffle
Sho nuff!
My mother loves bubble bath with chamomile
Straight up!
Give it to my mom d d d d d d doggystyle
This the perfect plan
For a perfect Mothers Day
They have to rename this one
All up under the covers day

'Cause I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should f*ck each others mothers
F*ck each others moms
I'm pushin' that lady
Where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy
Fuckin' each others moms

Break it down

It would be my honor to be your new step-father
It would be my honor to be your new step-father
While your in my mother make me another brother.
And I'm in your mother I'll never use a rubber
Oh!

'Cause every Mothers Day needs a Mothers Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin' on you cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover
They blessed us both with the gift of life
She brought you in this world so Imma sex her right
This is the second best idea that we've ever had
The choice can be no other
Be my mother lover
