Passion for the finer things
And you know that its only getting worst, only getting worst
I ain't got no diamond rings, but you know that
I'm gonna make it work, gonna make it work
So y'all can dine with me, shine with me
Ride with me, grind with me, climb with me
Long as you down for me, round for me
Its gonna be, everything, you ever dreamed

Hey ah hey ah (heyy) hey ah hey ah (heyy)
I'm saying last time that I look, things look real good
Hey ah hey ah (heyy) hey ah hey ah (heyy)
And if you look around the town, you can see I hold it down
(Baby) I'm getting this money, out here in LA (LA)
Beach side in Miami (Miami) that's everyday
I want to live, like this forever (ever)
Everyday is adventure (adventure)
This life that I own (own)
This life that I want (want)

Ohh woahh, and if you want to fade into the night
Then we can do it how every you like
And if you look around the town, you can see how I hold it down (oh)

Living loving everyday and you know that
Its passing, passing by, passing, passing, by
Early mornings, working late
So you know so you know my only limit is the sky, limit is the sky
I want y'all can dine with me, shine with me
Ride with me, grind with me, climb with me
Long as you down for me, round for me
Its gonna be, everything, you ever dreamed

Hey ah hey ah (heyy) hey ah hey ah (heyy)
I'm saying last time that I look, things look real good
Hey ah hey ah (heyy) hey ah hey ah (heyy)
And if you look around the town, you can see I hold it down
(Baby) I'm getting this money, out here in LA (LA)
Beach side in Miami (Miami) that's everyday
I want to live, like this forever (ever)
Everyday is adventure (adventure)
This life that I own (own) this life that I want (want)

Ohh woahh, and if you want to fade into the night
Then we can do it how every you like
And if you look around the town, you can see how I hold it down (oh)

Feels like I'm on top of the world
Looking down, everybody staring
Looking at me for their fashion and style
So they know what they should be wearing
(Ohh) Made some money, now I deserve my time
And now that I'm coppin whatever I want
My whole team gon' be fine

Hey ah hey ah (heyy) hey ah hey ah (heyy)
I'm saying last time that I look, things look real good
Hey ah hey ah (heyy) hey ah hey ah (heyy)
And if you look around the town, you can see I hold it down (baby)

Beach side in Miami (Miami) that's everyday

This life that I want (want)

Ohh woahh, and if you want to fade into the night
Then we can do it how every you like
And if you look around the town, you can see how I hold it down
