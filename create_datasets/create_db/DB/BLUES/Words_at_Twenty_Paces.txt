Just like a western movie, a challenge has been made.
A shot was fired in anger, and pride stepped off the train.
Won't we ever stop this killin', me and you, till our hearts are up on boot hill and there's nothing we can do? 

Words at twenty paces, anger at high noon.
This house ain't big enough for both of us. it's comin' soon.
We'll finish off our happiness and run hope out of town.
With words at twenty paces, lord, it's love we're gunnin' down.

How did we ever lose the dreams we used to share, the gentle touch, the words of love, the way we used to care? 
Sometimes you words cut like a bullet in my side.
Oh, which is more important, wounded hearts or wounded pride? 

I've got my ammunition. I know you've got yours too.
We know each other's weakness; lord, the damage we can do.
Why can't we just step aside and put our guns away? 
Let love come like the cavalry: ride in and save the day? 

Words at twenty paces, anger at high noon.
This house ain't big enough for both of us. it's comin' soon.
We'll finish off our happiness and run hope out of town.
With words at twenty paces, lord, it's love we're gunnin' down.
