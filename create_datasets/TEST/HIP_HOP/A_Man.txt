Don't let nobody treat me like crap
I'm pulling heads off sharp and smack em off francs 
The best in these days I smoke on these tracks 
I'm gonna mash your plan for holding me back  
Jump up rush the office with the gat 
Letting the niggas see where my mind is at
Hurry up to the walls see how I react
But I keep coming back and that's for a fact   
I got to be, but no road I got dropped 
And take each day the bullshit don't stop
Got to act with the man cause I don't suck cock
No matter how bad I want to get to the top
The music go out like a fucking lot
With the key and the ? I rap and just stop
Come and see me on a "soul assas" trip 
Hitting stage, generate, pumping all that

You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fucking man!
You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fucking man!

If y'all ever need help I don't wait
And I come from some shit that's put away
I hit these suckers that think they so great
Still a nigga die, so they can update
No matter how you try you'll always be fate
Breaking off chunks off of what I create
I see that liquorish all over your face 
Backstab a nigga in the mist of the chase
F*ck the bullshit let's get to the bottom
Stomping punk styles, aging rock got em
Only thing I don't want to say when I drop em
Loading my shells so don't try to hock em
Hitting the ? with the jig-ass beats
Bite my style, is the only way to compete
Smoke anybody if I ever ?
And anybody else that want to f*ck with me 

You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fucking man!
You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fucking man!

I sing funky-ass shit that I bring
? a lot when I do my thing
Check it out y'all ain't no one nicer 
Got it going on with the mighty want to cipher
Got a women crazy when I beg
And hip-hop styles with the ss thing
Trust no one ain't nobody your friend 
Cause this business hear all about to end
Don't mean coming back when they bust the raps
And all the little things of the nicer tracks 
Hanging out in this uniform
Keep what I'm doing here all night long
Is to keep it going, bring the thunder and pain
Ain't bitches same since I went insane
Fucking with these bitches up in this game 
To the ? on my fucking train

You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fucking man!
You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fucking man!
