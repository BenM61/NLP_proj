(Tramp!)
What you call me? (tramp!)
No you didn't! (you don't wear continental clothes, or Stetson hats)
Well, I tell you one doggone thing
It makes me feel good to know one thing, I know I am a lover
(Matter of opinion) that's all right, mama was, papa too 
And I'm the only child, lovin' is all I know to do
(You know what, Otis?) what? (you're country)
That's all right (you straight from the Georgia woods) that's good!
(You know what, you wear overalls)
(And big old brogan shoes)
And you need a haircut, tramp (haircut, woman, you foolin', ooh, I'm a lover)
Mama was, grandmama, papa too, boogaloo, all that stuff
And I'm the only son-of-a-gun this side of the Sun

Tramp! (yeah, that's what you are)

(You know what, Otis? I don't care what you say, you're still a tramp) what?
(That's right, you haven't even got a fat bankroll in your pocket) 
(You probably haven't even got twenty-five cents)
I got six Cadillacs, five Lincolns, four Fords
Six Mercuries, three T-Birds, Mustangs, ooh, I'm a lover 
My mama was, my papa too
I'm gonna tell you one thing (well, tell me)
I'm the only son-of-a-gun this side of the sun.

(You're a tramp, Otis) (no I'm not)
(I don't care what you say, you're still a tramp) what's wrong with that?
(Lookee here, ou ain't got no money) I got everything
(You can't buy me all those minks and sables and all that stuff I want)
I can buy you minks, rats, frogs, squirrels, rabbits, anything you want, woman
(Look, you can go out in the Georgia woods and catch them, baby)
Oh, you goofy, now (no, you're still a tramp) that's all right
(Tramp, Otis, you just a tramp) that's all right, that's all right
You wear overalls, you need a haircut, baby 
Cut off some of that hair off your head
You think you a lover, huh?
