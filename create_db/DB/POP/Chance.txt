When you see me in the club with another guy
Remember it was you who said goodbye
You expected me to sit around and wait for you
I'm telling you boy that you're not that fly

See you're the one who told me a pack of lies
It was obvious from the guilty look in your eyes
But really boy it comes as no surprise
That you were playing me
Now you thought it was enought to spend your money on me
When I really wanna spend time in your company
I tried so many times to make you see
That you can't buy my love

[Chorus]
When you see me in the club with another guy
Remember it was you who said goodbye
You expected me to sit around and wait for you
I'm telling you boy that you're not that fly
Now you're watching me on the dancefloor
Wishing you and I could've been more
You had your chance with me

Now I'm free to do whatever the hell I like
I can call my girls and go out and party all night
My soul has been uplifted and it feels so right
Now you're not in my heart

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
Uh, come on, it ain't your birthday, it ain't your birthday
Uh, come on, it ain't your birthday, it ain't your birthday
Don't think I don't know boy
My cash, it brought you joy
Most things you own, don't mean to moan but it's not OK, boy
Don't think I don't know boy
My cash, it brought you joy
You had your chance with me

[Repeat Chorus x2]
[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
