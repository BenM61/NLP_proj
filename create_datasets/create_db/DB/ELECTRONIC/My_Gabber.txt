My gabber is my best friend, my mate
When I'm in the field, and I'm with you
Then I'm with you my friend, my mate
My hooligan

My gabber is my best friend, my mate
When I'm in the field, and I'm with you
Then I'm with you my friend, my mate
Because our friendship never dies

Yes

My gabber is my best friend, my mate (my mate, my mate)
Everybody
My gabber is my best friend, my mate (mate, mate, mate)
Because our friendship never dies

(My hooligan)
Never on our own because we are one
Getting into trouble ever since we're young
It's time to raise your fist and let them know
Join the revolution, all fucking go

My gabber is my best friend, my mate

Because our friendship never dies

Through good days and the bad
Always have each others back
F*ck what other people said
What you see is what you get
It's time to raise your fist and let them know
Join the revolution, all fucking go

My gabber is my best friend, my mate
When I'm in the field, and I'm with you
Then I'm with you my friend, my mate
My hooligan

My gabber is my best friend, my mate
When I'm in the field, and I'm with you
Then I'm with you my friend, my mate
