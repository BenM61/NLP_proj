I bring it out
I bring it out
I bring it out

I beat it up
I bang it out
I bang it out

Sparks go flying on the kitchen floor
In my mind I'm already inside you
Bright lights, champagne, I need some new strange
Need to find that something I'm not used to

My only side to rock are the rich girls
Stealing daddy's money and we'll rule the world

I need a ride or die
Type of girl who lie
Likes to come in high
Swing in the parking lot
She tells me what she want
I give her all I got

I beat it up
I bang it out
Until the sun comes up
I bang it out
Until you scream, my love
So tell me what you want
You know what I want
I give her all I got
I beat it up
I bang it out

Sweat is dripping like a shower
I love the way she rises down the rear view
Fast life now bring on that new strange
She's the one that I can get used to

My only side to rock are the rich girls
Stealing daddy's money and we'll rule the world

I need a ride or die
Type of girl who lie
Likes to come in high
Swing in the parking lot
She tells me what she want
I give her all I got

I beat it up
I bang it out
Until the sun comes up
I bang it out
Until you scream, my love
So tell me what you want
You know what I want
I give her all I got
I beat it up
I bang it out

I bang it out
I give her all I got
I beat it up
I bang it out

Give me all you've got when ya
You know what I want

Bang it out
Like a drug
'Till I see the sun
'Till my eyes roll back
'Till my body goes numb
I need a ride or die
Type of guy tonight

I beat it up
I bang it out
Until the sun comes up
I bang it out
Until you scream, my love
So tell me what you want
You know what I want
I give her all I got
I beat it up
I bang it out

Until the sun comes up
I bang it out
Until you scream, my love
So tell me what you want
You know what I want
I give her all I got
I beat it up
I bang it out
