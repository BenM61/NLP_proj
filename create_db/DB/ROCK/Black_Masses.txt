Come and join
My black masses
Bring along
Your iron axes
Now draw a circle
Right here in the light
I'll tell you
Just what to write

Elohim...Adonai...Tetragrammaton

Slaughtering babies
In ceremonial ways
If we're lucky
We can see them for days
'cause baby blood
Is full of strength
But I tell you
Oh how it stinks

Give me some baby blood

Elohim...Adonai...Tetragrammaton

Black masses, black masses, black masses
Runnin' wild

Spittin' blood
In my lady's face
I show her my pets
A few rotten heads
And about my lady
If she can't take it
She's got to face it
I'll slaughter her too

Come and join
My black masses
Bring along
Your iron axes
Now draw a circle
Right here in the light
I'll tell you
Just what to write

Elohim...Adonai...Tetragrammaton

Black masses, black masses, black masses
Killin' babies, black masses.
