Shine season
Y'all niggas still in the bleachers
Mula
Good looking, yeah
Money
Yea boy

In and out of town on mothers
Skin brown so the cops busting
Cockroaches ain't got to love me
Top charts since dropping Lotus
Drop top, the car show it
Drop top, your bra showing
Tammy Lahren, I ain't ready for you
All the Becky's want a uncle Tom Sawyer
Race draft first pick
John Lennon for Don Lemon
Omarosa for a palm tree
Your lil' son see we both shady niggas
DC crazy nigga
Woop woop
PG crazy nigga
Woop woop
We see twelve pull up
Woop woop
Feet don't fail me nigga
I got the moves like Sean tonight
I got the juice like soccer wives
I ain't romantic but I got a Wraith
So take the pussy under stars tonight
If it's on, then it's on for life
If it's squad, then it's squad for life
If it's a foreign in your neighborhood and you see a Ghost say Folarin in it right
That petty humor make your bitch choose
House wives call me home improvement
I say your name they say mani-pedi, they don't even got a toe or nail improvement
Hottest out, what I got to do to show you stupid putos who the hottest doing?
What they trying to do but they as not as fluent
Shine season give me number two
Money where is number, number two
I just did a fucking number two
Money where is number, number two
I just did a fucking number two
Shine season and it's my season heard that Cool and Dre is in the other room
Keep going

Oh shit this the part where the shit goes left, right?
Or do it go right?
Or no we go up
Whatever
Talk to them
