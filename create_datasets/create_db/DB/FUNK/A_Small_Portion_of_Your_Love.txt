Just a small portion of your love winds me up like a clock
Just a small portion of your love, I'm like a river, a runnin' never stop
Oh, just a little bit goes a long way
Just as long as I get a little, each and every day

Just a small portion of your love seems to rule my troubles away
Just a small portion of your love and I'll go to work all for no pay
Your love that's so fine and oh how it soothe my time
But goin' out, get you, give me peace of mind

Oh baby, you don't know what you do for me
Oh baby, I don't have no misery

Just a small portion of your love, just a small portion of your love
Oh baby, you don't know what you do for me
Oh baby, I don't have no misery
Just a small portion of your love
Just a small portion
