Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair [2x]

drillin' a hole with my soul
In the sand
Diggin' for gold
For the hole [whore?], in the bed
Catchin' a ride from a band
I sat in the back of the van
They tried to make me understand
'cause if I'm not in a band, don't mean I'm square
And if I am, well then I don't care

wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair

number two has got me confused
Hope I'll always be numbers one and three [2x]

wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair [2x]

drillin' a hole with my soul
In the sand
Diggin' for gold
For the ho, in the bed
Catchin' a ride from a band
I sat in the back of the van
They tried to make me understand
That if I'm not in a band, doesn't mean I'm square
And if I am, well then I don't care

wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair [2x]

you said, hell, well I don't care
If you run your hands through my car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair
You said, hell, well I don't care
If you run your hands through my car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair
You said, hell, well I don't care
If you run your hands through my car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair
