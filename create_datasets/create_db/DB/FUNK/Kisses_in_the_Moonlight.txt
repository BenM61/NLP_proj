Oh, what a night
Now don't you feel like flyin'
Everything's right
You can't blame me for tryin'

Love, look up there
The stars are all aligned
Now don't you think it's time, ho, ho, ho

Closer to me
I want to feel your breathing permanently
Cause darling, I'm not leaving here
Till I get what I've been waiting for
Some twenty-five or more
That's all I need, oh

Kisses in the moonlight, sugar
That would make this night complete
There have got to be
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
Fly away with me

Most of our days
We get so busy runnin'
Lost in a maze
We've got no time for fun and dreams

Every now and then
A dream is real
And this is how it feels, yeah, yeah

For once in your life
Forget about tomorrow
Tonight is the night
Our worries seems so far away

You'll hold me in your arms
So tenderly
I only want a taste
Of your sweet, sweet, ooh

Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
That would make this night complete
There have got to be
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
Fly away with me
Oh, fly away with me

Don't let this night end right now
Cause in your arms is where I need to be
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Kisses in the moonlight
And you know
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh

Oh, kisses in the moonlight, hey
That would make this night complete
There have got to be
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
Fly away with me

Oh, kisses in the moonlight, ho, baby, ho
That would make this night complete
There have got to be
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
Fly away with me

Oh, kisses in the moonlight
