Sun is hanging low across the street
As we're fighting, loving, talking in the heat
We're all walking home barely
Everyday we'll meet, everyday we'll meet, do the same

I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my own
I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my way home

We could dance all night and sleep all day
Kiss and love and just walk away
Took pride in all the rules and disobey
Move so slow we didn't see a change

I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my own
I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my way home

I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my own
I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my way home

But I can't seem to find my way home
But I can't seem to find my way home
But I can't seem to find my way home
But I can't seem to find my way home
But I can't seem to find my way home
