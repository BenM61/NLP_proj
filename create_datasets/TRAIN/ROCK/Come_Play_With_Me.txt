Take a look at this note
I can't throw it away
No please read it
It's something she wrote

Just to ruin my day
Now do you understand?!
Are you sure you want to hear?
Well, she stormed out of the flat

No, I don't care
It's not her I miss
She was always doing that
Oh she can stay there

But you should've seen the smile
When she said "Should I go...
Should I walk out?"
We sat for a while

I didn't say yes or no
But we'd just run out of time
No, I'm sure that she meant
Every word that she said

But there are no more
Excuses to invent
Again and again
Just a closed door

And we couldn't go on
And no one's to blame
These things happen
I didn't need anyone

Until the day that you came
And I looked in your eyes

When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you

It's over, it's over, it's over, yes it's over
Now come play with me
It's over, it's over, it's over, yes it's over
Now come play with me

It's over, it's over, it's over, yes it's over
Now come play with me
It's over, it's over, it's over, yes it's over
Now come play with me
