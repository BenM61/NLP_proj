Oh, I go running 'round the Galaxy, baby,
Waiting on my life to come save me.
But there's nothing like Infinity, baby,
It's this Mess that I Bless when I break free.

I let go
Feels like Death Row.
And, Time
All I've got is time.
Well, I could live in this Cage that I've made,
Memorize where the boundaries lay.
But, I know deep down that This will pass,
This heart of Mine will break free at last.

Oh, I go running 'round the Galaxy, baby,
Waiting on my life to come save me.
But there's nothing like Infinity, baby,
It's this Mess that I Bless when I break free.

I was taller than the trees
Now I'm back on my knees
But that's alright,
Sometimes you gotta let go of the fight
You know, I could tune out
Lose all things that make me doubt
But I just, I just, I can't deny,
I was never into Black and White!

Oh, I go running 'round the Galaxy, baby,
Waiting on my life to come save me.
But there's nothing like Infinity, baby,
It's this Mess that I Bless when I break free.
