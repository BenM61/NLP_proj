Ah, you babes talk about your Madison shoes 
We got a thing we call the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues baby 
Rock away your blues 

I know a gal her name is Lindsey Lou 
She told me she loved me but I know it ain't true 
Put on your Madison shoes 
Put on your Madison blue shoes 
I got the Madison blues 

Now put on your Madison blue shoes 
Ahh, you cats talking about your Madison shoes 
We do the thing we call the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues baby 
Rock away your blues 

Ah you babes talk about your Madison shoes 
We got a thing we call the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues 
We do the Madison blues baby 
Rock away your blues
