I don't mean to, to alarm you
Can't you see now, it overtakes you
You're declining, disintegrating
You're gonna lose it all
This time you're wasting

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Blackout
Let your panic out

Let it out, let it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic

'cause you're trapped in the countdown
And your days are numbered
Don't you know that you're done for
Right now, lights out
Let your panic out

You can feel it, but you're ignoring
It creeps upon you, without a warning
You think you're thriving
But you're decaying
You're gonna lose it all
There's no escaping

Let it out, let it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic

'cause you're trapped in the countdown
And your days are numbered
Don't you know that you're done for
Right now, lights out
Let your panic out

Feel it slip away, slip away
You know you're done for, you're done
You can't get away, get away
You know you're done for, you're done for

Let it out, let it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic
Let it out, let it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Release the panic oh, release the panic
