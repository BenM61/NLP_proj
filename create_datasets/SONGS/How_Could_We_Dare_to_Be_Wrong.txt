Take me up
Fill my cup with your wine
I'm your home
And you are mine
I'll never leave you
Now that I've seen you
I'll never breath a word of what I've found

Make my eyes
Tell no lies
To my heart
I've known the way
Right from the start
You know you'll see me
Only when you free me
When our darkest hour are passes to dark 

How could we fail to see
Everything that we could be
Now that we've written this song
How could we dare to be wrong

There is no
Turning back from the truth
It took so long
But now I'm there
Take my word
Show me you've heard
I'll never ask again what I ask now

How could we fail to see
Everything that we could be
Now that we've written this song
How could we dare to be wrong
How could we fail to see
Everything that we could be
Now that we've written this song
How could we dare to be wrong

To be wrong
