I'm getting stupid sitting here
Waiting for the light to change
Shadows rearrange

My brain is dull, I'm holding on
We need to break these walls down
Need to finish seeing

If I could fly a million miles
Could not keep me down
Swim the endless suction
Just need you around

If I could fly a million miles
Could not keep me down
Swim the endless suction
Just need you around

I'm going crazy stuck in here
Am I made of bigger things
A body big as dreams

My voice is empty without you
Let me sing to you
All our played out love songs

I feel the size of an empty bed
How will I find you?
How will I find you?

I feel the size of an empty bed
How will I find you?
How will I find you?

I feel the size of an empty bed
How will I find you?
How will I find you?

I feel the size of an empty bed
How will I find you?
How will I find you?

I feel the size of an empty bed
How will I find you?
How will I find you?

I feel the size of an empty bed
How will I find you?
How will I find you?
