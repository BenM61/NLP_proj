Twitchy lady, so lovely with your short hair
Where do you come from? Where are you going?
My friends think you're ugly, mmmm
They don't see what I see
I love my crosseyed baby
Your secret's safe with me

[Chorus]

I can't wait to get you out of here
Take you home with me, away from here
I'll never tell about what I found out
About a crosseyed girl
Who can surely make you shout

[Chorus]
