Midnight I watch you as you're sleeping
You don't know that I'm leaving
My bag is packed to go 
oh,no,no,no it hurts me, 
hurts me so to leave you
Leaving for someone who
I hardly even know
But time is come to say good-bye
To spread my wings and fly
To feel the need  I feel inside
But I keep feeling these love pains
Hurting me through and through
Caught between a lover or two
Oh will I ever be free from these love pains
Tearing me all apart,
'cause I don't want to break your heart
Oh will I ever be free from these love pains
Can't help, can't help to remember
the love we had so tender,
a world so safe and sound.
Oh no no no what is this?
temptation so inviting,
a feeling so exciting
has turned it upside down
although, I know I could be wrong
this feeling's much too strong
I got to be where I belong
But I keep feeling these love pains
Hurting me through and through
Caught between a lover or two
Oh will I ever be free from these love pains
Tearing me all apart,
'cause I don't want to break your heart
Oh will I ever be free from these love pains
Love pains
Hurting me through and through
Caught between a lover or two
Oh will I ever be free from these love pains
Tearing me all apart,
'cause I don't want to break your heart
Oh will I ever be free from these love pains
Love pains...
