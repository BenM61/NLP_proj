Well, I woke up this morning
Looked out my door
I could tell my milk cow 
Could tell by the way she lows
So if you see my milk cow
Won't you drive her on home?
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since my cow's been gone

Now you better treat me right, baby, day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and pray
'Cause you're gonna need my help someday
Yeah, and you're gonna be sorry that you treated me this way

Well, I said sail, sail on
I said sail on, pretty gal, sail on
You're gonna keep right on sailing 'til you lose your happy home
Let me hear you, Mickey

I've tried everything, good woman, to get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell what I'm gonna do
Quit my crying
Leave you alone
If you don't think I'm leaving, you can just count the days I'm gone
'Cause you ain't gonna see me
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more
And you're going to be wondering where in this world I'm gone
You can count on me
