My state of mind
My state of heart
You are the reason
You pay the greatest part
When you're around me
Or baby when you're gone
It's still the same

I told myself
Never again
No sleepless nights and days
Of endless pain
I saw it coming
And so I tried
To hide my hide away

Just when I thought my heart was safe
You made me fall in love all over again
Love all over again

What is this thing 
You do to me
Why can't I break away
Why can't I just be free
I guess that love is why
I can't walk away from you

To you I guess
My love belongs
Do with it
What you want
Baby right or wrong
I understand there is no 
Getting over you

Just when I thought my heart was safe
You made me fall in love all over again
Love all over again

I'm not gonna fight
Baby I give in to you now
It's gonna be right
Because as much I tried
Girl I can't let you go
No I can't let you go
