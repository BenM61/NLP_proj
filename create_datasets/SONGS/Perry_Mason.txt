On his way to dinner when it took him by surprise
And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
Then a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife

I don't mind, single file down the runway
Feelin' fine and I see you, my friend
Over and over again

Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again

Riding painted horses, oh the kids they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business like my mama always said
But if I don't try to help 'em they could wind up on the front page

I don't mind, draw the line, then draw me an arrow
Feelin' fine, then I'll see you, my friend
Over and over again

Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again

Wake me when it's over, tell me it's all right
Just keep on talking, baby, I've been doing this all night
How much did you give me, tell me it'll be all right

Then I'll see you, my friend
Over and over again

Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again, again, again
