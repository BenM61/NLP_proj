Oh lord, have mercy on me
I don't know what I'm doing
Hope I will be just fine
If I let my feelings out
For real, I had a good time
Just had enough of your mind
Did I really let you go? No, oh, oh

I'm holding on for life
'Cause I can't escape-ape-ape
Escape from love
And I don't wanna die
But I can't escape-ape-ape
Escape from love

Escape from love
Escape from love

If finding love is what is
We want to trust with no risk
But I find it hard, baby, oh
You know I had a good time
Just had enough of your mind
Can I really let you go
Really let you go, go, go?

I'm holding on for life
'Cause I can't escape-ape-ape
Escape from love
And I don't wanna die
But I can't escape-ape-ape
Escape from love

Escape from love
Escape from love

Escape from love
Escape from love
I cannot let you go
Escape from love
Escape from love

I cannot let you go, no, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no
Cannot escape from your love

I'm holding on for life
'Cause I can't escape-ape-ape
Escape from love
And I don't wanna die
But I can't escape-ape-ape
Escape from love
