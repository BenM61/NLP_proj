While the choir sang, 
Ave Maria, I was singing with all my heart
And I sent a special prayer, up to heaven
That you'll return to me before I fall apart

While the choir sings hallelujah
I was singing with all my heart
Darling please come back and never leave me again
And this will be (this will be) the answer to my prayer

And I'll wait, here for the answer
That you'll come back, come back I pray
For if you stayed, away another hour
Well I don't think I could last another day

While the choir sang, Ave Maria
I was singing with all my heart
Darling please, come back and never leave me again
And this will be an answer to my prayer
