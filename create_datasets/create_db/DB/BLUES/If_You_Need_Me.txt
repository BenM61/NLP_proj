If you need me, call my name
I'll come a running like a choo choo train
Always love you, always feel the same

You told me a lie
You made, made me cry
I'll always love you 'till the day I die

I'm going far away
And I'm going, going to stay
If you don't see me no more, meet me on Judgment Day

But if you need me, call my name
I'll come a running like a choo choo train
Always love you, always feel the same
