Oh, girl it's what you say between a phrase
It's written in your face
It's rain against a windowpane
The sound it makes
It's dreamin' the day away
It's the shine of a precious pearl
Light of the world
It's the smile of our baby girl
It's finding a moment for a thought so pure
It's a walk along the shore

I hold on to the feeling
I don't know when I will feel it again
I've become amused by the little things
Seconds of pleasure

Second of pleasure
Life's little treasures

Ooh, girl, it's small talk
A touch so soft
It's watchin' you walk
It's the taste of a sour pop - a lemon drop
It's the last one in the box
It's a kiss in the mornin' sun
A few minutes of fun
Before you have to run
It's all of the little things that you've done
To ease my burden and my confusion

Second of pleasure
Life's little treasures
