If I've heard them once
I've heard them a thousand times before
I'm in danger of repeating myself
But I don't care anymore
Sleepless nights and world weary days
I live without you
But life goes on regardless
I don't know what to do

The bells keep ringing
The doors keep slamming
You don't understand
But the doors keep slamming
For whom the bells toll

If I put a shell up to my ear
I can hear the sea
Even though I've tried to erase
That memory
You could be wiped up on
Some faraway beach
But all I know and feel is
You're still out of reach

The bells keep ringing
The doors keep slamming
You don't understand
But the doors keep slamming
For whom the bells toll

Switch out the light, and go to bed
Switch out the light, and go to bed
