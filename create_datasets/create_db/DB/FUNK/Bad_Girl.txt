She's not a bad girl because she made me see
Oh how love could be
But she's a bad girl because she wants to be free
She wants to be free

She's not a bad girl to look at
Finer than fine, she said she was mine
But she's a bad girl because it was only a line

I, I bragged to the boys about the girl that I, I had
It broke me up to find out she was bad
And my only wish is that I wish I could make
A bad, bad girl be good

She wasn't a bad girl at first, so good at the start
But now we must part
Oh yes she's a bad girl because she's breaking my heart

Oh, she's breaking my heart
(Bad girl because)
She's breaking my heart
