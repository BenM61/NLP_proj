I've heard them say love was a wonderful things
Something you couldn't hide on a shelf
But for me they no longer have to explain
Because I know for myself

He awakens each morn with a smile on his face
When a boy is in love
And the world to him is a beautiful place
When a boy is in love
He's up and he's gone
There's no breakfast for him
Cause he lives on the love of his sweet little gem
The days not through, though it's not very long
Before he must talk to his girl on the phone
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

His girl's voice on the phone brings him wondrous delight
When a boy is in love
If there's been any darkness, it all fades from sight
When a boys in love
He can hardly wait til the moment they meet
For he knows when he sees her his day will be complete
When they're finally alone and he kisses her lips
The world sings a love song and his heart turns a flip
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

At the end of the day the time comes they must part
The strings of regret tear away at his heart
And late in the night as he sleeps on his bed
Visions of her sweet song, how they dance in his head
And before you know he is buying a ring
To capture forever that sweet darling thing
That's how it is when a boy falls in love
That's how it is when a boy falls in love
