So you give it all
In the world today
You say it's all about the passion
And the wars you wage
I'm not sayin' 
I'm one for violence
But it keeps me hangin' on
It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you
Oh they'll pay top dollar
Make you wear the dog collar
When everybody loves you
I said I'm not afraid of change
I'm not afraid to lose
They say it's all about the sacrifice
And the weapons you choose
Like I said I'm not one for violence
But it keeps me hangin' on
It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you
Oh they'll pay top dollar
Make you wear the dog collar
When everybody loves you
It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you
Oh they'll pay top dollar
Make you wear the dog collar
When everybody loves you
It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you 
Oh they'll pay top dollar
When everybody loves you
It's a casual affair
It's a casual affair
