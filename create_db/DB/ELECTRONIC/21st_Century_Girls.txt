Well I'm gonna tell ya something
And I'm gonna tell ya right
We gotta stay young 'cause the future is bright
Don't give me your talk or your messin' around
'Cause the century girls are rockin' your town
Oh yeah

Get real, stand back, street boyz, relax
We sin, all saint
We're comin' at ya
'Cause you know that we are

21st Century Girls, guitars and all that make-up
Lipstick, pigtails and curls,
The future is ours to take it
Rockin' our teenage world, give it up
'Cause you know we've made it
21st Century Girls

Tom boy, kill joy, get off our backs
You better stay cool and you better relax
The future millennium is right on our trax
You lose, we win, we'll take it to the max
Oh yeah

Posh Spice, stand back, cool J, we rap
Take a dive, Celine
We're comin' at ya
'Cause you know that we are

21st Century Girls, guitars and all that make-up
Jammin' as the rhythm burns,
The future is ours to take it

The 21st Century's gonna be cool
It's gonna be wild, real wild
It's gonna be sci-fi,
The whole world's gonna go crazy
Yeah, we'll be rockin'

We're comin' at ya
21st Century Girls, guitars and all that make-up
We don't need diamonds or pearls, 
The future is ours to take it
21st Century Girls
