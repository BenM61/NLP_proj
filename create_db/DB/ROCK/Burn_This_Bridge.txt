The turn
The pause
So you
Can walk all over me

Soon 
You learn 
That's 
Not how it's gonna be

And I know who you are
Not any longer
And I know who you are
Sit back and watch me

Burn this bridge
Down!

Dare die
Should I?
I'll take
As much as I can take

And I know who you are
And I know who you are

And those rules
You make
Were
Made for me to break

And I know who you are
Yeah I know who you think you are
And I know who you are
Sit back and watch me

Burn this bridge
Down!

Burn this bridge
Down!

Should I ever
Live to see it
Move across the land
Your lips in me

I will pay you
What I owe you
Wouldn't trust you
Far as I could throw you

Don't expect you
To detect it
Never see me
Better genuflect it

Burn this bridge
Down!

Burn this bridge
Down!

Burn this bridge
Down!

Sit back and watch me

Burn this bridge

Down!

Now I know who you are
