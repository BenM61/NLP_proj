All we want is to feel that feeling again
Just a drop on the lips and we're more than equipped
There is some thirst that's gotta be quenched, yeah
All we want is to feel that feeling again
We didn't reach a high it was always inside
We just coaxed it from the place it would hide.

We move in fear, we move in desire
Now I know how you feel.
I'm a pilgrim, you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us
And breathed in this ether.
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after.

Cause all we want is to know the vivid moment
Yeah, how we feel now was felt by the ancients
Yeah, all we want is to know the vivid moment
Just surrender your limbs to my every whim
Now we're lovers, we are cartwheeling.

We move in fear, we move in desire
Now I know how you feel.
I'm a pilgrim, you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us
And breathed in this ether.
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after.

We've a Mecca now, weave a Mecca now, no less
To hold the other end of the thread. Hold on-

We move in fear, we move in desire
Now I know how you feel.
I'm a pilgrim, you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us
And breathed in this ether.
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after.

'Cause, all we want is to feel that feeling again,
Yeah, all we want is to feel that feeling again.
