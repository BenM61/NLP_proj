He takes you out and he takes you up
'Cause he can show you so much
I go to bed and tomorrow again
ThereÂ´s a lot of work to be done
He gives you gold and he will promise you
The whole world will be yours
I just canÂ´t tell you I love you so
Even though my odds are low

IÂ´m not an actor IÂ´m not a star
And I donÂ´t even have my own car
But IÂ´m hoping so much youÂ´ll stay
That you will love me anyway

The dirty games in the neon shows
This is the world he knows
Watching the stars satisfies my soul
Thinking of him makes me feel so cold

The fancy cars and the restaurants
YouÂ´re just so fund of the man
Sometimes I wonder if you are blind
CanÂ´t you see heÂ´s got dirt on his mind

IÂ´m not an actor IÂ´m not a star
And I donÂ´t even have my own car
But IÂ´m hoping so much youÂ´ll stay
That you will love me anyway
