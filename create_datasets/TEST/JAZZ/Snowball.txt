Snowball, my honey, don't you melt away
Cause daddy likes those dark brown eyes
Snowball, my honey, smile at me each day
Cause daddy likes those dark brown eyes

You're my only sweetheart, little chocolate bar
I'll eat you up some day
Your two hands and feet are just as black as tar
But don't you cry, why, say

The good Lord said, use an apple dumplin'
To make your head, you know it's really somethin'
Snowball, my honey, don't you melt away
Cause daddy likes those dark brown eyes
