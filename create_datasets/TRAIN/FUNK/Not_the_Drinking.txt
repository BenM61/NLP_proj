How can I feel like this?
Thought if I stayed out late and partied hard
Maybe I wouldn't notice
The last time I saw a road was weeks ago

It's not the drinking, it's not the drugs,
It's not the money, 'cause there's enough
It's not the phone you never answer
Its just the love that you don't feel any more

Why can't you keep a man?
I can hear mother saying like she does
She should just understand
Not everything in this world is good for us

It's not the drinking, it's not the drugs,
It's not the money, 'cause there's enough
It's not the phone you never answer
Its just the love that you don't feel any more

Don't you run away when I'm talking to you-
I need a little more
Been around the world but you don't know do you?
I need a little more
Never had a chance to make it good, oh but I, I-

It's gonna be easy now,
Now that you made my bed for me to lie in
This ship is going down
And all I can do is stand and fear the water

It's not the drinking, it's not the drugs,
It's not the money, 'cause there's enough
It's not the phone you never answer
Its just the love that you don't feel any more
It's not the drinking, it's not the drugs,
It's not the money, 'cause there's enough
It's not the phone you never answer
Its just the love that you don't feel any more
Do you feel any more?
