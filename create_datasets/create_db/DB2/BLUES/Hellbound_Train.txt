Hellbound Train I'm on it's track 
Too late now to turn my back 
Conductor coming ticket in his hand 
Come to claim my soul 
Take me to his land 

Hellbound Train I been so wrong 
Too late now I'm moving on 
Conductor standing watch in his hand 
Got to get aboard take you to his land 

I'm going down the road on  the Hellbound Train 
Take a long look lady 'cause you won't see me again 
Take a last look lady, yes hard and long 
'Cause I'm going down the road on the Hellbound Train 

Hellbound Train driving slow 
Move on down to the Hell below 
Conductor please won't you lend a hand? 
Got to get on board take me to your land 

Yes I know I've been so wrong 
Too late now I'm moving on 
Hellbound Train I'm on it's track 
Moving down I can't look back 

I'm going down the road on  the Hellbound Train 
Take a long look lady 'cause you won't see me again 
Take a last look lady, yes hard and long 
'Cause I'm going down the road on the Hellbound Train 

I'm going down the road on  the Hellbound Train 
Take a long look lady 'cause you won't see me again 
Take a last look lady, yes hard and long 
'Cause I'm going down the road on the Hellbound Train 

Lost and flying down the road on the Hellbound Train 
Lost and flying down the road on the Hellbound Train 
Hand and hand with the devil
