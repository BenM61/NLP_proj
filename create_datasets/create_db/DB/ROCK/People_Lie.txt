Well, you can talk to the governor, 
Talk to a prince
Talk to a preacher or the president
Some people lie, some people lie and deceive

When they say one thing, 
They mean something else completely
I had me a woman, love me to the end
Two days later she was with another man

Some people lie, some people lie and deceive
But sometime later, they'll get theirs, yes sirree
Well, I bought me a new car, a lemon, no doubt
The wheels fell off, the salesman he was out

People lie, people lie and deceive
When they say one thing, 
They mean something else completely
The bottom line, you understand

When some people talk, 
You can't believe what they're saying
People lie, people lie and deceive
When they say one thing, 

They mean something else completely
