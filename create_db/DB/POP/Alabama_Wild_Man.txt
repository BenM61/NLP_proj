Alright, watch out

Now my daddy was hard shelled Alabama preacher
My momma was a dedicated Sunday school teacher
My brother went to college and got a PHD
Daddy said the only dud in the family was me

He said â??Boy you ain't never going to amount to a thing
You set around with that silly looking guitar and sing
You hang around them juke joints all the time
Making music like some wild man done lost his mind

Sock it to me
Well what's that supposed to mean
Boy you just a wild manâ??

Well then one day daddy told me â??Boy I've had enough
Now you just pack up that guitar you just pack up your stuffâ??
So I left home and organized myself a band
Called myself the Alabama wild man

Well I worked all them joints from the east to the west
Never making no money and a-starving to death
A-living on coffee and cold sardines
Soda crackers and pork n beans

But I finally went to Music City USA
Said I'm the Alabama wild man and I'm here to stay
Took my guitar and showed â??em what I'm talking about
So we made a little record and we put it out

With me going
Sock it to me honey
Ha ha hook it boy
Play that guitar

Well now I'm driving the Cadillacs a city block long
The Alabama wild man could do no wrong
â??Cause I'm selling them records
And I'm working them shows
And people love me everywhere I go

But a funny thing happened about a week or so back
I was a showing my home town and the place was packed
Guess who was sitting on the front row seat
Was my daddy grinning up at me batting at me

Yelling
â??Sock it your daddy wild man
Hook it boy, hook it
Play that guitar show â??em son

Yeah that's my boy alright
Taught him everything he knows
Bought him his first guitar
Ah sock it to your daddy son
Go ahead put it to me put it to me
Keep them checks coming in boy
We going to pave the drive next weekâ??
