You can play dirty
Or you can play clean
Lookin' for pleasure
You're bustin' out your seams
You can play it loose
Or you can play it tight
Make the boys sweat
On a Saturday night

Oh yeah, you're the talk of the neighborhood
They're saying somethin' bad
Saying somethin' good
You can carry on like an ice machine
Or you can give it up to me

So you wanna play rough tonight
It's all in the way that you roll the dice
You wanna play rough tonight
Better think once better think twice

You can race the eyes
I can let you go
Caught up in the madness
Of a worn out show
You can level passion
You can carry the cast
Make the boys think
You saved the best for last

Oh yeah you're the talk of the neighborhood
The queen of broken hearts
You like 'em good
Yeah you can carry on like an ice machine
Or you can give it up to me

So you wanna play rough tonight
It's all in the way that you roll the dice
You wanna play rough tonight
Better think once better think twice

You wanna play rough tonight
It's all in the way that you roll the dice
You wanna play rough tonight
Gonna get hurt better think twice

Oh yeah, heard the cop from the neighborhood
He caught you goin' down
You think you would
Yeah yea you can carry on like an ice machine
Or you can give it up to me

So you wanna play rough tonight
It's all in the way that you roll the dice
You wanna play rough tonight
Better think once better think twice

You wanna play rough tonight
It's all in the way that you roll the dice
You wanna play rough tonight
Gonna get hurt better think twice
