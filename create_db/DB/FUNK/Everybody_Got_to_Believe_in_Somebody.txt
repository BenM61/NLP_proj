If you walk away from me
My whole world will crumble down
I've been searching for someone like you
You were lost, but now you're found
(What you found baby)

(Tenderness when you need it)
And a kiss for every goodbye
Everybody got to believe in somebody
Lord knows, thank you give me a try

Believe in me for every moment
Don't ever let your faith die
'Cause believing is better than breathing
Girl I know I'll never never make you cry

If you do
Your only tears will be tears of joy
You wonder what kind of man am I
Everybody got to believe in somebody
Somebody
Say you'll give me a try

Believe me when I say I want you
Believe me, oh I'll always want you
Don't disappoint me

I'm only gonna give you joy
You have time to learn about pain
No no no no no no no

Your only tears will be tears of joy
Oh what kind of man am I?
Everybody got to believe in somebody
Say you will give me a try
And I know know
Everybody got to believe in somebody
Baby, everybody got to believe in somebody
Believe in me, believe in me baby
Believe in somebody, oh baby
I know, I know, I know
