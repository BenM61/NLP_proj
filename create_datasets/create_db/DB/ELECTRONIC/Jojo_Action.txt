JoJo c'est la vie

His name is JoJo
He's sexy talking, hip hip hip
And JoJo go-go
He's funky walking, tip tip tip
He's sweet as honey can be
A Coconut tree

When JoJo's acting
Selecting he says, you you you
He takes you dancing
Romancing makes you
Blue blue blue
He's like a bird on a tree
A sweet harmony
I feel lazy crazy

He's joking kind of, tip tip tip
Gives you illusion
Confusion very, hip hip hip
He makes you fire and ice
And JoJo's so nice
I feel lazy crazy
