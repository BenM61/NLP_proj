I went out to see if I could fall in love again.
That was my mistake.
That was my mistake.
I went out to see if I could raise a laugh again.
That was my mistake.
That was my mistake.

When all I needed was a friend,
To make me stop and think again,
Pull me up and pull me through.
Tally ho, your health my dear.

I went out to see if I could live for a couple of days.
That was my mistake.
That was my mistake.
One by one I counted all those happiest of days.
Yeah, That was my mistake.
Why, That was my mistake.

What's gone is gone, sweet memories,
Don't let them get the best of me,
No more lost in history,
No more lost for love.

When all I needed was a friend,
To make me stop and think again,
The call to arms is loud and clear.
Tally ho, your health my dear.

I went out to see if I could fall in love again,
That was my mistake.
Why, that was my mistake.
One by one I counted all those happiest of days
That was my mistake.
That was my mistake.
That was my mistake, etc.
