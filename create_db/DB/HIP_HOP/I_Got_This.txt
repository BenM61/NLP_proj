 

[Intro]
Yo, let me take all this jewelry off, hold on, hold on
I'm about to take it to the street
(Go get Nelly, go get Murph, Kyjuan, all them, lets go bring 'em here)
Turn me up in the headphones too, cus I'm here (Heavy Starch)
(I'm about to press this shit)
Yo, go tell them, run and tell them Ali coming
I said bring me along, bring me along, bring me along, Ali is coming (Whoa, Hang)
Bring me along, bring me along, bring me along, Ali is coming (Whoa, Hang)

[Verse 1]
How many mill' must we sell before they respect the 'L
And realize it ain't for us, it's all for Lavell 
Pass that so I can educate the uneducated
And stress the fact it's self-braided, we finally made it
Went from buying pound, from Mr. Down-Down Baby
Playing it cool, fan duckin' click-crack-crazy
Getting the crack daily, pay me
My tree in life was precise to a swisher in the light (whoa, hang)
Boy get it right before I go left, baseline pay off the ref
Technical fire were fucking Chillida to death
Its from the studio, then right to the block, I writer's block
Cus everything I right for the block, is right from the block
Pokemon riffle in glock, bumble be socked
Orange Juice in my pocket in case I swallow my rocks
I did my hustle y'all, we a bad mother fucker y'all
'Tic nigga respect that, where the boys at?

[Chorus]
Dirty I Got This
Round and Round and? Dirty drop the beat, go round and watch this beat go
Round and Round and? Dirty let the beat go
Dirty I Got This
Round and Round and? Dirty let the beat, go around and watch this beat go
Round and Round and? Dirty let the beat go round

[Verse 2]
Now when it comes to rapping and going platinum
Our have to get it like Osama Bin Laden walking the streets of Manhattan
Give me them sheets to say Patented and you biting these Tims and fat laces
It won't happen, I'll let you slide with the jersey backwards; I back words
Rap verb, and if I had more time
I'd show you how to turn that half to a bird
Lead the new, leave the Hannibal hectic off the meter
And you non-believers, you're wrong for that like Cita
The black Einstein ruled the war never a kind line
catch up like Heinz cus he owns a rhyme
I'm real listed, On the real list I'm listed
Really listen, cus this is for those that really listen
Really listening for competition
MC's is mixing like it's the source awards
Should knight go in the door
Big 8 for the track rap javelin hurdle hops
I write in hotels before shows trailers and tow-toppers  

[Chorus]

(Still coming with it, I'm an addict y'all,
 still at it! Check It Out, Check It, Check It)
I'm still at it, I'll give it to an addict who's had it
Still got it yours need fluffing this manic
I rhyme graphic heavily tattered shots to ram bank
He'll back small 6-9 erratic
In a automatic pumping jigga 22-2
Sitting on 22's but the spiral 22-2
Shot with the Rubes in the desert and that 22-2
This is 139, almost 22-2 (whoa hang)
Got home the Rams was up 22-2
Interception about Halloway he wear 22
Minnie on my phone like hook me up with Nelly
Ali, please dawg, I'm 22-2
I like them classy 23's with they back out
Classic ESPN say 23 back out
When over I guess I bring them 23's back out
And that 22-2 with 3 in it's so pimped out

[Chorus]

Dirty drop the beat, go round and watch this beat go
Dirty let the beat go
Dirty drop the beat, go round and watch this beat go
Dirty let the beat go
I said bring me along, bring me along
bring me along, Ali is coming (Whoa, Hang)
Bring me along, bring me along
bring me along, Ali is coming (Whoa, Hang)
