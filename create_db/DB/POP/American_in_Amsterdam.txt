It's only been an hour but I think I feel the power,
Tell me where do you guys want to go to?
Well I could go for that but I need to buy a hat,
I think I saw some for sale on the small streets,

Can I play the game without a plan?
I think Pete has the map but tell me what's the difference?
I do not know exactly where I am,

I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in

Silver Mushroom Jesus, he is standing in between us,
Preaching words that he doesn't believe,
I think that he's cracking 'cause he keeps calling me Captain,
And he's barking and growling at strangers,
Later on tonight he's gonna turn back into Elvis,
When they kick his ass out of the sex show,

We play in a band that has no fans,
I think Pete lost the map we don't know where were going,
I'm trying to remember who I am,

I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)

Mike prefers a quiet conversation in the pub,
But the English are pissed, drunk and raging,
"Hey Bono" they said when they threw peanuts at my head,
And said "Hey prick can we try on your glasses?"
Now I am just a dork, but listen I come from New York,
So I said "Hey, what are you guys, Irish?"

We came to play the game without a plan,
Pete puked on the map we don't know where were going,
I do not exactly who I am,

I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam,(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
I'm an American in Amsterdam.(Amsterdam, Amsterdam,)
