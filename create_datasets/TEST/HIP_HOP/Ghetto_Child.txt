All the ghettos around the world
Dig this, ghetto Fabulous Joe
Shaggy
All the children sing

I'm a ghetto child
I'm a ghetto child
(Check it, out)

there's a world out there that I wanna see
There's a man that I'm destined to be
I won't be stopped by the ghetto streets
I believe inside that I can't be beat

This life could be a ball and chain
If you let yourself get caught in the game
I had some friends who sold drugs for dough
But I don't intend to go down that road

Just because I'm a ghetto child
I won't live down to your expectations
Just believe that a ghetto child
Can rise in the highest celebration

Know that I am a ghetto child
But I can see the best in me, can you
I'm a ghetto child
All the ghettos around the world, dig this

One day I'm gonna change the world
Make a better place for every boy and girl
Everyone in need, homeless families
Have a place to sleep and food to eat

I?ll take every gun off the streets
So another tear won't be shed in grief
And every thug in every hood
I will make ?em change from bad to good

I believe that it can be done
Gotta start somewhere and I'm that one
All the children sing
(Yeah, yeah)
All the children sing
(Yeah, yeah)

Just because I'm a ghetto child
I won't live down to your expectations
Just believe that a ghetto child
Can rise in the highest celebration

Know that I am a ghetto child
But I can see the best in me, can you
I'm a ghetto child
(Ooh, yeah, ooh)

Hey, yo?, look at me in a different light
Spare me all about those stereotypes
Ain't no madness that'll bring me down
Gonna take this life and turn it around

That's right, the sky?s the limit, I won't be denied
Ain't no stoppin? me, I'm a ghetto child
And at the end when it?s said and done
We will all be singin? this ghetto song

I believe that it can be done
Gotta start somewhere and I'm that one
All the children sing
(Yeah, yeah)
All the children sing
(Yeah, yeah)

Just because I'm a ghetto child
I won't live down to your expectations
Just believe that a ghetto child
Can rise in the highest celebration

Know that I am a ghetto child
But I can see the best in me, can you
I'm a ghetto child
(Let?s go to church now)

Just because I'm a ghetto child
I won't live down to your expectations
(Take me to church now)
Just believe that a ghetto child
Can rise in the highest celebration

Know that I am a ghetto child
But I can see the best in me, can you
I'm a ghetto child
(Hey, ghetto child, oh)

Just because I'm a ghetto child
I won't live down to your expectations
(Sing a song for me)
Just believe that a ghetto child
(Sing a song for me)
Can rise in the highest celebration
(Everybody sing it now, yeah)

Know that I am a ghetto child
But I can see the best in me, can you
I'm a ghetto child
(So I can see the best in me, can you)

It?s not where you're from, it?s where you're gonna be
It?s not where you're from, it?s where you're gonna be
