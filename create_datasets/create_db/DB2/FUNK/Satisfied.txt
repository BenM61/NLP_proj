Before we got started
Are we all alone?
Cause I'm about to get open-hearted
It's time to send you're company home and turn off you're cellphone

Baby, can't you see
I just want to get you satisfied

This is gonna be a long night (long)
A little bit longer afternoon (afternoon)
Girl, if we get this thing right 
Oh, you gonna get satisfied real soon

(Can't you see)
Baby, can't you see
(I'm just trying)
I want to get you satisfied (satisfied)

I ain't talking about nothing physical
Cause foreplay starts in the mind (in the mind)
I'm just trying to get you to think about doing things
That you've always wanted but could never find

I'm gonna seek this thing like a buried treasure
Like Columbus sailing over the sea
Until I discover, baby, the land beyond expertise and chastity

Baby, can't you see
I'm just tryin', tryin'
I'm just tryin' to get you satisfied

I'm sure you had another lover
But let me tell you baby, all tricks aside
I can get you out of you're body
Have you ever felt like you were dyin'
And felt satisfied
