I heard you cried last night and I know why
I heard you cried last night and so did I

Why did you make us part
I'm so alone, why did you take my heart
You didn't want it for your own

And if you hadn't cared to make amends
I might have never dared, we'd be just friends,
So calm your fears and dry your tears

Come kiss the boy you adore
Now you can smile tonight and cry no more.
