When I met you in the restaurant you could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure, "A movie or a measure"?
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my dreamin'
Dreamin' is free
Dreamin', dreaming is free

I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living verite
People stop and stare at me, we just walk on by
We just keep on dreamin'

Beat feet, walking a two-mile
Meet me, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him, I'll never forget him
Dream dream, even for a little while
Dream dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away, radiate

I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own, something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold just to have some dreamin'
Dreamin' is free
Dreamin', dreamin' is free

Dreamin', dreamin' is free
Dreamin', dreamin' is free
