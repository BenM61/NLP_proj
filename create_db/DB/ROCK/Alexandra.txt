I don't think back, I don't need to
But I'm always thinking of you
Alexandra 

Yeah my roots are always stronger
Dug deep and hard as marble
Alexandra 

So I tune out all the voices
Telling me it's time to swing again
Alexandra 

Yeah there must be some signal
Some green light left in your life

Will you white wash your memory
When I call you from a crazy sleep?
Alexandra

Well I took a happy hour
And I ran it through your heart
Don't you lose me to those blue skies
I still miss you when we swing apart

Yeah there must be some signal
Some lonely old green light
Alexandra 

I don't think back, I don't need to
But I'm always thinking of you
Alexandra
