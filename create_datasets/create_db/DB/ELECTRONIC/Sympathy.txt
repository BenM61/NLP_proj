So you say you're feelin' jealous
Without it you don't know what love is
When I mess up, I know, I know 
But so went off my nerves to phone ya
Was so in shock when I first read it
That day I never will forget it
I've sewn it up inside my bones
And in my heart I know, I know

It's real like when I dream so vividly
But in my heart I know it's real
From your locks down to your feet
And now I'll never forget it
How my life was incomplete
And in the dark I found you
And now we've got this sympathy

So you say it feels reckless
Went out and bought another necklace
To cover up the bruises on you
But what about the ones I loaned ya'
You never made an edit
Not down enough that you'd regret it
Well I don't need a change to know
That there is space for love to grow

It's real like when I dream so vividly
But in my heart I know it's real
From your locks down to your feet
And now I'll never forget it
How my life was incomplete
And in the dark I found you
And now we've got this sympathy

Like when I dream so vividly
But in my heart I know it's real
From your locks down to your feet
And now I'll never forget 'em
And now I'll never forget 'em
And now I'll never forget 'em
How my life was incomplete
And in the dark I found you
And now we got the sympathy

Like when I dream so vividly
But in my heart I know it's real
From your locks down to your feet
And now I'll never forget it
How my life was incomplete
And in the dark I found you
And now we've got this sympathy

Like in when I dream so vividly
But in my heart I know it's real
From your locks down to your feet
And now I'll never forget it
How my life was incomplete
And in the dark I found you
And now we've got this sympathy
