She told me to wait
Now I'm alone outside the gate
My eyes are bleeding visions fade away

The sun came to late
Time is here to seal my fate
In pain inside the purgatory flames

Now open gate let me in, let me stay
I'm turning away from the light of the day

I'll never go back, no I never will return
The flames are burning still inside my soul
Inside my soul

In a time were I was young, at a place of innocence
She stood there all alone, a devil in disguise
Inside a raging storm, my mind was set at ease
She said I was the one, all she said was simple lies

Behind these walls, nothing will remain
Madness and rage, oh I'm turning insane?

Beyond the gates
Beyond the gates of Hell

Tormented by her eyes, my life was in her hands
Just a puppet on a string, read to give in
I believe that after life, my spirit will live on
In a world, for me unknown, in a world still free from sin

Somewhere beyond the flames are burning still
Between death and life, it is a destiny's will

Beyond the gates
Beyond the gates of Hell

Heaven or Hell, there's a thin line between
Inside this inferno, where no one can win

Beyond the gates
Beyond the gates of Hell
