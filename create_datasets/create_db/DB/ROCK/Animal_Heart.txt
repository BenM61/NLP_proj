Just as the daytime turns into nighttime, 
I know that I can turn to you.
And as the river runs to the ocean, 
I know that I can run to you.
Just like the rich man needs lots of money, 
Listen, woman, I need you.
Just like a hunter stalks the hunted
In a jungle of lust. It's true

[Chorus]
I've got an animal heart when I see you.
(Animal heart.) I'll do anything you want me to.
I've got an animal heart.
This love for you never changes (no, no).
 
Pressure's rising. I see your eyes and
I know that the "game" is you.
You keep me running, but I'm still coming.
Oh, lover, do the things you do.
Oh, with a young heart, well, I'm never lonely, 
Oh, but listen, woman, I need you.
My heart is aching. My body's shaking.
Oh, but one thing that I know is true

[Chorus]

[Chorus x2]
