Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
You say I been runnin' with other women
But take a look at yourself

I called your mama
'Bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama
'Bout three or four nights ago 
Well, your mother said
"Son don't call my daughter no more"

Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Well now, you say I been runnin' around
But you got somebody else

Come on back home, baby
Try my love one more time
Come on back home, baby
Try my love one more time
Well now you've been gone away so long
I'm about to lose my mind

Before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Well, before you accuse me
Take a look at yourself
Well now, you say I been buyin' other women clothes
You been taken money from somebody else
