Just say that I'm a friend o' yours
And maybe they won't get wise,
And if they see us together,
I'll brush the dreams from my eyes.

I'll tell my heart it mustn't sing
The song of remember when,
Just say that I'm a friend o' yours
That you happened to meet again.

I'll tell my heart it mustn't sing
The song of remember when,
Just say that I'm a friend o' yours
That you happened to meet again.
