Nigga this is our show
Twenty two master bedrooms in the crib
The garage like the car show
Not only am I real, I think
But I still jab a nigga with the left and won't spill my drink

A'yo I'm dealing with this mami from Quebec
When she fly out I pull the boat out and blow scomie on the deck
Shooting at the stars, Tommy and the Tek
Soon as the dutch finish you can find me on the neck
No foreplay, busting the pound raise me
Middle of the ocean, busting her down crazy
You know me, I ain't on no star shit
I just came to hurt the market
Then squirt the Larkin
Put your hands up, matter fact put your mans up
Put your medina's and your lambs up, your grams up
Talking bout bucking each other
Probably fucking each other
D-Block dog, we stuck with each other

A'yo Full Surface, Swizz Beatz is in front of him
Got a lot of problems but money ain't one of 'em
D 12's and up, that's our M-O
Tell me what you know bout a jet ski limo
Waterproof knocking it, ain't no stopping it
Automatic respect whenever D-Block's in it
Or we can take it to the avenue too
Bring the Porsche GT out, lavender blue
Shit change, Kiss came its all extortion
Everybody meet, except for smaller portions
For real though, behave yourself on some grown shit
It ain't enough room dog, I'm on my own hit
