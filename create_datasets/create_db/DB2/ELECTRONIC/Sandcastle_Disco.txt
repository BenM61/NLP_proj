Who would've known, the wind and the sunshine
Would oh baby, baby
Build up these walls of mine
And I can't see you or breathe you
Cause there's trouble right beneath you
It's all in the night
But oh baby, baby
Come pick me up in your ride

I'm a cool low Jane
With the skip on my feet
I play tough as nails
With my heart on my sleeve
I'm nothing but a sand castle
Baby don't blow me away, away

Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away

Who would've known, the storm of my past time
Would oh baby, make me
Losing the song of the eye
And I can't believe you or read you
Cause there's pleasure in your preview
It's all in your eyes
But oh Mr. DJ, baby
Can you meet me outside

You're an old school dude
With the kick on ya shoes
You've got groove in ya hands
The way you spend those tunes
I'm nothing but a sandcastle
Baby don't blow me away, away

Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
Baby I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away

Ooh, and just like the ocean
Lays right there behind me
Look over my sandcastle
And there's a sight to see
Don't blow me away
Don't blow me baby

Ooh baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, please don't blow me away

Away, away
Away, away
Away, away
