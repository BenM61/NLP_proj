I found me a hopeless case, and resolve to love
Maybe we can find a decent place
When I'm old enough
Found love in an empty gaze, try to fix it up
I found me a hopeless case, oh

I'll fall for you soon enough
I resolve to love
Now I know it's just another f*ck
'Cause I'm old enough
Sell lies like their only trust
It will pick me up
I'll fall for you soon enough, oho, oho

Oho, don't be scared, that it's a harder kind of feel
Hold on tight, you must hold on unless you're in it
Ease your mind, and when you think, you're thinking clear
It's alright, you really tired for a minute
I just say, that it's another on the clock
It is a summer-calling sickness

Sonsick at the t-ball games, I so feel luck
Maybe find a place where we could mess
When we're old enough
We can never go from all the rest
We can live it up
All pressed in the Sunday best, oho, oho

Sonsick at the t-ball games, I so feel luck
Maybe find a place where we could mess
When we're old enough
Make plans and we'll buy the things, try to fix it up
Sonsick at the t-ball games, oho, oho

Oho, don't be scared, that it's a harder kind of feel
Hold on tight, you must hold on unless you're in it
Ease your mind, and when you think, you're thinking clear
It's alright, you really tired for a minute
I just say, that it's another on the clock
It is a summer-calling sickness
It is a summer-calling sickness
Summer-calling sickness

Oho, don't be scared, that it's a harder kind of feel
Hold on tight, you must hold on unless you're in it
Ease your mind, and when you think, you're thinking clear
It's alright, you really tired for a minute
I just say, that it's another on the clock
It is a summer-calling sickness
It is a summer-calling sickness
Summer-calling sickness
