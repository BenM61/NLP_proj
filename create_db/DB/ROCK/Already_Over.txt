Cue the music, curtain falls
The lights all fade to gray
Don't think there'll be an encore
For our secret passion play

It's time to play the final card
In a game I now despise
To me it seems so obvious
To you it's such a big surprise

It's already over
If I stay here I'd only make you cry
It's already over
We can't move forward, so let's move on, bye-bye

Oh, they say parting is such sweet sorrow
But I'm still looking for the sweet
I feel just like a baby now
These tears don't miss a beat

And I'd rather be anyone but here
And any place else but me
I'll just climb inside my head a while
My demons have a date with me

It's already over
If I stay here I'd only make you cry
It's already over
We can't move forward, so let's move on, bye-bye

So go ahead and hate me now
For breaking up on the phone
But I know that I'd crack if I saw your face
I deserve to be alone

And I hate that I still love you, girl
And I only wish you well
But I'll never be man enough for you
You're a psycho bitch from hell

It's already over
If I stay here I'd only make you cry
It's already over
We can't move forward, so let's move on, bye-bye

Bye-bye
So long
Farewell
Bye-bye

Ooh, it's already over
Ooh, it's already over, oh
