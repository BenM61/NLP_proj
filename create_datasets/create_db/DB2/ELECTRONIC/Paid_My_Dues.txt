You can say what you want about me
Want to do what you want to me
But you cannot stop me

I've been knocked down it's a crazy town
Even gotta punch in the face in L.A.
Ain't nothin' in the world that can keep me
From doing what I want to do
'Cause I'm too proud, I'm too strong,
Live by the code that you gotta move on
Feeling sorry for yourself ain't got nobody nowhere

So I (held my head high)
Knew I (knew I'd survive)
Well I made it (I made it)
Don't hate it (Don't hate it)
That's just the way it goes

Yeah

I done made it through
Stand on my own two
I paid my dues yeah
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues

So like I told you
You cannot stop me
I paid my dues yeah

Now I'm still trusted everyday
And people try to mess with Anastacia
Gotta another thing comin'
'cause I have a mind and I thought I'd better let you know
I'm no punk I can't get down,
I don't give a damn about who's around
That's worked just fine 'til now

So I (held my head high)
Knew I (knew I'd survive)
Well I made it (i made it, don't hate it)
Whoa
That's just the way it goes

Yeah (I done made it through)
Oh I'll stand on my own two
I paid my dues, yeah
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues

Yeah yeah yeah

Took so long to get me here
But I won't live in fear
Are you tryin' to steal my shine?
First they want to build you up
Then they tear you down
It's a struggle, tryin' a bubble

So I (held my head high)
Knew I (knew I'd survive)
Whoa whoa whoa (I made it, don't hate it)

Said that's just the way
I said I paid my, I paid my dues
Yeah yeah yeah
But you can't stop me now
I paid my, paid my due oh whoa whoa whoa
Oh I paid my I paid my dues
Yeah
But you can't stop me now
I paid my dues
