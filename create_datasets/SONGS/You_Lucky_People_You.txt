Are you wearin' old dreams
Breakin' out at the seams?
They should be new!
and have I got the bargains,
You lucky people you!

Here's a hollyhock set,
Makes the lady or gent
Feel well-to-to,
And the price fits your pocket,
You lucky people you!

Then here's a green velvet landscape,
And to prove I'm no rogue,
I'll add a smart-lookin' rainbow,
Like you see pictured in Vogue.

I've a wonderful buy
In a wrap-around sky
Of moonlight blue,
And it's yours for a love song,
You lucky people you!

Just one love song
You lucky lucky people you!
