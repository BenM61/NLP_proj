Shadows pouring like rain
Beneath a decay
Alone we wait for the end to come
We look for the signs
A glimmer of light
A crack in the sky

What have we created?
What have we become?
Meaningless and jaded,
The forsaken ones
Following the footsteps
Deep into the black
We echo in the darkness
Knowing there's no turning back

Tell me, how long do we wait
Until we see the other side?
The end of everything
Nothing left but you and I
Waiting for the storm to pass
Caught up in the aftermath
With you by my side,
We walk in to the fire
We walk in to the fire

We reap what we sow
The end of the rope
Tightens its hold around our throats
We're closer to death
We're counting each breath
Like it was our last

What have we created?
What have we become?
Meaningless and jaded
The forsaken ones
Following the footsteps
Deep into the black
We echo in the darkness
Knowing there's no turning back

Tell me, how long do we wait
Until we see the other side?
The end of everything
Nothing left but you and I
Waiting for the storm to pass
Caught up in the aftermath
With you by my side
We walk in to the fire

We're burning all the same across this divide
So will we see the rain? Or let the flames decide?

What have we created?
What have we become?
Meaningless and jaded?
Are we too far gone?

Tell me, how long do we wait
Until we see the other side?
The end of everything
Nothing left but you and I
Waiting for the storm to pass
Caught up in the aftermath
With you by my side
We walk in to the fire
We walk in to the fire
We walk in to the fire
