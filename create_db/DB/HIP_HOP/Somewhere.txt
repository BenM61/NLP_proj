Now that I'm grown and I've made it on my own
My friends say I'm crazy for still being alone
But ain't found the right one for me 
But I know that he's out there
Just wait and see
All I do is try to keep my head together
Cause I know don't want no stormy weather
All I need is a man that's gonna satisfy me
He's out there I know

Somewhere there's a love for me
Soon as I can I'm gonna find my baby
Somewhere there's a love for me
Soon as I can I'm gonna find my baby

I've looked everywhere for that special someone
Who's for real and understands
All good things are gonna go to those who wait
I need your loving now
Let's not hesitate
All I do is try to take control of my life
Cause I know don't wanna make the wrong move
Please stop hiding
I really need you by my side
You gotta treat me right
He's out there somewhere I know

Somewhere there's a love for me
Soon as I can I'm gonna find my baby
Somewhere there's a love for me
Soon as I can I'm gonna find my baby
