Monday on the line when you know that now's the time 
To leave and be free aware of your destiny 
When that moment arrives worlds visions through the mind 
And all I see Is what used to be 
My life consumed be a memory 

I don't ever want to feel pain 
want to be ready when you call my name 
I don't ever want to feel fear 
'Cause every night feels alright when your near 

Battle through this wall of nerves when your life it takes a turn 
What I have is what I feel well in my mind your lying here 
Fear that en holy trail there's a piece of me in all he said 
All kinds are fixed up inside my head 
The stage freight in my own bed (Ahh ahh) 

I don't ever want to feel pain 
want to be ready when you call my name 
I don't ever want to feel fear 
'Cause every night feels alright when you near 

Don't wannabe like a voice without words 
('Cause I need you here with me) 
Don't wannabe unwilling this way (Will I suppress my fears) 
And will I be, this war of nerves 

I don't ever want to feel pain 
want to be ready when you call my name 
I don't ever want to feel fear 
'Cause every night feels alright when you near 
I don't ever want to feel pain 
When it's over will I feel the same 
I don't ever want to feel fear 
This war of nerves that I reserved 
For when your here 
I don't ever want to feel pain 
I'm feeling hurt but I feel no shame 
I don't ever want to feel fear 
Do I deserve these cruel words we have here
