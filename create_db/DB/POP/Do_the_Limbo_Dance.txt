Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Clap your hands it's party time
Do the limbo dance

Let's go on a holiday
(Let's go to Jamaica)
Fly in to Montego Bay
(Let's go to Jamaica)
Maybe find a hideaway
(Let's go to Jamaica)
We can limbo on the sand
To a steel drum band

Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Come on and move your body down
Do the limbo dance
Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Clap your hands it's party time
Do the limbo dance

You will hear the limbo song
(When you're in Jamaica)
You'll be dancin'all night long
(When you're in Jamaica)
We can party on and on
(When you're in Jamaica)
We can limbo on the sand
To a steel drum band

Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Come on and move your body down
Do the limbo dance
Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Clap your hands it's party time
Do the limbo dance

Fantasies can all come true
(Let's stay in Jamaica)
Golden sun will shine on you
(Let's stay in Jamaica)
Sleeping under skies of blue
(Let's stay in Jamaica)
We can limbo on the sand
To a steel drum band

Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Come on and move your body down
Do the limbo dance
Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Clap your hands it's party time
Do the limbo dance

Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Come on and move your body down
Do the limbo dance
Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Clap your hands it's party time
Do the limbo dance

Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Come on and move your body down
Do the limbo dance
Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Clap your hands it's party time
Do the limbo dance

Limbo cool, limbo fine
Ev'rybody gets a chance
Come on and move your body down
Do the limbo dance
