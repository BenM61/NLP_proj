There is no place like home
There is no place like home

Do you remember
You left this morning at nine
With everything fine
Welcome home baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)

Do you remember
(Oh oh oh)
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)

(Well)
Well
(Well)
Well, at ten o'clock
I was lonely and blue
At twelve o'clock
I thought of nothing but you
From two o'clock
Till a quarter of four 
I waited patiently
To hear your footsteps at the door

Do you remember
(Oh oh oh)
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
Welcome home baby
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
Welcome home
