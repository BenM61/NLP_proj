Ooh, you're givin' me the fever tonight
I don't want to give in
I'd be playin' with fire
You forget, I've seen you work before
Take 'em straight to the top
Leave 'em cryin' for more
I've seen you burn 'em before

Fire and ice
You come on like a flame
Then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
I want to give you my love
But you'll just take a little piece of my heart

You'll just tear it apart

Movin' in for the kill tonight
You got every advantage when they put out the lights
It's not so pretty when it fades away
'Cause it's just an illusion in this passion play
I've seen you burn 'em before

Fire and ice
You come on like a flame
Then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
I want to give you my love
But you'll just take a little piece of my heart

So you think you got it all figured out
You're an expert in the field, without a doubt
But I know your methods inside and out
And I won't be takin' in by fire and ice

Fire and ice
You come on like a flame
Then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
I want to give you my love
But you'll just take a little piece of my heart

You come on like a flame
Then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
I want to give you my love
But you'll just take a little piece of my heart

You come on like a flame
Then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice

You come on like a flame
Then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
