Gotta find me, gotta find me a part time love
Gotta find me, gotta find me a part time love, yeah
The next time, the next time he leaves, ohh
I've gotta have a part time love

Gotta find me, gotta find me a part time love
I gotta find me, oh got to find me a part time love, yeah
The next time, the next he leaves me, ohh
I need a part time lover

Now people in the cemetery, they're not all alone
Some turn to dust some bare bone
But I would rather be dead, six feet in my grave
I'm just a woman in love, each and every day
He came home this morning, asked him where'd he been
He said don't ask me no questions, woman
I be leaving again

Gotta find me, ohh gotta find me a part time love, yeah
The next time, the next he leaves me, ohh
I gotta have a part time love

Every time my baby leaves me, ohh
I suffer the whole time he's gone
Ohh every time he leaves me, yeahh
I suffer the whole time he's gone
And the next, next time my baby leaves, ohh
I gotta have a part time love, ohh

Talking about the kind of love
Wash my dirty floor
Talking about the kind of loving
Stick by me when I get old
Talking about a part time love
I don't need a full time love
That faithful love
May be your kind of love, no no, ohhh, part time love
