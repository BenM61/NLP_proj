You're gonna be a really hard egg to crack
The more you try to resist the more I keep wanting that
You got that ADT on your heart you keepin stoppin' before we start
Givin' me the run around, feelin' like I'm on a track

How long you're gonna keep me knockin at your door, how long
How long you're gonna keep on treatin' me like I'm the one
That hurt you before
How long you're gonna keep me standing in the cold , how long
How long before you let me in your soul

Let me in, won't you let me in,
Let me in, let me in
Tell me when you gonna, let me
Let me in, let me in.

Seems there's always a mountain to climb,
Seems like I'm always telling myself it's gonna take a little more time,
Sending mixed signals and it's keeping me in confusion,
Please don't keep making excuses,

How long you're gonna just let time sleeping away, how long
How long you're gonna keep our* future from being the day
How long you're gonna let our flight keep getting delayed, how long
How long you're gonna keep us from having it made,what do you say?

Let me in, let me in,
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in.

See it on my face, I can't even hide it baby
What is gonna take for you to make your mind up girl
Should I walk away and my wastin' time baby
I don't wanna wait* forever.

Won't you let me in, won't you let me in?
let me in, I've got to have you baby
My wastin' time baby, don't you let me in
Don't you see it in my face baby
Let me in, tell em how long
Just want to love you
Let me in, won't you let me in
