It's our time to shine through the down
Glorified by what is ours
Fallen in love fallen in love!
Was the best idea I ever had

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects what a beautiful thing

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects what a beautiful thing

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects what a beautiful thing

So you want a song of glory
Well I'm fucking screaming at you

C'mon motherfuckers
