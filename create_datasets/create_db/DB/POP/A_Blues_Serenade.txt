If there is a Cinderella
Looking for a steady fella
Listen to my serenade in blue

Toss at night upon my pillow
Mournful as a weeping willow
Haunted by my serenade in blue

Why must I go on dreaming of
An imaginary love

Wish I had someone to sing to
One that I could kiss and cling to
No one hears my serenade in blue

Toss at night upon my pillow
Mournful as a weeping willow
Haunted by my serenade in blue

Why must I go on dreaming of
An imaginary love

Wish I had someone to sing to
One that I could kiss and cling to
No one hears my serenade in blue
