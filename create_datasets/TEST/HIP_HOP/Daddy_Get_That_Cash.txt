(Lil' Mo)
Styles P...
It's Lil' Mo, holla at me
Get that cash daddy

(Styles)
If it's you versus me - think about it 
They goin' yell my name when they announce the winner
And I ain't bout to sell much
I got my honeys on the plane but the birds flyin south for the winter

Go get ya self familiated
I'm so gangsta that, just know'n myself makes me affiliated
What you think honey hold 'em hammers for?
So she can spend 10 cent at Jill Sander store?

We gon hit the day off, drive on Beverly Hills
Though I love her, so I'm spendin like 70 bills
I bringin what she be on went, keep ya payroll big
Light a blunt, and just beg me to chill

Ain't a player but my life is real all of the time
So she went and copped a gun a little smaller than mine
That's a down ass chick, and she keep it real 
So I'm a keep it real back all of the time

Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)

(Styles)
Daddy go and get that cash
Go and get the black suit, grab the burner plus get that match
She said "Tell my where you goin"
It's no doubt I'm comin in

'Cause she could fit a little 9 or a 22
Right inside her bra or Calvin Klein underwear
Mami you could stay home and bag up the work
I'm just goin out to play chrome or nag up a jerk

If I kiss it then the heart'll melt
Listen dogg, you don't understand the work
That she carry in the garter belt
No doubt I love her, I'ma tell you the truth

But don't' get it fucked up, and get fucked up
Only thing sweet about P is his tooth
And she could sleep with another dude
She gon tell me where the safe at

The coke at, how to rob his mother too
"Daddy go and get that cash"...
That's what my honey holla'd out every time I hit that ass

Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)

(Styles)
Since you helped daddy get that cash
Get the condom and the mink, and the ring and the gift wrapped Jag
And you still got the bomb ass, I pay the phone and the rent
But keep it real Boo, you pay the Conair

If I get knoced, she in the BI room
With some money on my books, give weed to a nigga
Don't worry about shit, cause I be out soon
No doubt that's my Booby-cat

She drop my bricks off right on Broadway
And she go and get a doobie wrapped
Lookin at the God, like "We all a little"
One pop for the pasta, one pop for the coke

Holiday Styles, dick one shot for the door
And it's sorta like we Bonnie and Clyde
I load the ouie up, she gon roll the gouie up, then mami abide
And she said "Daddy get that cash"
She know I would but had no idea that I would skip that fast

Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
