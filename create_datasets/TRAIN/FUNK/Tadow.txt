She was so sublime
Super fine
She was never lying
Strutting in her heels
Or her slides either way
Eyes on her every single day, week, year
Everyone wondering how she does it with no fear
All that confidence was it heaven-sent?
Does it come within?
Does it come run out?

She'll just have 'em runnin'
Out and in man they want to sin
Talking deadly sin
With Mrs. lady I don't understand
