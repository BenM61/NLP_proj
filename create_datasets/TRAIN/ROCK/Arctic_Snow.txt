Standing on the edge of feelin' 
Seconds from the point of healin' 
High enough to make a good impression 
Stimulate the conversation 

I wanna go off and hide 
You're colder than an arctic snow 
Come anyway, anyway you want it 
Falling energy let me go 

This is where we left off last time 
Still the same old thoughtless love-crime 
All he ever wanted for his birthday 
Kite slipped from his hand then flew away 

I wanna go off and hide 
You're colder than an arctic snow 
Come anyway, anyway you want it 
Falling energy let me go 

Send it around 
It'll never take me off the ground 
Never alone inside 
The future ship looks out 

Send it around other worlds and 
Send it around other worlds and 
Send it around other worlds and 
Send it around 

Down the stairs the red ball bounces 
Weigh me out in pounds and ounces 
Marry Poppins flies among the witches 
Win yourself a crown of stitches 

I wanna go off and hide 
You're colder than an arctic snow 
Come anyway, anyway you want it 
Falling energy let me go
