I missed the opportunity
To get you babe to stay with me.
Never thought, I'd regret the excuses that I've made
Like a song, it will fade

If there's music in the night,
And it's really, really right,
It's the only thing I need.
It intoxicates your mind
All your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead.
It's not just me who feels it
Music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you

So I put my feelings out to dry
Love, one day again,
I'll have to try.
Falling out, making up
It seems such a silly game
Why do I never gain?

If there's music in the night,
And it's really, really right,
It's the only thing I need.
It intoxicates your mind
All your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead.
It's not just me who feels it
Music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you

Na na na's

If there's music in the night,
And it's really, really right,
It's the only thing I need.
It intoxicates your mind
All your troubles left behind
So come on and take my lead.
It's not just me who feels it
Music plays a mind trick
Watch me forget about missing you
