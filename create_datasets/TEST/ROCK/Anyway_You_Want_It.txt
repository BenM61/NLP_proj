Come on, makes no difference what you like.
Come on, whatever turns you on is all right
Gonna have some fun tonite.

Anyway, anyway you want it,
You've got what everyone needs.
Anyway, anyway you want it,
A chance to do what you please.

Come on, if you're feeling good then stomp on your feet.
Come on, clap you hands and stand up and scream.
Throw you arms to the sky.

Anyway, anyway you want it,
You've got what everyone needs.
Anyway, anyway you want it,
A chance to do what you please.

Anyway, anyway you want it,
You've got what everyone needs.
Anyway, anyway you want it,
A chance to do what you please.
Anyway, anyway you want it,
Make it clear what you say.
Anyway, anyway you want it,
Anytime, anyday.
