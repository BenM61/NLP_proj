[Chorus]
My hearts like a jigsaw puzzle
Pick it up and fix it for me
Can you figure it out? [Repeat: x2]

Are you listening now?

So I'm smoking like a chimney
I feel fucked up
I got too much drink in me
Its a shame that you cant be around

I got you on mind I got shit on my mind
I got plenty of time to just sit and rewind
And just call up your line
And sip on my wine
Cause this is bugging me out
And I wish you were mine

I went too far, stole your car
Messed about,but heard me out
Didn't mean to scream and shout
But wont you for give me now?

[Chorus]

So I'm kinda pissed off
I mess the way we use to get off
And the way you that you held my hand when the fruit was dropped
Now I'm feeling kinda lost

Got you on mind I got shit on my mind
I got plenty of time to just sit and rewind
And just call up your line
And sip on my wine
Cause this is bugging me out
And I wish you were mine

I went too far, stole your car
Messed about,but heard me out
Didn't mean to scream and shout
But wont you for give me now?

[Chorus: x2]
