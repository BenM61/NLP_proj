Locator sees me swaying through the catacombs
Locator hears me whispering in my home
Even when the waves are falling
Beat me into diamonds
Even the wheels are winding
Even the wheels are winding
Something in the sky can find me
(High)

Here below, here below, here below, here below
Oh no, locator it is I

Even when I run I'm crawling
Even through walls and blinds and
Even when the wheels are winding
Even when the wheels are winding
Something in the sky can find me
High
Here below, here below, here below, here below

I love locator everywhere I go
I tell locator everything it wants to know
