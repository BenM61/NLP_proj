Oh yeah
I went down to the crossroads
Make a deal with the devil
Strapped my soul for a guitar
Became a rock'n'roll rebel
He put fire in my fingers
And whiskey in my blood
He said take this six strings
And burn heaven above

Are you ready? Are you ready?
You better get ready
Once we start we never stop, get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock

Got thunder and lighting 
Crashing all around
The power is frightening
One hell of a sound
And heaven's on fire
The needle's in the red
The flames are getting higher
We're goin' over the edge

Are you ready? Are you ready?
You better get ready
Once we start we never stop, get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock to rock'n'roll?

Whoa, oh yeah, come on, oh yeah 
Let's go 
Encore, can you feel it?
Just a little bit louder, come on
Oh, just a one more time, come on

Once we start we never stop, get ready to rock
Ready to rock, get ready to rock
Ready to rock
Get ready, get ready to rock
Ready to rock, get ready to rock
Ready to rock, are you ready?
Are you ready to rock?
I said, are you ready to rock?
I said, are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
To rock, to rock, to rock, to rock'n rock'n roll

Oh, get ready to rock, come on
Let me hear you, oh, get ready to rock
Ready to rock baby, get ready to rock
Ready to rock, ready to rock
Get ready to rock, rock, rock, rock, ready to rock
