Hey, what's up, girl? 
What took you so?
Long stop playing
Who? 
Don't worry about if I carry 'em around 
If I didn't have one, you would mad 
Don't worry about that, I got that

T-pain
Hey, baby, give me a reason so I can touch it how I want to (touch it how I want to)
And make love to you how them other lame niggas want to
Go on, girl, what you gon' do?
On my nappy head you can pull my nappy dreads if you want to
Shawty, I'm a put it on you
And make you think that you the girl that I be singing all my songs to
You got me thinking that me and you went to drinkin'
When you sippin' that Patron we been and got it on, boo
But for now we just sit and chill
You never had love making like this for real
Come on, baby, you just appeal
Now take it slow, let me take it down low, let's go, let's go
So you know it's about to go down now (go down now)
Speed it up, baby, can't slow down now (slow down now)
Tell ya closet freak she can come out now (come out now)
Why you think they call me Teddy Penderazdoun?

And now I know 
You didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
And now I know 
You didn't expect me to just 
Turn you 'round, spread it out, and put it down
From the top to the bottom and now that I got you
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh

You got a nigga all swole like a T-pain show in Tallahassee
Never put that ass on hold, I'm to nasty
Don't ever underestimated T-pain
You should have known when I was biting on you belly button chain
That you are about to receive some of that good tongue
Tryin' tell me not to do like you don't want none
Tryin' to sit up in the bed, tryin' to act all calm
Acting like it ain't good, tryin' to hold that cum
But you know that I'm the best, you know your Teddy Verset
It's the first ten minutes, you ain't felt shit yet
I got the whips, I got the chain, I got the handcuffs, too
But ain't none of that for me; I'm about to handcuffs you
That's the freaky shit; I keep on skeeting shit and leaving leaky shit
I take her ass back to the church, a preacher and deacon shit
I'm beating it; let's try computer love, I keep deleting it
I'm fucking under the dresser, the bedroom floor, and the sheets and shit

And now I know 
You didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
And now I know 
You didn't expect me to just 
Turn you 'round, spread it out, and put it down
From the top to the bottom and now that I got you
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh

What you doing?
Take ya pants off
Not that fast; do it slower
You gon' kill... ruin the mood
Move ya hand, let me see

Baby girl, let a nigga slide in them guts
My little man wanna hide them guts
I'm a take my time with them guts
And, baby girl, when I'm in them guts
You ain't gotta worry bout ya man 'cause
I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)
I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)

And now I know 
You didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
And now I know 
You didn't expect me to just 
Turn you 'round, spread it out, and put it down
