Mmm mmm yeah yeah yeah oh yeah

Hi there, its me again 
Let me lend your ear for just a minute
Here's something you should know 
I made a wish and you were there
I said hey it's a lovely day, 
I turned around as if I knew you
Turned around with a big big smile
There was magic everywhere
Ooh, we had a great time baby
We knew it would never end
Hey yeah...my oh my
Now I think we understand

We're spinning round and round 
Just like the planets do
But in this universe I'll fall in love with you
I've been searching high and low
I've been way down and up above
When I finely found you 
On the planet of love

Yeah yeah mmh mmh 
Say yeah 
Let me take you there, 
I show you life in all it's beauty
You turned around big big smile
There was magic everywhere
Ooh we had a good thing going
We gotta keep holding on 
Hey yeah...my oh my 
You're shining like the sun

We're spinning round and round 
Just like the planets do
But in this universe I'll fall in love with you
I've been searching high and low
I've been way down and up above
When I finely found you 
On the planet of love

Take a look around you
Just wait and see 
When love has finally found you
You will agree, yeah yeah,
I need you,
I need you, oh yeah yeah
Spinning around and around and around,
I'm you're planet of love
Ooh, come to me, come to me baby

We're spinning round and round 
Just like the planets do
But in this universe I'll fall in love with you
I've been searching high and low
I've been way down and up above
When I finely found you 
On the planet of love

On the planet of love 
We're spinning around and around and around
I'll fall in love with you,
Way down and up above
until I finally find you on the planet of love

Yeah mmm mmm
