Passion flower
Sent from the blue above
You're a flower of love
Passion flower
Free as a star in flight
Laughing through the night

Your lips keep taunting me
Not wanting me
Yet haunting me
Each day

Stay with me
My passion flower
You are all I'm dreaming of
Passion flower of love
Passion flower of love
