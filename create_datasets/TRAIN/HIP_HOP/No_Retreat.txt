"The mind-blowing party-rocking Platform crew" (scratched 4x)
	"That's Rakka-Iriscience, Evidence, Babu"

(Iriscience)
It's no retreat, hit the street, get my plane confirmation
To the other side of the world, a daily operation
First stop in Vegas, can't keep these lions locked in cages
We rock in places where alcohol's for all ages
On stages, in great heights land in London at night
LAX today, MP tight
A 2000 Technique cha, cut and freak
Detonate our drums, heat the plastique

(Evidence)
Ayo funky, straight up with the force to keep fighting
Samson, Atlas, Collossus, Titan
In the dark night the torch that enlightens
Our strong cast-iron, harder the lion
A mighty foundation, many mouths to feed
With the energy needed to turn a seed to weed
We're fortified tight, sturdy sound construction
Make rappers "Duck Down" like I'm Boogie Down Productions

	(Iriscience)
	Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
	No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat

"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat"
"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat"
(Evidence)
Yo we serve a full spectrum of flavors that's robust
Hustle in the same industry I don't trust
I know California dig it like a gold rush
And worldwide no retreat, we cold crush
Beef up support, insulate your stage or pay
Make way for the prophets of rage
While they engage to let you know we're in a new age
Babu will make a DJ turn a new page

(Iriscience)
Cause that's a dangerous man that can speak with his hands
Watered-down lyrics on dirty tracks turned to sand
To sink in, better watch the X that you ink in
Or on, disrespect us, step on my lawn
Skip the death threats, MC or graph and test these wrong
Your letters are wack, they get blown like mailbombs
I'm on the next train to your thought that's caught
Where I'm going, no retreat, hit the beat, exit the plot

	(Evidence)
	Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
	No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat

"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat"
"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat"
(Iriscience)
Uh, no retreat, get right up back out
Cuff the mic that's wack, develop tools to tap out
No doubt, Dilated's turning pros to flows
(No retreat) I risk my life on flights for hype shows

(Evidence)
And now you rocking with the camp that rocked last at Tramps
Worldwide, collecting little passport stamps
From the body to the mind like I'm Jesse Ventura
This millennium and mark 2000 like Futura

(Iriscience)
Bet, rest assured vaccines ain't far from cures
PLant some new shit, hit me two weeks into tour
But I'll adapt, guaranteed make it through
Eveidence, Iriscience, and my man Babu

(Evidence)
We freak by the KNK crazily
Pro game, expansion team, major league
Rakka-Iriscience trained to go the length
I'm an all-terrain think tank at full strength

	(Iriscience)
	Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
	No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat

"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat"
"To the enemy" "No surrender no retreat"
