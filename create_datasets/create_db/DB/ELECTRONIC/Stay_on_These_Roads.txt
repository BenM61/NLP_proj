The cold has a voice
It talks to me
Stillborn by choice
And it has no need to hold

Old man feels the cold
Oh baby, don't 'cause I've been told

Stay on these roads
We shall meet I know
Stay on these roads
We shall meet I know, I know

Where joy should reign
These skies restrain
Shadow your love
The voice trails off again

Old, old man feels the cold
Oh baby, don't 'cause I've been told

Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on my love
You feel so weak, be strong

Stay on, stay on
We shall meet, I know
I know
I know, my love, I know

Feel the cold
Winter's calling at my home

Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on my love
We'll meet, I know

So stay on
I know
Stay my love, stay on
We'll meet, I know, I know
Love, I know
