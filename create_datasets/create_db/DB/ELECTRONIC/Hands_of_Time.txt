An atom splits
To create a distraction
And every single is a counterfeit
A misdirection
And baby I'll wait forever to find you
And I'll change but never to blind you

I'll stop the hands of time (till the thunder dies away)
I'll stop the hands of time (until we can escape)

Whoah, whoah
I'll stop the hands of time

I'll stop the hands of time

An atom splits

And every single is a counterfeit

And baby I'll wait forever to find you
And I'll change but never to blind you

I'll stop the hands of time (till the thunder dies away)
I'll stop the hands of time (until we can escape)

Whoah, whoah
I'll stop the hands of time

Whoah, whoah
I'll stop the hands of time

Whoah, whoah
I'll stop the hands of time
