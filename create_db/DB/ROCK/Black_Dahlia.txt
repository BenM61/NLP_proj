I loved you, you made me, hate me
You gave me hate, see?
It saved me and these tears are deadly
You feel that I rip back, every time you tried to steal that
You feel bad, you feel sad?
I'm sorry, hell no f*ck that
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies
And these lungs, have sung, this song, for too long,
And it's true, I hurt too, remember I loved you

I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no

I wish I could have quit you, I wish I never missed you
And told you that I loved you, every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew, and all the shit we've been through,
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew.
How could you do this to me?
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love struck, now I'm just fucked up,
Pull up my sleeves and see the pattern of my cuts

And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no

Seems like all we had is over now you left to rest
And your tears are dried up now, you just lay without a sound
Seems like all we had is over now, you left to rest
And my fears are over now
I can leave with my head down

And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry no
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry no
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry 
I'm sorry, no
