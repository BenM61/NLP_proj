One music, one rhythm, one feeling, one love.
One leader, one voice, one moment, one song.
One dream, one hope, one faith, one love.
Together we conquer our planet with dance!

We give you the music, the rhythm of life.
One city, one nation, the power of love.
A feeling, a hope, that we become one.
Together we conquer our planet with dance!

One dream, one voice, one moment, one song.
I hear it, I feel it, still believe that we're one.
I give you a chance to take the control.
Together we conquer our planet with dance!

One music, one rhythm, one feeling, one love.
One leader, one voice, one moment, one song.
One dream, one hope, one faith, one love.
Together we conquer our planet with dance!

When we dance we want the music loud.
We give heaven and hell.
You know it's the only way for you.
Let your senses guide you through.
