Take a break for a while
Take a rest, do your very best
Take five, honey
Five, honey

You search in your bag
Light up a fag
Think it's a drag, but you're so glad
To be alive honey
Alive honey

Said when this is all over
You'll be in clover
We'll go out and spend
All of your blue money
Blue money
Blue money

Take a break for a while
Do your best, do your very best
Take five, honey

You search in your bag

Say it's a drag, but you're so glad
To be alive honey
