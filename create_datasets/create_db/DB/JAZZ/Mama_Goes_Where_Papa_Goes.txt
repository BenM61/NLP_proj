Mama goes where papa goes,
Or papa don't go out tonight!
Mama goes 'cause mama knows
He can't be trusted out o' her sight!

Mama's got a feelin' that she must be near,
Just to help her keep papa's conscience clear!
That's why mama goes where papa goes,
Or papa don't go out tonight!

Here's your bedroom slippers and your favourite pipe,
Your yellow bathrobe with the favourite stripe.
Here's your armchair, the book that you read,
And here's your lovin' mama, I've got everyrthing you need!

You go with lots o' fellas, and you ain't the worst,
But I think in terms of safety first!
Any clever gal will admit I'm right,
if you wanna keep your man keep him right in sight!
That's why mama goes where papa goes,
Or papa don't go out tonight!

Teacher used to tell me when I went to school,
"Any girl who trusts a man's a doggone fool!",
That's why mama goes where papa goes,
Or papa don't go out tonight!

And I'm sick o' your lies,
Your tired alibis,
It took me some time but I finally got wise;
So make up your mind,
You can't leave me behind,
Papa, you can't go out tonight!
