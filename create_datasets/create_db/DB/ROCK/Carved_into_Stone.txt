The aeon's lights are shining brightly ahead
They haunt the lonely years with perfect intent
They send a message that will help us channel the mind
Universally cementing the perfect design

Carved into stone, carved into stone
A method to release
All or nothing, all or nothing
Carved into stone, carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing, all or nothing

The symbols and signs arrive, emerge from the depth
Imprinting upon the minds in search for what's next
We need a presence that will guide us out of the blind
The affirmation that will promise all of our sight

Carved into stone, carved into stone
A method to release
All or nothing, all or nothing
Carved into stone, carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing, all or nothing

I need a method that will help me get right through the night
There's really not a whole lot left
Things are passing by and things are flying by
Things are moving way too fast
Carved into stone, carved into stone
Carved into stone, carved into stone
I need a method that will help me get right through the night
There's really not a whole lot left
Things are passing by and things are flying by
Things are moving way too fast

A method to release
All or nothing, all or nothing
Carved into stone, carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing, all or nothing
Carved into stone
A method to release
Carved into stone, carved into stone
Carved into stone, carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing, all or nothing
Carved into stone, carved into stone
