Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin'
Can hear my guitar rocking?

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

People think, I'm a crazing
The Lord above ain't lazing
The sunshine's all day long
(Incomprehensible) far too strong

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

The cars won't stop for no one
They don't think that you're just rolling down
They think you're an OAS spy
Gonna shoot them as they go by

No cars, they won't stop
Won't stop for no one

Strolling down the highway
And I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin'
Can hear my guitar rocking?

While I stroll on down
On down the highway
