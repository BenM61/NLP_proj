i don't care much for tradition
and i know you'll be leaving one day
i cant promise that i'll ever be the one
but if you love me til monday

lets seran wrap for the weekend
and see who comes up for air first
we can go and break some windows
and run and run til our chests are fit to burst
forget we ever said the word

the future is dead
that's what you said
its all in your head you see
not mine
i am fine
i'm alive
i've arrived

we thought we could make a difference
be remembered when the pyramids are dust
but we've had to learn that these bridges that we build
can be as fragile as a loved one's trust

the future is dead
that's what you said
its all in your head you see
not mine
i am fine
i'm alive
i've arrived

here comes my everything
this is my everything
there goes my everything
bye bye love

the future is dead
that's what you said
its all in your head you see
not mine
i am fine
i'm alive
i've arrived
the future is dead
that's what you said
its all in your head you see
not mine
i am fine
i'm alive
i've arrived

lets forget about the question
we've been dragging 'round for years
clear the smokey air between us
then say goodbye
and shed no tears
