The world outside your house is cold and windy
The summer breeze becomes a winter storm
And then you smile at me
And almost instantly
The weather turns warm

Slowly the green grass starts to grow
Softly the sunshine of your smile
Melts the snow

When I'm alone the streets are dark and cloudy
I walk around not knowing danger of night
And then you touch my hand
That's all that happens
And the whole world turns bright

Slowly the green grass starts to grow
Softly the sunshine of your smile
Melts the snow

To me you're everything that's true
My world begins and it will end
With only you
Forever

Slowly the green grass starts to grow
Softly the sunshine of your smile
Melts the snow

Slowly the green grass starts to grow
Softly the sunshine of your smile
Melts the snow

Slowly the green grass starts to grow
Softly the sunshine of your smile
