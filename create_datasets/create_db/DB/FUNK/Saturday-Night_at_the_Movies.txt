Saturday night at eight o'clock 
I know where I'm gonna go, 
I'm gonna pick my baby up,
And take her to the picture show.
Ev'rybody in the neighborhood 
Is dressin' up to be there too, 
And we're gonna be a ball 
Just like we always do. 
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby i
n the last row in the balcony?
 
There's Technicolor and Cinemascope, 
A cast out a Holly wood, 
And the popcorn from the candy store, 
Makes it all seem twice as good. 
There's alway lots of pretty girls 
With figures they don't try to hide,
But they never can compare  
To the girl sittin' by my side.
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby 
in the last row in the balcony?
 
Movies are better than ever, 
And just as dark as before, 
And Saturday night when you're with your baby,
Who could ask for anything more?
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby 
in the last row in the balcony?
