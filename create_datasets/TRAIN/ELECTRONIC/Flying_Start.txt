We took a place in the sun to see just what had become.
The warm wind blows constantly.
Does the answer still blow? Did you find your chateau
In that Mediterranean fantasy?
Flying start
Made the Whole World sing, they had no choice.
Flying start.
Like a shining pearl, they sang in one voice.
To where the sun always shines, familiar faces and wines.
The warm wind blows constantly.
Knock on the door, but the memory's poor.
Is there somebody in? Now answer me!
Two dark eyes from the doorway shine.
So you lost your dream in a bottle of wine.
I knew you had to do it your way, fine,
But there's none to carry the cross this time.
Flying start
Made the Whole World sing, they had no choice.
Flying start.
Like a shining pearl, they sang in one voice.
On dusty roads and tracks. Now it's the time to turn back.
The warm winds blow constantly.
Riding that storm since the day you were born.
Is there somebody in? Now answer me!
Two dark eyes from the doorway shine.
So you lost your dream in a bottle of wine.
I knew you had to do it your way, fine,
But there's none to carry the cross this time.
