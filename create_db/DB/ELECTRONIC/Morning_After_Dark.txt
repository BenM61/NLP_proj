Hello Mr. Mosley
I'm glad you're my maker
My Loyalty lies in your hands, you're my breath taker
Your body, your kiss is in unknown demand
So take command, go Timbo

I be the same when it all goes up
I be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one, open it up
I be the last one closin' it out
Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet
Lil Mama I'm peepin' your style
Do I think you're dope enough, yup
One way of findin' it out
The way you came at me, boo
Don't care, not afraid I'm like Wild
Really want it from head to toe
Question if she gon let it out
Anyway the hour glass go
I don't worry anyhow
Why don't we see where it go
Let's figure it out

When the cats come out the vamps come out to playy yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy yeahh
In the morning after
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy yeahh
In the morning after Dark

Owww, oooohhh owww

Come on SoShy

I got a little secret for ya
I never sleep when comes the night
But every time I snap my fingers
I switch back into the light
My moon belong to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust
Something that I just can't describe (ah)
Am I the one and only (ah)
Cause you're the only one (ah)
It felt so long and lonely (ah)
Waiting for you to come
It's lookin' bright and early
I'm willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story
Timbo and SoShy

When the cats come out the bats come out to playy yeahh

Heyy, heyy, (ay) heyy, timbo!

You talk about takin' it slow
I'm talkin' about takin' it wild
Don't wanna be too up front no
Baby you know it's my style
I'm talkin' about lightin' it up
You talkin' about dimmin' it down
Don't think about lettin' it go
But I've never seen no king that bows
Yes I'm the one and only
You know I see right through ya
I get it your magnetic
So you draw me right to ya
Maybe I give you a shot yup
Maybe you deserve the crown
Won't give you a treasure map yet
Cause you'll figure it out
