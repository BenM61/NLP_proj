Receiving dept. 3 a.m.
Staff cuts have socked up the overage
Directives are posted.
No callbacks  complaints.
Everywhere is calm.
Hong Kong is present
Taipei awakes

All talk of circadian rhythm
I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache gray
Daysleeper

The bull and the bear are marking
Their territories
They're leading the blind with
Their international glories
I'm the screen  the blinding light
I'm the screen, I work at night.
I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache gray
Don't wake me with so much.
Daysleeper.

I cried the other night
I can't even say why
Fluorescent flat caffeine lights
Its furious balancing
I'm the screen, the blinding light
I'm the screen, I work at night
I see today

Don't wake me with so much. the
Ocean machine is set to nine
I'll squeeze into heaven and valentine
My bed is pulling me.
Gravity

Daysleeper, daysleeper.
Daysleeper, daysleeper, daysleeper
