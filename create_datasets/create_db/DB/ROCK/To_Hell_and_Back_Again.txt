How long must I stay
How long must I go on
Taking my chances on burning away
Don't take away my daylight
Don't take away my dream

Why must I go 
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again

Will I make the morning 
To see another day
The Gods may come at midnight
They're taking me away
I'm waiting here on death row
I pray for my reprieve

Why must I go 
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again

The chaplain and the gardener 
Have told me how to die
I've used up all my chances
Now's the time to cry
For I can hear the footsteps
The lights have just gone dim
I'm on the final journey

Why must I go 
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again

Will I make the morning 
To see another day
The Gods may come at midnight
They're taking me away
I'm waiting here on death row
I pray for my reprieve
Why must I go 
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again

The chaplain and the gardener 
Have told me how to die
I've used up all my chances
Now's the time to cry
For I can hear the footsteps
The lights have just gone dim
I'm on the final journey

Why must I go 
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
To hell and back again
