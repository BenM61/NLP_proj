Listen all you chillunto that voodoo moan,
There's a modern villunworser than that old boogie woogie,
When that goofy critterspot your fancy clothes,
He injects a jitter,
Starts you dancing on a thousand toes,
There he goes.
Who's that hiding in the tree top?
It's that rascal The Jitterbug,
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible 
buzz,
But the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees couldn't do what The 
Jitterbug does;
So be careful of that rascal,
Keep away from The Jitterbug, The Jitterbug.
Who's that hiding in the tree top?
It's that rascal The Jitterbug,
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible 
buzz,
But the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees couldn't do what The

So be careful of that rascal,
Keep away from The Jitterbug, The Jitterbug. 
Oh!  The Jitter, Oh! The Bug,Oh! 
The Jitterbug, Bugabug, bugabug, bugaboo.
In a twitter, in the throes, 
Oh the critter's 
Got me dancing on a thousand toes,
Thar' she blows 
Who's that hiding in the tree top?
It's that rascal The Jitterbug,
Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,
Keep away from The Jitterbug.
Oh! The bees in the breeze and the bast in the trees have a terrible, horrible
