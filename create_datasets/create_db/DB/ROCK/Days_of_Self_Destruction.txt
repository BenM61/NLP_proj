Hellbound
As you descend from way above
To much below
There's nothing left to believe
Spaced out
Pure confusion takes control inside your head
Is it you or disease?

Welcome to the days of self destruction
Can you fight the evil deep within your soul?
Welcome to the days of self destruction
And I'll be damned if there ain't demons in control

Anger
There left to burn a lonely hole
Question your goals
You haven't earned any answers
Patience
Your swollen greed surpassed your needs
Enough's enough
And you will rot from the inside

Welcome to the days
Welcome to the days
Welcome to the days
Welcome to the days

Welcome to the days of self destruction
Can you fight the evil deep within your soul?
Welcome to the days of self destruction
And I'll be damned if there ain't demons in control

Hatred
Isn't easy to let go
You're even mad in your dreams
Wasted
Every moment you complain
You are not gonna win

Welcome to the days
Welcome to the days
Welcome to the days
Welcome to the days

Welcome to the days of self destruction
Can you fight the evil deep within your soul?
Welcome to the days of self destruction
And I'll be damned if there ain't demons in control
