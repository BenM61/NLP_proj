Business goes on as usual,
The corn and the profits are high
And TV's boom in every living room,
They tell us what deodorants to buy

Business goes on as usual,
Except that my brother's dead,
He was 25 and very much alive,
But the dreams have all been blasted from his head

In in a far off land with a gun in his hand
He died in a war he did not understand

While business goes on as usual,
There's plenty to choose from the rack
But rumor goes that the latest thing in clothes,
The latest things in clothes will be black.

But business goes on as usual, as usual, as usual.
