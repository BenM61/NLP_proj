Get the party started from the left to the right
Move your body dance all night x4
Woo, woo, woo etc

[Hannah]
I know a place where the mood is just right
They got the vibe and they're pumpin it all night
Where the heat is high and the lights are low
And when you want it, it's the only place you gotta go

[Bridge]
Come on down to the party town
And leave your reservations at the bus stop baby
At the bus stop baby baby

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance
Come on and do it baby
Dance, dance, dance
Shake it up shake it out
Dance, dance, dance
Just keep it movin' on the dance floor
Boogie on the dance floor boogie-woogie
Woo, woo, woo etc

[Hannah]
It's everywhere it's in everything
We're getting down and the whole place is movin'
Feel the music pump
Hear the vinyl scream
Run to your mama if I scare you with my funky thing

[Bridge]
Come on down to the party town
And leave your reservations at the bus stop baby
At the bus stop baby baby

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance
Come on and do it baby
Dance, dance, dance
Shake it up shake it out
Dance, dance, dance
Just keep it movin' on the dance floor
Boogie on the dance floor boogie woogie ( x2 )

[Bridge]
Get the party started from the left to the right
Move your body dance all night ( x4 )
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Just keep it movin' on the dance floor
Boogie on the dance floor boogie-woogie

[Repeat Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance
Come on and do it baby
Dance, dance, dance
Shake it up shake it out
Dance, dance, dance
Just keep it moving on the dance floor
Boogie on the dance floor boogie woogie
