A penny for your thoughts my love
A penny for your thoughts my love
A swinging door, a swinging door
A penny for your thoughts

They try to jump me, they try to jump me
A penny for you thoughts my love
A penny for you thoughts my love
They're spaghetti, they're spaghetti
They possess me, they possess me, they possess me

I'm trying to be a thought killer
I'm trying to be a thought killer
They come back to bite me
?
A penny for you thoughts my love
A penny for you thoughts my love

They court disaster, They court disaster
I'm trying to be a thought killer
A penny for you thoughts my love
A penny for you thoughts 
You'll forget me, You'll forget me
I'm trying to be a thought killer
A penny for you thoughts

They distract me, they distract me
A penny for you thoughts my love

I'm sending out choirs of angels
Trying round pieces of string
Pieces of string
To run amok run amok ran amok
To run amok

You got me you got me
You got me you got me
Back to bite me
Back to bite me
A penny for your thoughts
