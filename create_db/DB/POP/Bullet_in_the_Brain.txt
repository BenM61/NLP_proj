Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same

Looking back on where we used to be
Everything was clear, still I refuse to see
Hearts began to rust
The diamond turned to dust
Baby took her pain all out on me

Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same

I know I share the blame for whatâ€™s in store
I was in the wrong but weren't you anymore
I let you use my gifts
To back your lying wits
I'll never know just what I did it for

Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
