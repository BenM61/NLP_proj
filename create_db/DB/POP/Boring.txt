If I told you that, that I fucked your best friend, 
Would you even listen or slap me in the face turn and walk away.
If I told you that I burned all your money would you stand 
And watch me or throw me on the flames turn and walk away.

I can’t believe I was turning to be something 
So high at first now I’m falling asleep inside, you got anything inside.

It’s too late I can take another minute awake
What I’m feeling ain’t loving or hate, yes baby, 
You bore the shit outta me, cause it’s too late 
I can’t take another second awake what you giving it ain’t working for me, 
'Cause baby you bore the shit outta me.

If I made you think, you were never really that good.
I’m sorry but it felt good trying to make you react, want you to react. 

I can’t believe I was turning to be something 
So high at first now I’m falling asleep inside, 
You got anything inside.

It’s too late I can take another minute awake 
What I’m feeling ain’t loving or hate, yes baby, 
You bore the shit outta me, cause it’s too late 
I can’t take another second awake what you giving it ain’t working for me, 
'Cause baby you bore the shit outta me.

I wish you’d wake up, cause all I need is love, all I need is love.
Yes I, wish you’d wake up, cause all I need is love, all I need is you. 

It’s too late I can take another minute awake 
What I’m feeling ain’t loving or hate, yes baby, 
You bore the shit outta me, 
'Cause it’s too late I can’t take another second awake 
What you giving it ain’t working for me, 
'Cause baby you bore the shit outta me.

Wish you’d wake up. 
All I need is love baby.
