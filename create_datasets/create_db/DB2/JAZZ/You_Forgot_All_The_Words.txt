Love was like a song
A lovely melody
Our hearts would sing along
In perfect harmony
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune
Each time our lips would cling

I heard a serenade
Of love and youth and spring
Forever to be played
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune
We used to dance
Instead of walk
We used to sing

Instead of talk
Why was our love song
That used to be
Only the start of the blues for me
But songs are funny things
They never really die
And so my hope still clings

That someday you will try
To just remember the words
For I still remember the tune
When lonely lights are lit
And midnight songs will start
Our song I must admit
Still fills my hopeful heart
So please remember the words
For I still remember the tune
