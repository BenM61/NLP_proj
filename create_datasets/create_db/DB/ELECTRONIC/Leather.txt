When you kiss the base of my spine
Make my body into your shrine
You give me this feeling deep inside
One that I can no longer disguise
While other snakes just shed their skins
Fucked holes pointing out my sins
Even though I realize that history's not on my side
Even though I realize the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes

If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before
I wanna go to heaven, so you give me some more

Flying high upon the gallows
Too messed up to step out of the shadows
A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow
Rescued from this deep dark hole
Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails
Time is nigh for you leather girls
Maybe we should end this race
Vanish while we cannot leave no trace

If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
I saw a life before me, but now I'm blind
See one-arm film stars on alien beaches
Potted gold and tattooed faces
Harrison murals on the corner, tupperware boxes full of hops
Diazepam dreams there catching streams
Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green
Still I've got a flash-bulb head
Still I've got a flash-bulb head

If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before
I wanna go to heaven, so you give me some more

Come along nice, come along dead
Scorpio rising, and paint it red
A psychic equalizer in your head
Come along nice, come along dead
Scorpio rising, and paint it red
A psychic equalizer in your head (repeat all)
