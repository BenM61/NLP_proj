Independent girl
Independent girl
A limousine in the night
Drives away out of side
The Girl inside stole my pride
Run away with my whole life
Don't expect she turn around
Think about what she left behind
It is time to know what is going on
She turned my world around

She is the one, she is the girl
Who left me in this misery
Stole my pride 
Stole my life
Leaving me in mystery

(You are) 
Independent girl, you tried to ruin my world
And every time she goes
She'll cast me in her spell
Independent girl living in her world
You never know her well
My love for her is blind

(You are my)
Independent girl, you tried to ruin my world
And every time she goes 
She'll cast me in her spell
Independent girl living in her world
You never know her well
My love for her is blind

(I'll hope that you are)
My Independent girl you tried to ruin my world
An independent girl

Dig him out, she feels mo change
Love to her is just a game
Cause of her I feel I've changed
Feels day of fairy tale 

Calls my name 
Place the game
Way ahead of time
Stole my pride
Kills my life
Leaving me in mystery 

Independent girl you tried to ruin my world
And every time she goes
She'll cast me in her spell
Independent girl living in her world
You never know her well
My love for her is blind
