There's no other love like you
Did you see that guy?
Which one?
You're so
Well he looked
He looks so fine
He were lookin' at you for sure
He weren't lookin' at me
So? 

Sweet, my sweet, funky thing
Sweet, my sweet, funky thing
Oh baby 

Cherry kisses on a summer's day
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
My heart's on fire when I think of you
You stay on my mind, sweet like honey dew
I need you baby like a flower needs the rain
There's nobody who can make me feel the same 

Sweet, your mine, sweet funky thing
Baby you're the one who makes my heart sing
Sweet, my sweet, sweet funky thing
You know you're the one who makes my heart sing
My baby, oh 

I need your loving baby, every day
I give it all to you boy when you say
I want your loving right here and now
You've got me burning inside and out
I need you boy, like a flower needs the rain
When you wash away the hurt and ease my pain 

Sweet, my sweet, sweet funky thing
Baby you're the one who makes my heart sing
Sweet, my sweet, sweet funky thing
You know you're the one who makes my heart sing
Sweet, my sweet, sweet funky thing
Baby you're the one who makes my heart sing 

(Sweet funky thing, my sweet funky thing) 
If you're feeling the same my heart calls your name
The time is right for you and me tonight
My love runs so deep, it's yours to keep
Turn off the light, I know you want to be with me 

Sweet, sweet funky thing
Baby you're the one who makes my heart sing
Sweet, my sweet, sweet funky thing
You know you're the one who makes my heart sing 

I need your loving every day
Like a flower needs the rain
Late at night I think of you
And the special things you do
I need you baby every day
Like a flower needs the rain
Late at night I dream of you
And the special things you do 

My sweet
(Sweet funky thing, my sweet funky thing) 

(ad lib to fade)
