I'm biting the blade of your scissors
As the champagne fizzes
Keep it on ice
There's plenty more biting to do yet

Words dribble from my mouth
As I freeze your lungs

Of penetrating
Your fucking noodle is tangled
Your fucking noodle's been tango'd 

I'm biting the blade of your scissors
As the champagne fizzes
Keep it on ice
There's plenty more biting to do yet
I freeze your lungs
So have little hope
Of penetrating
You fucking nobody fandango
Your fucking noodley tango
Oo

Biting the blade of your scissors

I'm biting the blade of your scissors
As the champagne fizzes
Keep it on ice
There's plenty more biting (to do yet)
Words dribble from my mouth
As I freeze your lungs
So have little hope
Of penetrating
Your fucking noodle is tangled
