You can keep the good times righteousness
The best parting line
Rather then pretend we are A1 ultrafine
Shall I be the first then to say what we have found
There's something in our lifetime won't let us settle down

Darling it's a life of surprises
It's no help growing older or wiser
You don't have to pretend you're not crying
When it's even in the way that you're walking

Never let your conscience be harmful to your health
Let no neurotic impulse turn inward on itself
Just say that you were happy, as happy would allow
And tell yourself that that will have to do for now

Darling it's a life of surprises
It's no help growing older or wiser
You don't have to pretend you're not crying
When it's even in the way that you're walking - Baby talking

Never say you're bitter Jack
Bitter makes the worst things come back

Darling it's a life of surprises

Bitter makes the worst things come back
