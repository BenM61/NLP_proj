Are you high tonight, are you feeling right,
Cause I need you now, like I never did before,
Is it hard enough, is it loud enough
Cause if you don't approve,you can use the door
Armed and ready, I gotta gun sight trained on you
I'm in overdrive,and I feel alive,
Got everything I need, and that ain't all,
Got a thing to do, I want to do for you,
I want to see you jump like hell when I call
Armed and ready, I gotta spotlight trained on you
Armed and ready, don't let me down tonight
Are you high tonight, are you feeling right,
Cause I need you now, like I never did before,
Is it hard enough, is It loud enough
Cause if you don't approve,you can use the door
Armed and ready, I got my gun sight trained on you
Armed and ready, don't let me down tonight
Are you high tonight, are you feelin' right,
Is it hard enough, is it loud enough,
Are you high!
