It's cold and dark
I think I'm going insane
The end is coming, it's true
I'm all alone and I'm screaming your name
It seems that's all I can do

But it's too late to turn back now
It's too loud to hear the sound
I'm so lost, I can't be found
It's too late to turn back now

It's hard to focus when your life is a blur
(life is a blur)
It's hard to see the truth
How can I move on when there's so much to learn
And every road comes back to you

But it's too late to turn back now
It's too loud to hear the sound
I'm so lost, I can't be found
It's too late to turn back now

But it's too late to turn back now
It's too loud to hear the sound
I'm so lost, I can't be found
It's too late to turn back now, now

I'm so lost, I cannot be found
It's too late to turn back now
