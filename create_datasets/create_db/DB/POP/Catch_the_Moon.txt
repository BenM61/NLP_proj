Can you catch the moon
And hold it in your hands
Cause I can catch the moon
And I do my moon dance
I press my hands together
And slowly spin around

Tell my moon bird sister
To pick me up
And we'll go flying

Can you see what shines
When it's dark outside
'Cause I can see the moonshine
When I look in your eyes
When I catch the moon
I throw it to you
And you'd be happy too
I do that for you

We can dance together
And slowly spin around
'Cause you're my moon bird sister
I can see you, you're laughing

You can catch me
You'll be happy
I can see you
You're laughing

You can catch me
You'll be happy
I can see you
I'm so happy

You can catch me
I'm so happy
I can see you
You're laughing
