Inside you is you heart 
As also is a ball of hatred 
You struggle within 
Don't let that hatred swallow you whole 

'Cause darkness is all you see 
You use it as a foundation of strength 
But in fact its what makes you weak 
You are so much more 

Than that ball of hate 
(But it's all that you'll let us see) 
We won't tear you apart 
We're you're fucking friends 

But I won't take the fall 
Just to save your ball of bitter hatred 
It's your call now it's up to you 
What will you do? 

I know you can be yourself 
Again closer to the kid I knew 
You can be you it's not that hard to do 
If you trust in us like I said 

We won't tear you apart 
It's up to you to make a start
