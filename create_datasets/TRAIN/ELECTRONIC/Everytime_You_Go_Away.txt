Babe if we can't solve any problems
Why do we loose so many tears
Whoa, so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same things
But can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on

And every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you you

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
But doesn't mean that much to me
I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby even though you know

That every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Just don't care girl
every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you you

'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know
That every time you go away
(every time you go away)
(every time you go away)

Why you have to go away right now
(every time you go away)
(every time you go away)
Go on and go away girl
(every time you go away)
I don't understand why you gotta go girl
(every time you go away)

Go on and go free
Even though you mean so much to me
(every time you go away)
I don't understand baby
(every time you go away)
Oh baby, baby, baby every time you go
(every time you go away)
You don't know, you don't know
Because you never understand girl
(every time you go away)

Why you have to go away right now
(every time you go away)
every time you go girl
(every time you go away)
Go on, go on and go free
(every time you go away)
Baby you mean so much to me
I'll never understand why you gotta go girl
(every time you go away)

I don't understand girl
(every time you go away)
I don't know go, I don't know go
I don't know go, I don't know go
I don't know go, I don't know go
(every time you go away)
Go girl, go girl, gotta go girl, you won babe
(every time you go away)
Baby, baby, baby
(every time you go away)
