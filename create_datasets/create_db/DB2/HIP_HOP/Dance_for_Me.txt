Let me play you something
To make you keep your body moving
Winding, keeping my attention
Girl if I keep playin' will you keep
Doin' what you doin' ooh wee
So much more than sexy
(she's inspiration) every twist of you waist
Makes the chord that I play (change)
Like you're controlling me (strange)
(infatuation) started to kick in
I wanna strum you like this guitar in my hands but for now I wanna watch you

Dance for me 'cause you know you're gonna wind up coming
Home with me but for now baby wanna watch you
Dance for me, dance for me, just let me
Later we'll be makin' love 
But for now girl just dance for me

Let me play you something
(enticing keep you wanting)
This here strumming stroking your imagination
(your imagination)
When we take this to the crib
Let the music take your inhibitions
(willfully) but for now just dance for me

(she's inspiration)
Every twist of your waist
Makes the chord that I play (change)
Like you're controlling me (strange)
(infatuation) started to kick in
I wanna strum you like this guitar in my hands but for now I wanna watch you

Dance for me 'cause you know you're gonna wind up coming
Home with me but for now baby wanna watch you
Dance for me, dance for me, just let me
Later we'll be makin' love 
But for now girl just dance for me

Oh its so (hard to concentrate)
Girl you're making it hard for me
I can't take my eyes away
Senorita, like to meet you
Maybe after I'm through
You know what I wanna do later on
I wanna watch you

Dance for me 'cause you know you're gonna wind up coming
Home with me but for now baby wanna watch you
Dance for me, dance for me, just let me
Later we'll be makin' love 
But for now girl just dance for me
