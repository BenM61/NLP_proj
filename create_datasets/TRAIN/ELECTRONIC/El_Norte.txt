It's a million miles 
A giant place 
Like a work of art 
Amazing, amazing 

Fast cars that cannot move 
Die for a parking space 
Stuck on a carousel 
Crazy, it's crazy 

When you laugh 
Till you cry 
When you laugh 

All's well here in El Norte 
Who'd have thought it could be like this 
Big money for a job well done 
I swear to you 
I got a ride from a coyote 
Who sells high on the black market 

So your loved one can be home soon 
So your loved one can be home soon 

Fine women with dress-up clothes 
Say and do anything 
Wake up to work the day 
Tousled and tangled 

Rub shoulders with the downtown gang 
Where the Virgin lives 
Just like a movie star 
Hopeful and graceful 

When she smiles 
Till you laugh 
Till you cry 

All's well here in El Norte 
Who'd have thought it could be like this 
Big money for a job well done 
I swear to you 
I got a ride from a coyote 
Who sells high on the black market 

Maybe I don't understand it 
Maybe I won't try 
But nobody seems too satisfied 

All's well here in El Norte 
Who'd have thought it could be like this 
Big money for a job well done 
I swear to you 
I got a ride from a coyote 
Who sells high on the black market
