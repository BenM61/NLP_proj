He
(You are under my power
It is the power of love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
You say my kisses taste like magic, well, stop
That's got to be the classic line
Please no more "Presto-Changeo" now that I'm in love, baby
'Cause that would really blow my mind
I'd pull a rabbit out of my hat
Or cross a black cat's path to find you
And darling, you can best believe
There's nothing up my sleeve but love

It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic, got me under your spell
It must be magic (It must be magic), oh, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic)
Ooh, you got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
Keep workin' my love such a magical feeling
You got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
And I love it, love it, love it
(Tilt me)

It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good
It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good

You say you know I've got the potion, well, stop
No baby, don't stop, don't you dare (Don't you stop it, baby, don't you dare)
Aladdin, Houdini and Merlin the Magician
To you they never could compare
I see no long black flowing cape
Yet still I can't escape those two eyes (When I look in your eyes)
And we don't need no crystal ball
'Cause we have said it all in love

It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic, got me under your spell
It must be magic (It must be magic), oh, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic)
Ooh, you got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
Keep workin' my love such a magical feeling
You got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
And I love it, love it, love it
(Tilt me)

I can't get enough of it, of it, no, no, no, whoa
It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic (It must be magic)
It must be magic (it must be magic), got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic), oh, baby
It must be magic (It must be magic), our good fortune, I can tell, baby
It must be magic
'Cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic
Got me love, got me loving you
It must be magic
'Cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic
Got me love, got me loving you

Teena went to Wonderland, the plot is getting thick (Ooh, magic)
Met the King of Punk Funk and he taught her all the tricks
She feels the heat, there's magic in her feet
Now she's groovin', always movin' to the funky beat
Under your spell, ooh, it must be magic
Under your spell, what is it, what is it
Under your spell, ooh, it must be magic

What is it, what is it, what is it, what is it
It must be magic
'Cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic
Got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic
'Cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic
Our good fortune I can tell, baby
It must be magic
We're gonna take it to the top
It must be magic
Don't you let the magic stop
It must be magic

Got me love, got me loving you
Got me love, got me loving you
Got me love, got me loving you
It must be magic
'Cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic
Got me under your spell, baby
It must be magic
'Cause it feels so good to me
It must be magic

Temptations, sing
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
It must be magic
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
It must be magic
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
Baby must be a magician 'cause he's sure got the magic touch
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
It must be magic
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
My baby must be a magician 'cause he's sure got the magic touch
