First, first time I looked into your eyes
I saw heaven, oh, heaven in your eyes
Everything I did before you, wasn't worth my while
It should've been you all the time
I'll do anything, and everything to please you
You know how much I need you
You're always, always, on my mind

You're more than wonderful
More than amazing
Irreplaceable, love, love, of my life
You're so incredible, here in these arms tonight
The irreplaceable, love, love, of my life

Always, seems like reality
Forever, don't seem so far away
All I wanna do, all I wanna feel, all I wanna be is close to you
Everyday, is my lucky day
All I wanna do, is love you
I place no one above you
I'll tell you why

You're more than wonderful
More than amazing
The irreplaceable, love, love, of my life
You're so incredible, here in these arms tonight
The irreplaceable, love, love, of my life

Baby you know, you know you're my one and only
(All I wanna do is be together)
Sugar you know, I'll never leave you lonely
In your eyes, in your eyes I see forever
Ah, oh, oh, oh
h, oh, oh

You're more than wonderful
More than amazing
The irreplaceable, love, love, of my life
You're so incredible, here in these arms tonight
The irreplaceable, love, love, of my life
