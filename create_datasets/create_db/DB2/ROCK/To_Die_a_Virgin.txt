Well we've been going together
Since the eighth of November
And though it seems like forever
I very clearly remember
You told me on our first date
What you'd do on my birthday
Well hooray it's my birthday!
And frankly, baby, I can't wait.

I don't want to die a virgin

The other day I discovered
A magazine of my brother's
I read it under the covers
It got me all hot and bothered.
Now every time that I see you
Your uniform becomes see-through
You don't know how much I need you
The "Handy Andys" I've been through

I don't want to die a virgin

The pines and the cedars rejoice in his fall
How are you fallen from heaven?
Oh Hellel, star of the morning

With all the bombs and the bird-flu
We're probably gonna be dead soon
And here we are in your bedroom
Oh did I tell you I love you I love you I love you
I can feel your heart beating
And your breathing increasing
Your folks are out for the evening
I really hope I'm not dreaming

I don't want to die a virgin
