She knows the voices in her mind
They tell her
To leave
 
She's tired of smiling madly
Until silence becomes very silently 
A noise in her mind
 
After all she has nothing inside
No good to give
No meaning to live
The mist engulfed tonight
Every single star
 
After all they shared 
How could he simply say no
After all they shared
He turned away from her to go
She said she wouldn't cry
That was really just a lie
 
She knows the noises in her mind
Nothing's left but
Screaming silence
 
After all she feels numbness inside
The feeling's gone
She's upside down
The pictures behind her closed eyes
This time you went too far
 
After all they shared 
How could he simply say no
After all they shared
He turned away from her to go
She said she wouldn't cry
That was really just a lie
 
After all they shared 
How could he simply say no
After all they shared
He turned away from her to go
She said she wouldn't cry
That was really just a lie
 
After all she has nothing inside
No good to give
No meaning to live
The mist engulfed tonight
Every single star
 
After all they shared 
How could he simply say no
After all they shared
He turned away from her to go
She said she wouldn't cry
That was really just a lie
 
After all they shared 
How could he simply say no (simply say no)
After all they shared
He turned away from her to go
She said she wouldn't cry
That was really just a lie
 
After all they shared 
How could he simply say no (simply say no)
After all they shared
He turned away from her to go
She said she wouldn't cry
That was really just a lie
 
After all they shared 
How could he simply say no (how could he simply say no)
After all they shared (after all)
He turned away from her to go (he just turned away)
She said she wouldn't cry
That was really just a lie
