I'd rather be liberated, I find myself captivated
Stop doing what you, keep doing it too 
I'd rather stay bold and lonely, I dream I'm your one and only
Stop doing what you keep doing it too 

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for mulder and scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone

I'd rather be jumping ship, I find myself jumping straight in
Stop doing what you keep doing it too 
Forever be dozy and dim, I wake myself thinking of him
Stop doing what you keep doing it too

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for mulder and scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone

Here, my bed is made for two and there's nothing I can do
So tell me something I don't know
If my head is full of you is there nothing I can do?
Must we all march in two by two by two?
And as for some happy ending, I'd rather stay single and thin
Stop doing what you keep doing to me

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for mulder and scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone here
Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for mulder and scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone

So what have you got to say about that?
And what does someone do without love?
And what does someone do with love?
And what have you got to say about that?
