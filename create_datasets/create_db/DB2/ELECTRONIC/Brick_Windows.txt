Been bangin' my head against the window
Just trying to see the world outside
Some people say it doesn't matter
Some people take you for a ride

I am covered in blood and broken glass
It seems the window likes to fight

Some people say the world's on fire
Some people say the world's on ice
Some people say the world's on ice
Sweet all alone in alienation

Brick windows
I am sticking my face right through the glass
Just trying to see if the world's alive

Some people will say the window's broken
Some people will say it's all right
Some people will say it's all right
Keep bangin' my head against the wall (wall...)

Just trying to keep the past alive
Some people who make the windows shatter
Some people who make it airtight
Some people who make it airtight

Sweet all alone in alienation
Sweet all alone in alienation
Brick windows
Brick windows
