A diamond ring and twelve red roses
Everything she ever wanted
All those dreams and now they're finally here
She's so young and he's so perfect
They waited for love and it was worth it
She wants to feel like this for a hundred years

All this life still yet to live and they can hardly wait
They can laugh, they can cry
The future looks so beautiful and bright
They can dance under the moonlight
'Cause God is smilin' down on them tonight
And she wants to stay right here
Make it last for a hundred more years

She's got blue eyes just like her mother
Three years old, he's crazy for her
He wants to freeze this day before it disappears
She's spinnin' like a little princess
Makin' sure he's gonna notice
He could watch her twirl for a hundred years

She'll grow up and she'll leave home but until that day
He can laugh, they can cry
The future looks so beautiful and bright
They can dance under the moonlight
'Cause God is smilin' down on them tonight
And he wants to stay right here
Make it last for a hundred more years

And its only time
But it flies right by
And today is sweeter than we know

And so they dance under the moonlight
While God is smilin' down on them tonight
And they want to stay right here
For a hundred more years
