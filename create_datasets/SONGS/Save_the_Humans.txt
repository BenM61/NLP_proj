Save the humans, they're in distress
Save the humans, we're an awful mess
Let me tell you, baby, we got problems
As a species we're unfit to solve 'em

We can purify the oily seas
We can empathize with manatees
Even chit-chat with chimpanzees
But we're still dyin' from a sin disease

We're in the water and the water's hot
Yeah, we need somethin' that we ain't got
Oh, let's go

Whoa whoa, come and rescue me
Whoa whoa, gimme what I need
Whoa whoa, we're a dying breed
One hope, baby, only God can save the humans now

Sink the whaling ships save the whales
Kick out the French, save the baby snails
Stop the interstellar radiation
But we can never be our own salvation

We need somebody who can take control
We need somebody who can save our souls
Oh, let's go

Whoa whoa, come and rescue me
Whoa whoa, gimme what I need
Whoa whoa, we're a dying breed

One hope, baby, only God can save the humans now
Singing, one hope, baby
Only God can save the humans now, ooh, ooh

Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, God, save the humans

Whoa whoa, come and rescue me
Whoa whoa, gimme what I need
Whoa whoa, we're a dying breed
One hope, baby, only God can save the humans

Whoa whoa, come and rescue me
Whoa whoa, from my humanity
Whoa whoa, we're a dying breed

One hope, baby, only God can save the humans now
Singing, one hope, baby
Only God can save the humans now, ooh, ooh

Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans

Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans

Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans, save the humans
Save the humans
