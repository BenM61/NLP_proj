I'm so
Stupid and foolish I dropped the other to be available now
Where are you to keep the confidence?

I'm so
Stupid and foolish I dropped the other to be available now
Where are you to keep me faithful?

My oh my oh my
Did I drop the other
Why oh why oh why

You make it look so good
The way you put it like that
Yes I know we could
So shall we?
From the very first time
I could see in your eyes
They showed me everything
I need was waiting

Yes I always work hard
I can make you flip out
You see now I got nerve
For asking what I'm worth
If you really got faith
Then I know you'll invest
Hold your money up high
Waving and smiling
