I don't wanna feel like I don't have a future
I don't wanna feel like it's an end of a summer
Let's not fall back to sleep like we used to
I don't wanna wake up knowing I don't have a future

(Impossible, impossible)
Impossible, your love is something I cannot remember

I don't wanna spend another day in this city
I woke up thirsty, it's hard to go back, you know
Let's not fall back to sleep like we used to, do you remember?
I don't wanna wake up knowing I don't have a future
And I know it's

(Impossible, impossible)
Impossible, your love is something I cannot remember
And there's a first time and a second time, you gotta hold on
Did you know it could happen to you?
Your love is something I cannot remember

I don't wanna see the same pictures all over
And I've been standing on the same spot now since it's been over
'Cause someone promised me a new chance, yes, you promised
I don't wanna wake up knowing I don't have a future
And I know it's

(Impossible, impossible)
Impossible, your love is something I cannot remember
Now there's a first time and a second time, you gotta hold on
Did you know it could happen to you?
Your love is something I cannot remember
Your love is impossible

Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

You are just like your mother, I'm just as same as the others
Do you believe everything they write in all those magazines?
Stay out of love until you're ready, stay out of it 'cause it scares you
You'll still find your love outside the public library

I know it could happen to you
I know it could happen to you
I know it could happen to you
I know, did you? It could happen to you

I know it could happen to you
I know it could happen to you
And I know it's

(Impossible, impossible)
Impossible, your love is something I cannot remember
Now there's a first time and a second time, you gotta hold on
Did you know it could happen to you?
Your love is something I cannot remember
Your love is impossible

(Impossible, impossible)
It's impossible
(Impossible, impossible)

There's a first time and a second time, you gotta hold on
First time and second time
There's a first time and second time
(Impossible, impossible)
Impossible
