Every now and then
When the world steps in
Stealin' all our time away
It soon takes so much
We forget to touch
That's when I know it's time for me to say

Take my hand
Let's walk through love's door
And be free from the world once more
Here's my arms
We can hide today
And love the world away

Once again we'll be
where our hearts are free
And the time is ours to share
Love will always stay
Just a touch away
Come with me
All the magic's waiting there

Take my hand
Let's walk through love's door
And be free from the world once more
Here's my arms
We can hide today
And love the world away

We can love the world away
