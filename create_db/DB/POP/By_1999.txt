Ecstasy, that's how I feel you feel for me
But loving you has only just begun like racing sun your way

You're so sure
You seem to have the one like you by loving me
It's not that nice
But freedom is the price to pay, to pay, to pay

By 1999 ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
You and I'll be fine ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
Twenty years from now ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
We can see if we belong together
By 1999 ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
I'll give you a sign ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
Oh maybe today - (don't push, don't push me baby)
I might stay
I'd stay with you forever

All things pass
And I was caught in the looking glass
But why not try to make a lovely dream
Strangers see their dreams come true

Time will tell
If I would fly on rocket ships to mars
To milky ways of stars with you
With you, with you oh

By 1999 ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
You and I'll be fine ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
Twenty years from now ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
We can see if we belong together
By 1999 ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
I'll give you a sign ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
Oh maybe today ¨c (don't push, don't push me baby)
I might say I'd stay with you forever

Repeat
