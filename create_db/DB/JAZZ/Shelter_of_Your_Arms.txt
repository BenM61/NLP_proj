In this cold world no matter where I go the clouds are all the same.
To them I'm just a pebble in the sand, a face without a name.
Nobody gives a hang for what I say or do . .but you;
And in the shelter of your arms I find peace and comfort and care:
For I am wanted there (wanted there)
 
In this cold world I struggle to survive and sometimes I would fall.
You think someone would lend a helping hand, they'd sooner see me crawl.
But just when life itself seems more than I can bear you're there
And in the shelter of your arms I find strength and safety and then
I rise and start again (start again).
 
Just give me one good reason to keep in living, 
To keep on trying for what, 
I ask you for what, 
If not for you and all your love to see me through!
 
When times looked bad, 
The shelter of your arms would keep away each fear.
And this cold world can never get me down as long as you are near.
That's why I pray to God you'll never say goodbye;
And i will know the shelter of your arms and your love
Until the day I die (day I die).
