I found love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway

True love,
Will never die
So I've been told
But now I must cry
It is finally goodbye
I know

With music softly playing,
Her lips were gently saying
"I love you"
She held me in desperation 
I thought it was a revelation
And then she walked out

How could I be so blind
To give up love the very first time
To be fooled is a hurting pain
To be loved and fooled is a crying shame
While I bear the blame
As she laughs my name

With music softly playing
Her lips were gently saying
"Honey, I love you."
She held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation
And then she walked out

I found love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway

Bye, bye baby, bye, bye
Lost it on a lonely highway
