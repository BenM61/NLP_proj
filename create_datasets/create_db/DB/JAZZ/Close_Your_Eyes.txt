Close your eyes,
Put your head on my shoulder and sleep.
Close your eyes.
And I will close mine.

Close your eyes,
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep.
Close your eyes.
This is divine.

Music play,
Something dreamy for dancing,
While we're romancing,
It's loves holiday.
And love will be our guide.

Close your eyes,
When you open them dear I'll be near.
By your side.
So won't you close your eyes?
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

Close your eyes,
Put your head on my shoulder and sleep.
Close your eyes.
And I will close mine.

Close your eyes,
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep.
Close your eyes.
This is divine.

Music play,

While we're romancing,
It's loves holiday.
And love will be our guide.

Close your eyes,
When you open them dear I'll be near.
By your side.
So won't you close your eyes?
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
