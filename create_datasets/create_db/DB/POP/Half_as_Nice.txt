If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to
Who needs paradise I'd rather have you
They say paradise is up in the stars
But I needn't sigh because it's so far
'Cause I know it's worth a heaven on earth
For me where you are

A look from your eyes, a touch of your hand
And I seem to fly to some other land
When you are around my heart always pounds
Just like a brass band

If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to
Who needs paradise I'd rather have you
Oh yes I'd rather have you

If paradise is half as nice as heaven that you take me to
Who needs paradise I'd rather have you
Oh yes I'd rather have you

They say paradise is up in the stars
But I needn't sigh because it's so far
'Cause I know it's worth a heaven on earth
To me where you are

A look from your eyes a touch of your hand
And I seem to fly to some other land
