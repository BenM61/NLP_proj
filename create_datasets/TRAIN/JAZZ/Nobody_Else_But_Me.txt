I want to be no one but me
I am in love with a lady who likes me the way I am
I have my faults, she likes my faults
I'm not very bright, she's not very bright

She thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me
She may be wrong but if we get along
"What do we care?", say we

Walking on the shore, swimming in the sea
When I am with her, I am glad the boy who's with her
Is nobody else but me

She thinks I'm grand, that's grand for me
She may be wrong but if we get along
"What do we care?", say we

Walking on the shore, swimming in the sea
When I am with her, I am glad the boy who's with her
Is nobody else but me
When I am with her, I am glad the boy who's with her
Is nobody else but me
