I walked alone; I never tried to stay in line
I didn't know what I was doing half the time
I didn't know that my life would ever change
I didn't think that anybody felt the same way
And then you came

I said I wanna try it all without regrets
I wanna meet the kind of folks I never met
Skipping school and smoking cigarettes
We hadn't even really gotten started yet

(Cuckoo)
Let's go driving
(Cuckoo)
'Cause there's nowhere to go
(Cuckoo)
We're in hiding
They're telling our story on the radio

I fell in love with being defiant
In a pickup truck that roared like a lion
When you're with us, you don't have to be quiet no more

People said we'd have to make it on our own
We never thought there'd be another hand to hold
We didn't care--we never did what we were told
They couldn't break us--they could never turn us cold, no
You and me, well, we were never growing old

(Cuckoo)
Let's go driving
(Cuckoo)
'Cause there's nowhere to go
(Cuckoo)
We're in hiding
They're telling our story on the radio

I fell in love with being defiant
In a pickup truck that roared like a lion
When you're with us, you don't have to be quiet no more
No, no more

I see you now
We talk about
The way it used to be
When we were brave
We misbehaved
Yeah, you know what I mean
And you know why
Our battle cry always comes back to me

I fell in love with being defiant
In a pickup truck that roared like a lion
When you're with us, you don't have to be quiet no more
No, no more
I fell in love with being defiant
In a pickup truck that roared like a lion
When you're with us, you don't have to be quiet no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
