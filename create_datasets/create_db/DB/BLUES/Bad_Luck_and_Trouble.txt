Trouble Lord, trouble, trouble is all I see
Trouble, I said, "Trouble, trouble is all I see"
Yes, you know, I ain't got nobody there work and care for me

Bad luck and trouble, two of my best friends
Bad luck and trouble, two of my best friends
[Incomprehensible] know bad luck
Which I'm walkin' in

Bad luck and trouble hangin' 'round my door
Bad luck and trouble hangin' 'round my door
You believe it I'm a hopin', won't come back no more

Goodbye trouble
