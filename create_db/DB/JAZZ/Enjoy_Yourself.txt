Enjoy yourself while you're still in the pink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think.

You work and work for years and years
You're always on the go
Never take a minute off
To busy makin' dough
Some day, you say, you'll have your fun
When you're a millionaire
Imagine all the fun you'll have
In your old rockin' chair

Enjoy yourself it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think.
(Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself it's later than you think)

Your heart of hearts, your dream of dreams
Your ravishing brunettes
Has left you now and she's become
Somebody else's pet (pity isn't it)
Lay down that gun, don't try my friend
To reach the great beyond
You'll have more fun by reaching
For a red-head or a blonde

Enjoy yourself it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think.
(Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself it's later than you think)

There's another thing I want to tell you too.

You love somebody very much
You'd like to set the date
But money doesn't grow on trees
So you decide to wait (Foolish Fellow)
You're so afraid that you will bite off
More than you can chew
Don't be afraid, you won't have teeth
When you reach ninety two.

Enjoy yourself it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think.
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy yourself it's later than you think
