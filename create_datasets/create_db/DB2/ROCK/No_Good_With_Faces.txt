No Good with faces and I'm bad with names
Gave me directions but it's all the same, oh no
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try

Streetlamps are broken black the way I came
Who broke the moonlight watch it wax and wane, oh no
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try

Let's not get ahead of ourselves
There's no need for rain, it's our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
It's not only you you're looking at now

Road signs are stolen left here hole in this flame
Who stole my patience, who stole my way, oh no
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try

Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for raid it's our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
It's not only you you're looking at now

Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for raid it's our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
It's not only you you're looking at now

Ooh you're looking at now
Ooh you're looking at now

No good with faces and I'm bad with names
Gave me directions but it's all the same, oh no
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
