Big boy blue, come blow your horn
Big boy blue, it's almost dawn
And the band will soon be gone
Come on, blue, blow your horn

Big boy blue, it's getting late
Big boy blue, my seeds can't wait
So before you, you wear the cake
Come on, blue, blow your horn

When you blow hard and soul out
How am I gonna keep my sweet
Even with my two left feet?
I must give in, I'm in devout

Big boy blue, you know it's so
Big wide blue, before you go
Send me fast and send me slow
Come on, blue, blow your horn

So when you blow out, soul out
How am I gonna keep my seed
Even with my two left feet?
I must give in, I'm in devout

Oh Big boy blue, you know it's so
Big boy blue, before you go
Swing me high and swing me low
Come on, blue, blow your horn

Big boy blue, come blow your horn
Come on, blue, blow your horn
Come on, blue, blow your horn
So hard, so hard, how am I gonna keep my seed
Even with my two left feet?

Big boy blue, you know it's so
Big wide blue, before you go
Send me fast and send me slow
Swing me high and swing me low
Rock me too and rock me fro
Come on, blue, blow your horn
