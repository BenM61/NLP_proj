Angel came down
From heaven yesterday
Stayed with me just long enough
To rescue me

And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love
Between the moon and the deep blue sea

Then she spread her wings high over me
She said, "I'll come back again to see you tomorrow"

And I said fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side

Sure enough
This woman came home to me
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise

And my angel
She said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise"
Take my hand, you're gonna be my mind
And she took me high over yonder

And I said fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side
