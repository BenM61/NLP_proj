I've been calling
I've got endless reasons
Wait now, hold on
Say you still believe 
We run straight through fire
But we can do better
We can do better
Save our lost time
'Cause we can do better
We can do better

'Cause all that we need
Is a second to hold on
'Cause we are the strong ones
All that we need
Is a reason to fight on
'Cause we are the strong ones
Yeah we are the strong ones, we are the strong ones
We are the strong ones, we are the strong ones

We are the strong ones

Don't think
Don't speak
Let's just sit in silence
Every heartbeat
Makes it feel just like we
Run straight through fire
But we can do better
We can do better
Save our lost time
'Cause we can do better

'Cause all that we need
Is a second to hold on
'Cause we are the strong ones
All that we need
Is a reason to fight on
'Cause we are the strong ones
We are the strong ones, we are the strong ones

Is a reason to fight on
'Cause we are the strong ones
We are the strong ones, we are the strong ones
