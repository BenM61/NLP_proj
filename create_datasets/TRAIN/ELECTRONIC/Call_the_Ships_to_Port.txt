A billion words ago
The sailors disappeared
A story for the children
To rock them back to sleep

A million burning books
Like torches in our hands
A fabric of ideals
To decorate our homes

A thousand generations
The soil on which we walk
A mountain of mistakes
For us to climb for pleasure

A hundred clocks are ticking
The line becomes a circle
Spin the wheel of fortune
Or learn to navigate

A choir full of longing
Will call our ships to port
The countless lonely voices
Like whispers in the dark

A second of reflection can
Take you to the moon
The slightest hesitation can
Bring you down in flames

A single spark of passion
Can change a man forever
A moment in a lifetime
Is all it takes to break him

A fraction of a heartbeat
Made us what we are
A brother and a sister
For better or for worse

A billion words ago
They sang a song of leaving
An echo from the chorus
Will call them back again

A choir full of longing
Tonight we light the fires
We call our ships to port
Tonight we walk on water
And tomorrow we'll be gone
