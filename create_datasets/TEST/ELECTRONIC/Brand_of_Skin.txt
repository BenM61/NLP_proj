What brand of skin do you occupy?
Who is that smile on your face?
Where is the hole for the sands of time,
Smiling even lines upon my face?

Did comfort kill the curiosity,
The safety failed to engage?
Said I was empty while you shaken me,
Are you too angry to be saved?

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

What brand of skin do you occupy?
And what is left in the snow?
But in the end, let the money decide,
We get too deep we may drown

Harmony's gone
The rhythm remains
Harmony's gone
The rhythm remains
Harmony's gone
But the rhythm remains
It remains,
The rhythm remains

Harmony's gone
The rhythm remains...
