A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Shy little he and she
Were declaring love's old story
In the shade of the old apple tree

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Decided to say, "I do"
So they rode to June and glory
On a bicycle built for two

Hear the past, the song is old
The summer days are through
With silver threads among the gold
They still say, "I love you"

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Are true to this very day
For he loves her in December
As he did in May
