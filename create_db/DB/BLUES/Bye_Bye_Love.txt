Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry

Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna die

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy and I'm so blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry

I'm through with romance
I'm through with love
I'm through with countin' the stars above
And that's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I think I'm gonna die

I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die

I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die
I think I'm gonna die
