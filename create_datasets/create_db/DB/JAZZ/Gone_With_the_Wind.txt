Gone with the wind,
Just like a leaf that has blown away.
Gone with the wind,
My romance has flown away.
Yesterday's kisses
Are still on my lips,
I found a lifetime of heaven
At my fingertips.

But now all is gone,
Gone is the rapture that filled my heart.
Gone with the wind,
The gladness that stilled my heart.
Just like a flame,
Love burned brightly then became
An empty smoke dream
That is gone, gone with the wind!

Now all is gone,
Gone is the rapture that filled my heart.
Gone with the wind,
The gladness that stilled my heart.
Just like a flame,
Love burned brightly then became
An empty smoke dream
That is gone, gone with the wind!
Adios, goodbye, she's gone!
