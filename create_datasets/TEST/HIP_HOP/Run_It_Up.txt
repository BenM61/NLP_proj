All of my niggas is winners, your niggas pretenders, not even contenders
Come to my bando when it say do not enter
Jewelry below temperature, cold like December
Migo my family, yes I'm a member
If a nigga really want it, banana, I peel 'em
Actavis, sipping something discontinued
Pull up with choppas, I pop a nigga like a pimple
Thumb through that check, get adrenaline rush
I be like f*ck around and run it up
Wanna do something, gotta get up and go get it
Money don't run, gotta run to the money (Monopoly)
Trappin' dabbin' is a sport
My diamonds' water, swimming with the dolphins
Mustard Lamborghini nigga, catch up
Set the same niggas I hate drinkin' Cas
Call me Usain Bolt the way I run it up
