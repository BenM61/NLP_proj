Excuse me, madam
You're standing still in a no parking zone
You don't get a move on that body
I'll be forced to give you a ticket so get with it

There's a party tonight, you're in a red light zone
If you don't want a ticket you better move on
If you break the law you gotta pay your dues
Ain't much better if you play it by the rules

'Cause it's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it with your body, baby
It's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy if you drive it all night

No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor

Let me hear you blow your horn
(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)
Shake it, baby
(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)
(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)
Rock it, baby
(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)

Movin' violations are easy to fix
Just tell the deejay to fix it in the mix
Shake it up and shake it on down
Let me feel you movin', you gotta get down

'Cause it's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it with your body, baby
It's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy if you drive it all night

No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
I wanna say it again
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor

(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)
Shake it, baby
(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)
(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)
Rock it, baby
(Beep-beep, beep-beep, beep-beep)

Shake it
Don't drive it

Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam
Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam

Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam
Don't park your booty, don't park your can
It's time to party, it's time to jam

No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
