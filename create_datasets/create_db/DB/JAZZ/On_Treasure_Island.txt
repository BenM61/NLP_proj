I sailed away to Treasure Island
And my heart stood still 
When I landed on the silvery shore
We met that day on Treasure Island 
And the smile you gave
Was the treasure I'd been craving for. 
Then came those moments of bliss
In the shade of the sheltering palms,
I still remember your kiss
As you nestled within my arms,
I looked for gold on Treasure Island
And I found that gold 
When you gave your golden love to me.
