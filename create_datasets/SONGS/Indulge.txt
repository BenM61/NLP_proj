The way that you stare, it's so addictive
The way that you breathe, I can't resist it
So when you talk, I can't help but listen
I feel every sound, you could say I'm obsessive

I'm in danger, but I savour the thrill of you

I know that it's wrong, but I, I wanna indulge in you
I've taken too much 'cause I, I need every touch from you
I take it so strong 'cause I, I waited so long for you
I wanna indulge in you

You, I wanna indulge in
You

The light in your eye when the whole world is sleeping
The strength of your mind, I'm so addicted
The way that you stand, I can't resist it
And when you smile, you hold me like a prison

I know that it's wrong, but I, I wanna indulge in you
I've taken too much 'cause I, I need every touch from you
I take it so strong 'cause I, I waited so long for you
I wanna indulge in you

You, I wanna indulge in
You, I wanna indulge in
You, I wanna indulge in
You, I wanna indulge

I know that it's wrong, but I, I wanna indulge in you
I've taken too much 'cause I, I need every touch from you
I take it so strong 'cause I, I waited so long for you
I wanna indulge in you
