You woke me up from this sorrow place
You switch me off
Turn me on
You rescued me when you came along

No One Ever Knows Which Way is Gonna Go
Who would ever know
That we've been here last September
Let's make this suited to remember

What A Difference Your Love Makes
What A Difference Your Love Makes

Your spirit sophisticated
Like an albatros
You glide on me
You make me happy
You make me come alive
My lonely reason to survive

No One Ever Knows Which Way is Gonna Go
Who would ever know
That we've been here last September
Let's make this suited to remember

What A Difference Your Love Makes
What A Difference Your Love Makes

Wanna take you in my house
Take you in my arms
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful love
It makes sense
With you it all makes sense

Stay with me tonight
Stay with me tonight
Don't go
Why don't you love me

What A Difference Your Love Makes
What A Difference Your Love Makes
What A Difference Your Love Makes
What A Difference Your Love Makes

What A Difference Your Love Makes
It's wrong
What A Difference Your Love Makes
I know
