You smile so sweetly when you dream
And I wonder what that expression really means
Could it be that you're trying to turn the key when I don't want you to
And I think that you already know

Ain't it funny how the streets seem so gray?
When even the brightest colors seemed much brighter yesterday
And all you can think of is how to get away

You say you don't wanna tie me down
And you point out all the other fish around
Well, maybe it?s just the opposite and I don't want to go through with it
'Cause I think that you already know

Ain't it funny how the streets seem so gray?
When even the ones you love seem to turn their heads away
And all you can think of is how to get away
