One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn
Mom loves the both of them
You see, it's in the blood
Both kids are good to mama
Blood's thicker than the mud

It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)

Newly-wed a year ago
But you're still checkin' each other out
Hey, nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out
Uh-huh, you can't leave
'Cause your heart is there
But you can't stay
'Cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry
'Cause you look broke-down
But you cryin' anyway
'Cause you're all broke-down

It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
(It's a family affair)
(It's a family affair)
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
(It's a family affair)
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
