I'm just about as solitary
As anyone could be
Of course my life is not so merry
But that's all right with me

No love, no nothin'
Until my baby comes home
No sir, no nothin'
As long as baby must roam
I promised him I'd wait for him
Till even Hades froze
I'm lonesome, Heaven knows
But what I said still goes

No love, no nothin'
And that's a promise I'll keep
No fun with no one
I'm getting plenty of sleep
My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb
No love, no sir, no nothin'
Till my baby comes home

My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb
No love, no sir, no nothin'
Till my baby comes home

No sir, I'm waiting
Till my baby comes home
