Heaven can be cold
Baby, baby, when you lose control
Everybody needs someone to love
Be careful in the night

He can hurt you more
Baby, baby, as he did before
Come on baby, keep your hands of him
In the gypsy night

It will come and go
Everybody knows

You make your own
Heaven and hell
Daytime lovers' love for sale
You make your own
Heaven and hell
Letters full of tears will tell

He takes your heart
I know him well
You've got no time to lose
For heaven and hell

Behind the painted smile
Baby, baby, he is running wild
Everybody needs some love tonight
Be careful in the night

You don't wanna lose
Baby, baby, it's a simply this
Come on, baby, keep your hands of him
In the gypsy night

It will come and go
Everybody knows

You make your own
Heaven and hell
Daytime lovers' love for sale
You make your own
Heaven and hell
Letters full of tears will tell

He takes your heart
I know him well
You've got no time to lose
For heaven and hell

You make your own
Heaven and hell
Daytime lovers' love for sale
You make your own
Heaven and hell
Letters full of tears will tell

He takes your heart
I know him well
You've got no time to lose

For heaven and hell
For heaven and hell
For heaven and hell
For heaven and hell
