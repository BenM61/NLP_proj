I love you, yes I do,
I want you, yes I do,
I know you know it's true
From the way I look at you.

You love me, yes you do,
You need me, I need you;
That's why I'm never blue
Since I first laid eyes on you.

I guess you knew it from the start,
From the day you took my heart,
You're the one boy I'll always admire.
Darling, you're my guiding star,
I must be where you are,
You set my soul on fire!

I miss you, yes I do,
Must hug and kiss you too,
I'm yours my whole life through!
I love you, yes I do.
