I want to be with you
I just want to be with you
Want to be with you
I just want to be with you

I've tried to forget you with all my might
But you really got a hold on me
I've been good I've been good to you
The way that I should be
You got me hangin' around
Waiting for your call
Talking about it doesn't do a thing at all

I want to be with you
I just want to be with you
Want to be with you
I just want to be with you

Don't want to tie you up
It wouldn't mean to much
If you don't feel the same
And I get so excited
At the mention of your name
I'm just a fool for you
And how I should take heed
I can't help myself
Your the only one I need

I want to be with you
I just want to be with you
Want to be with you
I just want to be with you

Together forever
There's just no place I'd rather be

I want to be with you
I just want to be with you
Want to be with you
I just want to be with you
