Uh huh, uh huh, gonna get along without you now
Uh huh my honey, uh huh my honey,
Gonna get along without you now
You told me I was the neatest thing

You even asked me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town
You never cared if it got me down

Uh huh, uh huh, gonna get along without you now.
Uh huh my honey, uh huh my honey,

Gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find somebody who's twice as cute

'Cause I didn't like you anyhow
You told everybody that we were friends
But this is where our friendship ends
'Cause all of a sudden you changed your tune

You haven't been around since way last June.
Uh huh, uh huh, gonna get along without you now.
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now

So long my honey
Goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
