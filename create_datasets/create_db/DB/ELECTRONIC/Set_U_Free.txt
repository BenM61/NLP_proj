Stimulated cause your body's so amazing
I can not believe your acting so abrasive
What you need, you can get from me
Don't you that I can set your body... free
Taking time, tell me why your tryna tease me?
Got your body all over me than you leave me
What you need, you can get from me
Don't you know that I can set your body...

Free-ee-ee-ee
Set your body free-ee
If you want it
Set your body free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Set your body free-ee
If you want it
All you gotta do, is call on me
And I can set you free
If you want it
Set your body free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Set your body free-ee
If you want it

Baby don't you know your body's so persuasive
Threw my fingers, why you acting so invasive
What you need, you can get from me
Don't you know that I can set your body... free
My position is I'm tripping going crazy
Boy your presence making everything go hazy
What you need, you can get from me
Don't you know that I can set your body

Let me take you to a place that you aint never been
Where the night shines with gold and emerald green
Where the music never stops we can rock til light
Turn the bass and be right up and set this floor on fire
Let me take you to a place you that you aint never been

('Cause you got me going)
Ooo - ooo - ooo
(cause you got me saying)
Set your body, set your body
Ooo - ooo - ooo
Set your body, set your body
Ooo - ooo - ooo
Set your body, set your body
Ooo - ooo - ooo
Set your body, set your body
