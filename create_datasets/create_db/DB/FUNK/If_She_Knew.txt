8:45, I knew she'll be coming in real soon
So everyday I come in early just to wait for her
She'll sit at her desk
Pull back her hair then spray perfume
And as it fills the room
I just close my eyes and I'll start to fantasize

'Cause if she knew, would she come to me
If she knew, would she run to me
And then say, "I love you"
Oh, I wonder what she'd do
I wonder what she'd do if she knew, baby

5 after 1 and usually she'd be back from lunch
And I start to think of all these crazy things
Oh where could she be, is there someone else
Someone whose living out my dreams
Why can't it be me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind when she returns

'Cause if she knew that I care for her
If she knew, I'd be there for her and always
I'd be true
Oh, I wonder what she'd do
I wonder what she'd do

'Cause if I could tell her
Say exactly what I'm feeling inside
I would give my all to you
Dedicate my life to you
Hold you tight and never let go

'Cause if she knew, would she come to me
If she knew, would she run to me
And then say, "I love you"
Oh, I wonder what she'd do
I wonder what she'd do

If she knew that I care for her
If she knew baby, I'd be there for her
And always I'd be true, whoa
I wonder what she'd do
I wonder what she'd do
If she knew

Ooh baby
Ooh if she knew
