Ooh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
And ooh, I lost the feeling but I'm tryin'a hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore!

When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been laying on the floor, sweeping on the ground
I would give up everything in life, I'd know how!

'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up to the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!

Ooh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared,
Visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words 'til I can't make a sound

'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!

Can't hold back, reaching out
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it to you, give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
