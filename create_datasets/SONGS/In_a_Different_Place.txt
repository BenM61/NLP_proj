Blowing bubbles, lying down
Waiting for the rain to fall
Laughing at the people
Wonder why they always rush, never slow down

And we're smiling, when we're sleeping
And we're smiling, when we're waking

Even if the rain falls down, and all the sky turns cold
I will feel fine
Thunder roared and lightning flashed
But you and I are in a different time

Floating in and out of time
In and out of space
No-one can touch us
We're in a different space
