Lady Sleep, please kiss me sweetly
Throw me in a wad of cotton wool
And close my eyes, so I can see
Will you breast-feed with bewitching silence

Treat me like I was your only son
And love me like there was no morning?
You unfaithful lover
Careless mother

Cheating angel
'Cause you always leave me after some time
So lustrously and disinfected
I'll be diving into you
When, eventually, will you stay forever?
