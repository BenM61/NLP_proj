I once had a gown it was almost new, oh, the daintiest
Thing, it was sweet Alice blue; with little forgetmenots
Placed here and there, when I had it on, I walked on the air,
And it wore, and it wore, and it wore, till it went and it
Wasn't no more.

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down in to town
I was both proud and shy, as I felt every eye, but in every shop
Window
I'd primp, passing by;

Then in manner of fashion I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
Till it wilted I wore it, I'll always adore it, my sweet little
Alice blue gown
