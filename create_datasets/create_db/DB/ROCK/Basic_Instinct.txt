Tender we fall
Quiet and alone
Tired and gone, just speechless
Speechless
Tired and gone

Coming up for air
Coming up for air air
Coming up for air
Coming up for air air

Coming up for air
Coming up for air

Push me back in
Silent in sin
Fight in water
want it, want it
Basic instinct

I'm tired, I don't want it
I'm tired, I don't want it
I'm tired, I don't want it
I'm tired, I don't want
I'm tired, I don't want it
Tired, I don't want

Coming up for air air
Coming up for air
Coming up for air air

Coming up for air
Coming up for air air
Coming up for
Coming up for air air

Coming up for
Coming up for
Coming up for
Coming up for
