You're just another in a long line of men she screwed
Just another in a long line of men she knew
And yeah she did, yeah she did what she wanted to do
Like all the boys before
Another dream come true

It's a power, it's a power, it's a power move
And while I'm not quite sure what she's trying to prove
They all say she's got low self-esteem
So, why is she looking like the cat who got the cream

But you, you can do better than
You can do better than that

I know you've been feeling sad
I've got no right to be mad, mad
But you can do better than that
And I know that you're not to blame
You just got caught in a game, game
But you can do better than that
Better than that
Better than that, ooh
Better than that
Better than that
Better than that, ooh

She's the apple of everybody's eye
With an angel voice, devil in disguise
Got a sour face like a poisoned fruit
That the boys can taste 'til they're out of use

And she'll network 'til her dreams come true
Even if it means getting into bed with you
Everybody's friend, does it ring a bell
I know a little too much, but I'll never tell

But you, you can do better than
You can do better than that

I know you've been feeling sad
I've got no right to be mad, mad
But you can do better than that
And I know you've been feeling down,
You're always out on the town, town
But you can do better than that
Better than that
Better than that, ooh
Better than that
Better than that
Better than that, ooh

Well, I guess it's just what humans do
Hook up with other people 'til it all falls through
And when it's over, they go out and try to heal their pain
Hook up with another lover, do it all again
I'm not passing judgment on her sexual life
I'm passing judgment on the way she always stuck her knife
In my back ever since we were starting out
Suspicious from the start, I always had my doubts about you

But you, you can do better than
You can do better than that

I know you've been feeling sad
I've got no right to be mad, mad
But you can do better than that
And I know that you're not to blame
You just got caught in a game, game
But you can do better than that
Better than that
Better than that, ooh
Better than that
Better than that
Better than that, ooh
