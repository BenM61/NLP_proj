Stop
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Stop
Slow down, baby

Whoa, yeah (Slow down, baby)
Oh (Slow down, baby)
Hey (Slow down, baby)
Whoa, oh (Stop; slow down, baby)

I can tell that you're into me, uh
Baby, it's so plain to see
I can see it in your eyes
You're paralyzed
Every time I pass you by

You're the kind that gets your way, uh
Every minute, every single day
I can see it all in your face
You're blown away
'Cause I don't want you in my space

You're struttin' 'round here like you think that I can't do without you
You got some nerve to think that I would give up everything

Slow down, baby
And don't act crazy
Don't you know you can look all you want but you just can't touch? (just can't touch, no)
So slow down, baby (hey)
I'm not your lady (lady)
Boy, you're never gonna get it from me 'cause I'm with someone

Slow it down
Slow it down
Oh, oh, whoa
Slow it
Slow it

Stop
Slow down, baby

After all of the games you played
How's it feel to finally get a taste?
You can dish it out, but can you take the bed you've made?
Boy, and it's gonna change
I'm not falling for your stupid lies
I know you've dished them 'bout thousand times
Saying nothing but a nursery rhyme
But I won't buy it
Baby, don't you even try

You comin' 'round here like you think that everything's about you
If you knew anything, you'd realize I'm wearing a ring

Slow down, baby (Slow down)
And don't act crazy (crazy, hey)
Don't you know you can look all you want but you just can't touch? (You just can't touch, no)
So slow down, baby (Slow down)
I'm not your lady (your lady)
Boy, you're never gonna get it from me 'cause I'm with someone (with someone, yeah)

Do you really wanna waste your time?
Don't you have better things to do with life?
Hey, yeah
Whoa
Listen, I don't wanna get you down
But I ain't never gonna mess around
So how many ways do I have to say
Oh, oh, oh

Slow down, baby (Slow it down, yeah, yeah)
And don't act crazy
Don't you know you can look all you want but you just can't touch?
(You know that you can't touch, no, oh, whoa)
So slow down, baby (Slow down, baby)
I'm not your lady (not your lady)
Boy, you're never gonna get it from me 'cause I'm with someone (oh, whoa)
You better stop
Slow down, baby

So slow down, baby (Slow down, baby)
And don't act crazy (And don't act crazy)
Don't you know you can look all you want but you just can't touch? (You just can't touch, no)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa
Hey, hey
Oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

Stop
Slow down, baby
