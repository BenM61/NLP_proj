I met him in a crowded room
Where people go to drink away their gloom
He sat me dawn and so began 
The story of a charmless man

Educated the expensive way
He knows his claret from his beaujolais
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray
But then nature didn't make him that way

He went na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

He thinks he's educated
Airs those family shares
Will protect him 
That we'll respect him

He moves in circles of friends
Who just pretend that they like him
He does the same to them 
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

He knows the swingers and their cavalry
Says he can get in anywhere for free
I began to go a little cross eyed
And from this charmless man I just had to hide

He went na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

He talks at speed 
He gets nosebleeds
He doesn't see 
His days are tumbling down upon him

And yet he tries so hard to please
He's just so keen for you to listen
But no one's listening
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

He thinks he's educated
Airs those family shares
Will protect him 
That you'll respect him

And yet he tries so hard to please
He's just so keen for you to listen
But no one's listening
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na
