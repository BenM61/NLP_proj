Every day since our first kiss
Sit alone and reminisce
What you said last night
Just took me by surprise
How you said you're not gon' cry no more
You're waiting to exhale
Having feelings that you're falling
Woman, I've already fell

(Oh I'm)Falling for you
And I just can't help myself 
Baby, I'm falling (oh I)
Falling for you (oh I'm falling)
And I just can't help myself 
Baby, I'm falling 

Contemplating what to do
Falling faster over you
Both my heart and pride are out there on the line
I dial your number on the phone
It's steady ringing
You're not home
If you're listening to this message
Girl, I'm calling cause I'm falling for you

Falling for you (oh, I)
And I just can't help myself
Baby I'm falling (can't believe I'm falling)
Falling for you (do you feel the same way too)
And I just can't help myself 
Baby, I'm falling...
I'm falling
