I'm full of fire (full of fire, full of fire) 
You're my one desire,
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire, full of fire) 
You can make me cry,
I can dance to the music,
I can sing, all night long
I can play with the band, until you hear my song

Cause I'm full of fire (full of fire, full of fire) 
See the party lights,
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire, full of fire) 
Its the reason why,
I can dance with the fire,
Burnin', burnin' low,
I can stay until the party is all over

Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire, full of fire) 
I'm over a twenty one,
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire full of fire)
Life has just begun,
Oh, oh I can dance to the music,
I, I can under, understand 
That there must be an upper power that is holding my hand
Dance, dance, dance

Oh I understand,
Young lady, young man, I say I understand,

Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire, full of fire) 
I'm over a twenty one,
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire full of fire)
Life has just begun,
Oh, oh I can dance to the music,
I, I can under, understand 
That there must be an upper power that is holding my hand
Dance, dance, dance
 
Oh I understand,
Young lady, young man, I say I understand,

I can dance dance, dance, dance, 
I understand, understand, understand 
There's some things that may not know, 
But I want the horn to blow,
There's some things that I know, 
But I want the horn to blow,
I can dance dance, dance, dance, 
I understand, understand, understand 
There's some things that may not know, 
But I want the horn to blow,
I can dance
Let me say that I can dance
Full of fire, my heart's desire
Full of fire
