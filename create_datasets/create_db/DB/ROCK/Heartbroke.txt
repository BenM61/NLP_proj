Who wouldn't notic the fire in your eyes 
Or the bitter direction of impending goodbyes 
I'm fallen and folded and wilted in place 
At the sight of you standing with streaks down your face 

Heartbroke and runnin' from the reason 
Heartbroke Don't give up on believin' in me 
Heartbroke Who kept me from leavin' with my 
Heartbroke 

Pride is a bitch and a bore when your lonely 
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield 
But all is not lost it is only mistaken 
That's small consolation but I know just how you feel 

Heartbroke and runnin' from the reason 
Heartbroke Don't give up on believin' in me 
Heartbroke Who kept me from leavin' with my 
Heartbroke 

Nobody said it was goin' to be easy 
We all have feelings that need a softer touch 
But nobody said that it would not be worth it 
The human condition continues as such
