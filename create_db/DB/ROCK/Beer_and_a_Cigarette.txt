Well I met her yesterday, 
She just came into my way, 
And I was so surprised
She told me that she loved me, 
Always would be true to me, 
Never tell no lies to me
She said her love was free, 
And I thought that I might,
Just take a chance on her
Try hard to get into her, 
You know what I did

I told her that I love her, 
Told her that I care, 
I said I'd be free to ride
And to do it anywhere, 
Never want no love affair, 
I just like the clothes you wear
There's one thing I gotta do, 
Before I kiss you

(I want to beer and a cigarette), 
I've got to get myself an ice cold beer, 
(I want to beer and a cigarette)
And I need a cigarette, Well I, 
I didn't come here for no fix, I just need a beer
(I want to beer and a cigarette), 
Oh babe, I got to get myself, (I need a beer and a cigarette)
Lord, there's only 2 things on my mind,
(I want to beer and a cigarette), 
Too much ain't enough
(I need a beer and a cigarette), 
Well and a cigarette, and beer
