Down and out when I used to walk the same way home from school 
And I hoped I'd see her and then when I didn't I was crushed 
Like the bully stole my lunch, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah well it 

It seems so hard for me to do, to be myself when I'm with you, with you, I'm with you 

And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more 
And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more than this 

Take me back in time when I, I didn't give a f*ck 
About what I said or did or when I, when I did it, it was done 
And nothing more was less, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah well it 

It seems so hard for me to do, to be myself when I'm with you, I'm with you 

And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more 
And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more than this 

And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more than this 

It seems so hard for me to do, to be myself when I'm with you, with you, I'm with you 

And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more 
And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
It takes away my emptiness 
And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more 
And she gave me a milkshake and a kiss 
I don't need a whole lot more than this
