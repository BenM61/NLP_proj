In the morning, when I see the sun
I think about you
February, cold and cloudy days, here without you
Oh oh oh
I know it wont be long
Till your here with me
Waitin' with anticipation
Lately
Seems I hear your voice in the distance
Comin' closer, dark and rainy skies disappearing

Oh oh oh
Let me hold you close
I know what u need
Give you all my love and affection
Oh
Now I'm layin' next to you
We share our hearts beneath the desert moon
Now my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

Lately
The world is far away, when we're together
In my oasis, kiss my tears away, and we remember (now remember)

Oh oh oh
Let me hold you close (hold you close)
I know what you need (what you need)
Give you all my love and affection
Oh
Now I'm layin' next to you
We share our hearts beneath desert moons
And my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

(Say you'll never leave) say you'll never leave
(Oasis, oasis) oh no
All that I need (is to keep is to keep you here with me)
Is to keep is to keep you here with me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

(When we're together)
World is far away
(No stormy weather)
No more cloudy days, no no
(Found my oasis)
In your lovin' arms
(I'll leave you never)
Never leave you (no)

Let me hold you close (hold you close)
I know what you need (what you need)
Give you all my love and affection
Oh
When I'm layin' next to you
We share out hearts beneath (desert moons)
And my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

Now I'm layin' next to you
We share out hearts beneath desert moons
Now my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

My oasis
(My oasis, my oasis)
My oasis
(My oasis, my oasis)
Ooh ooh la
(My oasis, my oasis)
(My oasis, my oasis)
(My oasis, my oasis)
(My oasis, my oasis)
(My oasis, my oasis)
(My oasis, my oasis)
(My oasis, my oasis)
(My oasis)
Brava
