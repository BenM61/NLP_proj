Sometimes I call it Tuesday
Sometimes I call it the best day of my life
Maybe that was a Friday
Making conversation with box of wine

Oh love
I'll only call you when I'm drunk
On Tuesday
On Tuesday

Sometimes I think I'm mundane
Sometimes I think I'm better off like my dad
Maybe that's progressive
Maybe that's the working class

Oh love
I'll only call you when I'm drunk

On Tuesday
On Tuesday

My friends say we are the lucky ones
In terms of our relationship
Alcoholic tendencies underneath our fingertips
I think I love you
I think I know you
Or is it only liquor speak?
I want to love you
I wanna know you

Sometimes I call it a Tuesday
Sometimes I think I am doing fine
Sometimes I call it a Tuesday
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life

Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
