You came to me from out of nowhere
You took my heart and found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower to me
And if you should go back to your nowhere
Leaving me with the memory
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you'll bring your love to me.

When I least expected, kindly fate directed
You to make each dream of mine come true
And if it's clear or raining there is no explaining
Things just happened and so did you.

You came to me from out of nowhere
You took my heart and you found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower to me
And if you should go back to your nowhere
Leaving me with, with the memory
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you'll bring your love to me.
