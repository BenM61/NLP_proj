A new Royal Family, a wild nobility, we are the family
A new Royal Family, a wild nobility, we are the family 
A new Royal Family, a wild nobility, we are the family 

I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming

No method in our madness
Just pride about our manner
Antpeople are the warriors
Antmusic is the banner!

A new Royal Family, a wild nobility, we are the family
A new Royal Family, a wild nobility, we are the family

And even when you're healthy
And your colour schemes delight
Down below those dandy clothes
You're just a shade too white
Shade too white!
Shade too white!

I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming...

I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming...
