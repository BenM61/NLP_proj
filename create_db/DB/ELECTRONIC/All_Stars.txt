(Turn on)
We all stars, we are one
We light up the night like a black sun
We all shine, we are chrome
And we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on (turn on)

Play it loud, we don't care
And dance like there's nobody there
Light up the night, yeah
Light it up every night
'Cause we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on (turn on)

We all stars, we are one
We light up the night like a black sun
We all shine, we are chrome
And we are shimmering
Come on, come on y'all

Hey!

We all stars, we are one
We light up the night like a black sun
We all shine, we are chrome
And we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on (turn on)

We got something to tell
Spin like a carousel
Don't like it, go to hell
This is our favorite song
Lights on everybody
We party legendary
High on sour and fury (hey)

Turn on now
Calling all stars, come on
Calling all stars, come on
Calling all stars, come on

Calling all stars, come on

Hey!

We all stars, we are one
Calling all stars (stars)
Calling all stars, come on
We all shine, we are chrome
And we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on

Calling all stars, come on
