Ugh
Wah
Ugh
Um
Yo
SHAGGY
Ugh
Yo
This one goes out to all my women yeah know
My strong women, ugh

So amazing how this world was made 
I wonder if GOD is a woman
The gift of life astounds me to this day
I give it up for the woman
She's the constant wind that fills my sail
Oh that woman
With her smile and her style,my
She'll protect like a child
That's a woman

She'll put a smile upon yah face
And take you to that (ah) higher place
So don't you under estimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman

Woke up this morning 
I got up with the scent of a woman
Jus picture if you would what life would be
Ain't much good without a woman
She can nag and be a constant pain
Oh that woman
But those hips she's got me whipped
And it's just to hard to resist 
What a woman
Ugh, hey

She'll put a smile upon yah face
And take you to that (ah) higher place
So don't you under estimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman

Tosses in

Ugh, ugh, ugh

Tender lips that's so so sweet
Gentle words she softly speaks
Such an angel when we need
GOD bless the ground beneath her feet
She can take you on a high
Be your comfort when you cry
But if you look into her eyes
You'll see the strength of a woman
Strength of a woman
Ugh, ugh, ugh

She'll put a smile upon yah face
And take you to that (ah) higher place
So don't you under estimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman
