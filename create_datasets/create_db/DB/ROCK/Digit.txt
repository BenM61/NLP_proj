Spread the seed and multiply
There's no disease, the human race is digital
Pacified by fluoride, genetically modified
Is it genocide?
Burger bar where slaughter chars
They pay the rent, they pay the rent
So it's alright?

Do you know why?
Do you know why?
They claim it all
They claim it all
They claim it all
And they claim you

Now we're coming round to the sucker
Picking pockets in the rat race
Spitting at the wrong face
Any dream they can buy again,
Make them come again
So they can turn it all into a sale again

And here am I
Snorting incense in a backroom
Sitting in a vacuum
Falling apart at the seam again
Till I'm numb again
Close the door onto a silent end

There must be something more than this
There must be something more than this

Are we coming down to the sound
Of 8 billion on a bad day?
Maybe later on we're
Gonna find out the hard way
Someday
Is it too late? Too late?

There must be something more than this
There must be something more than this
