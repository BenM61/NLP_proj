One wish whispered to the ear
I want the most
Keep it safe from the world
Know it will bring me all

And this wish will keep me sailing
Safe into the storms
No matter when I go
I will reach the shore

When we go
Feel it in the air
Where we ship
I'm coming home
With one wish
One wish

And the void, running through
The darkness and the cold
Season comes and they go
I'm away in the storm

And my heart singing from 
The bottom of it's core
No matter when I go
I will reach the shore

When we go
Feel it in the air
Where we ship
I'm coming home
With one wish
One wish

Be, be the heart, be, be be the dark
I fell with you aside so many times
But the wish keeps me sailing, the seas are the radio

When we go
Feel it in the air
Where we ship
I'm coming home
With one wish
One wish
