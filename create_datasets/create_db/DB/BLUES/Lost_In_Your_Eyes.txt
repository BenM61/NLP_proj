Light from a window, golden and bright
Sound from a dream
I was hypnotized, I was paralyzed
I could hardly speak

And baby, baby, you never realized
That I could have stood there lost in your eyes
Stood there waiting and not realized
Love isn't easy, it isn't always kind
But I could have stood there lost in your eyes

Guess I understand it, guess I sort of have to
Guess I kinda see
Just because it could have been
Doesn't mean it had to ever mean a thing

And baby, baby, I could say it all the time
That I could have stood there lost in your eyes
Stood there waiting and not realized
Love isn't easy, it isn't always kind
But I could have stood there lost in your eyes

And you know sometimes I wonder
Yes, I wonder, I really, really do
Ya, yes, I do, just because it helps me
And though sometimes it scares me
Guess you wouldn't know, no you wouldn't know

Guess I understand it, guess I sort of have to
Guess I kinda see
Just because it could have been
Doesn't mean it had to ever mean a thing

And baby, oh, baby, you never realized
That I could have stood there lost in your eyes
Stood there waiting and never realized
Love isn't easy, it isn't always kind
But I could have stood there lost in your eyes

You know, I could have stood there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost in your eyes, lost in your eyes

Lost in your eyes, lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes, lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes, lost in your eyes
