Don't get too close
This shore is cavernous and cold

Too close is cavernous cold
Cavernous cold
You're collecting empty shells

Too late to scribe
Alive on my soul
I'd rather hide
Than fight 
You stealing my soul

A haunted ocean of steaming ghosts
They bore what's tavernous and told
A haunted ocean is tavernous and told
I am where the feeling dwells

Too late to scribe
Alive on my soul
I'd rather hide
Than fight 
You stealing my soul

Cavernous
Cold
