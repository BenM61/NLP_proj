Come get my love [Repeat: x 3]
Come get my love, please don't hesitate 
Come get my love, tomorrow is too late 
One more chance to give you girl all my love tonight 
Come get my love before I walk outside 
And if I leave you now, I won't be back around 
And if by chance you stay, love will save the day 

[Chorus]
Come get my love my baby, come get my love [Repeat: x 2] 
Come get my love 

I know you've been checking me out for a long, long time 
Open up your heart girl and be mine tonight 
Open up, open up your heart, 
Open up, and come get my love 
Open up, open up your heart 
And come get my love 

Come get my love now, please don't make me wait 
Come get my love, tomorrow is too late 
Come get my love girl 
Come get my love 

[Chorus]
One more chance to give you girl all my love tonight 
Come get my love before I walk outside 
And if I leave you now, I won't be back around 
And if by chance you stay, love will save the day 

Love will save the day if you come get my love 
Love will save the day, tomorrow is too late 
[Repeat: x 2]

Come get my love [Repeat: x 3]
