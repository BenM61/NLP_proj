Love is hiding in the city
Here in all of you
Put the place in cages
But don't label it a zoo

Get a girl inside your head
Get out of the way
Write yourself a postcard
When there's nothing left to say

There's danger, I believe it
Wake up, it's a fight
Love me now forever
War's on it's now or never

Mr. Clean Air just went past
Eating chewing gum
He doesn't want to see you
He gets sick when you come

Make yourself up once again
Kick out in a style
Ann don't let her sadness show
She paints on a smile

Danger, I believe it
Wake up, it's a fight
Love me now forever
The war's on, it's now or never

Always it is now
Love me, in the jail house
Pictures of the losers
Crying that's enough

Get a girl inside your head
Get out of the way
Write yourself a postcard
When there's nothing left to say

Love is hiding in the city
Hearing all of you
Put the plays in cages
But don't labor in a zoo

There's danger, I believe it
Wake up, it's a fight
Love me now forever
War's on, it's now or never
Now or never
