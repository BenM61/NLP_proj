Soft lights
Moving in darkness
Moving in patterns
Outlining life
Distant
Image of crystal
Like finger extending
Into the sea

East of the sun
The blue Webb of tangled ribbons grow
Out of the ancient river they flow
Into the red light dangers that rise
Higher as the time goes by

Blue planet
Save yourself

Changes
Unwelcome changes
From oceans to badlands
To forest of stone

Short lived
Profusion of flowers
Dry in the warm winds
Of this vanished life

Out on the edge, the edge of the southern plain
Up high, a mosaic of rainbow colors glow
Where the remains of lost
Worlds lay untouched by the forces of time

Blue planet
Save yourself
