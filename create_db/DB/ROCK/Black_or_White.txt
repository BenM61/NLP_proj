Behind the wall the ears of love are listening
Behind the door they kneel
Behind the boy from whom we steal
Behind the dark, deserted halls of memory
Inside the sound: "ahoy !
"We have just landed for employ
"We need your hands to carru us to our joy"
To black or white
And step on it
Black or white

Between the shadow and uncertain color
Between the word and sign
Between the man and all his time
Between the sidewalk and the moving stairway
Between the yay and nay !
There falls the truth we aim to slay
There falls the truth we do so righteous flay
Come black or white
And step on it
Black or white

Until we gather life and all our dreams
Until we cool the heat
Until we share our cup of meat
Until the trail of waste is put to stud
Until we drift away
Towards the picture in the frame
Our celebration comes a game to play
Just black or white
And step on it
Black or white
