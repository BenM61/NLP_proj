You can't stop me 
I was born to be with you 
Your love's my center point of view, every day 
You can't stop me 
Gonna stand right next to you 
Until I know that I was made for you 

Let me bet you, I'll never come in second place 
I know I got what it takes for you 
Hey love -- moving at the speed of love 
Love -- livin' with the need of love 
Hey love -- burnin' in the heat of love 
I need your power in the midnight hour 

The best is yet to come 
Once you're in my arms 
Let ma take control at the speed of love 

If you let it 
Love will be your stepping stone 
One that I'm depending on, to shine 
And that's the bottom line 
Love is magic 

Created in a special place 
Moving in and out of space for you 
Let love take us 
To a land of pearly skies 
A wonderland that never dies 

Hey love -- moving at the speed of love 
Love -- livin' with the need of love 
Hey love -- burnin' in the heat of love 
I need your power in the midnight hour 

Let's take circumstance 
By design or chance 
Makes no difference at the speed of love 

Emotions won't slow down 
Hearts are upward bound 
Passing lights and sound at the speed of love
