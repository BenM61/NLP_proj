Found a message in the sand
It read 'just do the best you can'
This world's not how I planned
You're on your own

No one can hear you
They're just talking all the time
There's the world, and you're outside
Your home's hard to find
Your home's hard to find

Worn down by strangers
All you need's a friend
You've been worn down by strangers
This is not the end

Guess it's hard to settle down
When love's been spread all around the town
I'm no stranger to this room
My highs just serve to bring me down
I hope to change now
From a sorry state of mind
I had hoped for heart to heart
My heart's hard to find
My heart's hard to find

Worn down by strangers
All you need's a friend
You've been worn down by strangers
This is not the end
(This is not the end)

Worn down by strangers
All you need's a friend
You've been worn down by strangers
All you need's a friend
By strangers
By strangers
By strangers

(This is not the end)
(This is not the end)
This is the end
