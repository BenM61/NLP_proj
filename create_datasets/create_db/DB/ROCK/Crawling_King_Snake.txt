Well, I'm the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
I'm the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
Yeah, don't mess 'round with my mate
Gonna use her for myself

Caught me crawlin', baby, window
Grass is very high
Keep on crawlin' till the day I die
Crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
You better give me what I want
Gonna crawl no more

Caught me crawlin', baby
Crawlin' 'round your door
Seein' everything I want
I'm gonna crawl on your floor
Let's crawl
And I rule my den
C'mon, give me what I want
Ain't gonna crawl no more

I have crawed a while

C'mon crawl
C'mon crawl
Get on out there on your hands and knees, baby
Crawl all over me
Just like the spider on the wall
Ooo, we gonn' crawl, one more

Well, I'm the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
Call me the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
Yeah, don't mess 'round with my mate
Gonna use her for myself
