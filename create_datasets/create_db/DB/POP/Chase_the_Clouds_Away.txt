You never know what the day will bring
Another song for you to sing
You never know what the day will bring
You never know when the sky will fall
What do we really know at all?
You never know when the sky will fall

[Chorus:]
Baby, I was frightened by the storm, but not today
Now if the rain should fall, it won't worry me at all
Cause our love will chase the clouds away

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Takin' time to work it out
To see what's goin' on about
Takin' time to work it out
Cause I can't move the other way
There's too much gettin' in my way
No I can't move the other way

[Chorus]

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

[Chorus x2]
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Oh yeh...know I'll be there for you
Oh yeh...ya know I'll be there for you
To chase the clouds away
