There she was just walkin' down the street
Singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy, dumb diddy do"
Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do"

She looked good, she looked fine
(Looked good, looked fine)
She looked good, she looked fine
And I nearly lost my mind

Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do"
Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do"

We walked on to my door
(Walked on, my door)
We walked on to my door
Then we kissed a little more

Whoa, oh
I knew we was falling in love
Yes, I did and so I told her
All the things, I'd been dreamin' of

Now we're together nearly every single day
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do"
We're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do"

Well, I'm hers, she's mine
(I'm hers, she's mine)
I'm hers, she's mine
Wedding bells are gonna chime

Whoa, oh
I knew we was falling in love
Yes, I did and so I told her
All the things, I'd been dreamin' of

Now we're together nearly every single day
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do"
We're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay,
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do"

Well, I'm hers, she's mine
(I'm hers, she's mine)
I'm hers, she's mine
Wedding bells are gonna chime

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do, we'll sing it
Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do
Do wah diddy diddy, dumb diddy do
