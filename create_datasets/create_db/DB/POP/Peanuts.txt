It's all a game
You're not the same
Your famous name
The price of fame

Oh no, try to liberate me
I said oh no, stay and irritate me
I said oh no, try to elevate me
I said oh no, just a fallen hero

Don't want to hear about the drugs you're taking
Don't want to read about the love you're making
Don't want to hear about the lives you're faking
Don't want to read about the muck they're raking

You sang your song
For much too long
There's something wrong
Your brain is gone

Oh no, try to liberate me
I said oh no, stay and irritate me
I said oh no, try to elevate me
I said oh no, just a fallen hero

Don't want to hear about the drugs you're taking
Don't want to read about the love you're making
Don't want to hear about the lives you're faking
Don't want to read about the muck they're raking

It's all a game
You're not the same
Your famous name
The price of fame

Oh no, try to liberate me
I said oh no, stay and irritate me
I said oh no, try to elevate me
I said oh no, just a fallen hero
Oh you're just a fallen hero

Don't want to hear about the drugs you're taking yeah
Don't want to read about the love you're making
Don't want to hear about the lives you're faking
Don't want to read about the muck they're raking

Don't want to find about the drugs you're taking
Don't want to read about the love you're making
Don't want to hear about the lives you're faking
Don't want to read about the muck they're raking

Don't want to find out what you've been taking
Don't want to read about the love you're making
Don't want to hear about the lives you're faking
Don't want to read about the muck they're raking

Don't want to find out what you've been taking
Don't want to read about the love you're making
Don't want to hear about the lives you're faking
Don't want to read about the muck

Peanuts, peanuts
Peanuts

Oh no no
Oh no no
Oh no no
Oh no no
Oh no no oh
