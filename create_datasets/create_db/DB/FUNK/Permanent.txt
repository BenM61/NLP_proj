Memories serve, only to show
What came before, wouldn't have grown
Maybe the past, has brought me to this
Maybe this time, love will be missed
I hear my heart calling for you
And I believe you feel it too

I want something permanent, like the stars in the sky
Permanent, like the mountain high
Permanent, as time goes by, I want something I can count on
Permanent, like the sun and the rain
Permanent, like a burning flame
Permanent, I'll say it again
I want something that won't change

Respecting yourself, reaching down deep
That's how I'll find, a love so complete
It became clear, the very, very first time
It's more than a dream, that you could be mine
I hear my heart calling for you and I believe you feel it, too

I want something permanent, like the stars in the sky
Permanent, like the mountain high
Permanent, as time goes by, I want something I can count on
Permanent, like the sun and the rain
Permanent, like a burning flame
Permanent, I'll say it again, say it again, say it again
I want something that will never change

What's my only way, I could never say that I don't feel the same
You've brought me somewhere I can feel safe
Don't you feel it, don't you feel it

I want something, say it again, say it again
Like the stars in the sky
Like the mountain high, as time goes by
I want something that will never change
I can count on, like the stars in the sky
Permanent

I'll say it again, I want something that will never change
I want something permanent, yes I do
Permanent, yes I do, gonna say it again, say it again

Permanent, like a burning flame, like the sun and rain
I want something that won't change
