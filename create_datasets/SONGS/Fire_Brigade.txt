Cast your mind back ten years
To the girl who's next to me in school
If I put me hand upon her leg
She hit me with a rule

Though tomorrow won't be long
You're gonna have to play it cool
You get fascinated by her
She could set the place on fire

Run and get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
See the buildings start to really burn
Get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
If you jump you've got to wait your turn

Friends all seem to laugh
I fear I'm apt to make a compromise
Try to reassure myself
My head must need some exercise
Half past ten in the morning
She just took me by surprise
True she set the place on fire
You get fascinated by her

Run and get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
See the buildings start to really burn
Get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
If you jump you've got to wait your turn

The lights across the street throw a rainbow
I'd love you all to meet her
I'll be there, I'll be there

Notice that my eyes have been
A misty place since Saturday
Brings a feeling we might lead
The fire engines anyway

Though tomorrow won't be long
You're gonna have to play it cool
You get fascinated by her
She could set the place on fire

Run and get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
See the buildings start to really burn
Get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
If you jump you've got to wait your turn

Run and get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
See the buildings start to really burn
Get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
If you jump you've got to wait your turn
