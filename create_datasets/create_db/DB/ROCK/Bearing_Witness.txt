And so it comes to an end
And everything that you thought turns out to be
Feathers borne on the wind
Bearing witness that gravity will win
And take you for a spin

They're bearing witness to
The water bleaches it out of you
The cleansing showers fall
They're falling, falling

Lay me down in the bulrushes
Send me down, down to the sea
Float me on this raging river
Leave me just my memory

Now I start to see
Just as it's ending
The river is bending
And drowning me

The snow that falls in December
Could be the rain in the Gulf of Mexico
And though I know I'm a sinner
I'm still an angel when I get back to home
Where I can do no wrong

They're bearing witness to
The water bleaches it out of you
The cleansing showers fall
They're falling, falling

Lay me down in the bulrushes
Send me down, down to the sea
Float me on this raging river
Leave me just my memory

Now I start to see
Just as it's ending
The river is bending
And drowning me
Drowning me

Lay me down in the bulrushes
Send me down, down to the sea
Float me on this raging river
Leave me just my memory

[Repeat: x10]
Lay me down
