Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you

How I wish I could forget those
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories of you

And your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories, just memories of you
