Elvis he's a hero he's a superstar
And I hear that Paul McCartney drives a Rolls Royce car
And Dylan sings for millions
And I just sing for free
Oh everybody's makin' it big but me
Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me
Everybody's makin' it big but me
Neil Diamond sings for diamonds
And here's ole rhinestone me
Oh everybody's makin' it big but me
Well I hear that Alice Cooper's got a foxy chick
To wipe off his snake, and keep him rich
And Elton John's got two fine ladies
And Doctor John's got three
And I'm still seein' them same old sleezoes, that I used to see
Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me
Yeah everybody's makin' it big but me
I've got charisma

And personality
Oh how come everybody's makin' it big but me?
(What's wrong with that?)
(I don't see nothing wrong with it Ray)
Well I paint my face with glitter
Just like Bowie does
And I wear the same mascara
That Mick Jagger does
And I even put some lipstick on
But that just hurt my dad and mom
And everybody's makin' it big but me
Oh, everybody's makin' it big but me
Yeah everybody's makin' it big but me
They got groupies for their bands
And all I got is my right hand
And everybody's makin' it big but me
Everybody's makin' it, makin' it, makin' it
Everybody's makin' it big
