Red skies, there's a moon on the new horizon
We're dreaming of no world of broken dreams
Escaping from the eerie inquisition
But the howling in the night goes on and on

We're searching for a shelter, a cocoon from the rain
We break the chains of tragedy, fear and pain

Unbroken glory
Telling tales of the crown
Infinite story
Leaving tears on the ground

Keep moving on to the edge of our time
Protect us from the realm of the other side

We're searching for a shelter, a cocoon from the rain
We break the chains of tragedy, fear and pain

Unbroken glory
Telling tales of the crown
Infinite story
Leaving tears on the ground

In a world of dreams, sins and fear
The fools held up the crown to disappear
They're trying to get hold of your soul
Like a game of the other world beyond control
Torches are shining in the dark
(the) shadows of the sword don't need a spark

Captive breeding
Our souls kept on bleeding

Captive breeding
Our souls kept on bleeding

Unbroken glory
Telling tales of the crown
Infinite story
Leaving tears on the ground
