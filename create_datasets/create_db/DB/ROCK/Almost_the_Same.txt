Fine, I'll admit
I may have been wrong
But I never knew
That we'd get along

it's hard to believe 
Even now I can see
That you're almost the same
As me

well I never, though you and I
Would be friends
It only goes to show you can't tell
How it ends

it's hard to define
Even now when I find
That you're almost the same
As me
You're almost the same as me
