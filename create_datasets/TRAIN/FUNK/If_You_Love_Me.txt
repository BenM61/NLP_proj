If you love me
Like you say you do
Why don't you show me
Just how much you do
If you love me
Unconditionally
Say that you'll always, always be with me

In my heart
There is a love
That's yearning for you
Let me know
If you feel the same
The yearning that I do

All I know
Is that I need a love
To give me what I need
Don't be afraid
Or hesitate
I'm tryin' to make you see
How it's gotta be

If you love me
Like you say you do
Why don't you show me
Just how much you do
If you love me
Unconditionally
Say that you'll always, always be with me

All the words
That you didn't say
Pushed me away from you
Word of love
That I need to hear
To let me know you do

Through the night
I dry my eyes
For now I have learned
Lonely tears
They fall the same
When love is not returned

If you love me
Like you say you do
Why don't you show me
Just how much you do
If you love me
Unconditionally
Say that you'll always, always be with me
