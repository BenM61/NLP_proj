Ghostyhead, ghostyhead, standing in the door
You think if you don't answer
I can't hear you anymore
Chains you hung from ear to ear

Finally drug your head
But I can see through anything
I know what you bled
Ghostyhead, ghostyhead, you think that I can't see

The shadow of another girl
Each time you look at me
People came from far away to watch us drop you in
But ghostyhead the crowd is gone

Come back up again
Ghostyhead, ghostyhead
Come out on the porch
There's a serpent caught in a fisher's net

Virgins light the torch
'Cause who this night would not stay warm
By any light they could?
You just eat your bread and cake

And tell them it was good
