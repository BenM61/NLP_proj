The beat of bondage stalks on

Hey little girl you move so fine
All I want to do is melt your mind**

Under the crimson moon
Under the crimson moon
I wanna feel your heat under the crimson moon
I wanna feel your heat under the crimson moon

You can shake your torpedoes
You can shoot your gun
You can mix your martinis
From the blood of the sun

* Repeat

I'm a chartreuse lover
I am an indigo man
In the black of the night
I'll hold your lily white hand

* Repeat
** Repeat
* Repeat twice
