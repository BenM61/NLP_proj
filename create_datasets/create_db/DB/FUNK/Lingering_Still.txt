I like to learn things slow 
I like learning a lot 
I like to get it all again and in the end 
You know you get what you got 
I like to mean what I say 
But it don't always come through 
'Cause if I say it all again, again, again 
It doesn't make it all true 

And the world's like a science 
And I'm like a secret 
And I saw you lingering still, still 
I saw you lingering still 

It's all just news to me 
Don't really care if it hurts 
'Cause if I knock it I won't know it 
Then I know that it will only get worse 
He was different at first 
But then he won't understand 
Because he's never gonna know me 
If he doesn't want to just shake my hand 

And the world's like a science 
And I'm like a secret 
And I saw you lingering still, still 
I saw you lingering still 

And the world's like a science 
And I'm like a secret 
And I saw you lingering still, still 
I saw you lingering still 

And the world's like a science 
And I'm like a secret 
And I saw you lingering still 
I saw you lingering still
