Sorrow - for letting someone else
Define you know who you are at every age
What impression am I making?
I see me as other people see me

There is no going back
I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again (x2)
There's no going back, I can't stop feeling now

I had to fantasize
I was a princess, mum and dad were queen and king
I ought to have what feeling?
I see me as other people see me

There is no going back, I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again (x2)
There's no going back, I can't stop feeling now
Feeling now

There is no going back, I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again (x2)
There's no going back, I can't stop feeling now
I had to fantasize

Just to survive
I was a famous artist everybody took me seriously
Even those who did
Never understood me
I had to fantasize just to survive
