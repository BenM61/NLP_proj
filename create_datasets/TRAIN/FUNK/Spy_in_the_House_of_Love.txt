The air was filled with suspicion
She poured us two martinis
And tried to guess my mission
I pretended to know nothing

It's best to use discretion
But she turned her floodlight eyes on me
And demanded a confession
I told her I am a spy in the house of love

Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused I'm waiting for your heart's defection
I saw, yes I did, everything that pleased her

I recorded every movement
And plotted how to seize her
I used a tiny camera
I thought I'd Japanese her

I made a voodoo doll of her
And sat around and squeezed her
I told her I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections

I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused I'm waiting for your heart's defection
I'll read your mail
I'll tap your phone

I'm on your trail
You're never alone
One day you'll slip up
And leave a lip print on a coffee cup

I'm a spy and I just can't help myself
