She so good for me
Mr. good stuff, Mrs. good stuffin', good lovin'
Watch me pull up till I pour somethin' on a full stomach
Take her out to eat like I'm hungry if you're hungry
Hopin' it off, then droppin' her off
Then toppin' it off with a muah on her jaw
And a smack on the ass, and a call me tomorrow
And a walk to the door and a honk on the horn
Got Monica on my playlist and she on my bae list
But since I got a situation I use imagination, all right

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Tunechi)
Ain't no one can take me from my baby
Like I can get my heart and all my time
Gotta keep my lovin' on your mind
Oh you got me goin' so find me
I can't control it

Meant to be together through the times
'Cause you're just right for me
Boy you know your love's the best
And it's just right for me
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me
Just right for me
And I don't care about your past

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
It's like you're always tryna keep me happy
So you know what a wife like me gone do
Got me thinkin' on the (?) that made you
Oh you got me goin', so find me
I can't control it

When you're meant to be together through the times
'Cause you're just right for me
Boy you know your love's the best
And it's just right for me
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me

You know it
Oh you got my attention
Boy you never lose
Cause you know I miss it
The things we do
My King, you're my best friend

And it's just right for me
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me
Just right for me
The only one in my

Ooh you're just right for me
Just right for me
