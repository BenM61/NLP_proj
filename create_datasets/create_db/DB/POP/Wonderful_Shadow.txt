You've a beautiful body and a wonderful mind
These are things I've been stumbling towards
And I think you've been kind towards me

There are wonderful moments
The gifts I've received
And the knowledge is hurting
But I guess it comes back to the things that you no longer need

I'm an evil young hustler
To be so curious
These are evil young thoughts here
To be so jealous, so jealous
When a beautiful thought can
Can be just thrown away
''cause i tell you - I'm used to looking and turning my back on them

Some things you say
Just to be sociable
And somethings you feel
''cause you're young and you're gullible
And sometimes I'm watching
Sometimes I'm too scared
And sometimes I'm able, I'm useful
I'm holding you
Holding you

You've a beautiful body
And a wonderful mind
These are things I've been stumbling towards
And I think you've been kind towards me

I'm a wonderful shadow
Whose sweetness is brief
For there's nothing like lovers
Who cry in the night
Wanting to need you
and wanting to need you
And hoping that you'll feel it too
Yes, you
