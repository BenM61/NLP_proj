You said, "I got something to say"
And then you got that look in your eye
"There is something you've got to know"
And you said it as you started to cry

I've been down the wrong road at night
And I swear Ill never go there again
I've seen this face once before
And I don't think I can do this again

There's something I can see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say 
'Cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

As you turn to walk away
I saw another look in your eye
Even though it hurt like it did
I couldn't let this be our goodbye

You say that you're sorry
And you say now that it hurts you the same
Is there something here to believe
Or is just another part of the game?

There's something I can see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say
'Cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

Behind those eyes you lie
Behind those eyes you hide

And there's something I can see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say
'Cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide

There's nothing I can say
Except we're gonna make you change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide
Behind those eyes you hide
