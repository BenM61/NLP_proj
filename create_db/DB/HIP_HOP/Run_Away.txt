Run Away Run Away Run Away 
(Where you going girl) 
Run Away  Run Away Run Away 
(You can't run away from my love) 
Run Away  Run Away Run Away 
(Where you going girl) 
Run Away  Run Away Run Away 
(You can't run away from a thug) 
Run Away Run Away Run Away

I was gonna take my life where, I wanted to go which was with  
your life more then you'll ever know
Now I can't do that no with the heaven found 
Cause when I was ready your no where around

[Chorus:]

Said I want to be with you Why you have to go and run away
Is it cause you were not true and you never had plans to stay
Or is it you had a girl on the other side of town, 
Made plans to be with you why the hell are you not around?
Said I was special, special to the world and made you special, 
Cause I was your girl now I can't do that with the heaven found,
I thought I was special where are you now?

Said I want to be with you Why you have to go and run away
Is it cause you were not true and you never had plans to stay or is it you had a girl (maybe) on the other side of town, (I ain't the one to play)
Made plans to be with you  ( they call me Pusha ) why the hell are you not around?

Look I never asked for the game to start (nah) .You pursued and just gave your heart Pusha played his part, yes .You know I showed you things from rodeo strolls to Louie gummy soles. Said I got an angel flow So I gave your Neck angel blow match me .Now we both heavenly, OH Pink's your color but it make it Show part ring say love but we only lovers .Our commitment empty to put it simply. Just need you shotgun to sit on findi Rims match yo eighties the early twenties .Everything shiny still grimey and a thug I know it make you like to stand by me in the club. Hugs and kisses every young girls wishes Kiss and enjoy the frame and your title as my mistress, misses.

And when my dad called, you said I was yours and then I was ready your heart an open door so I gave up the biggest smile for your voices sound But I can't smile now cause your not around!

Chorus x2
Said want to be with you Why you have to go and run away
Is it cause you were not true and you never had plans to stay or is it you had a girl on the other side of town, Made plans to be with you why the hell are you not around?
