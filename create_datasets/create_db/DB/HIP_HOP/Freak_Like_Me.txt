Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that a man has gotta feel with it (with it, with it)
I don't care what they say
I'm not gonna pay nobody's way
'Cause it's all about the doll in me (mmm)

I want to freak in the morning
Freak in the evening
Just like me
I need a rough neck brother that can satisfy me
Just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I've gotta freaky secret everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

'Cause I will be a freak until the day
Until the dawn
And we can all through the night
To the early morn
Come on and we'll take you around the hood
On a gangster lift
'Cause we can any time of day
It's all good for me

Boy you're moving kinda slow
You gotta keep up now
There you go
That's just something that a man must do (mmm mmm)
I'm packing all the things that you need
I got you shock up on your knees
'Cause it's all about the dark in me, yeah

I want to freak in the morning
Freak in the evening
Just like me

Come on and we'll take you around the hood
On a gangster lift (Take you round the)
'Cause we can any time of day
It's all good for me

Good for me...
Good for me...
Good for me...
