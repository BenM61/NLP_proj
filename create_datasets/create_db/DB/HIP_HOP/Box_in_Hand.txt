Wu Tang will survive no no no no no no 
Wu Tang will survive 
Cause every time they flip a party 
You know the party screams and shouts 
Cause you, damn! Aw T-C that was the bomb

Get all my peoples get all my peoples headphones 
All of em 
Lay em a death warrant 
Ah yo show it off kid show em what what 
Let em have it bust it hey yo, hey yo 

Blend wine, who want to win mine 
Shorty get a ten-round for floatin'
With the richest, huh 
Flexed out, Flinstone style 
Your crimi-nal pen pal kidnapped Loud, jetted the 
Mosyin, posin' for them niggas up in Poland 
Rollin wax style museum, G 'em 
Them richest niggas bless this 
Like Russian cut V-V-S's 
Slide the hatchback, black were finessing this 
Them niggas over there know, Gaselle goggles 
And them Lottos, 88 style, throwin' bottles (bottles) 
Scenario rap, rap imperial, material (uh, yo yo, yo, yo) 
Murderin' cats is like that real 

Yo come do me somethin word to Michelob peep the Land Rov' 
Sleeper hold club faggots lay your dome on a stove 
It's like space kid, the whole world is pitch black, granola rap 
Dough got smaller famous team, walked up in Photomat 
Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown 
Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town 
We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases 
Porno stations, drinkin' violations, God relations 
90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks 
Bangin' earaches, lay my verse down in two takes 
The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen 
Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin', woofer hissin'

Yo, he's strong armin', manipulatin' niggas, scrapin' niggas 
Takin' play from niggas, hate fakin' niggas, yo you hear me? 
The whole shit's like wrestling 
What you dare me? Back the f*ck up kid, we flexin 

This rap shit bust yo' gums, and leave you stunned 
Pull your plug, now you can't function 
There's no to-tal or sum to this equa-tion, you fro-sen 
Many may come but few are cho-sen 
Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin 
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen 
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man 
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan 
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin'
It's getting deep in this mud 
Cats heat seekin', for one blood 
Nameless thugs with aimless slugs, shootin' at these stank bitches 
Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches 
From the lamp I grant three wishes 
Johnny be parlayin', I Blase britches, then I roll 
One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body 
One hundred percent soul, individual 
Assholes tend to run 
From this PLO extortion to the one 
The next chamber, you fuckin' with the star spangler 
To the dawn's early light with this head-banger 
Boogie, represent this shit fully 
Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully 
Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly 
Like a fat bitch in Spandex, free Willy! 
We on some milli, check the joint, engine number nine 
Niggas wastin' time worryin' about me and mine 
Get your own shit
