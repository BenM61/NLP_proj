Every night I go to sleep, the blues fall down like rain
Every night I go to sleep, the blues fall down like rain
Takin' pills and cheap whiskey, just to try to ease the pain

It's hard to gamble when you lose every bet
Hard to save money when you're twenty years in debt
The blues is fallin', fallin' down on me like rain
I'm gonna take a shotgun now, people, and disconnect my brain

I made some mistakes, had some bad breaks
Now my mind don't work and my whole body aches
Blues is fallin', fallin' down on me like rain
My life is like water, just swirlin' down the drain

Tried standin' up, keep on fallin' down
Tried standin' up, keep on fallin' down
Everywhere I go the blues is all around
