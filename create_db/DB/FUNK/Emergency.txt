I never thought there'd come a time
When someone else would tap my line
On hold my woman's love I have
Expecting to still be mine, yeah

Time comes around

Cause when I call her
A line that's always been clear
Is busy at the strangest hours
Operator got to have your help

This is an emergency
Please interrupt the line
He's trying to beat my time
Emergency
That's what I'm making, ooh

Tell her love is on the phone
I know I left her all alone
But this time I got my signals straight
When love calls she won't have to wait

Try the line one more time
This woman is much too rare for me to give her up
Knowing that love's still here
Cause all at once it came to me
Now operator got to help me please

Or she'll have somebody new
