Hey little school girl, are you going my way
Hey little school girl, are you going my way
Let me bring your books home baby, feel so good today

I passed your house the other day,
Your mama told me you is going out to play
Hey little school girl, are you going my way
Let me bring your books home, feel so good today

Hey little school girl, I want you for myself
Hey little school girl, I want you for myself
If I can't have you, you won't belong to no-one else

I traveled to the East, traveled to the West,
Now I found the girl that I love the best
Hey little school girl, are you going my way
Let me bring your books home, feel so good today
