Hey have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I'm maybe coming on rainbows,but baby here goes

dreams out for us to sleep
Love is for us to keep
And if you wondering what this song is leading to

**
I wanna make it with you
I really think that we can make it good

love you don't know me well
I never let a thing,only time will tell
If you believe this that I do,then we'll see through
Love can be sure or wrong
Love can be right or wrong
If I chose the word I like to help me through
(back to **)

baby you know that...
Dream out for us to sleep
Love is for us to keep
And if you wondering what this song is leading to

(back to **)
