Attack of the name game
Attack of the name game
I was walkin down the street keepin time with my feet
When I heard the strangest sound

I saw a spaceship scene and a man in green
And a crowd was gathered round
Well, I stepped up close just to get a little dose
Of his rhymin kind of game

Then he winked all three of eyes at me
And he said, Did you catch my name
