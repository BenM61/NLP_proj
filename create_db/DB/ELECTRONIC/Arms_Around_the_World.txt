(All around the world) 

All around the world 
My love will always be the same 
New York or Tokyo 
Rome  Paris  Egypt or Spain 
Wherever I am I will always think of you 
No matter  baby 
My love will always 
Get to you  yeah 

When I think of you 
My love can fly 

[Chorus]
You and I 
Gonna wrap our loving arms 
All around the world 
Gonna capture all the love in the universe 
Gonna make it shine 
And wrap our arms around the world 

(You and I) 
I swim the ocean 
To be with you every night 
I cross the desert 
And bring to you the Sahara light 
(Oh oh, yeah yeah) 
Wherever I am 
I will always come back to you 
As long as you're there for me, baby 
I'll find you, yeah 

When I think of you 
My love can fly 

[Chorus]

Oh oh, yeah 
Around the world 
And wrap our arms around the world, the world 

I never thought that I 
Could find someone 
I never thought that I 
Could reach the sun 
I never thought that I 
Could feel your love 
All around the world 

[Chorus]
