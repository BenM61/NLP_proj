When Mom and Papa first laid eyes
On me right from the start
They knew right away a lover was born
I'd be breakin' lovers' hearts
(Breakin' lovers' hearts)

At a very early age, yeah, I began to show sign
That a stone cold lover was born
Lord, I'm gonna let it shine, yeah
(I'm gonna let it shine, yeah)

Girl, if I can't love you
A reel can make gumbo
A drunken man don't stumble
A seein'-eye dog can learn to lead the blind

A bee don't deal in honey
The Beatles ain't got no money
And watermelons grow on a grapevine

One day my papa told me
'Son, sit down, I gotta talk to you
Said, don't believe I can't understand
I've been through the same thing too?

Said, ?You think you're pretty hot stuff
And you dig every girl you see
But listen, son, settle for one
It'll save a lotta misery in the long run?

If that don't get it, sonny
There ain't no corpse in the dawn
There ain't no birds in a home
And you can get black from a turnip
If you squeeze and squeeze

Tears don't go with the blues
Chicken wear high-heeled shoes
And Old McDonald's farm didn't have no trees

I'm gonna take my papa's advice
Though it's gonna be hard to do
I'm gonna stop tryin' to prove a point
I'm gonna give myself to you, girl

If I fear you, baby
Ain't no leaps in a frog
There ain't no bumps on a log
And you can get black from a turnip
If you squeeze and squeeze

A new cow don't give milk
A egg don't got no yolk
And I'd pull side of pole right out of tree, yeah
Baby
