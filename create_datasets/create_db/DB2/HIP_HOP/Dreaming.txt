(Dreaming) mmm
(Dreaming)
(Dreaming) woah, oh yeah
(Dreaming) mmm
(Dreaming)
(Dreaming) mmm
(Dreaming)
(Dreaming)

I close my eyes and see
A vision of what used to be
Such beauty

Undress me to the bone
Scatter seeds among the stones
Can't you see?

Imagine brown eyes, love and wonder, mmm
That's what keeps me from going under, ooh
Imagine passing through your shadow
A fly-by angel at your window, yes, indeed

Ooh, oh yeah
Am I dreaming again?
Dreaming of when
I thought you were heaven sent
But I wonder
Dreaming again
Dreaming of when
I thought love was innocent
But I wonder

Walking through empty streets
Gazing at your history
So blue, yeah

Deep in the heart of me
I just can't shake the memories
It's you, yeah

Imagine walking on the water, ooh
The past keeps coming back to haunt you, yes indeed

Ooh, oh yeah
Am I dreaming again?
Dreaming of when
I thought you were heaven sent
But I wonder
Dreaming again
Dreaming of when
I thought love was innocent
But I wonder

Dreaming again
Dreaming of when
I thought you were heaven sent
But I wonder
Dreaming again
Dreaming of when
I thought love was innocent
But I wonder

I have a dream (mmm mmm)
Do you have a dream?
(Oh yeah)
I have a dream
Dreaming of me
Dreaming of you
Dreaming of me
Dreaming of you

Imagine walking on the water, ooh
The past keeps coming back to haunt you, yes indeed

Ooh, oh yeah
Am I dreaming again?
Dreaming of when
I thought you were heaven sent
But I wonder
Dreaming again
