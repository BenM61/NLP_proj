I can see it in your eyes
Taste it in our first kiss
Stranger in this lonely town
Save me from my emptiness

You took my hand
You told me it would be OK
I trusted you to hold my heart
Now fate is pulling me away, from you

Even if I leave you now
And it breaks my heart
Even if I'm not around
I won't give in
I can't give up
On this love

You've become a piece of me
Makes me sick to even think
Of mornings waking up alone
Searching for you in my sheets
Don't fade away

Even if I leave you now
And it breaks my heart
Even if I'm not around
I won't give in
I can't give up
On this love

I can't just close the door
(On this love)
I never felt anything like this before
(Like this love)
Tell me the truth no matter what we're going through
Will you hold on too 'cause

Even if I leave you now
And it breaks my heart
Even if I'm not around
I won't give in
I can't give up
On this love
