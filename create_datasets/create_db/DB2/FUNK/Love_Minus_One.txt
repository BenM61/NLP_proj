You know, I've never been good at doing numbers,
But losing your love has taught me that, 
When there's two and you take away one,
You're left with something that's worth less than nothing.

Never let it be said I didn't try to rescue your heart
But how can you save a love that is thru before it could start.
We were more than the sum of all our pearls we were infinity
But now that you're gone, can't figure it out
Don't add up to me

I'm in love minus one
And that probably is
Even less than love
Ending before it had begun
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Minus one.

You know, I could count all the days that's added up to a lifetime with you
But most times I live in a dream that you're coming back,
But somewhere in my heart I know it's not true.

If I could I'd stop time and wait until you love me again
I just can't believe, forever so long
I'll hold on till then

I'm in love minus one
And that probably is
Even less than love
Ending before it had begun
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Minus one.

Wooo

I'm in love minus one
And that probably is
Even less than love
Ending before it had begun
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Minus one.

I'm in love minus one
And that probably is
Even less than love
Ending before it had begun
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Minus one.
