I'm not the one who goes for my own pleasure
And then just brush you aside
I'm here to please and lead on your expectations
Ultimately satisfied
See, you trigger my affections to mirror your sensations
And I promise you I'll do you so right
So you know that
chorus
If you don't feel good
Then I don't feel good
Don't you know I love you so crazy
If you're not ticking
Then I'm not tocking
Nobody does it better than me
Now that you've had a taste of my flavor
You've found you've deeply touched my soul
See when you learn and understand each other
You get a simple unconditional flow (unconditional flow)
Nobody can stimulate
Excite the way
Blend the way you do
Girl I'm gonna gratify you
chorus
We're like a weeble wobble
And we don't fall down
Sugar, you excite me
You know you stimulate me
Our love will never fade you see
chorus
