I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something good
Something good, yeah something good
Oh oh oh oh

All these days seem so far away
And I went too far enough to wait
I've come
Way back then when I hadn't seen
Half them things I'd never thought I'd see
Become someone I'd never thought I'd be, oh

'Cause there's something good,
Yeah, I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something good
Something good, yeah something good
Oh oh oh oh

All these days seem to fade away as I lost faith in myself
Questioned everything I stood for
No no ain't more left to look for in life
I began to lose all, found it harder to cope
With everything around me
And them people that would doubt me
Oh I, I was in a place that I didn't wanna be
Seeing face after face I didn't wanna see, I I I
I didn't go out of my mind, only God knows
And all them girls that I used to see running 'round
Was like the rain that I used to see pouring down, ey ey ey
They did nothing for me

'Cause I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something good
Something good, yeah something good
Oh oh oh oh no no no no no

I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, something good
Something good, yeah
No no no no no 
No no no no no no no no no no no no (I need)

I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
