The moon shines bright above
And the charts declare it's not my night for love
Ah the beat of my heart
I feel a good vibration
Saying you and me baby 
Would make a good combination
There's no need for looking to the stars
Can't you see the stars shine in my eyes
I love you boy, 
I really love you boy 

No matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are
Can't let astrology chart our destiny 
No matter what sign you are 
You're gonna be mine you are

The beat of the heart my love 
Is stronger than the charts my love
Your water sign just lit my fire
You fill me with such desire
I love you boy, 
I really love you boy 

No matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are
Can't let astrology chart our destiny 
Oh no matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are 
Need you beside me love 
Only you guide me love

I  don't care about your rising sign
All I know is when your lips touch mine
You move me boy, you really move me boy 
No matter what sign you are 
You're gonna be mine you are
Hold me tight, ah hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
