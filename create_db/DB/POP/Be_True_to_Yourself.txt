Be true to yourself and you'll always be true to me
Be true to yourself and you'll be the girl that I want you to be

Remember that
If some other guy catches your eye just follow your heart
I know your heart won't lead you wrong 
our love is much too strong

I'm not afraid of losing you
I have faith in you, can't you see
Darling be true to yourself and you'll always be true to me
