She works at it hard and she keeps herself to herself
But she can take what she gets anyway
She talks of the things and places she wants to go
But she knows that she wants all the things she wants

She's a great dancer
Not ideally built for ballet
She's got her calling card to live this way
The young teenage boys
Would climb on cars just to take a look
They watch her move, schoolboy dreamers fantasy

She's a dancer, not ideally built for ballet
Embracing everyone to see the play
Everyone's eyes are looking on as she takes the stage
Seeing themselves as she plays out their lives for them

She's a great dancer
Not ideally built for ballet
She's got her calling card to live this way
The young teenage boys
Would climb on cars just to take a look
They watch her move, schoolboy dreamers fantasy

She works everyday, does anyone care ?
Playing the fool is anyone there?

She's a great dancer
Not ideally built for ballet
She's got her calling card to live this way
The young teenage boys
Would climb on cars just to take a look
They watch her move, schoolboy dreamers fantasy

She still looks quite young and the world has a space for her
Something there in her face good to photograph
The reason she said, for being able to take success
Living this life, cause she only has this chance

She's a great dancer
Not ideally built for ballet
She's got her calling card to live this way
The young teenage boys
Would climb on cars just to take a look
They watch her move, schoolboy dreamers fantasy

Everybody knows, she knows, she knows
She's got a good voice
She's keen and got some visual sense
She knows, she knows
