We can't turn back the clock
But we can chant for love
Let's cut the idle talk so we can
Chant for love

We always have the time to quarrel
About such problems as money and war
Let's put it off until tomorrow
Who needs another dose of sorrow?

It don't necessitate an act of faith
To chant for love
What alibi is strong enough to wait
To chant for love

Though we don't hold the reigns of power
Somebody else seems to be in control
We mustn't waste another hour
We'll get directly to the soul

If we can
Chant
For a world united
Chant

For a world that's dying for love
The Hare Krishna plays a drum and bell
When he chants for love
The tribal priest is afraid of hell

So he chants for love
I am not pushing some religion
Don't get me wrong,
I never mess with such things

Just be true to your own vision
This is your personal decision
The Dervish spins to a "Hu Hu Hu"
When he chants for love

Nobody knows what the angels do
When they chant for love
You're at the bottom of the ladder
Someone may try to tell you where you should start

But the words, they never matter
If you can feel it in your heart
Then you can
Why don't you chant?

You can chant
Chant, chant, chant...
