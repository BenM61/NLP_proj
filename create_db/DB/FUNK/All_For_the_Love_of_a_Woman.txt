Every man I know is working everyday
For a woman somewhere
If she's a woman that's true
There ain't nothing he won't do to show her how much he cares

'Cause some men will cry for it
Some men will lie for it
Some men will even go out an' die for it

All for the love of a woman
Talkin' 'bout the love of a woman
It means everything to a man

Now a rich man, a poor man, it's all the same
Love and happiness is the name of their game
And it makes no difference if they are young or old
He need a woman just to reach his goal

Oh, 'cause some men will kill for it
Some men will steal for it
Some men will even do a dirty rotten deal for it

All for the love of a woman
Talkin' 'bout the love of a woman
It means everything to a man

Oh baby
Talkin' about the love of a sweet little woman like you

Now a young man or old man or a middle age one too
For the love of a woman there ain't nothing they won't do
She loved one and reject him up
Trouble is comin' you better run for cover

Oh, 'cause some men will kill for it
Some men will steal for it
Some men will even do a dirty rotten deal

All for the love of a woman
I'm talkin' 'bout the love of a woman
It means everything to a man

Talkin' about the love of a sweet little woman like you
Every man I know what I'm talking about
We work two jobs seven days a week
Spend every diamond one night, take your woman out

It may not be your woman
But you're taking somebody else's woman
Every thing a man loves
[Incomprehensible] woman
