We getting' money over here, hey I'm

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
'Cause baby boy he got his own damn money

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
'Cause baby boy he got his own damn money

I'm getting' rich y'all, check out the karats in my wrist boy
The way I'm iced out I know you hate this boy
I switched to dank from [unverified] now it's [unverified] boy
Done copped a ride and a lot of niggaz pissed boy
No FEMA checks, hustle hard, this a rich boy
New clothes, new style, new kicks boy

The reason why I claim rich 'cause I got a lil' change
I'm tryin' to get the new range
The reason why I say I'm blowin' real fast
Is I just got in the game and I got a lil' cash
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel
But if I don't hustle dawg I can't pay my bills, I'm

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
'Cause baby boy he got his own damn money

This year I gotta shine, this year I gotta grind
This year I gotta hustle, this year I'm gon' blow
No purp stain on my lips I stay out of trouble
Cause niggaz be provokin' me to put 'em in a tussle

But now I can't do it, I got a positive mind frame
I'm somethin' like spike, I can only do right things
God blessed me with a talent now it's time to show off
6 years in the game now it's time to go off

The rapper that I'm bein', I'm tight with no flaws
If you don't hustle hard then you dog with no claws
Hard work straight grindin' now I'm almost the boss
Really nuttin' changed just my ice and my cars

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
'Cause baby boy he got his own damn money

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
'Cause baby boy he got his own damn money

Look I don't care about another man's money
Cause finally I got my own damn money
I can't get cut short 'cause I got my own shit
I can't get set back 'cause I own my own shit

I done made it to the start and now I gotta finish
I'm talkin' getting' lil' money but now I'm getting' plenty
Grey Goose, Belvedere, I done bagged off some Henny
And I'm still from the block but don't call me Jenny

Call me baby boy, I'm a Prince of the game
I'm stuck on my money like a pimp with his cane
Take another peek at, my neck and my wrist boy
Bank account sky high, 'cause I'm getting' rich boy

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
'Cause baby boy he got his own damn money

Gettin' rich y'all, and I'm blowin' real fast
'Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
'Cause baby boy he got his own damn money

What you say now gettin' money
What you say now gettin' money
What you say now gettin' money
What you say now gettin' money

What you say now, I done, done it again
What you say now, I done, done it again
What you say now, I done, done it again
What you say now, I done, done it again

Extreme Universal
Hardness on the track
And that's that, a known fact
