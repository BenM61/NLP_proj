Baby I just thought you love me, but then I guess I was wrong
Thinking you stay by my side, yeah
Still got a feeling that I need you
But why you had to cheat on me?
I still see you in my dreams, even though you're far away

And when I'm lyin' in silence in my bed
You come crawling to my head
And I'm tryin' to fight back, you
Come again
Come again
Come again and shine like a star
You stole my heart, but I feel that I just have to fight

Fight back with love tonight (fight back, fight back, yeah)
Get it on get in on, yeah
Fight back with love tonight
(Fight back, fight back, yeah
Get in on, get in on, yeah)
Fight back with love tonight (fight back, fight back, yeah)
(Get it on get in on, yeah)

Yeah
Yo baby I thought I forgot you
But you haunt me like a ghost
On my mind, every day and night

Come again
Come again
Come again and shine like a star
You stole my heart, but I feel that I just have to fight

Fight back with love tonight (fight back, fight back, yeah)
Get it on, get in on, yeah
Fight back with love tonight
(Fight back, fight back, yeah
Get in on, get in on, yeah)
(Fight back, fight back, yeah
Get in on, get in on, yeah)

And when I'm lyin' in silence in my bed
You come crawling to my head
And I'm tryin' to fight back, you
Come again
Come again
Come again and shine like a star
You stole my heart, but I feel that I just have to fight

Fight back with love tonight (fight back, fight back, yeah)
Get it on, get in on, yeah
Fight back with love tonight
(Fight back, fight back, yeah
Get in on, get in on, yeah)
Fight back with love tonight (fight back, fight back, yeah)
(Get it on, get in on, yeah)
