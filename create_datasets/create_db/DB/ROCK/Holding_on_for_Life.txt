Girl take a seat, rest your weary bones
Your secrets safe in my hands
Tell me about the years and
Let me buy an hour
Maybe help me to understand
Ooh ain't nobody callin'
Ain't nobody home
What a lovely day to be lonely

You're holding on for life
Holding on for life oh
Holding on for love.
You're holding on for life
Holding on for life oh
Holding on for love.

Light another cigarette
Burning in the cold
Waiting on the street for your man
You're trying not to look so
Young and miserable
You gotta get your kicks while you can
In the lighted corner, sitting on your own
What a lovely day to be lonely

You're holding on for life
Holding on for life oh
Holding on for love.
You're holding on for life
Holding on for life oh
Holding on for love.

Well you might belong to another time
Still you have to carry on here
No where else to go and you never know
What to hide and what to show, no

You're holding on for life
Holding on for life oh
Holding on for love.
You're holding on for life
Holding on for life oh
Holding on for love.
