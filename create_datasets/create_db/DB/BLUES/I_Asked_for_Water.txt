Oh, I asked her for water, oh, she brought me gasoline
Oh, I asked her for water, oh, she brought me gasoline
That's the troublingest woman
That I ever seen

Oh, the church bell tollin', oh, the hearse come driving slow
Oh, the church bell tollin', oh, the hearse come driving slow
I hope my baby
Don't leave me no more

Oh, tell me baby, oh, when are you coming back home?
Oh, tell me baby, oh, when are you coming back home?
You know I love you, baby
But you've been gone too long
