Now baby don't worry, if he troubles your mind
Cause it'll all wash away girl, in the river of time
If you need a shoulder, I'll be around
I'll be your rock to hold onto, till the river goes down

It's hell and high water, that you're going through
But come hell and high water, I'll be here waiting for you

Can't keep you from crying, and I can't stop your pain
Bright instant sunshine, never could stop the rain
But you know that I'll be there, just like that old sun
To be your good morning, when your cryings all done

It's hell and high water, that you're going through
But come hell or high water, I'll be here waiting for you

It's hell and high water, that you're going through
But come hell or high water, I'll be here waiting for you
