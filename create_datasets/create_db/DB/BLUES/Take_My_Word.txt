Take my word for what I tell you 
I have never lied to you
Pay no mind to what they're sayin' 
I have never been untrue
Evil tongues in town 
Continue to prat aloud 
Their evil news
You'll have to take my word 
When I tell you I love you 
I love you (I love you)

The power of gossip is always strengthen 
When it finds a respected ear
If you listen the chances are greater 
That a thread of doubt may appear
Evil tongues in town continue

Evil tongues in town 
Continue to prat aloud 
Their evil news
You'll have to take my word 
When I tell you I love you 
I love you I love you
Take my word I love you 
Take my word I love you
