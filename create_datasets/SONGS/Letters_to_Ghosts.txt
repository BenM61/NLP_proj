Left were the ashes 'cause I let it burn
They're with my cold heart buried in the dirt
His lost is the only thing that still hurts
I would be yours now if the tables turned
And only my time is wasting
This can't be right

And I can't let go
Someone I wanted the most
I'm still on fire
I'm writing letters to ghosts
If I was stronger
You would be holding me close
But his love has got me stole
Stole

And all you wish for this heart that's one
But you're my soulmate
Can't be undone
And you hold the bullets
But he's got the gun
And he's gonna find me wherever I run

And I can't let go
Someone I wanted the most
I'm still on fire
I'm writing letters to ghosts
If I were stronger
You would be holding me close
But his love has got me stole

I can't let go
Someone I wanted the most
I'm still on fire
I'm writing letters to ghosts
If I were stronger
You would be holding me close
But his love has got me stole

I can't let go
Someone I wanted the most
I'm still on fire
I'm writing letters to ghosts
If I were stronger
You would be holding me close
But his love has got me stole

I can't let go
Someone I wanted the most
I'm still on fire
I'm writing letters to ghosts
If I were stronger
You would be holding me close
But his love has got me stole
Stole
His love has got me stole
