Girl you ready, say you ready, hope you ready, know you ready
All I ask is venom in that thing hold it steady
Get it, get it true freaks, blues sheets you gon' wet it
Make that pussy hurricane
It spins like a tornado and that thunderstorm hit it
And if you caught amnesia this night you still won't forget it
Girl I promised to your body kept my word yeah I did it
Girl it's on, I'd like to welcome you to Chapter V
