Let it go
How far will a falling star take me
How far can I go can I go
Gotta be what the nightmare made me
Gotta be gotta be what I see
Jump clear of the falling parts from me
How far will they go will they go
Can't give what you need from me baby
Just let it go

Bringing me down break me down sweet sugar
Bringing me down break me down
Breaking me down to the ground sweet baby
Breaking me down to the ground

Too much is made of what's in me
Not enough about how I strive
Keep an eye on your world it's cheating
Keep an eye keep an eye on me
Deep inside there's a little place for me
A little place for me
Can't give what you want from me baby
Just leave it be

Sweet razor wound
Deep down slice my groove
Sweet razor wound
Deep down c'mon and slice it

How far did the falling star take me
How far did it go did it go
Had to be what the nightmare made me
F*ck, just had to be
Jump clear of the falling parts form me
How far did they go did they go
Can't give what you want from me baby
Hell, just let it go
