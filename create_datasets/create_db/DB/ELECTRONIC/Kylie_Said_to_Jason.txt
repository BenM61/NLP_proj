Song:
Kylie Said to Jason
All lyrics transcribed by Dave Datta
I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
Oh Baby...............................Oh Baby
I was lying on the floor
With the music in my head
The Todd Terry Project
Was the last thing that I heard
I had searched for the answer
It was not much to find
Then Kylie said to Jason
"It's all in the mind"
My mind was empty (party)
Had been for a while (party)
So I said to Kylie (party)
"Jason's got some style" (party)
You got it, You got it
I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
Oh Baby...............................Oh Baby
Trapped in a rerun
Of a seventies sitcom soap
"Some Mothers Do Have 'Em"
Or "The Archie Bunker Show"
I was smokin with Felicity
The good life begins in bed
Richard was in the garden
Or I think that's what she said
Then in walks Skippy (party)
The bush kangaroo (party)
Rolf playing "Sad Eyes" (party)
And playing the didgeridoo (party)
You got it, You got it
You got it, You got it
I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
Oh Baby...............................Oh Baby
You got it, You got it
You got it, You got it
I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
You got it, You got it
You got it, You got it
I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
