When mistletoe and tinsel glow
Paint a yuletide valentine
Back home I go to those I know
For a Christmas auld lang syne.

And as we gather 'round the tree
Our voices all combine
In sweet accord to thank the Lord
For a Christmas auld lang syne.

When sleigh bells ring and choirs sing
And the children's faces shine
With each new toy we share their joy
With a Christmas auld lang syne.

We sing His praise this day of days 
And pray next year this time
We'll all be near to share the cheer
Of a Christmas auld lang syne.

"Merry Christmas everybody and a Happy New Year!"

In sweet accord we thank the Lord
For a Christmas auld lang syne.
