Let's meet up
When the time is right
The time is right
The time is right

Well I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Let's find out
What you are about
What's hidden in there
What you've got for me there

Well I don't know about you
I don't know about you

I know the way to fantasy
The world of dreams
The place to be

Well I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Let's find out
If our spirits meet
Let's push and tweak
Let our spirits cheat

'Cause I don't know about you
No I don't know about you

You can trust me baby
The scratch right there
You can trust me baby
You can trust me baby

Well I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Anybody
Who's coming with me
Gotta love my tracks
And swing an axe

No I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Don't know don't know don't know
Don't know don't know don't know
Don't know don't know don't know don't know
Don't know don't know don't know don't know

Well I don't know about you
I don't know about you
But I don't know about you
I don't know about you
