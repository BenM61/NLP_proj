I love the way you walk
I love the way you talk
With your mouthful
The way you park on the sidewalk

The way you are in your car
I'll make you love the way I behave
On my bad days
And show you the trigger to my bitch switch
And how to play with my witch stitch, ohh

Kiss my dirty feet
And I'll take you out for dinner
Laugh at my jokes
I wanna sit on your back
Close my eyes take your pulse
It's hundred and twenty and it's rising

All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you

I love the way you rob a shop
And I love the way your belly flops
As the morning drops
And the way you change from playing cup
When you force me to stop

First my assailant
Then my private Federal agent
Bang my feet, chain my hands
And ignore my demands

Kiss my dirty feet
And I'll take you out for dinner
Laugh at my jokes
I wanna sit on your back
Close my eyes, take your pulse
It's a hundred and twenty and it's rising

All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you now
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you, oh
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you, yeah
All I wanna do is kootchi, kootchi, kootchi koo with you

All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you, oh
All I wanna do is kootchi, kootchi, kootchi, kootchi koo with you
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you now

You're like maggots in my brain
Crawling through my veins
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you, with you now
(Incomprehensible)

All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you
All I wanna do is kootchi koo with you, yeah
Kootchi, kootchi, kootchi, kootchi, kootchi
Kootchi, kootchi, kootchi, kootchi koo
