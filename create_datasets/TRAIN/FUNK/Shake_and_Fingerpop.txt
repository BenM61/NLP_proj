Said put on your wig, woman 
Were goin' out to shake and fingerpop! Hey, baby! 
I said put on your wig, woman 
Goin' out to shake and fingerpop! Hey, girl! 

Were gonna get out on the floor, now 
Dance like we never did before, right on, sugar! 

I said, look at the people, find a place in line 
Doin' the barracuda, the jerk and the twine 
Kick off your shoes baby and get in the groove 
Cause when you hear the music, you feet has got to move 

I said, put on your wig, woman 
Goin' out to shake and fingerpop, that's what I said 
We gonna get out on the floor now 
Dance like we never did before, hey, hey! 

I said, do the boomerang, the twine and the jerk 
They're jammin' up the band now, so everybody work! 
I said, put on your wig, woman 
Goin' out to shake and fingerpop, hey, that's what I said! 
Gonna get out on the floor now 
Dance like we never did before, hey!
