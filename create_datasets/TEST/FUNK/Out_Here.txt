Yea, yea, mob city

If you wanna come see me for a bag
(I'm out here)
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
(I'm out here)

If you wanna see me rollin' that Philly
(I'm out here)
If you talkin' like you comin' ta get me
(I'm out here)

If you wanna see real niggaz around
(I'm out here)
Every day I put my life on the line
(I'm out here)

If a nigga need a lick on some 'dro
(I'm out here)
I got weight and I don't break it on my own
(I'm out here)

On the deck old school hustlin', I came up from nothin' and uh
The game so cold, my pistols protectin' me bro
The streets is my tool to buildin' my legacy, uh
I made it so what the f*ck is you sweatin' me fuh?

I'm out here, fuckin' hoes and doin' shows
I'm out here, poppin' mo's and smokin' dro
I'm out here, doin' me ballin' the f*ck out
Chris T of Easy G's, throwin' some dust out

If you wanna come see me for a bag
(I'm out here)
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
(I'm out here)

If you wanna see me rollin' that Philly
(I'm out here)
If you talkin' like you comin' ta get me
(I'm out here)

If you tell me that it ain't really hot
(I'm out here)
If you wanna see me out on the block
(I'm out here)

If you wanna see that old school Chevy
(I'm out here)
If you talkin' like you comin' ta get me
(I'm out here)

'Fore I hit my windows up, hit up my doors then
Shoot up my partnaz and kidnap all of my hoes then
Make my money funny if I got it comin' ta me
Talk stupid to a nigga when you run it ta me

If you don't want your grill, you don't want to live
You don't want your kids, you don't want your crib
But that's exactly what you're losin'
If you don't want it better let the 'lac hear ya movin'

If you want to see a real nigga shine
(I'm out here)
Need a pimp to control your body and mind?
(I'm out here)

When you ready to go cook up this cake
(I'm out here)
Got a few hundred grams, you wanna shake?
(I'm out here)

Mobsta Niggas spend that time on the grind
Sippin' Yak, slingin' packs of the city's biggest dimes
Yeah, you got a decent bag, but yo shit ain't big as mine
If you get your game tight, I'ma have to rob you blind

I'm from K town, bitch, with different gangs on every block
And the way you wear your hat just might get your ass shot
The mobsters got the game on lock and the haters full of fear
Scared to ride through the hood 'cause they know we out here

If you wanna come see me for a bag
(I'm out here)
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
(I'm out here)

If you wanna see me rollin' that Philly
(I'm out here)
If you talkin' like you comin' ta get me
(I'm out here)

When you see me pull that hood up
Better get low we 'bout to tear the fuckin' hood up
Ballas and killas and gangstas
(What you runnin' from?)
Ballas and killas and gangstas
(Nigga, what you runnin' from?)

Shoulda seen their face when I first got there workin', got it to rock
I'm from K town bitch and I don't know shit but the block
Gotta get that money so I don't care, I'm posted up right here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, you gon' have to move me

Twenty thousand a week and I ain't hearin' nothin'
But since y'all is stackin' chips (Incomprehensible)
See dem police come cuffin'
That's when I might have to hide out
Or dip through the hood with the chrome
And the wool when I pull that ride out, got a screen that slide out

When the jump out boys gone
(I'm out here)
If you wanna get them knocks and them blows
(I'm out here)

If you plottin' on a mission to get me
(I'm out here)
If you wanna see the Twista in your city
(I'm out here)

If you wanna come see me for a bag
(I'm out here)
If you wanna see that mean green Jag
(I'm out here)

If you wanna see me rollin' that Philly
(I'm out here)
If you talkin' like you comin' ta get me
(I'm out here)

If you tell me that it ain't really hot
(I'm out here)
If you wanna see me out on the block
(I'm out here)

If you wanna see that old school Chevy
(I'm out here, I'm out here)

When you see me pull that hood up
Better get low, we 'bout to tear the fuckin' hood up
Ballas and killas and gangstas
(What you runnin' from?)
Ballas and killas and gangstas
(What you runnin' from?)

When you see me pull that hood up
Better get low, we 'bout to tear the fuckin' hood up
Ballas and killas and gangstas
(What you runnin' from?)
Ballas and killas and gangstas
(Nigga, what you runnin' from?)
