C'mon c'mon remix
C'mon c'mon
Something deep inside

The first time that it crossed my mind
I kept on pushing it aside
Its such a strong emotion
Second time was plain to see
This feelings rushing over me
Oh yeah
And unknown to me
This chemistry is
Something deep inside

I can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
Its something deep inside

c'mon c'mon

The third time was just as sweet
Boy you make my life complete
Every thought and motion
Its hard just telling you
But everything I feel is true
Oh yeah
And unknown to me
This chemistry is
Something deep inside

I can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
Its something deep inside

c'mon c'mon

Its crossed my mind 
Its crossed my mind

So if you follow emotion

The love and devotion you'll find

I can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
Its something deep inside

I can feel but I can't touch
Can never get too much
I hear you loud and clear
I've got nothing to fear
Your love will be my guide
I've never been this satisfied
Its something deep inside
