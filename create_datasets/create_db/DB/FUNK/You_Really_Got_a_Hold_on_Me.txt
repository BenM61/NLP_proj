I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Though oh, oh, oh,
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and, all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter, tighter

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend 
Another day here
Though Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, squeeze me, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
I've said you've really got a hold on me
You know you've really got a hold on me
