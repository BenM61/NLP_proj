Oh don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He made this world for us to live in
And gave us everything

And all He asks of us
Is we give each other love, oh yeah

Don't go and talk about my father
'Cause God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He loves us whether or not we know it
And He'll forgive all our sins, oh yeah

And all He asks of us, oh yeah
Is we give each other love, oh yeah

Love your mother, she bore you
Love your father, well He works for you
Love your sister, she's good to you
Love your brother, your brother

Don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
And when we call on Him for mercy
He'll be merciful, my friend, oh yeah
All He asks of us, I know
