Driving away from the wreck of the day
And the light's always red in the rear-view.
Desperately close to a coffin of hope
I'd cheat destiny just to be near you.

And if this is givin' up
Then I'm givin' up.
If this is givin' up
Then I'm givin' up, givin' up.
On love, on love

Driving away from the wreck of the day
And I'm thinking 'bout calling on Jesus.

'Cause love doesn't hurt, so I know I'm not fallin' in love
I'm just fallin' to pieces

And if this is givin' up
Then I'm givin' up.
If this is givin' up
Then I'm givin' up, givin' up.
On love, on love

And maybe I'm not off of being a victim of love
All my resistance will never be distance enough

Driving away from the wreck of the day
And it's finally quiet in my head.
Driving alone 
I'm finally on my way home to the comfort of my bed.

And if this is givin' up
Then I'm givin' up.
If this is givin' up
Then I'm givin' up, givin' up.
On love, on love
