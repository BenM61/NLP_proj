And your starve us now
You light up for me
You didn't want me to see
The love quietly silently
Now just a million miles
They won't hide tonight
And the stars are like
Like a way to love tonight.

I've been having these strangest feeling
That you walked out on me on evening
But I can't leave the chance
Let them cut and in my heart
I've been having these strangest feeling
That you walked out on me on evening
But I can't leave the chance
Let them cut and eat my heart

A single tear just dropped into the ocean of your heart
You left me open now I'm hoping that you try to understand
What is calling from me there's no way I can pretend
That you were coming back to get me
Now the move would lead me in
So destine over and missed in
You're the incoherent here only yesterday
Where you going?
Make that fire let it burn start the rain

I've been having these strangest feeling
That you walked out on me on evening
But I can't leave the chance
Let them cut and in my heart
I've been having these strangest feeling
That you walked out on me on evening
But I can't leave the chance
Let them cut and eat my heart

I have put and I emphasize
Face it I'll turn the high
Closer I get your fate, you were here on the yesterday
And I know I try to forget all those nights, all those nights
You know I've tried.

I've been having these strangest feeling
That you walked out on me on evening
But I can't leave the chance
Let them cut and in my heart
I've been having these strangest feeling
That you walked out on me on evening
But I can't leave the chance
Let them cut and eat my heart

Let them cut and eat my heart
