i'm gonna stay in bed all day
i'm not gonna hear a word you say

it's gonna be a life of style for me
electric blankets,pillows,fire,and tv


take a look outside
those lively arts are on the slide
and culture's just a bore
when you're angry, young and poor
but if i got my way
those idle rich would pay
when the discussion starts
on the lively arts

i'm gonna be a lazy slob
stuff the folks and sod the job

and tell the foreman that i'm ill
and in a week i'll be here still
yes i will
