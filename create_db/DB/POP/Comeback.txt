Caught out, sleeping around
He says it's nothing with her lipstick on his mouth
And you might think he doesn't care that much at all
But they always come back, yeah they always come back

When he returns he puts you in a situation
But it's too late to have that kinda conversation
It's not your job to show this boy some education, no
Now ain't it funny how we never seem to work it out

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take the pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back, yeah they always come back

They're all the same, they never learn
So dig their grave, and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back, yeah they always come back

Dry your eyes Mr. Wise Guy
But take a picture, it's the last that you will see
Let's see how far this guy gets walking on his own feet
But they always come back, yeah they always come back

When he returns he puts you in a situation
But it's too late to have that kinda conversation
It's not your job to show this boy some education, no
Now ain't it funny how we never seem to work it out

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take the pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back, yeah they always come back

They're all the same, they never learn
So dig their grave, and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back, yeah they always come back

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take the pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back, yeah they always come back

We've all been played, we all get hurt
Just take the pain and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back, yeah they always come back

They're all the same, they never learn
So dig their grave, and let that motherfucker burn
And you know that in time you will find
That they always come back, yeah they always come back
