There was a little girl I had planned to marry
This was my love I didn't want to share it
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn't love me 'cause I didn't have no money

So, everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

I had me a girl and yes, I really loved her
Every night, well, I was thinking of her
But you cant mix love with money
'Cause if you do you gonna hurt somebody

So, everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

Lord, I know that I'm just a poor man
But is it wrong to love 'cause I'm not a rich man?
But you can't mix love with money
'Cause when you do you gonna hurt somebody

And everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

Everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

Everyday I have to
Let the water fall from my eyes
Everyday I have to
Let the water fall from my eyes

Everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
