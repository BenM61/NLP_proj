Caroline, you are my number one
Caroline, your lovin' came so strong
When your eyes first met mine, we both knew
What was comin' for me and for you

Sweet lovin' Caroline
You're to good to be true
Caroline, the way that you walk your walk

Caroline, and how I adore your talk
When your fingertips 're curling my hair
It's a feelin' beyond all compare
Sweet lovin'

Makes me shiver from my head to toe
Caroline, you're so fine
You're a wonder of nature
Caroline, you're a wild flower growing so free
I'm so glad what a beautiful day when I found you

Caroline, can't you see you're my everything
What a sound you whisper in my ear
All the words that you know I'd like to hear
And when your body gently meets mine
We are far away from space and time
Sweet lovin' Caroline - make it last all our lives
Caroline, you're so fine
You're a wonder of nature...
No more tears
No more fears
No more lonely nights
''cause I got you
Girl
You're my hope
You're my dope

No one can ever cope
You got even more to show
You got style
You can smile
You got more than just only
Some sex-appeal, it's a high-time with you
Everything that we do
We're doin' with all our hearts
Caroline, you're so fine
You're a wonder of nature...
