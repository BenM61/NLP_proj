See me in the morning light 
A photograph of pure delight 
Yeah but I left too soon 
I don't see you girl
There were some good times we had 
And there were some that weren't so bad
Oh just feel it now lets feel it now

Yoh yo I remember what we used to do
Blink up and dream a living with the notion to
I'll give you the sun, the stars and the blue sky too
So come on a leasing want to pleasing you
Remember when we used to link up with the crew
Suze and Suzette and Tanya too
You're the one on me side, when me ask you to
It's just a party now,
Yo, I believe in you, I ain't leaving you

[Chorus]
Ooh come on let's get down tonight
Come on let's get down tonight
Join the carnival of love ooh
Well you sing it now, take it now
Join the carnival of love 

Come on join in the carnival of love yeah

I watch the laughter in your eyes
I see the wrinkles change in size
Yeah, time has left you now
Lovers may have tried to be 
Everything that's strange in me
Oh much deeper now, much deeper now 

Much deeper, 
Yo, I used to love it when we used to play
It used to be like a weekend everyday
Three times at night when I came every way 
Body to body make you scream and say
Physically dance
You're not easy, take it easy
For again we are love, at one with the pope
And you stay on my mind, 
So lets go to the party girl 
That we leave behind

Ooh come on let's get down tonight
Come on let's get down tonight
Join the carnival of love ooh
Well you sing now, take it now
Join the carnival of love
