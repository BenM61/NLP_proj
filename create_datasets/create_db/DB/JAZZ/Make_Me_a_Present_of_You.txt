I don't want a mountain of diamonds
And a valley of gold wouldn't do
But if you want to make me happy
Just make me a present of you

I don't need a desert of rubies
Or an ocean of pearls to swim through
But if you wanna make me happy
Just make me a present of you

What good is a girl with a million?
What good if the world calls you Queen?
If you don't have someone to love you
Then you really don't have anything

So I'll take your arms for my palace
And the sky for my room with a view
I know that I'll make you happy, yes
If you make me a present of you

What good is a gal with a million?
What good if the world calls you Queen?
If you don't have a man to love you
Then you really don't have a doggone thing

So I'll take my arms for your palace
And the sky for my room with a view
I know we'll both be very happy
If you'll box yourself up
Tie it with a pretty ribbon
And make me, Lord, make me a present of you
