And so to sleep again, as if I'll ever sleep again
These restless nights go on away from you
And so to dream again, as if I'll ever dream again
My darling, since you've gone, my dreams are through

No other arms can ease this ache within my heart
No other lips can kiss away these tears that start
And so to sleep again, as if I'll ever sleep again
As if I'll ever love again anyone but you
