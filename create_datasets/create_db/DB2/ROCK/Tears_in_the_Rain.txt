Away from home
Alone again
This time my train is going
Many miles away from you

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else, I've got to be

Tears in the rain
We'll never be the same
What can we do now
Baby we're through now

We'll never meet again
Tears in the rain
We'll never be the same
Nothing to do now

Baby we're through now
I won't see you again
Things go their way
It's hard to say

Ooh so much time was wasted
Just trying to make you see
So many people change their lives
Trying to understand

There's something deep inside me
There's someone else, I've got to be
Tears in the rain
We'll never be the same

What can we do now
Baby we're through now
We'll never meet again
Tears in the rain

We'll never be the same
Nothing to do now
Baby we're through now
I won't see you again

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else, I've got to be

Tears in the rain
We'll never be the same
What can we do now
Baby we're through now

We'll never meet again
Tears in the rain
We'll never be the same
Nothing to do now

Baby we're through now
I won't see you again
Tears in the rain
We'll never be the same

What can we do now
Baby we're through now
We'll never meet again
Tears in the rain
