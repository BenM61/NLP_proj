We were sleeping till
You came along
With your tiny heart
You let us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth

Don't you know it's true? Oh
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Seven figures leap the hungry mouths
The beast, he comes to you
He's a hunter for a lonely heart
In the season of the sun

Don't you know it's true?
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Where you thinking that you gotta run to now
With the beating of a tiny heart?
Hang on to the things that you're supposed to say
Millions of stars, they open to your fate

Norway ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
