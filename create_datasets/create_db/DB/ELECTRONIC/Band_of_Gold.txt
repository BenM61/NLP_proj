Now that you've gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories
Of what love could be
If you were
Still here with me

You took me from the shelter of a mother I had never known
The love of any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I waited in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'd walk right through that door
And love me
Liked you tried before

Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
