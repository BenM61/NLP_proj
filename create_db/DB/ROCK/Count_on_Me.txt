I know that life ain't always good to you
I've seen exactly what it put you through
Thrown you around and turned you upside down
And so you, you got to thinking there was no way out
You started sinking and it pulled you down
It may be tough, you've got to get back up because

You know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
you can count on me cause I will carry you till you carry on

Anytime you need someone
somebody strong to lean on
well you can count on me to hold you till that healing is done

And every time you fall apart
you can hide here in my arms
and you can count on me to hold you till that feeling is gone

I wonder why nobody's waiting on you
I'd like to be the one to pull you through
Your darkest times, I'd love to be the light that finds you
I see a silver lining on your cloud
I'll pick you up whenever you fall down
Just take my hand and I will help you stand because

You know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
you can count on me cause I will carry you till you carry on

Gone so you can live today
I seems so long till yesterday
Keep on counting on me to carry you till you carry on
Carry on

You know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
you can count on me cause I will carry you till you carry on

Remember life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
that you can count on me to hold you till that feeling is gone
