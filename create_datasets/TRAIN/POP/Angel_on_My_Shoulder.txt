Got an angel on my shoulder
Got a penny in my pocket
And I found a four leaf clover
And I put it in my locket

Wished on all the stars above me
And I caught the nearest rainbow
Gonna find someone to love me
Gonna find someone to love

Well I tossed a lot of nickels in the wishing well
And saved the fortunes that the fortune cookies tell
I got a lucky penny and a mustard seed
But a warm and tender love is all I need

And I want a love that lingers
And a strong one through and through
So I'm gonna cross my fingers
That I'll find a boy who loves me true
And I'm gonna love him too

Well I tossed a lot of nickels in the wishing well

But a warm and tender love is all I need

And I want a love that lingers
And a strong one through and through
So I'm gonna cross my fingers
That I'll find a boy who loves me true
And I'm gonna love him too
