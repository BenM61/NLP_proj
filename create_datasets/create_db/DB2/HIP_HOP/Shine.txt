Shine, shine like a star
Dreams take me far, far away
You, the brightest of all
Show me the way I hear you call
So close to me, I feel it
You are present in this room today
No one else can see you
But you shine

All, all through my life
You'll be my only guiding light
So show me the way
I'm weak and I feel I've gone astray
You are close to me, I feel it
You are present in this room today
No one else can see you
But you shine
Shine, shine, shine

Shine, shine like a star
Dreams take me far, far away
You, the brightest of all
Show us the way we hear you call

You're close to me, I feel it
You are present in this room today
And no one else can see you
But you shine
Shine, shine, shine

Shine-shine like a star
