Sickly sweet, his poison seeks 
For the young ones who don't understand 
The danger in his hands 
With a jaundiced wink see his cunning slink 
Oh trust in me my pretty one 
Come walk with me my helpless one 
Candyman 

Syrup lies upon your tongue
Ge latine saliva spills
The flash of a guillotine a smile 

Candyman - oh candyman 
No pity for him, their misery screams
Unspeakable things 

A cool missile, yes it's in his smile
With open arms to welcome you
Beware the masked pretender
He always lies, this candyman
Those lips conspire in treachery
To strike in cloak and dagger, see! 

Candyman - oh candyman 
And all the children, he warns ''don't tell,''
Those threats are sold
With their guilt and shame they think they're to blane
For candyman - oh candyman
