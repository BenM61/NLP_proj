Come closer
And maybe you will see me better
So come closer
And take a look at what you've done to me

Tell me who is right
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me I'm no good before I'm gone

Because sometimes it feels like

We're in big big trouble
'Cause I'm about to lose control
We're in big big trouble
You got my system overload
You wanna push me off the edge
Don't do it, don't, don't do it
You're gonna push it too far
Big big trouble

Come get it
Why did you have to punish my romance
Bad habits
You always put the blame on someone else

Tell me who is right
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me I'm no good before I'm gone

You know I'm dangerous
You better run run run
