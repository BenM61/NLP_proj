All of the scrutiny, I feel the eyes fall down upon me
Is it amnesty? Or is it hang me from the gallows?
Committed to the conviction I carry with me
When I'm afraid of my name, I know I'm not free

Turn it up loud
Just to take it all away
Turn it up loud
Yeah just to take it all away
Turn it up loud
Just to take it all away
Try to shut us down but we won't be another casualty
No we won't be another casualty
No we won't be another casualty

Born in the USA
The fear, the guilt, the worry
All the shame and hate
The rat race and the hurry

Turn it up loud
Just to take it all away
Turn it up loud
Yeah just to take it all away
Turn it up loud
Just to take it all away
Try to shut us down but we won't be another casualty
No we won't be another casualty
No we won't be another casualty

Saints and sinners
Traders and thieves
Crooks and killers
Thugs and police

Turn it up loud
Just to take it all away
Turn it up loud
Yeah just to take it all away
Turn it up loud
Just to take it all away
Try to shut us down but we won't be another casualty

Turn it up loud
Just to take it all away
Turn it up loud
Yeah just to take it all away
Try to shut us down but we won't be another casualty
We won't be another casualty
No we won't be another casualty
We won't be another casualty
No we won't be another casualty
