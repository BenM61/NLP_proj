You can't stay home
Dreaming on your own
Wanting love waking up alone
But taking chances on the street
Romance can put you on your knees

Holding on wanting to belong
Needing love making do with none
Taking risks you can't afford
One kiss could knock you off the board

Love is a dangerous game
Sometimes passion fades into pain
Just when you're sure you know the score
You get more than you bargained for
Love's a dangerous game
Be careful how you play
A stranger may try to steal your heart away
Love's a dangerous game
Be careful what you do
All too soon you'll find
You're howling at the moon
Love is a dangerous game

Love is a dangerous game
Sometimes passion fades into pain
Just when you're sure you know the score
You get more than you bargained for

A stranger may try to steal your heart away
Love's a dangerous game
Be careful what you do
All too soon you'll find

Love is a dangerous game

Just when you're sure you know the score
You get more than you bargained for
