If I feel I've had too much,
I'll get off
And then get back
In my car
Which is going to take me
To Paris,
Where I'm going to climb the tower
And enjoy the view
It's going to take me
To Toulouse
From where I'm going to give
You a cheer
It's going to take me
To Marseilles
It's okay there,
It's okay there
But it's not that nice
Unless you're with me
It's not that nice
Unless you're with me
If I feel I've had too much.
I'll dash out
And then blow back
In my car
Which is going to take me
To Provence
Where I will sorely miss you
But I'll maintain my composure
It's not that nice
Unless you're with me
It's not that nice
Unless you're with me
