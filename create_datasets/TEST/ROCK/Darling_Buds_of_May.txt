I burnt the kitchen down
You told me ooh
We've got to get this right,
Right now
Uh oh oh

You tried to shut me up
I told you ooh
We've got to get this right,
Right now
Uh oh oh

And when you walk, and when you walk
I feel better now, I feel better now
And when you walk, and when you walk
I feel so much better now

Because her birthday's in May, in May
It is what it is, it is what it is
Because her birthday's in May, in May
It is what it is, it is what it is

I heard police last night,
Their sirens ooh
We've got to get this right,
Right now
Uh oh oh

They tried to pick me up,
I told them ooh
We've got to get this right,
Right now
Uh oh oh

And when you walk, and when you walk
I feel better now, I feel better now
And when you walk, and when you walk
I feel so much better now

Because her birthday's in May, in May
It is what it is, it is what it is
Her birthday's in May, in May
It is what it is, it is what it is

Because her birthday's in May, in May
It is what it is, it is what it is
Her birthday's in May, in May
It is what it is, it is what it is
