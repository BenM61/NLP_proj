I know you come a long way, baby
But you don't need
That heart of stone, no
To prove that you can
Do it, do it, baby
You can make it on your own

But you can't keep
Running away from love
Cause the first one
Let you down, no, no, no

And though others
Try to satisfy you, baby
With me, true love
Can still be found

Love can still be found
(The second time around) ooh
The second time is
So much better, baby
(The second time around)
And I make it better
Than the first time

You know I really love you
And I paid for my mistakes
Yes, I did, girl
The more I try to
Hide my feelings, baby
This old heart gets in the way

And love won't let me wait
(The second time around)
Girl, believe me
It's better than the first time
(The second time around)
Let's do it one more time

Say it again
(The second time around)
All that I've been through
I'd do it again
Just as long as I'm with you
(The second time around)
Aah, the second time

I'll make it so good to you, baby
I'll make it so good to you

Not like the first time
(Not like the first time)
Not like the first time
(Not like the first time)
Not like the first time
(Not like the first time)
Talking bout the second time

Not like the first time
(Not like the first time)
Not like the first time
(Not like the first time)
Not like the first time
(Not like the first time)
Talking bout the second time

You can't keep running away from love
Cause the first one let you down
And though others try
To satisfy you, baby
With me, true love
Can still be found

(The second time around)
Gonna keep you mine
The second time, baby
(The second time around)
I'll know what to do just
As long as I'm with you

(The second time around)
Do it one more time, say it again
