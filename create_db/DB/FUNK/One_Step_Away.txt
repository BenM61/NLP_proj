I'm one step away from self-destruction 

Yesterday, in a certain section of the Daily Times 
The paper read, you will be wed to a friend of mine. 
But if that's the price I have to pay 
I'll accept the crumbs she throws away 
'Cause I [I] can't spend another day 
of you being away from me dear. 
Oh there [there] must be another way, 
you don't know how I pray, for you here. 
I'm one step away from self-destruction 
[believe me baby] 
Just one step away from self-destruction 
[Hey hey hey hey hey] 

In my vista I cry all lonely tears 
Cause they have seen the happiness we've had through the years 
But now you've gone to another, 
and now we're away from each other. 
Oh I, [I] can't spend another day 
of you being away from me dear 
Oh there [there] must be another way, 
you don't know how I pray, for you here. 
I'm one step away from self-destruction 
[believe me baby] 
Just one step away from self-destruction 
[Hey hey hey hey hey] 
Mmm baby, why did you leave me? 
[leave me, leave me, leave me] 
Ohh baby, why did you deceive me? 
[deceive me, deceive me, deceive me] 

[I] can't spend another day 
of you being away from me dear 
Oh there [there] must be another way, 
you don't know how I pray for you here. 
I'm one step away from self-destruction 
[believe me baby] 
Just one step away from self-destruction 
[Hey hey hey hey hey] 
Oh, one step away from self-destruction 
[believe me baby] 
I'm one step away from self-destruction 
[Hey hey hey hey hey] 
Just one step away from self-destruction 
[believe me baby] 
[fade out]
