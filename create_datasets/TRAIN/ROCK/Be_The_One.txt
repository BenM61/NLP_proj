As I think about the past and all the fun we've had.
We'd eat at Denny's after three and watch the real world on MTV.
And I'd take you to the shows where everybody goes.
I'll tattoo your name on my sleeve.
Cause babe my loves so true.
And you'll be the one I sing this song to.
Cause all I wanna do is share my life with you.
And I'd take you to the coast.
To the places you love the most.
In a chop top caddy on the scene cruising like a limousine.
And we can walk along the sand.
I'll put a ring upon your hand.
It's you and me through eternity cause babe my love's so true.
And you'll be the one I sing this song to.
Cause all I wanna do is share my life with you.
