The brotha's got this complex occupation
The brotha's got this complex occupation
The brotha's got this complex occupation

Me and this baby
Gon' be up all night long
Walkin' this wood flo'
'Till my man gets home
I'm at the front do'
I'm listening by the phone
But I'm gon' be here 
With my make-up on
It's been a long time 
Since my man been gone
But when he get here
You know I won't be gone
Because I love him
Love him strong (N'Dambi)
Me and this baby
Gon' be up all night long

[Chorus 2x]
Because they got the block on lock 
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock 
The block stay hot
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot

[Talking]
What she say?
I said,
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock 
The block stay hot

Got a box of money
That I keep under my bed
But we don't spend it though
Might need it for more Yeyo
We need this money
Just in case we need to
Make a run
Gotta keep the clip in mama's gun
Or run...

We like to keep the car runnin'
We try to keep the bitch hummin'
In case the sweeper boyz are comin'
Runnin' runnin', We like to keep the car runnin'
We try to keep the bitch humin'
In case the sweeper boyz are comin'
Runnin' runnin'

[Chorus 2x]
Because they got the block on lock 
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock 
The block stay hot
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot

Well there ain't no mistaken
That the money you're makin'
Leaves you nervous and shakin'
'Cause at night you're awake and 
Thinkin' bout lives that you've taken
All the love you've forsaken
In yo zone
Niggas gon' get they fuckin' head blown

Danger
You're in danger
No hard feelings right or wrong
Weak or strong, I don't make the laws
In yo zone niggas gon' get they fuckin'
Head blown

[Chorus 2x]
Because they got the block on lock 
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock 
The block stay hot
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot

Might have to flush the Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Yeyo, Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Yeyo, Yeyo

Break!

Your eye, your eye,your eye, your eye,
Your eye, your eye, your eyes [4x]
