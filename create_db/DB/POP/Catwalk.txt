High up above like a cat clings to an icy root
He keeps a slow pace,
Tight hold, anxious view
There's something ticking away inside his head
He's got to keep that vital distance
You can see it in his eyes
That glance across the shoulder

He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk
He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk

He's always on the far side of the street
Never getting too close, too near, might meet
Someone a little too close to himself
You can see it in his eyes
Those eyes are getting older
You can see it in his eyes,
That glance across the shoulder

He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk
He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk

He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk
He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk

He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk
He's on a cat walk
He's got a cat walk
