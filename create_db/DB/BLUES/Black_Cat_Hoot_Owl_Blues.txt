Black cat on my doorstep, black cat on my windowsill
Black cat on my doorstep, black cat on my windowsill
If one black cat don't cross me, another black cat will

It's bad luck if I'm jolly, bad luck if I cry
It's bad luck if I'm jolly, bad luck if I cry
It's bad luck if I stay here, it's still more bad luck if I die

Last night a hootin' owl came and sat right over my door
Last night a hootin' owl came and sat right over my door
A feelin' seems to tell me, I'll never see my man no more

I feel my left eye jumpin', my heart a-bumpin'
I'm on my P's and Q's
I feel my brain a-thumpin', I got no time to lose
Mama's superstitious, tryin' to overcome these blues
