Was in the early evening and the sun was punching into my head
Outside a stockholm cafe at the river's edge we sat and smiled
We said how rich we were and how warm we felt with a cognac heart
Talked over women in a lonely voice and began to jive

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

Was in a scene from "death in the afternoon" when I almost cried
I realized papa wanted me to live in his bull ring life
It made me hungry for peace and it made me wild and tore my heart
It didn't help to wipe away the fears like he often claimed

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

Was in a frenzy from the midnight air when I saw the light
I realized only children can live upon a timeless flight
It made me hungry for youth and it made me sad and made me laugh
To think that as we live and learn we only follow god's path

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time
