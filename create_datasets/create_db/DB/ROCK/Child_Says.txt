Do what you said
You can't change it, listen to me
I said, back to R.O.T.
Born and then you decay
Default, this wasn't meant to be
We star, in all eternity 
Draw from this we say

Child says oo oo
Just another day Oo oo
It's upsetting Oo oo
Effigy

Choose them
Now cut them
Your offspring
You could be
Indifferent
You could be
Their savior
You falter
You drop them
Without them
Don't miss them
Inhuman
Now listen 
To me
Kiss my knuckles

You're done

Beaten down with your oppression made me feel a lesser person and I'll cut you, no compassion execution, done out of fear

You're a traitor my dictator outside sickens inside you die is this what you wanted with me? Welcomed the world of the constant seasons inside my mind mind's eye I die locked down locked down hearts against the gate

Locked down
Locked down
None but the gods would get it
Locked down
Think how much I like to do this

To cut yourself free of the moon
I'm wide awake
But silent in front of me,
Void in front of me,
But silent the enemy thus, I run away from

Do what you said
You can't change it, listen to me
I said, back to R.O.T.
Born and then you decay
Default, this wasn't meant to be
We star, in all eternity 
Draw from this we say

Child says oo oo
Just another day Oo oo
It's upsetting Oo oo
Effigy Oo oo
Just another Oo oo
Day, do what you say
Child say
Just another 

You're a traitor my dictator outside sickens inside you die is this what you wanted with me? Welcomed the world of the constant seasons inside my mind mind's eye I die locked down locked down hearts against the gate
