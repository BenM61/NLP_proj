I'm awake, no I'm not scared
Shouldn't I pull off my head
Fire and ice, all in between
Of this world, and all unseen
No one knows just why we're here
Embrace the doubt and face the fear
It's all about the inner search
To be a hand to gatherer
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh

I awake unto this day, I'm going out to make a change
I've fallen down, and gotten uW
Been searching everywhere for love
I've let it go, welcomed it in
I wear the scars upon my skin
The stroke was real, the force is great
My heart is an adventurer, 
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh

I've tried to make this life my own
To find myself, I've searched alone
'Till I've let go and let it in
I found it burning like a sin
I've worked it out, but learned it hard
It's sad inside and life is out
Till I won't settle down and watch either way
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh
I'm going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
O-oh-oh-oh
