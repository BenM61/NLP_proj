Bells will be ringing the glad glad news.
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues.
My baby's gone. I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again.
Choirs will be singing Silent Night.
Christmas carols by candlelight.
Please come home for Christmas.
Please come home for Christmas.
If not for Christmas, by New Year's Night.

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above,
Because it's Christmastime, my dear.
The time of year to be with the one you love.

Dear, won't you tell me you'll never go wrong.
Christmas and New Year's will find you home.
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and no pain,
'Cause I'll be happy, happy once again.

Mmmmm, no more sorrow, no grief and no pain,
'Cause I'll be happy Christmas once again.
