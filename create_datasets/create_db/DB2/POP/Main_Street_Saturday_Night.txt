See them drivin' by look at them fancy wheels
Headlights winkin' checkin' each other out
The Great American Pastime is still the automobile
Cruisin' on the white line
Is the only way to make time

Down on Main Street Saturday night
Everybody thinks they're so cool
On Main Street
Saturday night
Don't you mess with him (her), 
Daddy, he's (she's) nobody's fool

Look at the blonde haired beauties, givin' it all they got
Maybe if you hit on one, you might luck out
Some of them are foxy some of them are not
But all of them will get down
If the right thing comes around

Here comes Little Willie, higher than a kite
He's been doin' some heavy duty hangin' out
If Willie's got a line on some of the best, it's got to be 
Dynamite
You know you can trust him
If the Law don't bust him
