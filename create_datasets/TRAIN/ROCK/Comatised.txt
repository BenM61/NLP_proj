Two days today 
Don't carry much weight 
But all the stars are here 
And they've made it quite clear 
That I am alive 
So very alive 
Please tread gently 
Ever so friendly 
I'm back from a temperate sea 
Capsize when you comatise 
When you capsize, you're comatised 
By a love that never should have died 
I was up before the dawn 
Like a child on Christmas morn 
And all the blues were in his sky 
Waiting to impress you 
So alive 
So very alive 
Please tread gently 
Ever so friendly 
I'm back from a temperate sea 
Capsize when you comatise 
When you capsize, you're comatised 
By a love that never should have died 
Capsize when you comatise 
When ya hit the tide on the other side 
Please tread gently 
By a love that never should have died
