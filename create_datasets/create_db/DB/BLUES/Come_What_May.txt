Wish I was your child 
Hold me in your heart
We could love so free
And know it never goodbye
But I am not a child 
And wish for star frame
My love
No I never be afraid of who I am 
And who I am not come what may
Wish I was a bird 
I warmed you with my wings
Safe from all the storm
You know what true love can bring
But I am not a bird
And wishes and just fly away
My love
No I never be afraid of who I am
And who I am not come what may
La la la 
La la la
But I am not the voice 
Shinning in your eyes
That you understand
My love
No we never be afraid of who we are
And who were not come what may
No we never be afraid of who we are
And who were not come what may
No we never be afraid of who we are
And who were not come what may
