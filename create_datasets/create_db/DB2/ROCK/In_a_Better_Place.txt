Some are those we never see
Some with me
Otherwise with you
And we don't hear when they speak
Trustingly, with no parachute
A celestial address
This is me
Oh, I hope so
But it really is a mess, honestly
As better places go

Oh, I can't remember when last I slept
For when it comes, it stays
But that I know that we shall find happiness
In a better place
And what are you dressed as?
I'm a race car, see?
I'll get us there fast
Until death occurs
Better hope this will last
We drove through the night
Hey, I was sad it passed
Eight shady stations played us
At last

I am closing my eyes just when I'm supposed to
I am closing my eyes just when I'm supposed to
