After the love shined down on me
All you beautiful people love and you rise, me say
Oh yeah

Beautiful people come down on, right

Me see the sunrise, I wanna get down down down
The tide is rising high, all the way
No raindrop in the sky, no reason to run run run
Watch all these spirits fly, sees the day

Be one generation, join the love foundation
We'll make it all the way to a brighter day now
Feel the desperation every human nation
All around the world go feel it

After the love shined down on me
I see the beautiful sunlight rising above the world
What me say now

After the love shined down on me
All ya beautiful people love and you rise, me say
Oh yeah

Me see the sunrise, I wanna get down down down
