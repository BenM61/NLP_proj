My veins are the roots of this tree
I would die inside if you ever stopped the dreaming

With your breath
Oh, when you breathe
I feel like my eyes took fee

If there's a God
I wonder what she looks like
I bet she looks like you
I bet she looks like you

I wish that life would release the tree
Or you could put me to sleep
Forever and ever
