Know you think you know me better
Standing where you are
But I have tried to tell you
That I don't know where you are
Do you feel bigger?
Do you feel better now?

'Cause I don't feel better now

And all the light we cannot see
I won't ever take it from you now
Take it from you now
And all the light we cannot see
I'm no better, better than you now
I'm no better than you now

Wanna tell you that I understand
But I have never known
How you'd ever ask a hundred times
And watch what hills grow on you
You can realize what you're missing out
And I know

And all the light we cannot see
I won't ever take it from you now
Take it from you now
And all the light we cannot see
I'm no better, better than you now
I'm no better than you now
I'm no better than you now

You can hold it
Like it's nothing
Though it's something to me

You can hold it
Like it's nothing
Though it's something to me

You can hold it
Like it's nothing
Though it's something to me

And hey, you can hold it
Like it's nothing
Though it's something to me

And all the light we cannot see
I won't ever take it from you now
Take it from you now
And all the light we cannot see
I'm no better, better than you now
I'm no better than you now
I'm no better than you now
