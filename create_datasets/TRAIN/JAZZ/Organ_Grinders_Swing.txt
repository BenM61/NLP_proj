Who's that coming down the street?
Good old organ grinder Pete
He's the latest rhythm king
With his organ grinder's swing
Dadya, Pa swings it, so does Ma
Dadya, Ma swings it, so does Pa
Dadya, you swing it, so do I
Dadya, I swing it so do you
 
When he turns that handle down
Music goes around and 'round
Ev'rybody starts to sing 
To that organ grinder's swing
Trala,  Pa swings it, so does Ma
Trala, Ma swings it, so does Pa
Trala, you swing it, so do I
Trala, I swing it so do you
 
All the children tag along
Just to listen to his song
Monkey dancing on a string
To the organ grinder's swing
O-hum, Pa swings it, so does Ma
O-hum, Ma swings it, so does Pa
O-hum, you swing it, so do I
O-hum, I swing it so do you
