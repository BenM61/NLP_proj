Gonna get out my sycamore and shine up my shoes
Meet my baby and tell her the news
I bet my bundle on a swayback nag
And I came home winner with a plenty of swag

One foot, two foot, slew foot, drag
Swing your honey to the Sugarfoot Rag
Dig a little jig with a zig and a zag
And listen to the guitar play the Sugarfoot Rag

I got a big jug of cider and a bottle of wine
One's for and honey and the other is mine
Sip on the cider and sip on the wine
Both sip together and a have a good time

One foot, two foot, slew foot, drag
Gonna spend all my money and a git on a Jag
Swing my honey to the Sugarfoot Rag

Walk right up and stomp on the floor
And swing up the middle with a shoe-fly four

One foot, two foot, slew foot, drag
Swing your honey to the Sugarfoot Rag
Dig a little jig with a zig and a zag
And listen to the guitar play the Sugarfoot Rag
