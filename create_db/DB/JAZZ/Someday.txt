Someday, we'll leave this town
It wears us down
We'll leave somehow
All its harm and all its charms, oh someday

Someday, we'll leave behind
All this time
That has turned sour
Far behind and out of mind, oh someday

Someday, we'll leave this life
Far behind
And fade in time
We'll look down on this sad town, oh someday

Safe from harm
Was it a dream I had?
Was it a dream I had?
When did it turn bad
Oh safe from harm, was it a dream?

Safe from harm
Was it a dream I had?
Was it a dream I had?
When did it turn bad?

Oh safe from harm
Was it a dream I had?
Was it a dream I had?
When did it turn bad?
Oh safe from harm, was it a dream?

Someday we'll leave behind
This sad life
And all it's lies
All its harm and all its charm, oh someday

We shall see with clarity
And we won't look back
