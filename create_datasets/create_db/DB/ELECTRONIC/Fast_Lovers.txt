Oh, some say we are fast lovers
Oh, some say we are fast lovers

Every single morning she dreams about the place
All the better problems were miles away
So, some say we are fast lovers
Now she's fucking happy but struggles every day
Everybody's perfect, but everything is fake
So, some say we are fast lovers
She has many problems, cuts that never show
But everybody loves her when she's doing coke

Oh, some say we are fast lovers
Oh, some say we are fast lovers

Finally got the cover, finally it's a dream
But when the part is over, she's written from the scenes
Nothing makes her happy, oh, nothing is enough, oh
Craving for some candy, to have her keep up

Oh, some say we are fast lovers
Oh, some say we are fast lovers

She has many problems, cuts that never show
But everybody loves her when she's full of coke

Oh, some say we are fast lovers
Oh, some say we are fast lovers

Oh, some say we are fast lovers
Oh, some say we are fast lovers
