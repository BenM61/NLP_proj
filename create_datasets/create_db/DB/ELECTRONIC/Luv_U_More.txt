You can make the sun turn purple 
You can make the sea turn turtle 
But you know you can never make me love you more 

You can turn wine into water 
And sadness into laughter 
But you know you can never make me love you more 

Let the sky fall down 
Let the leaves turn brown 
Still you know you can never make me love you more 

Let the redwoods die 
Let the wells run dry 
Still you know you can never make me love you more 

You can make dew into diamonds 
Or pacify the lions 
But you know you can never make me love you more 

You can make me dance to order 
My sex hung, torn and quartered 
But you know you can never make me love you more 

Let the sky fall down 
Let the leaves turn brown 
Still you know you can never make me love you more 

Let the redwoods die 
Let the wells run dry 
Still you know you can never make me love you more 

Let the sky fall down 
Let the leaves turn brown 
Still you know you can never make me love you more 

Let the redwoods die 
Let the wells run dry 
Still you know you can never make me love you more
