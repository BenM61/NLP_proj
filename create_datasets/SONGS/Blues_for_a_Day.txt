Baby, if you love me
Then show me that you care
Yes, baby, if you love me
Then please show me that you care
Cause every time I need you
You make darn sure that you're not there

Don't drift too far, daddy
Stick around so that you'll be near
Please don't drift too far, daddy
Stick around so that you'll be near
You don't need to go out for anything
Cause I've got everything you need right here

Yes, understandin' is somethin'
That makes everything just fine
Yes, understandin' is somethin'
That makes everything just fine
No, I'll never be contented
Till you say that you are mine
