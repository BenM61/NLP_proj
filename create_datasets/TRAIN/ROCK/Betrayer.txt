This is a song 
which is use to describe what i feel
about people like you
no sense for humanity, no idea about life
this premise has been proved
you used my trust to satisfy your brainless lust
your word isn't worth more than puke in the dust

betrayer
betrayer

misleader, you twisted things to satisfy
deceiver, this greedy lust you can't deny
how could i be so naive to believe all the lies
you so easily told
i think i've learned my lesson too late
the story took time to unfold
now i see your true face
behind your mask, a cheat, a fake
your word isn't worth more than puke in the dust

betrayer
betrayer

ignorant twisted mind, maybe it would help
to think before you speak from time to time
pretend to be a friend of mine
but you would sell your mother if you could 
for less than a dime

intelligence lost, brain deceased,
so you will loose, fall to your knees,
guys like you i cannot stand
maybe i must speak another language before you understand

betrayer
betrayer
