I was lying on the floor
Till I I heard you cry so close
Yes, I was thinking of suicide,suicide.
Your face,there in the mirror
Your sigh,vision in my head
Goin? mad,is there someone else? Someone else?
Is there something more that I can say?

I can say,I can say,I feel you closer
I can say,I can say,is the something more that
I can say,I can say

Are we living on a razor?
Is this predestination?
I?m confusing what is real,what is real
Something,something is controlling
Calling,crawling in my skin
I say,is there someone else?

Is there something more that I can say?

I can say,I can say,I feel you closer
I can say,I can say,is the something more that
I can say,I can say

I feel you-Am I sick?There?s no end,if you believe
Coincidence,destiny,it?s not over
I feel you-Am I sick?There?s no end,if you believe
Coincidence,destiny,it?s not over

Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
I can?t see you

(chorus)

If I have a star
You are protecting me
If I am too blind
It?s just a coincidence
If I live in fera
Your sigh covers me
If I fear to live
I can say
It?s not over
It?s not over
