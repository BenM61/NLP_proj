please don't be angry with me cause i've gone away
i've told you about your mistakes
but you didn't hear a word i said
i'm so tired of worrying
i don't know just what to do
i'm sorry baby
i just can't put up with you

i've tried to please you
but you just wasn't satisfied with me
well i tried to please you
you just wasn't satisfied with me
i've had to do it ever since i met you
now you ought to be free
