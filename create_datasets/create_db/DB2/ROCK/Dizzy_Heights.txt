Fairy lights like the stars
You could be lost but here you are
It's Halloween, on the street
You came looking for me

I'm sealed in tight, through the double glass
Come inside, take off your mask
All the zombies in town
They're all dead to us now
And we can't hear the song they're playing

Smoke drifting up
To the dizzy heights
Where the elevator won't come down
And the ceiling cracks like a treasure map
The mosquito's buzzing round, round, round
Help me make up a new sound

It's alright in my room
The worlds moving at a different pace
Ah the buzz it never stops
If you don't like the groove well call the cops

On Halloween, it's Halloween
And they don't make a sound
'Cause I don't like the song they're playing

Smoke drifting up to the dizzy heights
Where the elevator won't come down,
And the ceiling cracks like a treasure map
Every destination pulls you in, turns you back
The mosquito's buzzing round, round, round

I'm gonna take you up to the dizzy heights
There's a lot more going on
I will take you up to the dizzy heights
I'm better off that way
