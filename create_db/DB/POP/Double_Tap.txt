Betta look betta than yo last one
Babe, I know we don't care
Ain't so famous ova night, yeah
Don't be scared to admit it
Seen you look from the start
Oh, on my Instagram he be lookin'
Secret looks on yo phone, I know

Baby, on the low, you stay on the page 'cause
I guess I'm yo favorite
But you won't let it show, no way
If you like what you see then
You gotta let me know

That you won't double tap that hoe
That you won't double tap that hoe

Go and lemme know about ya (About ya)
Hash tag, sum' to show you're gangsta
Oh no, don't, he no square
Just say it, just say it if ya want me

Baby, on the low, you stay on the page 'cause
I guess I'm yo favorite
But you won't let it show, no way
If you like what you see then
You gotta let me know

That you won't double tap that hoe
That you won't double tap that hoe

Must be a sucka, 'cause I been lookin'
Ya ass gettin' fine with ya big cookie
Niggas know I woulda been takin'
School of hard knots, they was were plain lickin'
I really did it 'cause I say I did it
It's a turn on if a girl say she in the pot
It's a turn on if a girl say she independent
If I ask her, can a home girl come to dinner
People gonna question you if you're a singer or a stripper
Tryna get with you, yo otha nigga inefficient
Well, is it an issue, well, I ain't think it was an issue
'Cause when I get with ya I double tap more than a pistol

Baby, on the low, you stay on the page 'cause
I guess I'm yo favorite
But you won't let it show, no way
If you like what you see then
You gotta let me know

That you won't double tap that hoe
That you won't double tap that hoe
That you won't double tap that hoe
