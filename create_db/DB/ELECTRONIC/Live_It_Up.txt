How can you see looking through those tears?
Don't you know you're worth your weight in gold?
I can't believe that you're alone in here
Let me warm your hands against the cold

A close encounter with a hardhearted man
Who never gave half of what he got
Has made you wish that you'd never been born
That's a shame 'cause you got the lot

Hey yeah, you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for, let's live it up

If you smiled the walls would fall down
On all the people in this pickup joint
But if you laughed you'd level this town
Hey lonely girl, that's just the point

Hey yeah, you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
Hey yeah, you beside the dance floor
What do you cry for, let's live it up

Just answer me the question why
You stand alone by the phone
In the corner and cry

How can you see looking through those tears
Don't you know you're worth your weight in gold
I can't believe you're alone in here
Let me warm your hands against the cold

If you smiled the walls would fall down
On all the people in this pickup joint
But if you laughed you'd level this town
Hey lonely girl, that's just the point

Hey yeah, you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
Hey yeah, you beside the dance floor
Whattya cry for, let's live it up

Let's live it up, live it up, live it up
Hey yeah, you with the sad face
Come up to my place
Come up to my place, baby
