If I speak in the tongues of angels, but have not love 
I'm only a resounding noise 
If I have the gift of knowledge 
And if my faith moves mountains high 
But have not love I am nothing 

Though I know the One 
Who holds the stars in the heavens 
In the palm of His hand 
If I give all I possess 
To the poor and the helpless 
I'll still gain nothing 
Without love 

(Without Love) 

Love's patient 
True love is always kind 
Love does not envy 
Never brags, it's never proud 
Slow to wrath, it keeps no records of wrongs against friends 
Love forgives 
We all could use forgiveness 

Though I know the One who holds (I know the One) 
The stars in the heavens 
In the palm of His hands 
If I give all I possess (All I possess) 
To the poor and the helpless 
I'll still gain nothing (without love) 

oh... OOh... without love... oh 

Love never fails 
Love is true 
Love's the one thing that can always change you 
Love is patient 
Love is kind 
Love's the one reason the world survives 
Love never fails 
Love is true 
Love's the one thing that can always change you 
Love is patient 
Love is kind 
Love's the one reason the world survives 

Though I know the One who holds (I know the One) 
The stars in the heavens 
In the palm of His hands (Oh...) 
If I give all I posses (All I possess) 
To the poor and the helpless 
I'll still gain nothing 
Without Love 

Without Love 
ooh...hey...yeah...
