Baby love, oh, our love, our love
Oh, baby love, oh, our love, our love

Every time I see her face you know my heart drops to my feet
And I would never feel this way if my baby love walks so sweet
Well, I know I'm the envy of every girl
And my baby love is the reason, why you better stop, take a look

Because my baby, my baby love, ooh
I gotta have her love, have her love, ooh
Baby love, ooh, I gotta have a love

A kiss for marriage, like a breathless breeze
When I'm with her I don't need anything
Want her with me all the time, 'cause my baby love, she got my mind
She's got my nose open wide and I'm gonna keep her by my side as done
(Oh, baby love, ooh, baby love, oh baby love, oh baby)

Oh, baby love, oh, our love, our love
Oh, baby love, oh, our love, our love

She can just call my name and my heart will light a glow
The reason that I feel this way is because I love her so
And it is all so plain to see that she was just meant for me
Stop, there she goes again, now

Baby love, ooh, I gotta have her love, got to have her love
Baby love, ooh, I gotta have her love
That's my baby love, ooh, I got to have her love
Baby love
