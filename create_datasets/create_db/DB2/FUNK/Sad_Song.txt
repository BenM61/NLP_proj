Let that sad song play just one more time
There's nothing I could say that would help me find
The reason why I'm left behind
With no one to care, no one to share
The misery that I've brought upon myself
I'm so lonely & I'm so blue, yeah

So let that sad song play just one more time
There's nothing I could say that could ease my mind
I know I was wrong, but I wish he would come back home
I could still feel his touch, I need it so much
I'm so lonely & I'm so blue, yeah

Why don't you, why don't you, why don't you
Why don't you
Let that sad song play just one more time
There's nothing I could say that would ease my mind
I know I was wrong, but I wish he would come back home
I could still feel his touch, I need it so much
I'm so lonely & I'm so blue, yeah
Oh why don't you, why don't you, why don't you play that
Sad song one more time
& fade
