Times are changing and I'm changing too
A new direction and this nasty groove
Gets me over in a funky way

This time make it funky
Make it funky this time

This time make it funky
Drop the bass and make it funky
I'm steady moving I want
This world to know, 
Just what I'm doing, 
I've got to take control
Made my mind to come back
Hard this time

Yo, Tracie
What
Tell 'em what's on your mind

This time make it funky
Make it funky this time
