Don't keep on saying it's too late
That you know right from wrong
I'm holding on to what you gave me
While you push me to move on
We know we're fooling ourselves
So you put your mind at ease
Knowing that we can't do it again
While I keep on begging you please

Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love
Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love

Got me pacing the floor at night
About to walk an extra mile
Keeping me here for all your own reasons
I can see it in your smile
Emotions taking over now
Asking you to come home
Reminded you about happiness
No one wants to be alone

Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love
Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love
Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love
In and out of love
Don't leave me
In and out of love

Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love
Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love
Don't leave me hanging on
In and out of love
In and out of love
Don't leave me
In and out of love
