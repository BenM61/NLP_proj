In an April dream
Once she came to me
When you smiled I looked into your eyes
And I knew I'd be loving you

And then you touched my hand
And I learned April dreams can come true
Oh are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us

If we're just April fools
I don't care, true love has found us now
Little did we know
Where the road would lead

Here we are a million miles away from the past
Travelin' so fast now
There's no turning back
If our sweet April dream doesn't last

Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us
If we're just April fools
I don't care, we'll find our way somehow

No need to be afraid
True love has found us now
