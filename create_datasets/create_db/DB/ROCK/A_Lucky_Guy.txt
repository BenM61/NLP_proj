Oh, he's a lucky guy
Oh, he's a lucky guy
He doesn't worry about me
When I'm gone
He goes to sleep at night
He don't turn off the light
And wonder how to find me
Or if I'm alone

Oh, he's a lucky guy
I wish I was like him
Cause when he talks about me
He don't look this way
He's a lucky guy

He used to walk with me
He used to talk to me
See, we have these secrets
That no one else could hear
Well, he's not the only one
No, no not the only one
But what happens to them?

Do they matter?
Do they disappear
Into a lonely girl?
Now I'm a lonely girl
Cause I want somebody with me in the world
Oh, he's a lucky guy

Fortune walks right in the door
And here I am
Just like before

Well, I'm not gonna turn around
I'm not his pretty clown
I'm not the one caught
Like he thought
He was the last one I had there
Cause I did a foolish thing
A real, real stupid thing

I told him I love him
And I want him there
When I knew he wouldn't come

And I knew he didn't care
And I'll cry awhile
I'll cry awhile
But when I wake up
Tomorrow is a new day
I'm a lucky guy
Hey, I'm a lucky guy
Real, real lucky guy
Hey, I'm a lucky guy
