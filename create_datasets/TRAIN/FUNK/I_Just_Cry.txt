I Just Cry

Sleepless nights
A worried mind
she treat my so unkind
And I just cry

Cry cry cry 
All the time
All the time
All the folks

All my friends
Sayin' nothin' but the same
And I just cry
Cry cry cry

All the time
All the time
Can't get her off my mind
She keep me worried all the time

I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna try to forget about you
'Cause I can't go on
Can't go on

And I'm tired of been alone
And I just cry
Cry cry cry
All the time

All the time
I just cry
Cry cry cry
All the time

All the time
I just cry
Cry cry cry
