So, now my time has come.
I will be dead and gone
from the earth's face.
It is my destiny,
this time I cannot cannot hide
from this cruel fate.

A never ending memory,
a life before my eyes.
Whatever comes, whatever's been,
my pocket full of lies.

Like an arrow in the air,
falling endlessly and I know we're gonna be

Higher than the sky, we're
higher than the sky.

An ordinary flight,
who could imagine this
will be our death cell.

No miracle in sight,
We're diving faster now,
as for as I can tell.
I see the faces passing by,
there's fear inside this eyes.

They all will be my company
we're brothers now for life.

Like an arrow in the air,
falling endlessly and I know we're gonna be

Higher than the sky, we're
higher than the sky.
