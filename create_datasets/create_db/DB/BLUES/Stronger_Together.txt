You know I'll always be the friend that
You can call when nobody else'll call back
With the key under the doormat
When there's nowhere else to go
But you already knew that
I can see you when you're hiding
And I can hear you even louder
When you're quiet
I'm here to help you fight it
Remember, remember

When you feel the weight of the world
It's weighing on me, weighing on me
When it's raining you
It's raining on me, raining on me
I'll be leaning on you while
You're leaning on me, leaning on me
There's no way to say it better
We're stronger together
We're stronger together

With trouble dancing all around me
Couldn't find my rhythm
You were the backbeat
'Steada driving from the back seat
You were shotgun sitting right beside me
And when I'm falling over my feet
Lost in the dark you're the light
When I can't see
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you, without you

And when you feel the weight of the world
It's weighing on me, weighing on me
When it's raining you
It's raining on me, raining on me
I'll be leaning on you while
You're leaning on me, leaning on me
There's no way to say it better
We're stronger together
We're stronger together

When you feel the weight of the world
It's weighing on me, weighing on me
When it's raining you
It's raining on me, you know it is
I'll be leaning on you while
You're leaning on me, leaning on me
There's no way to say it better
We're stronger together, woo, oh yeah
We're stronger together, yeah

If you ever need a helping hand
You know where to call, yeah
'Cause we're stronger together
You can always stand on me, yeah, whee
You got to call me, just call me
Just, just call me, yeah
