Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Every now and then when I see you
There seems to be no measure of time
I can't make you feel the way that I do
Still I won't be giving up on you

Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Every now and then when I see you
There seems to be no measure of time
I can't make you feel the way that I do
Still I won't be giving up on you

Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

My feelings run deeper and meet the eye

Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 

Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless 
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless
