I'm coming back to you
Just like before
I've been a lonely boy
Since I walked out your door
If there's a life for us,
I don't know
But I can't live like this
Anymore

The time I spend alone has nothing to give
It's repetition
I'm coming back to you
Repetition
The only thing I can do

I'm coming back to you
This time to stay
If I've learned one thing
It's that I can't stay away

The time I spend alone has nothing to give
The life I lead alone has nowhere to live
It's repetition
I'm coming back to you
Repetition
The only thing I can do

And I can still recall
How you would hold me
The way a vast wave
Broke so slowly

It's repetition
I'm coming back to you
Repetition
The only thing I can do
Repetition
And we can see this through
It's repetition
I'm coming back to you
