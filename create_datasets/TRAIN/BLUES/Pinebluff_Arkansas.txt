Whoo, well, I got a little woman in Pinebluff, Arkansas,
She was the sweetest little woman that your men most ever saw.

Gonna get up in the mornin, baby, with the risin sun,
Whoo well, in the mornin, baby, with the risin sun,
If this train don't run, gonna be some walkin done.

My baby she's callin me, she called me up on the phone,
Whoo well, she's callin me, she called me up on the phone,
She said, "Daddy, daddy, I don't jive, come on hurry home."

My baby says, "I'm tired goin to bed and moan."
Ooo well, she says, "Tired of goin to bed and moan."
She said, "I ain't had no lovin, daddy, daddy, since that you been gone."

Well, she says, "I'm tired, daddy, singin to you lonesome songs."
Ooo well, she says, "I'm tired of singin to you lonesome songs."
She says, "I ain't even here, daddy, I ain't even here anymore."

My baby says, "I'm tired, daddy, hearin my bedsprings groan."
Ooo, well, she says, "I'm tired a-hearin my bedsprings groan."
She said, "I declare if you want me, daddy, you better hurry on."
