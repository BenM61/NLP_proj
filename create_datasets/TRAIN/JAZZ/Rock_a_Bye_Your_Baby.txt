Mammy mine
Your little rollin' stone that rolled away
Strolled away
Mammy mine
Your rollin' stone is rollin' home today
There to stay
Just to see your smilin' face
Smile a welcome sign
When I'm in your fond embrace
Listen, Mammy mine

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon Line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya
"Weep No More My Lady," sing that song again for me
And "Old Black Joe" just as though you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing "The Swanee River"
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye-baby with a Dixie melody

Any time
I hear a mammy sing her babe to sleep
Slumber deep
That's the time
The shadows 'round my heart begin to creep
And I weep
Wonder why I went away
What a fool I've been
Take me back to yesterday
In your arms again

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon Line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya
"Weep No More My Lady," sing that song again for me
And "Old Black Joe" just as though you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing "The Swanee River"
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye-baby with a Dixie melody
