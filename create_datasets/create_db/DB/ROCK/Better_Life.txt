All this trouble that I know
Every swing I take and stone I throw
All the bridges that I've burnt
All the new ways that I hurt

You gave up and I lost track
When you love someone who don't love back
It don't matter who's at fault
Nothing matters now at all

I might have said too much
I might have said too much
I won't forget your touch
I'm saying too much

A better life is waiting

And what is done is done
Piece together what's been broken
Can you ever give up someone
A better life, a better life is waiting

All this fire in my veins
From a heart that's trapped in my ribcage
Burning through my fingertips
Burning everything I kiss

All the memories that you live in
Are just another door that I'm closing
In a hall that's infinite
But at least I can admit it

I might have said too much
I might have said too much
I won't forget your touch
I'm saying too much

A better life is waiting

And what is done is done
Piece together what's been broken
Can you ever give up someone
A better life, a better life is waiting

Oh, I know
I'm saying too much
