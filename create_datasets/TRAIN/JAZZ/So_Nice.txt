Someone to hold me tight 
That would be very nice 
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice 
Someone to understand 
Each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand
And be a team with me

So nice, life would be so nice 
If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong 
Someone to sing to me 
Some little samba song 
Someone to take my heart 
And give his heart to me 
Someone who's ready to 
Give love a start with me

Oh yeah, that would be so nice
I could see you and me, that would be nice
