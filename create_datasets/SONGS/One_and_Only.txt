Don't want much, 
Just a hand to hold to give me grace growin' old as I slow down 
Midnight touch 
To say "You'll be all right, you're gonna make it through the night for the go-round." 
Watchin' what you've been doin' 
Reminding me of that lady I once knew 
I'm lookin' for a lover that's worth pursuin' 
Honey could it be you? Could it be you? 

Darlin, darlin', darlin, darlin, a little closer 
Can't you see that I'm lonely? 
Oh my lover, lover, please discover, a little bit more 
You might be my one and only 

Don't ask much 
Just a hand to hold and understand growin' old as I slow on down 
Midnight touch 
To say "You'll be all right, you're gonna make it through the night for another round." 
Thinkin' 'bout things you been sayin' 
Reminding me of that lady I once knew 
I'm lookin' for a lover that's worth pursuin' 
Honey could it be you? Could it be you? 

Darlin, darlin', darlin, darlin, a little closer 
Can't you see that I'm lonely? 
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely 
Oh my lover, lover, please discover, a little bit more 
You might be my one and only
