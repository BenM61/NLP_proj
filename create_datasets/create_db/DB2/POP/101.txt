4 EVERY NIGHT THAT U'VE BEEN GONE I'VE LIT A CANDLE
THERE MUST BE 99 AROUND MY BED
AROUND MY BED
LYING AWAKE ALL NIGHT LONG TEARS IN VAIN
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT I'D BE BETTER OFF DEAD
BEING WITHOUT YOU IS MURDER BABY

GET IN A TAXI, SUBWAY TRAIN
DON'T MAKE ME CRY THESE TEARS IN VAIN, BABY
A HUNDRED NIGHTS WITHOUT U IS MURDER BABY
A 101 JUST WON'T DO, NO!

WHY DO I CRY 4 U
U PROBABLY FOUND SOMEONE NEW
AND NO ONE DESERVES YA
I SAY, NO ONE DESERVES YA LIKE I DO
BABY U KNOW IT'S TRUE
OOH, WHAT WE HAD U SAID WAS MEANT 2 BE
IF THAT WAS TRUE TELL ME WHY'D U LEAVE
BABY, I WANNA KNOW
I'M SICK OF, I'M SICK OF, I'M SICK OF
CRYING THESE TEARS IN VAIN BABY

WHY DON'T CHA GET IN A TAXI, SUBWAY TRAIN
I'M GOING MAD BABY
I'M GOING INSANE BABY DON'T CHA KNOW
101 JUST WON'T DO

MY GIRLFRIENDS BORE ME
THEY TRY TO PLEASE ME BUT I NEED U BABY
U AND ME NEED 2 BE TOGETHER
TOGETHER PHYSICALLY
WHY CAN'T YOU COME SEE ABOUT ME?
WHY CAN'T YOU COME SEE ABOUT ME?

U'VE GOT 2 GET IN A TAXI
SUBWAY TRAIN
DON'T MAKE ME CRY THESE TEARS IN VAIN, BABY
A HUNDRED NIGHTS WITHOUT U IS MURDER BABY
A 101 JUST WON'T DO, NO!
