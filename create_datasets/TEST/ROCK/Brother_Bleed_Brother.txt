Hasten not the sinner, 
A mold of ugliness thrown into the fire.
Brother bleed brother,
What have you done my son with your desire?

I'll hold my breath, until the end.
A prayer for us to make it through.
I'll hold my breath

Miles of conviction to carry the weight of all your own mistakes.
Open your eyes, 
In the end of everything, everything dies.
And I die for you, and I die.
And I die for you, and I die.

Sifting seasons through the sand. (Time moves so slowly)
Spitting treason in your hand. (You won't hear me)
Sifting seasons through the sand. (Time moves so slowly)
Spitting treason in your hand. (Ah... You won't hear me)

I'll hold my breath, until the end
A prayer for us to make it through.
I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath,
I'll hold my breath
