Working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time when you're free
From all the trouble you're in

In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel is fine
But you go all the way to being brutal

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town

Let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging style for running miles
You're running miles in some boy's jumper

Boo to the business world!
You know a girl who's tax free
On her back and making plenty cash
While you are working for the joy of giving

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
And you hope that they will see

You are in two minds
Tossing a coin to decide
Whether you should tell your folks
About a dose of thrush you got
When were licking railings

But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame
From all those prying eyes

Lazy Jane, all the time
Painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town
You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see
