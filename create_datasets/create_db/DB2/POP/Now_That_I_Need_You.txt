Where are you, now that I want you
Now that I want you so badly I could cry
Where are you, where did fate lead you
Funny how I dreamed you'd still be standin' by

I had you at my beck and call
I called you anytime at all
I guess I took too much for granted
I never thought I'd lie awake and sigh

Where are you, now that I need you
Now that I love you so madly I could die

 I had you at my beck and call
I called you anytime at all
I guess I took too much for granted
I never thought I'd lie awake and sigh

Where are you, now that I need you
Now that I love you so madly I could die

Where are you, baby, now that I need you
So madly that I could die
