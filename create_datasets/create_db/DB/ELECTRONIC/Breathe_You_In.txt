Welcome to the beat baby
Step into my room
Tell me how you feel
When sinking to the mood

If you want to be the reason
I can be the answer
We can stand together, baby
Walk the world together

Let the rhythm take you
Where you want to go
Listen to the melody
Let it take control

If you wanna be the reason
I can be the answer
We can stand together, baby
Walk the world forever

I want to feel you
I want to taste the world we've found
I want to feel you
I want to breathe you in right now

Give yourself to me, baby
Listen to a song
Let the music take us
As we move along

If you wanna be the reason
I can be the answer
We can stand together, baby
Walk the world together

It's driving
('Round)
('Round)
Don't stop

I want to feel you
I want to taste the world we've found
I want to feel you
I want to breathe you in right now

I want to feel you
I want to taste the world we've found
I want to feel you
I want to breathe you in right now

With you
In my life
We can find
The world together

With you
In my life
We can find
The world together

The world together
The world together
The world together
Find the world together

I want to feel you
I want to taste the world we've found
I want to feel you
I want to breathe you in right now

I want to feel you
I want to taste the world we've found
I want to feel you
I want to breathe you in right now

Feel you
Breathe you in
Feel you
Breathe you in

Feel you
(It's driving)
('Round)
('Round)
Don't stop

Breathe you in
(It's driving)
('Round)
('Round)

Feel you
(It's driving)
('Round)
('Round)
(Don't stop)

Breathe you in
(It's driving)
('Round)
('Round)
(Don't stop)
