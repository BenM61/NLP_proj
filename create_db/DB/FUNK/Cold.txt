I'm eating crow babe
I had to go and think that I could be more best
Left alone then with you next, it develops none the less
Hell hath no fury than the flurry of your snow
Global warming ain't got nothing on this chick she's not to play with
You can't just leave this, you can't just think that you can quit this
She'll make you regret this, she's on top and she means business
As God as my witness, my summer's gone frigid, my summer's gone frigid
I know you can hear this

How can you be so cold, how can you be so cold
Good God the girl's gone home: oh my the girl's gone cold
How can you be so cold, how can you be so cold
I'm on freeze fo' sho, oh Lord, you're so cold
So cold, so cold

Tell me baby why I can't believe, yeah
Something as good as you could ever love me
Lighter than air you felt like a ton of bricks
You dropped out from the sky filled with mercy

How can you be so cold, how can you be so cold
Good God the girl's gone cold, oh my the girl's gone home

God bless you baby, oh you're too good to me
Too good to be anything the mortal man can call on
Do it baby, do it baby

How can you be so cold, how can you be so cold
Good God the girl's gone home, oh my the girl's gone cold
How can you be so cold, how can you be so cold
I'm on freeze fo' sho, oh Lord, you're so cold
So cold, so cold

So cold, so cold
Oh Lord it you're so cold
So cold, so cold
