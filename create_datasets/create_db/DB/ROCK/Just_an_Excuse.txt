Why do you feel you'd be happy somewhere else?
Why do you feel you're missing out all the time?
Oh, if it hadn't been for your wife and children
You say you'd be off

Or is it just an excuse?
Or is it just an excuse not to stay here?

You're gonna leave, I don't believe it
You say you don't need me no more, I bet you're afraid to go
You say I tie you down, you've had enough of this town
Ad of fairweather friends

Or is that just an excuse?
Or is that just an excuse not to stay here?

You should reconsider
If the grass is greener, my dear
I left the door open
But you prefer to stay here, holding me near
You prefer to stay here, holding me near

Why do you feel I'm competing with you?
You know it's not fair because it isn't true
If you must find yourself not in material wealth
I think you've found it

Oh, but it's just an excuse
Yes, it's just an excuse
Yes, it's just an excuse not to stay here
