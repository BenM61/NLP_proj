Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance to love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance to love you

So open the door and calm down
Can't you see that I'm trying

Don't say another word about the other boy
Can't you see that I'm dying
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see, see
These hands will come around
You'll love their touch again
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see, see

Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance to love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance to love you

So open the door and calm down
Can't you see that I'm trying

Don't say another word about the other boy
Can't you see that I'm dying
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see, see
These hands will come around
You'll love their touch again
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see, see

Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance to love you

This time things will be different
And you're gonna see
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see, see
These hands will come around
You'll love their touch again
This time things will be different
And you're gonna see, see
