Oh Corinne
I've got a pain in my heart
I think it's because of you
'Cause they kicked me out of the forces
When I laid a hand on you

Oh Corinne
I'd take this pain in my heart
For just one night with you
If they'd let me back in the forces
And I could lay my hand on you

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I-I-I-I I've got my heart tied up,
I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time 

I've got my heart tied up,
I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time 

I've got my heart tied up,
I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time 

I've got my heart tied up,
I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time 

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I've got my heart tied up
Now with the boom and the bang
I'm not gonna fire you again
