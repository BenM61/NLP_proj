See this here
This is crucial
Yeah

This is an emergency
They shot down in the door
They did it cause they paid a fee
Now there's nothing to die for
All the kids from miles around
Are fools in paradise
Don't know about the firing sound
So this scene isn't I saw

Come in bat me fly away
Ja ja come and Zoe I like see another day
All I think about if I were just to run away
Will I come back to love you now?

I don't want to change the world
I only want to stop pretending

What you say? Come again
What you say? Come again now

Nothing left to the little bird
I only hope you're all ascending high

What you say? Come again
What you say? Come again now

All around my home town
They try to chop me down
But the truth shall not forsake me
Take me up to higher grounds

And ooohh-hoooo
You're the light when the feeling is dark
You're pretending the game is a rule
Because you're born and you're dying my heart

I don't want to change the world
I only want to stop pretending

What you say? Come again
What you say? Come again now

I will never let you down
I'll be right here beside you, hanging around
So if you think you let me down
You leave me here in silence, without a sound

Change words
Ch-change verse
We change verbs

Cause why would I change when there's no one to play the time?
