Back when we started
Before we parted
I would wonder what would make her stay
You were left thinking
As if my drinking was the only thing that drove her away
Was it ambition? or war of attrition?
Honey, you could always take it out?
Now I know beyond the shadow of a doubt, its my fault.

Got me thinking, what it might be like to be alone for a while,
Or alone for just one night

I share my feelings
You'd hit the ceiling
I couldn't shake it if I tried
You were my lover
Only to discover, something inside of me had died
Was it ambition? or war of attrition?
Honey, you could always take it out?
Now I know beyond the shadow of a doubt, its my fault.

Got me thinking, what it might be like to be alone for a while,
Or alone for just one night
