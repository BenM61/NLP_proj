I can feel in my body
Chains on me are breakin' loose

I can feel in my body
Standin' tall I make the moves

With the sun kissing my face
There's no way that I can lose

And the thing that I crave your embrace
You're the one that's being you

I hear you say
I cant let you leave my life like this
I hear you say
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave

Either way that I
Cant keep feelin' the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Either way that I
Cant keep feelin' the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Gotta let this go
Gotta field tomorrow
On my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Gotta let this go
Gotta field tomorrow
On my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

I can feel in my body
Free from all the things you were
I can feel in my body
Show me the way
Show me the way

I hear you say
I can't let you leave my life like this
I hear you say
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave

Either way that I
Cant keep feelin' the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Either way that I
Cant keep feelin' the pain of your touch
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Gotta let this go
Gotta field tomorrow
On my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'

Gotta let this go
Gotta field tomorrow
On my own
Your touch keeps on hurtin'
Hurting this way
