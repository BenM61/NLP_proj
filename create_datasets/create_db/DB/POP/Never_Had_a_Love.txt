There's been a hundred if there's been one, whoa, oh,
And they've all been nice for a while, uh huh, yea
But then one day, I call on you
And I got to let ya know
That there's a feeling inside that I can't explain
But id like to let it go

Cause I've never had a love like this
No I never had a love like this
And I can't explain the way it feels but it feels right, yea

Infatuation usually wears off soon, whoa, 
And then you split and go on your way, yea,
But this has been going on for too long
To be just another fling
And I could wait between two nighters to say that I don't care
But that doesn't really mean a thing

Cause I've never had a love like this
No I never had a love like this
And I can't explain the way it feels but it feels right, yea

No I never had a love like this
No I never had a love like this
And I can't explain the way it feels but it feels right yea

I tried to make a love work out, yea,
Well I guess it wasn't supposed to happen then
Or I didn't find out how
Or the feelings weren't just broken in
Well I know were working now

Cause I've never had a love like this
No I never had a love like this
And I can't explain the way it feels but it feels right, yea

No I never had a love like this
No I never had a love like this
And I can't epxlain the way it feels but it feels right, yea
