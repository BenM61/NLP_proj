You are the love of my life 
That's what you are to me 
You are the love of my life 
That's what you mean to me 

With my heart going boom boom 
Your love is driving me to ruin. 

Strong love is just too much for my heart 
Strong love is just too much for my heart 

Oh won't you kiss me again 
You sure know what you're doing 
Oh won't you kiss me again 
Don't you stop what you're doing 

There's something I just gotta say 
I can't keep it up every day 
With my heart going boom boom 
Your love is driving me to ruin.
