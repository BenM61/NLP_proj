Please, mom
You ground me all the time
I know that I was right
All along

And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did
Just having fun

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

Shit, dad
Please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed
At least one time

Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends
It's been awhile
Since I have used that line

You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before

(Alright)

Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
