[INTRO:]
Put your hand on your heart and tell me
That we're through, ooh
Oh, put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

[1:]
Well it's one thing 2 fall in love
But another 2 make it last
I thought that we were just beginning
And now you say we're in the past
Oh, look me in the eye
And tell me we are really through

You know it's one thing 2 say you love me
But another 2 mean it from the heart
And if you don't intend 2 see it through
Why did we ever start
Oh, I want to hear you tell me
you don't want my love

[CHORUS:]
Put your hand on your heart and tell me
It's all over
I won't believe it till you
Put your hand on your heart and tell me
That we're through, ooh

Oh, put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

[2:]
They like 2 talk about 4 ever
But most people never get the chance
Do you want to lose our love 2gether
Do you find a new romance
Oh, I want to hear you tell me
you don't want my love

[CHORUS:]

[CHORUS:]

Oh, put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

(Hand on your heart)
Hand on your heart
(Hand on your heart)
Hand on your heart

Oh, look me in the eye
And tell me we are really through

[CHORUS:]
(repeat & fade)
