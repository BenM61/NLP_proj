My heart has found a home now
My lips know where to rest
My heart has found a home now
A home that suits it best
My eyes know who to see now
One side my whole life through
My eyes know what to see now
For they see only you
They say home is where the heart is
Where the heart is love endures
And the very nicest part is
My heart's at home with yours
I know I'll never roam now
I'm glad to tow the line
My heart has found a home now
And what it so divine
Your heart's at home with mine
My heart has found a home now
And what it so divine
Your heart's at home with mine
