Go away little boy
Go away little boy
I'm not supposed to be alone with you
I know that your lips are sweet
But our lips must never meet
We're not grown up enough you know that it's true

Oh go away little boy
Go away little boy
It's hurting me more
Each minute that we delay
When you're much too near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away little boy
Before I beg you to stay

Go away little boy
Go away little boy
It's hurting me more
Each minute that we delay
When you're much too near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away little boy
Let's call it a day little boy
Please go away little boy
Before I beg you to stay
Go away little boy
Go away little boy
Go away little boy
Go away little boy
