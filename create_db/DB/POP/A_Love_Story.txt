Honey I told you
That these things never last
And one of these days now
You`ll start dreaming of the past

When life was once too short for all the things we`d do and the shots we`d call
And endless summer without a fall
When promises were meant to keep
And nighttime wasn`t meant for sleep
A love story at it`s peak

Doesn`t it feel good
To know that you`ve been loved
And doesn`t it make you
Laugh when you think of

The day when we all got lost on the old mans farm
Just trying to get across 
It was only then I knew what love was
Sunday mornings that never ended and hangovers that never mended
A love story at it`s peak
