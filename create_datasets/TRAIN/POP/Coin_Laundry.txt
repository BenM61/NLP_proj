There I was sitting on the top of the world
In a coin laundry
Well I could have been royalty
Sitting in the palace like a queen

Do you have a dollar?
Do you have a dollar for me?
Have you got a house on a hill
And a bed for three?
Do you have a story
Do you have a story for me?
Do you know the one where
We'll all live happily

Do you, do you
Do you, do you

So now I'm here sitting on the edge
Throwing these stones to the long lost friends
I could have been a common thief
Sitting in the dirt quite happily

Do you have a dollar?
Do you have a dollar for me?
Maybe just an hour or two
And a pot of tea
Have you got a memory
Have you got a memory for me?
Tell me about the days when
You were seventeen

Do you, do you
Do you, do you

Do you have a dollar?
Do you have a dollar for me?
Have you got a little old house
And a lemon tree?
Do you have a reason?
Do you have a reason for me?
Can I be the girl that you met
In a coin laundry?

Can I be the girl that you met
Can I be the girl that you met
Can I be the girl that you met
In the coin laundry?

Can I be the girl that you met
Can I be the girl that you met
Can I be the girl that you met
In the coin laundry?
