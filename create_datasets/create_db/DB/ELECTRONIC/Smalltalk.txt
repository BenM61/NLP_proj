Stop with the small talk
Won't you
Don't wanna feed the nightmare

Sharp memory talks
I hear around the room
Don't wanna hear no more
Hear no more from you

Stop with the small talk
Won't you
I don't wanna hear the nightmare

Sharp memory talks
I hear around the room
Don't wanna hear no more
Hear no more from you

And you no longer seem to cope
With what you ask for

But if you haven't gone back
How can you start again

This south island
Is thorn apart
But I'm stuck in it
For this time

When I breath
Does it show that the more I learn
The less I know

Is not enough to crawl back
Because you have to realize
That if you choose to start again
You gonna leave me mid-air

And you no longer seem to cope
With what you ask for

And you no longer seem to cope
With what you ask for

Stop with the small talk
Won't you
Don't wanna feed the nightmare

Sharp memory talks
I hear around the room
Don't wanna hear no more
Hear no more from you

And you no longer seem to cope
With what you ask for

And you no longer seem to cope
With what you ask for

This south island
Is thorn apart
But I'm stuck in it
For this time

When I breath
Does it show that the more I learn
The less I know
