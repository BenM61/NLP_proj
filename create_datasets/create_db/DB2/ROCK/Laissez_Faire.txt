Money for cigarettes
Pennies for wine
Don't let them take that away bud
It's all I have to call mine
Listen buddy that's all I have to call mine

I've got no overhead
No taxes to pay
I've just got one roll away bed
That they want to roll away

Sure I've heard what they're saying
Share the wealth
Ah that's what they're saying
But I don't believe it
The government takes all the cash
And eats it or something
So the rich get richer
And the poor get nothing

So leave me my
Money for cigarettes
Pennies for wine
Don't let them take that away bud
It's all I have to call mine
Listen buddy that s all I have to call mine
But buddy it's just enough to call mine
