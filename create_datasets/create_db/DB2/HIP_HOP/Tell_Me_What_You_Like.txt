Tell me baby, what do you want, ooh
Just tell me what you like

Midnight candlelight
You and I
Promised to share love for life
But I must have been a fool
'Cause me and you
Don't talk the way we used to
I just need to know
I'm in need of an explanation
'Cause I know that we still can make it right
With no words love is complication
Do you love me baby

Just tell me what you like
What you want
Tell me what you like now
Tell me what you like
What you need
Tell me what you like baby

Remember when we played
Run through the rain
Love was laughter love was right
I never shed a tear
When you were near
Passion was never ending yeah
Then you hurt me so
But I feel only pure compassion
'Cause I know that we still can make it right
With no words love is complication
Do you love me baby

Tell me what you like
You know and I know we can make it
Give me a reason just tell me what you like
I don't want us to put our trust into time
I just need to know

Tell me baby, what do you want
Ooh, got to tell me
I need to know
Tell me now
Tell me baby what do you need
Ooh, got to tell me

Just tell me what you like
What you want
Tell me what you like now
Tell me what you like
What you need
Tell me what you like baby
