Add a little sugar, honeysuckle
And a great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss
With a dozen roses
Such will astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
It is true, the makings of you
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so
You're second to none
The love of all mankind
Should reflect some sign of these words
I've tried to recite
They're close but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Reciting the makings of you

The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so
You're second to none
The love of all mankind
Should reflect some sign of these words
I've tried to recite
They're close but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Reciting the makings of you
