What brought us to this
What brought us to life
What brought us to the here and now
This trouble in time

What brought us to this
What brought us to mind
What brought us to the now and then
This trouble in time

You know you're sick you play your power games
I know you're not beyond the blame
You know you lie and then deny
You know you're throwing your love, our love away
You know you're turning you turn your heart away
You know you've fallen in love with deepest lies

You know you're pushing you push your luck again
You know you're twisted you twist the knife again
You know I'll save my pain for the darkest night
We know there's nothing we know the past is gone
I realize you're not the only one
I'll take my time the future's bright
