Ooh, doin' the ride on
Uhh, uhh, doin' the ride on
Put a hump in your back
Shake your sacroiliac
And ride on
Let's take a ride

Ride on
Baby do the ride on

It ain't what you know, it's what you feel
Don't worry about being right, just be for real
We're gonna do it to the max, when we do it
We're gonna do it, do it good, when we do it

Put a hump in your back
Shake your sacroiliac
And ride on
