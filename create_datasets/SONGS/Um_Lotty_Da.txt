There's a place that I know 
Where I wanna go 
Where we'll all have a good time tonight 
Let me take you there 
'Cause I wanna share 
That same ol' um-lotty-da tonight 

Let me try to sing 
Um-lotty-dotty hey, um-lotty-dotty 
Come on with me tonight 
Let me take you there 
'Cause I wanna share 
That same ol' um-lotty-da tonight 
Let me hear you sing 

Um-lotty-dotty hey 
Um-lotty-dotty, Um-lotty-da tonight 
Um-lotty-dotty 
Um-lotty-dotty 
Um-lotty-da, tonight 

So come on with me tonight 
Cause I know what you'd really like 
Let me take you there 
Cause I wanna share 
That same ol' um-lotty-da tonight 

Now there's a place that I know 
Where I wanna go 
Where we'll all have a good time, tonight 
Let me take you there, cause I wanna share 
That same ol' um-lotty-da tonight 
Let me try to sing 

Um-lotty-dotty hey 
Um-lotty-dotty
