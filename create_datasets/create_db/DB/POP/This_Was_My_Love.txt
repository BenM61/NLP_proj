Soft as a raindrop, fresh as the sea
Warm as the sunshine shining on me
This was my love, this was my love

Light was her laughter, few were her tears
Gentle her beauty, tender her years
This was my love, this was my love

So young, so fair, such bright golden hair
A smile always on her face
No other love can ever compare
No other can take her place

Others may cherish fortune or fame
I will forever cherish her name
For this was my love
This was my love!
