There's a message in my madness, coming out to you
The only one who ever knew me
There's a maybe in my head baby, you'll be coming too
Pink clouds all in my eyes, purple mountains capsize
When I'm thinking about you

So it's not gibberish when it's you that I miss
And there's one bell that rings true
You know who you are, you know what you've been
You know that your feathers tickle-hurt my skin
You know I'm the brown sugar covered with snow
And magnetism's animal you know

Surrealistic pillow, soft and cushion and just right
Surrealistic pillow, I guess, I held your love too tight
There's a method to my magic, coming out to you
The only one who ever knew me
If you hear me pillow-talking, you'll be comin too
Moon beans all in my hand, sweet dreams that you began
When I'm thinking about you

So it's not by design, when it's you on my mind
And there's no one bell that rings true
You know who you are, you know what you've been
You know that your feathers tickle-hurt my skin
You know I'm the brown sugar covered with snow
And magnetism's animal you know
I just want hold you tight
Make love to you all night
Do it till we get it right
Lay your head down
