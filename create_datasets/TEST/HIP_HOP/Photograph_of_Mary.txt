I keep a photograph of Mary
I keep it lying by my bed
And everytime I look up
I get so badly shook up
I with that she were here instead

It gets so lonely without Mary
I can't get her off my mind
And after all we've been through
I'll do whatever it takes to
Get her back into my life

Na na na na na na

What did I do to make her walk away
And leave me on my own
And I think I have the right
To know where we went wrong

I've got memories of Mary
I keep them all inside of my head
If only I could find her
I would just remind her
Of all the good times that we had

Na na na na na na

Got a skin as tough as leather
But I don't think I'm ever gonna get over you
No way. . . I don't wanna think about it girl

I keep a photograph of Mary
I keep it lying by my bed
And everytime I look up
I get so badly shook up
I wish that she were here instead

Na na na na na na

Come back baby baby
