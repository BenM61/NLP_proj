Lord I'm amazed at everything you've done for me
For every battle You have given victory
All I have needed You've provided for me
Who am I that You have so much love for me

You are so Awesome
You are so Awesome
You are so Awesome
You are so Awesome

Oh Lord we give you praise
Oh Lord we bless your name
Let all the earth rejoice and proclaim

That there is no other name
That is above Your name
You are the King forever You shall reign

Lift up your hands
Lift up your heart
Lift up your voice
And bless Him
For He is Awesome

Lift your hands
Lift your heart
Lift your voice
And bless Him
For He is Awesome

You are so awesome
