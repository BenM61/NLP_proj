I didn't take the warning
I really didn't care
I had already gone too far
To let them steal my share

So, like a fool I took 'em on
And as my anger cool
I realized I could take all mine
And skip off with theirs, too

I know I must be crazy
I'm bound to wake up dead

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody, somebody
Tryin' to even up the score

I figured I should lay real low
And stayed away from town
I covered up all my moves
So, it'd be hard to track me down

But I started gettin' shaky
And I paced around the floor
Hiding out all alone
I couldn't take much more

Just sitting 'round here waitin'
Is drivin' me up the wall

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody, somebody
Tryin' to even up the score

So, I called up my old friend Marlene
Who was lookin' for some fun
I got drunk and like a fool
I told her, what I'd done

I heard them knockin' at my door
They got to me at last
It don't take much to figure out
How they'd found me out so fast

And when I looked for my Marlene
I saw that she was gone

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody somebody
Tryin' to even up the score

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody, somebody
Tryin' to even up the score

Somebody, somebody
Waitin' outside my back door
Somebody, somebody
Tryin' to even up the score
