See what the boys in the backroom will have
And tell them I'm having the same
Go see what the boys in the backroom will have
And give them the poison they name

And when I die don't spend my money
On flowers and my picture in a frame

Just see what the boys in the backroom will have
And tell them I sighed and tell them I cried
And tell them I died of the same

And when I die don't buy a casket of silver
With the candles all aflame

Just see what the boys in the backroom will have
And tell them I sighed and tell them I cried
And tell them I died of the same

And when I die don't pay the preacher
For speaking of my glory and my fame

Just see what the boys in the backroom will have
And tell them I sighed and tell them I cried
And tell them I died of the same
