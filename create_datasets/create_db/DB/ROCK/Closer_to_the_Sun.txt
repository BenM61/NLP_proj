If I think she beautiful, well, that's for sure 
Give a little loving, but I still gonna need some more, rob it 
Stealing from the rich and then give it to the poor 
Telling everybody it don't matter anymore, she said 
All I really needed was a friend like you 
Help me through and together we can change, but 
If I was to stay it wasn't for too long 
People sing the same song everywhere I'm going 
Closer to the sun and far from the moon 
People screaming out they gonna see me real soon
They say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
