happiness is a kong foo sing
with good fortune that it brings
so quit your moping
and crack one open
smiles abound
the cookie has spoken

ah the kong foo sing
yeah the kong foo sing
ah the kong foo sing
it's the king

the kong foo sing is a holy scripture
i heard the word i got the picture
ancient wisdom in a cruncy treat
the place where the faith and the flavour meet

tasty biscuit holds a ticket
never did i ever feel so uplifted
i once was nothing now i rock the stack
when i was young i got the foo sing contract

ah the kong foo sing
yeah the kong foo sing
ah the kong foo sing
it's the king

the kong foo sing can you say no?
do you see how to be getting with the flow?
no one to be shown within the wrapping of the dough
crack 'em by the stack and then you won't be feeling low

ah the kong foo sing
yeah the kong foo sing
ah the kong foo sing
it's the king
