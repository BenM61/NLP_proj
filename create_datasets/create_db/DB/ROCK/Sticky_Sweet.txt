When she calls me up
My voice it starts to shake
She says come right over
Over right away
Oh good God there's a fire
In my pants
Then lightening strikes
And she laughs that evil laugh

She's so sticky so sticky so sticky
She's so sticky so sticky
She's so stick sweet

Sticky sweet
Sticky sweet

Now when I've done good she slaps me on the ass
It takes more than ten seconds
To satisfy this lass
The way she walks, I swear
Should be a crime
Sirens scream every time you walks by

She's so sticky so sticky so sticky
She's so sticky so sticky
She's so stick sweet

Sticky sweet
The way she walks the way she talks
Sticky sweet
Ooh all the time
Sticky sweet
Sticky, sticky, sticky child
Oh baby, you make me feel so good
She's so sticky so sticky so sticky
She's so sticky so sticky
She's so stick sweet
(She's so stick sweet) the way she walks the way she talks
She's so sticky (stick sweet) all the time
Sticky sweet
Sticky sweet
Break it up, shake it up, give it up, break it up
Stick sweet
Break it up, shake it up, give it up, break it up
Sticky sweet
Sticky sweet
Sticky sweet, child
