I saw you at the air race yesterday 
April showers get out of my way 
Fear of flying, no not me 

I'm never bothered, what you say 
Someone's kid just lives for today 
It ain't your problem anyway 

'Cause I've got my own way 
I can find my own way 
'Cause I've got my own way

'Cause I've got my own way 
I can find my own way 
'Cause I've got my own way

Number one
Public figure, what a pain 
Just puts another rattle in your brain 
Take another green but it's not the same 

Now you're on the Sandlane everyday 
Dancing with the bulls in any old way 
Running like a fox to keep up with me 

'Cause I've got my own way 
I can find my own way 
'Cause I've got my own way

'Cause I've got my own way 
I can find my own way 
'Cause I've got my own way

I'm on Forty-fifth between Sixth and Broadway 
Seven UP between Sixth and Broadway

'Cause I've got my own way 
I can find my own way 
'Cause I've got my own way

'Cause I've got my own way 
I can find my own way 
'Cause I've got my own way

Just how I like it
