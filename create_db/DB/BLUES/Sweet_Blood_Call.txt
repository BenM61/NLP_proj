I have a hard time missing you baby, with my pistol in your mouth
Mmmm have a hard time missing you baby, with my pistol in your mouth
You may be thinking 'bout going north, but your brains are staying south

Just roll your pretty eyes, if you intend to stay
Just roll your pretty eyes, if you intend to stay
Close 'em up again, and I blow your world away

I see your eyes are rollin'
Must mean your love for me has come back
Must mean you're satisfied again
With our little wooden country shack
I have a hard time missing you baby, with my pistol in your mouth
You may be thinking about going north woman, but your brains are staying south

Even if you sneak away
I'll find you before nightfall
You're tied to me girl
I can feel your sweetblood call
Even if you sneak away
I'll find you before nightfall
Caused you are tied to me girl
I can feel your sweetblood call
