I'm a son of a bitch ready to stitch
You muthers not ready to rock
I've shed all my tears & ain't got no fears
& they key to my heart bears no lock

Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
F*ck your blessed trinity

Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out

I'm a bastard & brave I'm nobodies slave
I'm telling you once & for all
Breaking the laws coz I know the score
Waiting on nobodies call

Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
F*ck your blessed trinity

Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out

Let's burst right out of here
"Let's go"
