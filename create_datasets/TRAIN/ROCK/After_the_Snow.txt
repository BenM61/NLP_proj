The rhythm of the rain gives an off beat on the window pane 
Like an angel crying from the sky 
I can see its beauty after the snow 
I can see its beauty after the snow 

The temperature's dropping rapidly 
Normal service will shortly be resumed 
I can see its beauty after the snow 
I can see its beauty after the snow 
After the snow 

I stood and watched the dark sky rise 
With glaring sunlight in my eyes 
I thought of all the times gone by 
And laughed aloud at the crimson sky 
After the snow 
After the snow 
After the snow 
After the snow 

After the snow there's something born 
After the snow there's something born 
After the snow there's something born 
After the snow there's something born 
After the snow 
After the snow 

The rhythm of the rain gives an offbeat on the window pane 
Like an angel crying from the sky 
I can see its beauty after the snow 
I can see its beauty
