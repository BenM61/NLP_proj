Taking my medicine
Changing the way I am
I don't know where I been
But I was well behaved

I don't know who you are
Coming out of my scar
Driving my crashing car
That needs a coat of paint

Chemical
Up and up away I go
Out of my head

I'm putting myself in jail
I'm hoping to see you fail
I'm flipping my head and tail
Over
I don't know the way
Over

I'm throwing up what I drank
No one here I would thank
I feel like a shark that's caught
In a goldfish tank

Swallowing a thousand pills
Trying to change how I feel
There's just to much time to kill
Between all my mistakes

Chemical
Up and up away I go
Out of my head
