(Goodbye, cruel world)
(Goodbye, cruel world)

Oh, goodbye, cruel world, I'm off to join the circus
Gonna be a broken-hearted clown
Paint my face with a good-for-nothin' smile
'Cause a mean, fickle woman turned my whole world upside down

(Goodbye, cruel world)

Farewell to love, I'm off to join the circus
Gotta find a way to hide my tears
Bet I'll have them rolling in the aisle
And I'll forget that woman if it takes a hundred years

Oh, oh, oh, step right up and take a look at a fool
He's got a heart as stubborn as a mule
C'mon, everybody, he's good for a laugh
And no one could tell his heart is broken in half

Well, the joke's on me; I'm off to join the circus
Oh, Mr. Barnum, save a place for me
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care
Let the people point at me and stare
I'll tell the world that woman, wherever she may be
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown outta me

Goodbye, cruel world
