Sometimes I doubt
But I get down on one knee
I get down on one knee, I don't pray
But it comes by, I go down
I get so lost, in my own problems

Soon crouch, ride
But I get down on one knee
I get down on one knee, I don't pray
Around into me, time by down
And I get so lost, in my own problems

And I think if you
With your love I service
Tell me do you feel the way I know?
With your love I promise
Help me get back to my home
With your love I service
Tell me do you feel the way I know?
With your love I promise
Help me get back to my home

With your love I service
Tell me do you feel the way I know?
With your love I promise
Help me get back to my home

With your love I service
Tell me do you feel the way I know?
With your love I promise
Help me get back to my home
