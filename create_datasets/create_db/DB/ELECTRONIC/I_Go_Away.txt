It's over
don't you believe it's over
How did I get here without feeling anything?
Stay true, see it through they say
Tick tock, time just slips away
And when the air is clear
The way I go is the way I feel

I'll go away, I'll go away, I'll go my own way
I'll go away, I'll go away, I'll go my own way
I'll go away, I'll go away, I'll go my own way
I'll go away

This is my anthem
I know it like I know everything
I see it everywhere and in everyone
It's complication, it's validation
Stay true, see it through they say
Tick tock, time just slips away
And where the air is clear
where I'll go is anywhere I feel

I'll go away, I'll go away, I'll go my own way
I'll go away, I'll go away, I'll go my own way
I'll go away, I'll go away, I'll go my own way
I'll go away

Stay true, is that what they really say?
See it through, there is no easy way
If it's right, why do I feel this way?
Tick tock, time just slips away

I'll go my own way
