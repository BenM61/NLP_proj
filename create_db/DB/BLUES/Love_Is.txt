Hard to get
Impossible to hold
Straight and narrow
Like a burning fuse
In a long cold dawn
By the side of the road
A hopeless case
A perfect thing

Love is (love is)
What you want it to be
Love is (love is)
Heaven to the lonely
Show me
What you want me to do
Cause love is
What I got for you

I close my eyes
Search the stars
Call for help
Wake up cold
You're in my system
Under my skin
Raw emotion
Please don't go

Love is (love is)
What you want it to be
Love is (love is)
Heaven to the lonely
Show me
What you want me to do
Cause love is
What I got for you

Can't live on promises
Won't sleep at night
Don't understand the things you say
Till I read them in your eyes
Got to run on instinct
Got to go by feel
Got to trust my senses
Know it is for real
Can't live on promises
Won't sleep at night
Don't understand the things you say
Till I read them in your eyes
Got to run on instinct
Got to go by feel
Got to trust my senses

Love is (love is)
What you want it to be
Love is (love is)
Heaven to the lonely
Show me
What you want me to do
Cause love is
What I got for you

Love is (love is)
Love is (love is)
Show me
