Life isn't always easy
This we know my friend
I thought you knew where to go
But you were following me
So let's get lost in space
I feel displaced
I'm stuck in the rat race
It's a lovely day to lose your way
And get stuck in a loop

Over and over again, you can never make it stop
Over and over again, you can never make it stop
('Cause life isn't always easy)
Over and over again, you can never make it stop
('Cause life isn't always easy)
Over and over again, you can never make it stop 

My old bones stroll along
Railway track is oh so long
Stem the tide, the nine to five
Is slowly eating me alive
But all night long, we carry on
We're stumbling slowly to a lovely day to lose your way
And get stuck in a loop

Over and over again, you can never make it stop
Over and over again, you can never make it stop
('Cause life isn't always easy)
Over and over again, you can never make it stop
('Cause life isn't always easy)
Over and over again, you can never make it
You can never make it
You can never make it
You can never make it stop
