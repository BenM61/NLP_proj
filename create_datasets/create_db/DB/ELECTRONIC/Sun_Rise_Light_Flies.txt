Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies

Sweet Sunday morning 
Lets the nightmares come alive 
I bet tomorrow makes it alright
I see my lovers
Flash before me on their knees
She tip the velvet makes it alright

Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies

Sweet Sunday morning 
Shake the lizards from my back
I chase the devil just for one night
And I light the paper
For all the friends who passed away
To all existence show me your light

Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies
Sun rise light flies
