I went out and felt the sun on my face
Then a tug on my leg and now I'm
Back in the cave
There's a moment of peace
That I just can't re-create

I need sleep but my brain won't get tired
I smell like smoke from electrical fires
Don't touch me I've got
Crossed wires
Keep your fingers free from these
Crossed wires
Crossed wires, crossed wires

A day like this, we should be out on the road
With the sky so clear and the air so cold
There's blankets in the back
Bundle up, my little urchin
'cause we never got the heat working
No, we never got the heat working

Well you don't touch me 'cause I've got
Crossed wires
Keep your fingers free from me
Crossed wires
Crossed wires, crossed wires

Collecting the notes you slid under the door
But I go blank
When I try to remember what we were good for
I'm cracked, and I'm cross
And it's no way to be
Let's just get lost
Maybe it'll come back to me
Back to me

Now you can't touch me I've got
Crossed wires
Keep your fingers free from these
Crossed wires
I smell like smoke from electrical fires
Oh I've got
Crossed wires, crossed wires
Yeah, yeah
Crossed wires
