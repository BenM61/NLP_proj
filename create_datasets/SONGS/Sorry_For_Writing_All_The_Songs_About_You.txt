I can't help myself I put it down on paper
All the different stages, memories of us
That's the only way I know that I can shake it
Writing all our pages, every single thought

I know you don't like when I'm nostalgic
No you've never tried to understand
Say you're doing fine, don't think about it
Like I do

Sorry for writing all the songs about you
I know that you hate that I got more to say
Sorry for writing all the songs about you
But I had to, oh, I had to
Swear no one will know that every moment was true
All the mistakes and why you ran away
Sorry for writing all the songs about you
But I had to, oh, I had to

I can't wait for you to recognize the stories
Like when you said you loved me or that time on the rooftop
Will you act as if you haven't even heard it
Nothing of it really matters

'Cause I know you don't like when I'm nostalgic
Go back to the start to get an end
Say you're doing fine, don't think about it
Like I do

Sorry for writing all the songs about you
I know that you hate that I got more to say
Sorry for writing all the songs about you
But I had to, oh, I had to
Swear no one will know that every moment was true
All the mistakes and why you ran away
Sorry for writing all the songs about you
But I had to, oh, I had to

Just to get over what we lost, what we lost
I put it in words to clear my thoughts
And just to get over, over us
I had to, I had to

Sorry for writing all the songs about you
I know that you hate that I got more to say
Sorry for writing all the songs about you
But I had to, oh, I had to
Swear no one will know that every moment was true
All the mistakes and why you ran away
Sorry for writing all the songs about you
But I had to, oh, I had to
