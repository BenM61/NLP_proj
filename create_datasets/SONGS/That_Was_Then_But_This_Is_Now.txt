Why make the past your sacred cow?
I guess you've changed, you've changed and how
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fruit's grown rotten on the bough
Reap what you sow, with a counterfeit plough
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That was then but this is now

More sacrifices than an Aztec priest
Standing here straining at that leash
All fall down
Can't complain, musn't grumble
Help yourself to another peace of apple crumble
And consequently:
Hearts of oak are charged and blistered
Russians should be baby-sitted
Americans enlisted

That was then but this is now
That was then but this is now
That was then but this is now
