Make a smile for me
Lately I've been so lonely
And a smile from you
Might make these blues go away

Stay awhile with me
Can't you tell I've been lonely
And a smile from you
Might make it a nicer day

Close your eyes and dream of a sunny place
Watch the world light up when you smile
Stay with me and smile at me, sunny face
Chase the clouds away with your smile

Close your eyes and dream of a sunny place
Watch the world light up when you smile
Stay with me and smile at me, sunny face
Chase the clouds away with your smile
