I am, I myself alone,
and realise, I never had to use no-one.
When it comes down to my soul,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
There was a time I was so afraid
Of everything people around me said
That I wanted to hide my face in the shadows
There was a time on a bed of nails
I was dreaming a plan I thought could not fail
But no power under the sun, could pull it together
I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question
I am, I myself alone
Realise I never nedd to use no-one
Money, power, holy roads,
Freedom puts my faith in none above.

If there's a time, that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there -
To kick at the answer
I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question

I am, I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy roads,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
I am, I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy road,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
I am, I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy road,
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
(None of the above)
(My faith in none of the above)
(None of the above)
(I stand by none of the above)
(None of the above)
(I stand by none of the above)
