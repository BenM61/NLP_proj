Jessie died today I heard the news it's safe 
Photographed nude at age thirteen 
Nick was a friend of mine 
He died before his time 
Dead on acid at age eighteen 
Ooh and you still bitch 
About your payments 
It's funny how your looks predict 
Your statements 

I dressed in black today it represents 
This phase I'm in 
And what it was I can't believe 
The stain glass your hiding behind 
It's from a different life 
And what it was it's still in your dreams 
Oh and you still bitch about your payments 
It's funny how your looks predict 
You statements 

So check your head set your eyes 
On your dreams 
Be happy with nothing 
You're a sight to see my love 

So check your head set your eyes 
On your dreams 
Be happy with nothing 
You're a sight to see my love

You fell out of time with some distance to go 
It's not a design it's a talent show 
And if you believe it's the end of the line 
You'll be taken 

Now Jessie never thought that what 
She did would change my life 
She just thought her life was a waste of time 
And Nick worked hard to graduate 
And after that he died he always 
Thought high school was a waste of time

So check your head set your eyes 
On your dreams 
Be happy with nothing 
You're a sight to see my love 

So check your head set your eyes 
On your dreams 
Be happy with nothing 
You're a sight to see my love
