Now's the time your visions and your shreds
Turned out to be the cheap imported threads
The flag reeled out in a cotton kite
Flying miles above the wheat lands in a single stripe
The Revolution came and the Revolution went
The chemical rain left the message on the tent
Wanted: one man to lead a crusade
Payment: a bullet on a big parade

Down in Gangsterville
Where any sane people already crawled under the house
Yeah Gangsterville, the television is always thinking about
Real people, especially when it's hungry

Final decisions are made by the club
And implemented by the shadow of a glove
And sitting in a coffeehouse reading words
We got popcorn salesmen for protection from the world
Went through extensive preparations
I learned all about the other nations
When freedom was defined as a word in a book
I learned if you're plugged into something then baby you're hooked

Into Gangsterville
I searched for a rose or some sweet juice of water
Gangsterville, people are giving
A black lady sobbed on a step--God bless the little born

On the other hand, sitting next to a evil crew
They just got down from floor eighty-two
Been selling Indian reservations
Coming in looking for some jazz and a little libations
I like the same kind of beer
I gotta get right out of here
I'm going to New Orleans--gonna buy me a prayer
Gonna call somebody from a call box there

Hell this is Gangsterville
Bring your money to the shore
No automatic weapons on the jetty
Oh Gangsterville, electro shields on the phalanx
Club the Mayor in the streets, it's a chewable fecie

My kind, we are the worst kind
Got enough shrinks working on us
To defy paralysis, identify analysis
Just wanna hold my carburetor bible
Snapping to attention, eyes on the horizon
Keep your filter clean, wipe the oil from your dreams
Keep our hopes pinned to the Southern Cross
You got to believe in something or you feel a sense of loss

Down in Gangsterville
Pelicans dying strangling on a six can strap
Gansterville shut off all the power burn out all the gasoline
Stop writing things on screens.
