The lonely day I've met you
Has changed my world
I can't exist without your smile

You pushed me up
You filled my days
You realize the right things
Which can help me everywhere.

Visions have incensed and destroyed
My mind
Voices would only explain
I have restricted the feelings

Of shame
But we can't
Put back the time.
