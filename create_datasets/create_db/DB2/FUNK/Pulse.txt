They say that from the looks of it
That you and I probably won't make it
(But when I hold your hand) I know that somewhere
(Deep inside of us) the love is still there
They can say what they want to
But I'm not givin' up on love

That's why I'm feeling for a pulse
Cause I can feel us breathing
Feel our heart beating
Seems a little weaken
But I know that we can
Come back to life
(Revive it, revive it, revive it)
I'm feelin' for a pulse
Cause I can feel us breathing
Feel our heart beating
Seems a little weaken
But I know that we can
Come back to life
(Revive it, revive it, revive it)

They're shaking their heads 
And sayin' that it's no use (it's no use)
That we've tried everything
And there's nothing more we could do for her
(When I look in your eyes)
That's when I know
(That within us lies)
A ray of hope
They can say what they want to
But I'm not givin' up on love
So

That's why I'm feeling for a pulse
Cause I can feel us breathing
Feel our heart beating
Seems a little weaken
But I know that we can
Come back to life
(Revive it, revive it, revive it)
I'm feelin' for a pulse
Cause I can feel us breathing
Feel our heart beating
Seems a little weaken
But I know that we can
Come back to life
(Revive it, revive it, revive it)

There's a lot of pain
We can do it, babe
Even though we lost a lot of lovin' on the way
Don't care what they say
It's not over, babe
I'm-a do whatever it takes
And I'll never give up
So

That's why I'm feeling for a pulse
Cause I can feel us breathing
Feel our heart beating
Seems a little weaken
But I know that we can
Come back to life
(Revive it, revive it, revive it)
I'm feelin' for a pulse
Cause I can feel us breathing
Feel our heart beating
Seems a little weaken
But I know that we can
Come back to life
(Revive it, revive it, revive it)
