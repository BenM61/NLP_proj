Oh, sweet Dardanella
I love your harem eyes
I'm a lucky fellow to capture such a prize
Oh, Allah knows my love for you
And he tells you to be true, Dardanella
Oh, hear my sigh, my Oriental
Oh, sweet Dardanella, prepare the wedding wine
There'll be one girl in my harem when you're mine
We'll build a tent
Just like the children of the Orient

Oh, sweet Dardanella
My star of love divine
Down beside the Dardanella Bay
Where Oriental breezes play
There lives a lonesome maid Armenian
By the Dardanelles with glowing eyes
She looks across the seas and sighs
And weaves her love spell so sirenian
Soon I shall return to Turkestan
I will ask for her heart and hand

Oh, sweet Dardanella
I love your harem eyes
I'm a lucky fellow to capture such a prize
Oh, Allah knows my love for you
And he tells you to be true, Dardanella
Oh, hear my sigh, my Oriental
Oh, sweet Dardanella, prepare the wedding wine
There'll be one girl in my harem when you're mine
We'll build a tent
Just like the children of the Orient
