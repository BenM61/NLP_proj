I'm in a band now, we're called The Carrie Nations
Man, you'll see we're really going places
We took our act down to LA and met Z-Man at the party

It could be dangerous living in this valley
Everybody here parties all the time
Everybody here's got sex on their minds

It could be dangerous living in this valley
Everybody here parties all the time
Everybody here's got sex on their minds
Everybody here is popping pills

I got a dream and it's gonna come true
Z-Man will make us stars, leave it
And you take things one at a time and just relax
Get some acid or smoke some grass

It could be dangerous living in this valley
Everybody here parties all the time
Everybody here's got sex on their minds

It could be dangerous living in this valley
Everybody here parties all the time
Everybody here's got sex on their minds
Everybody here is popping pills

Bentley, Rolls, Bentley, Rolls

It could be dangerous, it could be dangerous
It could be dangerous living in this valley
Everybody here parties all the time
Everybody here's got sex on their mind

Everybody here parties all the time
Everybody here's got sex on their mind
Everybody here is popping pills
