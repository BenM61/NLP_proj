Want to go with me? 
Do I have to wear 
A Shirt and tie? 
We can take a limousine 
But everybody there will 
Ask us why! 
Ain't nothin' wrong 
We can have 
A little fun and play 
As longs as we never forget 
How to stop and pray! 

If you've been set 
On partying 'til your head is numb 
Betta not forget 
That the party is when the 
Kingdom comes! 
Come on and dance 
All your troubles away 
And look through the 
Windows of heaven 
It's not too late 

My life 
Yeah 
It's your life 
Yeah 
Don't want to get it wrong 
It's time to get it right 
My life 
Yeah 
It's your life 
Yeah 
Need to make a change 
Time for saving 
My life 

I was a mess 
But that was all before 
I told him yes! 
Now it's all good 
'Cause everyone in his will 
Is blessed 
Just let him take 
All your troubles away 
Look through the 
Windows of heaven 
It's not too late 

My life 
Yeah 
It's your life 
Yeah 
Don't want to get it wrong 
It's time to get it right 
My life 
Yeah 
It's your life 
Yeah 
Need to make a change 
Time for saving 
My life 

Don't want to wait too long 
It might be too late 

My life 
Yeah 
It's your life 
Yeah 
Don't want to get it wrong 
It's time to get it right 
My life 
Yeah 
It's your life 
Yeah 
Need to make a change 
Time for saving 
My life
