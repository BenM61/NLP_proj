Another day scribe writing fighting the force
The fabulous never faking the funk
Fool fever in my bones got me sweating solid gold microphones
On some brand-new leave me alone
Or love me to the world sunset earth unfurl
Long arm of the pen, I done did it again
From miraculous men and women that blend
Into the earth rotation wind
The roads hard and long but yo I be
And that's a guarantee that you could never disagree
Another day rhyme writing fighting the force
Saying nothing when I speak gotta stay on course
But sometime a brother just wanna spit rhymes
Talk about my shine or my zodiac sign and bra
That's the element that make me love the song
It's the balance or ma'at come along
Rhyme writing fighting the force that make
Mother nature laws deal with man laws
I gotta pause on that and react to what's real
'Cause no man can make that sunshine feel
Deal with folks best after solo time
No interruption from the world creeping in my mind
Another day scribe writing fighting the force
Another day rhyme writing fighting the force

Another day rhyme writing pressure is on
I stayed up all night making hip-hop songs yo
Now it's 12 noon soon I gotta pay rent
It seems all the loot I got before I had was spent
Now the hustle start again I look around my crib
Scouting things I could sell just to make that dough
Another day rhyme writing pressure is on
Aint kept up with my friends now the vibe is gone
Yo I know I need to call e-mail or write
It aint nothing personal I mean the love is tight
It's just the last 5 years I been seeing mad change
Became more introvert it's all so strange I?m
Rhyme writing pressure is on
I wanna move to the desert play guitar songs
Move away from the big city crime and fear
'Cept I know the world needs me here you too
Peace to all of the heads in the b-sides crew
The ghostface night was hype and sade too
Live band beat crew trying to make things fresh
Hip-hop purists hating on us trying to bring that stress
