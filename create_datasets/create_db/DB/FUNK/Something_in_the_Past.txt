We we're together
Living as one
Until something happened
One day our love was gone

Always seems to be
Something in the past
Won't let us pass by

Always seems to be
Something in the past
Won't let us last by

We we're together
Our love was very strong
Until you waited, brought
Up something from the past
Which broke up our lovely home

Always seems to be
Something in the past
Won't let us pass by
Always seems to be
Something in the past
Won't let us pass by

I want you, do you want me forever
I want you, do you want me

Don't bring it up
Don't bring it up
Don't keep bringin up the past
I've loved you forever

Some people win
Some people loose
Some always cryin' the blues, yea
Some people win
Some people lose
Some always being misused yea

I've loved you forever(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Don't keep bringing up the past(aah aah aah)

As you may understand
We've been lovin each other a long time
Something like this will just break up EVERYTHING
We,ve held on to so long(aah aah aah)

I'm gonna do the things for you
But girl what is a man to do?
Just leave the past alone(ooh ooh ooh)

I don't want to live in the past
Leave the past behind(ooh ooh ooh)

Baby please don't do that
Seems like every time we think got things together
The past just comes along and tears it apart

Don't bring it up
Don't bring it up
Don't keep bringin up the past
No gi-i-irl
I've loved you
I've loved you forever
