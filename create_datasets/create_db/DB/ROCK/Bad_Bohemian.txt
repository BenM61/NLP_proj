You said the world was losing all its lustre
You realised each day you're growing old
And the future stretches out there between us
And we decide if we want it to be cold

But don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian

It's sad now how the glass looks rather empty
The formulation of the elements makes you yearn
What's done is done, and there'll be no redemption
Just periodic tables to be learned

But don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian

Oh, don't let us die
While we are still alive
Oh, don't let us die
While we are still alive
While we are still alive

Search every default payoff
Search out there looking chaos
We'll do it fast, we'll do it clean and true
Because you're bad, you're bad, you're bad
You know it, and you're bad, you're bad
Don't be a bad bohemian

Oh, don't let us die
While we are still alive
Oh, don't let us die
While we are still alive

Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
