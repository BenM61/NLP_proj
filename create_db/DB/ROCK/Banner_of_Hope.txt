Angry young voices cry 
There's a new sun burning in the sky
Saying listen to your heart
And not to the people tearing you apart
The message is here upon our lips
Listen for once, ignore your hip

We hold the banner
United hand in hand
The banner of hope
For a truce across the land

This generation
Holds the banner to the eyes of the nation
Like two lovers reaching out
In their minds no dark shadows of dread or doubt

We hold the banner
United hand in hand
The banner of hope
For a truce across the land
