An early warning
Forging notes that never die
The air now rings with dissonant sound
Screaming our last prayer
For this cross that we bare grows much heavier
Holding us down when we fall from our feet

As the storms of time subside
The coals from past life will fuel this fire
Dreams carry us on to believe
And die for the things we had hoped for
The arrival sets us free

A killing season
Blinding words obscuring the plain
Poisoning the lips of the newborn in vain
Distant signs of light
Deliver us from the night we were drowning
But now we've been washed
Onward to a new shore

As the storms of time subside
The coals from past life will fuel this fire
Dreams carry us on to believe
And die for the things we had hoped for
The arrival sets us free
Dreams carry us on to believe
And die for the things we had hoped for
The arrival sets us free

They call this reason
Different views through different eyes
If you speak the truth why do I see lies
Distant signs of light
Will smooth these rough seas that we ride
We were drowning
But now we've been washed
Onward to a new shore
Over and over and over
