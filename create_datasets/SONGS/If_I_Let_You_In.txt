If I let you in. I'll never let you out 
If I let you in. I'll never let you out 
If I let you in. I'll never let you out 
Never let you out 

Blessed are the few who live and die for love 
I can see their footsteps in the sand 

If I let you in. I'll never let you out 
If I let you in. I'll never let you out 
If I let you in. I'll never let you out 
Never let you out 

Winter watches over us as we decide 
I can see the twilight in your eyes and mine 

If I let you in. I'll never let you out
If I let you in. I'll never let you out
If I let you in. I'll never let you out
Never let you out
