Out with the boys
Testing my virility
The booze and the music
Arrousing my curiousity

I moved in beside her
Asked her to rock and roll with me
Cause I have her classed
My eyes roam lecherously
Lecherously, lecherously, lecherously

She's a big teaser [Repeat]
I only see her
Very occasionally
She's leading me on
She's living dangerously
It's easy to see
She's making a fool out of me
Oh but I ain't no fool
I'll get her eventually
Eventually, eventually, eventually

She's a big teaser [Repeat]
