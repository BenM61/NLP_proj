Farther on down the road 
You will accompany me 
Yes, further on down the road 
You will accompany me 
Every time I think about 
Your sweet love 
Shining' down on me like the sun 
I don't remember any old cold days 
Baby, I guess that you're the one 
Goin' farther on down the road 
You will accompany me 
If there's fools in this life 
Then a happy fool is what I wanna be 
So I'll be glad to learn about you, baby 
You can learn a thing or two about me 
But then if we ever should get down 
And things really got sad 
You know we could cheer each other up 
And things wouldn't be that bad, baby 
If I'm gonna be a fool in this life 
Just want to be a fool for you, darlin' 

Day by day, just one step at a time 
Girl, you've been so sweet 
Restore my peace of mind 
And I don't care what anybody knows 
And I don't care what anybody might say 
With lovin' in my corner each and every day 
And I wanna thank you for that, baby 
Just want you to go with me thru time 
And every step of the way 
Farther on down the road 
Farther on down the road 
I know baby
You can say further on 
Further on 
Gonna turn around.
