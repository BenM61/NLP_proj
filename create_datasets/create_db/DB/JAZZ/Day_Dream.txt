Funny the way I feel now
Can't keep my feet on the ground
Everything seems unreal now
When you're not around

Day Dream
Why do you haunt me so?
Deep in a rosy glow 
The face of my love you show

Day Dream
I walk along on air
Building a castle there
For me and my love to share

Don't know the time
Lordy, I'm in a daze
Sun in the sky
While I moon around, feeling hazy

Day Dream
Don't break my reverie
Until I find that he
Is day dreaming just like me
