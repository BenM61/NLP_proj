I can see that you are almost over me
Gonna make it simple for ya, won't stand in your way, baby
Gonna set you free, my darling, gonna cut you loose na, na, na
Won't be the broken hearted, let's finish what we started
Won't try and make you stay, you won't even have to say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, a ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba

Gonna make it simple for ya, won't stand in your way, baby,
Gonna set you free, my darling, gonna cut you loose, na, na, na
Won't be the broken hearted, my dearly departed
Won't try and make you stay, you won't even have to say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, a ba, da, da, da, da, da
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, a da, da, da, da, da, da

I can see that you are almost over me
Gonna make it simple for ya, won't stand in your way, baby
Gonna set you free, my darling, gonna cut you loose na, na, na
Won't be the broken hearted, let's finish what we started
Won't try and make you stay, you won't even have to say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, a ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Bye bye, bye bye, bye-bye, a da, da, da, da, da, da
