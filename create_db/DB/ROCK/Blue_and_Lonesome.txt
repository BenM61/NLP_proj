I'm blue and lonesome
As a man can be
I'm blue and lonesome, yeah
As a man can be
I don't have no headache about myself
My love has gone away from me

Baby, please
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please
Come on home to me
Yes, my heart is full of misery
Baby, you won't be sweet to me

Yeah, I'm gonna cast my trouble
Down in the deep blue see
Yeah, I'm gonna cast my trouble, yeah
Down in the deep blue see

And the whales and the fishes
Have no fuss over me
