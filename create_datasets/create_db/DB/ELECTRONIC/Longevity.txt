Harmonizing with a ghost of a late face 
Just like the old days 
Golden seaplane
Dollar tossed in the take bin 
What a bargain 
Turned up in yellow night
Found oysters on the beach
Undressed from the waist

My girl says that
All the rain promises is 
To give life to the seeds, sea 
Live in the moment
Never count on longevity 
Please 

Ribbons showing
Very plainly on her skin
Okay I want in
Heels overhead
With her
Never monetized
My lovely space case

The times I'm in (there?) are cheap
Legs bruised up from the beast
Undressed from the waist

My girl says that
All the rain promises is 
To give life to the seeds, sea 
Live in the moment
Never count on longevity 
Please
