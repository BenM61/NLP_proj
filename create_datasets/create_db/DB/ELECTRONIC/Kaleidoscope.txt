One and two, three and four
Go through kaleidoscope, I see you there
Five and six, so many, then many more

This is where you want to be
It's where you want to see

All together, now we sing in unison
All together, now we sing in unison

One and two, three and four
Go through kaleidoscope

All together, we sing in unison
We sing in unison

All together, now we sing in unison
This is where you want to see and where you want to be

All together, now we sing in unison
This is where you want to see and where you want to be

All together, now we sing in unison
All together, now we sing in unison (All together, now we sing in unison)

Where you want to see and where you want to be

All together, now we sing in unison
This is where you want to see and where you want to be

All together, now we sing in unison
This is where you want to see and where you want to be

All together, now we sing in unison
All together, now we sing in unison
