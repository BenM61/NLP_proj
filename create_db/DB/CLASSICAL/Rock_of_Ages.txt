Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
	let me hide myself in thee; 
	let the water and the blood, 
	from thy wounded side which flowed, 
	be of sin the double cure; 
	save from wrath and make me pure. 

	While I draw this fleeting breath, 
	when mine eyes shall close in death, 
	when I soar to worlds unknown, 
	see thee on thy judgment throne, 
	Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
	let me hide myself in thee.
