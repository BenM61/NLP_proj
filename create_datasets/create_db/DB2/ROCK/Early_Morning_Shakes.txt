I've been out here praying for sunshine
All I see is pouring rain
I've been out here praying for good times
And all I get is more pain
There's a monkey on my back
I've got some habits that I can't break
So I'm out here standing in the sunrise
With a case of the early morning shakes

Early morning shakes

This bus is headed to hell now
At least that's what the old folks say
You only get a little while to shine
Before you fade away
Out here on the highway
It's more then I can take
Just giving everything I got
Until there's nothing but the early morning shakes

Early morning shakes

I wanna break away and just be myself sometime
And get back all those things I lost along the way
To the early morning shakes

Jack Daniels in her coffee
Ice water in her veins
Bleach blond hair with a rose tattoo
Maybelline and White Rain
I took her back to the woods
Listening to "When the Levee Breaks"
I reached over and took her hand
Then I gave her the early morning shakes

Yea, the early morning shakes

To the early morning shakes

Yea, the early morning shakes
