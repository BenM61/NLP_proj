Here's to the winners - lift up the glasses .
Here's to the glory still to be.
Here's to the battle, whatever it's for,
To ask the best of ourselves, then give much more.

Here's to the heroes - those who move mountains.
Here's to the miracles they make us see.
Here's to all brothers - here's to all people
Here's to the winners all of us can be.
