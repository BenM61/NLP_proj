That guy is drawn into the vortex of sound hiding in his head.
And this phenomena, it destroys
The affection that is born from the bottom of that future.

Gazing at that point, from the current one. Where is an answer
Connected above this head. From the empty darkness
Strength that slips away.

Why don't you strike justify your mind
So coing tribe is absorber.

Japanese part (sounds like mumbling):

Soitsu wa atama no naka ni hisonderu oto no uzu ni makare

Soshite hakai suru kono genshou

Sono mirai no tei kara umareru ji o

Sono ten o mitsume ima tsugi naru mono kara doko ni kotae o

Sou tsunagaru kono atama no ue Kuukyo no yami kara

Nukedasu chikara

(Tribe)
Why don't you strike justify your mind
So coing tribe is absorber.
