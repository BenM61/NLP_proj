This time she's really out my life, oh
I know I gotta get her back
Just need one night to hit it right, oh
But I can't get her alone, no
Know she deserves to up and leave
If it was me I'd do the same
I see that girl, look like she hopes
So I'd be damned to let it go
Damned to let it go

I gotta discover, discover
I love her
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh
Gotta discover, discover
That I love her
Oooh, that will get her back

I'm guessing this is where it ends
(You don't even pick up for a nigga)
I know she's calling all her friends
(If they don't like me, f*ck your bitches)
They probably tryna take her out
(All in the VIP so they can take a picture)
And tryna find her ass a man
(Shit, hah)
Make a nigga mad
'Cause she know I heard it
She know that I heard it, I heard it, I heard it
Yeah she know I care, she know that I care
I can't understand, know I treat you bad
But you don't get me back like that, no, no
Oh, oh
I gotta get my baby
Girl don't leave me
All this crazy shit that you been dealin with
You probably hate me, ay
'Cause baby if you cheated, I couldn't ever love that
To know that another nigga is making you smile like I

Discover, discover
I love her
Oh, I gotta get her back, woah, yeah
Discover, discover
That I love her
Oooh, that will get her back

I can't breathe, yeah
Can't breathe, can't breathe, yeah
Girl let me breathe again
Breathe again
Let me breathe again, oh
I can't breathe (Wee-oh, wee-oh)
Can't sleep (Wee-oh, wee-oh)
Can't dream (Wee-oh, wee-oh)
So weak, girl
Gotta get you back
Gotta get you back
Can't think, oh gee

Discover, discover
I love her
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh
I gotta discover, discover
That I love her
Oooh, that will get her back

Wee-oh, wee-oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh

Can't think, girl
Oh gee, ohhh
