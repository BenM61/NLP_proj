Whoa whoa-oh
Whoa whoa-oh
I'm feeling this desperation,
Your words are tearing me apart
With every last conversation,
Not going anywhere from the start

You and I could have made this happen
Given time and some time and sense, but now you're on your own.
I can't help but wonder
What this could have been, but now you're frozen.

I have to be the one who just leaves you all alone 
I hate to see you leave, but your hearts been growing cold, whoa whoa-oh
Now I believe that I'm starting again to be the man that I should be
I hope you find what you're looking for, just take a chance, and then you'll see.
Then you'll see.

I needed some restoration
But you kept tearing me apart.
I'm going through renovation,
Rebuilding what you took from my heart

You and I could have made this happen
Given time and some sense but now you're on your own.
I can't help but wonder
What this could have been, but now you're frozen.

I have to be the one who just leaves you all alone
I hate to see you leave, but your hearts been growing cold, whoa whoa-oh
Now I believe that I'm starting again to be the man that I should be
I hope you find what you're looking for, just take a chance, and then you'll see.
Then you'll see.
