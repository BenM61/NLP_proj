I bought a ticket, got an aisle seat
I was ready for that good old Western flick
Then all at once an angel sat down next to me
So I had to think of something quick
What shall I do?

I said, 'Excuse me
Have I seen you somewhere before?'
And then she smiled at me
With big brown eyes

We talked and talked
As the bad guy shot up the town
And sure enough she was in my arms
As they brought that curtain down

Oh, I met my baby at the bang-bang, got'cha
Shoot ?em up movies
During the gunfight we fell in love
Oh, I met my baby at the bang-bang, got'cha
Shoot ?em up movies, yeah

All at once I knew I wouldn't see this movie through
I was so lost gazing into her eyes
She shared my popcorn while we shared a kiss
And she whispered, 'I love you', to my surprise

The posse rode in
As the bad guys made their get away
There we were fallin' in love
Oh, I'll never forget that day

Whoa, I met my baby at the bang-bang, got'cha
Shoot 'em up movies
During the gunfight we fell in love
Oh, I met my baby at the bang-bang, got'cha
Shoot 'em up movies, yeah

She said she'd love me
Then the lights went down, hey, hey
Okay, okay

I said, 'Excuse me
Have I seen you somewhere before?'
And then she smiled at me
With big brown eyes

Whoa, I met my baby at the bang-bang, got'cha
Shoot 'em up movies
During the gunfight we fell in love
Oh, I met my baby at the bang-bang, got'cha
Shoot 'em up, shoot ?em up movies, yeah

Hoo, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up movies, yeah
While the good guys and bad guys were fighting it out we fell in love
In the good old Western movies, shoot ?em up
Hoo, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
