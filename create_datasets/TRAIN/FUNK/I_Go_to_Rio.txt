When my Baby, When my baby smiles at me I go to Rio De Janeiro 
My-oh me-oh 
I go wild then I have to do the samba, then la Bamba 
Now I'm not the kind of person with a passionate persuasion for dancin' or romancin' 
But I give in to the rhythm and my feet follow the beat of my heart 
 
When my baby, when my baby smiles at me 
I go to Rio, De Janeiro 
Me salsa fellow 
When my baby smiles at me 
She shines the lanterns of my life 
And I am free at last what a blast! 
Whoa 
 
When my baby, when my baby smiles at me 
I feel like Tarzan of the jungle 
There on the hot sand 
And in the bungalow 
While monkeys play above-a 
We'll make love-a 
 
Now I'm not the type to let vibrations 
tickle my imagination easily 
You know that's just not me 
But I turn into a tiger every time I'm beside the one I love
