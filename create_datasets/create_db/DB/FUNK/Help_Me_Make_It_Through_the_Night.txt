Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft against your skin
Like the shadow on the wall

Come and lay down by ma side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night

I don't care what's right or wrong
'N' I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Oh, tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's so sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

Mmm mm mm mm
Mmm mm mm mm
Lord it's so sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
Uhu, lead me through the night, uhu
Come on and take me through the night, uhu
Through the night
