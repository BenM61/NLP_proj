Beyond the reef
Where the sea is dark and cold
Where love has gone
And our dreams grow old

There'll be no tears
There'll be no regretting
Will you remember me
Will you forget

I'll send a thousand flow'rs
When the trade wind blows
I'll send my lonely heart
For I love you so

Someday I know
You'll come back again to me
Till then my heart will be
Beyond the reef
