Yo-yo homeboy, pass me dat
Yo, this is the song I wrote for the girl I love.
Her name, Mary Jane

Saggin' my dickies, smoke like a hippy
Smell so good when she get wet and sticky
You lift me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong
A bong, a blunt, or a paper square
It really don't matter she'll take you there
You been my gal since the age of thirteen
And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend
You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain
You been true to me, stood by my side
I wake up and get my mornings first high
Other hoes wonder why they get no love
'Cause Mary got a big ol' but, huh

[Chorus: x2]
Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh let the Mary-go-round, pass the sweet

If yous a Jane user
Throw your hands in the air with this muthafuckin three time user
Producer, wanna cool my future (pass the sweet)
Pass the Medusa, I never knews her
Who ya, who ya think ya are
Ya fuckin with a dopehouse shootin' star

Smokin' that budda
Drinkin' that puda
Booya, another killa from madulas
I thug in rida chick gets me higher
There's no needa tryna find a finer hyna
I decya my bitch your fya
Be bestet as we kids under plya

[Chorus: x2]

Mary-go-round round and round
Oh let the Mary-go-round
Pass the sweet

Now you can do snow or get wet as the rain
Me man I got Jane in my brain
Of course I kick doors for white whores
But my wife Mary-Jane I never get divorced
'Cause she be tha only one fit for a playa
The green eyes and the pretty red hair
The hoes sick cause them jealous bitches wanna
Vyla coma vana marijuana
You was born in Mexico but I took the chance
And brought your ass across to the promise lands
I love to lay you down so soft in my swisha
Act like a freak and let all my niggaz hit ya
I got your picture on all my walls
Mama caught us kissin' wanna call the laws
My family thinks you nothin' but trouble
Can't see how you helped me through the struggle

[Chorus: x2]
