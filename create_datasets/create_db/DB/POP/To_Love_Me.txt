That morning was so cold, awoke and felt so cold
The story that you told but time could not defend
This cry without an end, the worst was to pretend

Hearts torn away
How could you say?
Didn't you care about the games that you played?

The frost upon the grass, then pane of broken glass
The hurt that came to pass, you left me mystified
Your careless wail of sighs, at least you might have tried

But every now and then you cross my heart again
Oh, how could you pretend to love me?

Hearts torn away
How could you say that you loved me?
Didn't you care 'bout the games that you played?

To love me
Hearts torn away
How could you say that you loved me?
Didn't you care 'bout the games that you played?
