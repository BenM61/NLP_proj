Come with me
Into the trees
We'll lay on the grass
And let the hours pass

Take my hand
Come back to the land
Lets get away
Just for one day

Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you speaking just for me
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you crying just for me
Let me hear you make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking just for me

Oh oh oh 
Metropolis has nothing on this
You're breathing in fumes
I taste when we kiss

Take my hand
Come back to the land
Where everything's ours
For a few hours

Oh oh oh 
Oh let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you speaking just for me
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you crying just for me
Let me hear you make decisions
Without your television

Let me hear you speaking just for me
Let me hear you crying just for me
Let me hear you speaking just for me
Let me hear you crying just for me
Let me hear you speaking just for me
Let me hear you crying just for me
