I never thought that you'd leave
And not take me
But you've broken my belief

I never thought that my life
Could just fade away
But it will if you don't stay

And now I see that it's true
That you broke my heart in two
I'm losing you

Take my heart when you go
Cause I don't need it anymore
Take my heart when you go away
And take my life when you go
When you walk out of the door
Take my life when you're on your way
Cause I've never asked for much
But I'm asking now
I'm begging you to stay
Or take my heart

I never thought that you'd say
It's not like before
And that you don't love me anymore

I never thought that I'd cry
When you said good-bye
But now we're living separate lives

And now I see that it's true
That you broke my heart in two
I'm losing you

Take my heart when you go
Cause I don't need it anymore
Take my heart when you go away
And take my life when you go
When you walk out of the door
Take my life when you're on your way
Cause I've never asked for much
But I'm asking now
I'm begging you to stay
Or take my heart

I go crazy every time I see you by my side
I go crazy every time I feel you every night...

Take my heart when you go
Cause I don't need it anymore
Take my heart when you go away
And take my life when you go
When you walk out of the door
Take my life when you're on your way
Cause I've never asked for much
But I'm asking now
I'm begging you to stay
Or take my heart
