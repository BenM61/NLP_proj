Bet I'll be damned
Built the debt
I turned 2's up today
Bet I'll be damned
Gets harder to sense to sail
Farewell fare well
Mother numb to & devout to
Reckon luck sees us the same

Weighted my hand
Kill the bet
I'll burn on judgement day
Weighted my hand
Get hard hit to sin to sail

Farewell fare well
Mother numb to & devout to

Double deal
A season wrapt
Too lax to lapse so soon
Reckon luck sees us the same

Bed on my back
Dealt my hell
I've dealt my months of May
Bed on my back
Get parted ascension day

Farewell fare well
Mother numb to & devout to Reckon luck sees us the same
Reckon love deals us the same
