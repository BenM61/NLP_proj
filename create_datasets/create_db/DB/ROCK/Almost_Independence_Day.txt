I can hear them calling way from Oregon
I can hear them calling way from Oregon
And it's almost Independence Day

Me and my lady, we go steppin', we go steppin'
We go steppin' way out on China town
All to buy some Hong Kong silver
And the wadin' rushing river, we go steppin'
We go out on the, out on the town tonight

I can hear the fireworks
I can hear the fireworks
I can hear the fireworks
Up and down the, up and down the San Francisco bay
Up and down the, up and down the San Francisco bay
I can hear them echoing
I can hear, I can hear them echoing
I can hear, hear them echoing
Up and down the, up and down the, up and down the San Francisco bay

I can see the boats in the harbor, way across the harbor
Lights shining out, lights shining out
And a cool, cool night
And a cool, cool night
And a cool and a cool
And a cool and a cool, cool night and across the harbor
I can hear the fireworks
I can hear the people, people, people shouting out
I can hear the people shouting out
Up and down the line, up and down the line
And it's almost
And it's almost Independence Day

I can see the lights way out in the harbor
And the cool, and the cool, and the cool and the cool night
And the cool, and the cool, cool night breeze
And I feel the cool night breeze
And I feel, feel, feel the cool night breeze
And the boats go by
And it's almost Inde, Inde, almost Independence Day
And it's, and it's and it's almost, and it's almost Independence Day

Way up and down the line
Way up, way up and down the line
Way up and down the line
Way up, way up and down the line
Way up, way up, way up and down the line
Way up and
Way up and down the line
Way up and down the line
Way up and
Way up and down the line
Way up and down the line
Way up and down the line
Way up and down the line
