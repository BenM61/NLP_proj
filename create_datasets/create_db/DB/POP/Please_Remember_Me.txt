Two sad faces tell the story
Heard so many times before
He is leaving she is staying
Neither of them know what for

There's no laughter there's no crying
There is love there's no denying
Differences led to goodbye and please remember me
And she said-I've got phone and a mail box

A front door that's unlocked
A faith in the feelings there'll be someone you forgot
True I'm gonna miss you, true I'm gonna need you
You know I'm not the one to worry

Oh but I heard the weather report
It says it's gonna be cold and lonely
So honey won't you please remember me
I'm the one that loves you

Please remember me
I'm the one that cares
Please remember me
I'll be thinking of you

And should you ever decide you want to come home
I'll be there
This is like that old love story
Those who've lost love know it's true

She's sitting by a window waiting
He's sitting somewhere wonderin' what to do
They know they should be together
They know they should reconcile

He knew he would regret her saying please remember me
She said-you've got a home and a warm bed
A roof over your head
A place in my heart for someone I'll never forget

True I'm gonna miss you, true I'm gonna need you
You know I'm not the one to worry
Oh but I heard the weather report
It says it's gonna be cold and lonely

So honey won't you please remember me
I'm the one that loves you
Please remember me
I'm the one that cares

Please remember me
I'll be thinking of you
And should you ever decide you want to come home
I'll be there

Oh lover won't you please remember
Won't you please remember me
Ooh lover won't you please remember
Won't you please remember me
