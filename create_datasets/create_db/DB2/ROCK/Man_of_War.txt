Drift all you like
From ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions
And hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone

When you come home
I'll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me
Dressed for the kill
You're my man of war

You're my man of war

And the worms will come for you
Big Boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So unplug the phones
Stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
From poisoned clouds
To poisoned dwarf
You're my man of war

You're my man of war

And the worms will come for you
Big Boots
Yeah the worms will come for you
Big Boots
For you
Big Boots
