A smile is something special,
A ribbon is something rare,
So I'll be special and I'll be rare with a smile and a ribbon in my hair.
To be a girl they notice,

Takes more than a fancy dress,
So I'll be noticed because I'll dress with a smile and a ribbon in my tresses...
The bigger my toothy grin is, the smaller my troubles grow
The louder I say I'm happy, the more I believe it's so

So I'll have that extra something,
Because I know what to wear.
So I'll be special and I'll be rare.
I'll be something beyond compare.
I'll be noticed because I'll wear a smile and a ribbon in my hair
