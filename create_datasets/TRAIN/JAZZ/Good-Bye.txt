There is no great big ending
No sunset in the sky
There is no string ensemble
And she doesn't even cry
And just as I begin to say
That we should make another try
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
There is no big explosion
No tempest in the tea
The world does not stop turning round
There's no big tragedy
Sitting in a coffee shop
With cheesecake and some apple pie
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily
Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
Just two always strangers avoid each other's eyes
One still make believing
One still telling lies
She tells me that I'm not to blame
But when I ask the reason why
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily
Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
