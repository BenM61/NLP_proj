In the shade of the old apple tree
When the love in your eyes I could see
When the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird
Seemed to whisper sweet music to me

I could hear the dull buzz of the bee
In the blossoms as you said to me
With a heart that is true, I'll be waiting for you
In the shade of the old apple tree

In the shade of old apple tree
(Apple tree)
When the love in your eyes I could see
(I could see)
Mama, when the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird
Seemed to whisper sweet music to me
(Music to me)

I could hear the dull buzz of the bee
(Buzz of the bee)
In the blossoms as you said to me
(Said to me)
Mama, with a heart that is true, I'll be waiting for you
Yes, shade of the old apple tree
