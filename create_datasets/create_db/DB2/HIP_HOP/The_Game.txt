Use me as I use you, pull my strings
My money says that you will, that's what I pay you for
Got me served on a plate, do what you want
Show me you care, you're the one in control

The harder you pull my strings, the harder I get
Just a question of time before I lose my mind

It's the game that you play with my head and I can't get enough
Triple sex, almost death, twisted love, the game I cannot bluff
It's the game that you play with my head and I won't get enough
Can't walk away, got to play it all the way

Tight up in this game, this game that I can't quit
Pleasure I get in pain, the pain will keep me sane
Feed my twisted mind, touch my skin with your razor blade
Strip me down to the bone, I'll do anything

The harder you pull my strings, the harder I get
Just a question of time before I lose my mind
The harder you tighten the rope, the harder I get
A slave to my burning desire, a taste of death

It's the game that you play with my head and I can't get enough
Triple sex, almost death, twisted love, the game I cannot bluff
It's the game that you play with my head and I won't get enough
Can't walk away, got to play it all the way
