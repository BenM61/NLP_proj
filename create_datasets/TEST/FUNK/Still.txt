Funny when you stop and think
Times goes faster then you blink
Nothing's ever like it was

But girl we've got a special thing
All the happiness it brings
Is more than enough

I know it's hard to believe
You're still the biggest part of me
All I'm living for

I still think about you
I still dream about you
I still want you 
And need you by my side 
I'm still mad about you
All I ever wanted was you
You're still the one (2x)

It's hard to breathe when were apart
You're like sunshine in my heart
I keep you here inside

You've been everything to me
You've been and always will be
The apple of my eye

And I know it's hard to believe
You're still the biggest part of me
All I'm living for

I still think about you
I still dream about you
I still want you
And need you by my side
I still mad about you
All I ever wanted was you
You're still the one 
You're still the one

If you love me 
Look into my eyes and say you do
I've been waiting all my life 
For someone just like you
Baby all that we've been through
Girl I'm still in love with you
And I want you to know I do, I do

I still think about you
I still dream about you
I still want you
And need you by my side
I'm still mad about you
All I ever wanted was you
You're still the one 
You're still the one
