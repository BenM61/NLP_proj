My first thought was
There are so many days of rain
In Mexico City
A good reason to go
You know I love to run away from sun

Is it time to dance?
I'll fall you know I like to fall
I'm hopeful for
The rush hour car
Stares and
The memory of your piano

Can I feel you? Are you
Mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my
Eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat

The time change worked well
I had a good excuse for being late
But I pushed open the door
The room was empty all the people gone

When the cab pulled up
I laughed, I forgot where I was going
There I stood mystified
I could give no reason for my frozen stare

Am I heading toward you?
It's a hot day
Can I feel you? Are you
Mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my
Eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat

All these perfumes
In this parking lot
Thousands of people pass through
On the festival day
Playing their saxophones
I see a flashing light
I'm blinded by the possibility
