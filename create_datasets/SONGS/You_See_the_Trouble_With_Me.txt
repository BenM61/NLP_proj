I'm like a blind man who lost his way 
I can't see nothin' 
I'm like a deaf man who can't relay 
Yeah, I can't hear nothin' 

You see the trouble with me 
I can't do nothin' without my baby 
And as plain as can be 
It's gonna drive me crazy 

I walk the lonely streets late at night 
Cold and lonely 
Everything I do is wrong, never right 
I'm lonely for her only 

See the trouble with me 
I can't do nothin' without my baby 
And as plain as can be 
It's gonna drive me crazy 

See the trouble with me 
I can't do nothin' without my baby 
And as plain as can be, what do I do 
It's gonna drive me crazy 

See the trouble with me 
I can't do nothin' without my baby 
And as plain as can be, what do I do 
It's gonna drive me crazy 

See the trouble with me 
I can do nothin' without my baby 
And as plain as can be 
It's gonna drive me crazy
