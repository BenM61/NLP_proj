Take it fast, take is slow,
But it won't soften the blow
When it's time to go
May be old, may be scared
But you'll never be prepared
For that final blow

Better use your wits or you'll lose your mind...
There's a world to discover and you're running out of time
Like a roller coaster ride
Took you by surprise
Now you're burnin' up inside

Better make it better, yeah eah
Better make it better,
Better make it better,
Time's running out fast
Make it last

You can scream you can shout,
But when your time runs out
Deep inside you'll know
May be rich, may be poor,
But when you knock on Heaven's door,
Well you have to go

Make the most of what you've got
'Cause it's better than to not have anything at all.
Live each day as it's your last
Or you'll find the future's passed and you're left with nothing at all

Better make it better, yeah eah
Better make it better,
Better make it better,
Time's running out fast
Make it last

Cherish every day each hour each and every single minute
There's no second chance to turn when they start again living your life

Better make it better, yeah eah
Better make it better, oooh
Better make it better, 
Time's running out fast
Better make it better now
Better make it better
Make it last
Better make it better now
Better make it better now

Better make it better, yeah eah
Better make it better, oooh
Better make it better, 
Time's running out fast
Make it last

Better make it better now
Better make it better
Make it better now
Better
