Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
You took all my money and you done me wrong
Staying out all night baby and you won't come home
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?

Oh baby, you know my love is true
Oh baby, you know my love is true
I do everything you tell me to
You won't do anything baby but try to make me blue
Baby, you ought to treat me right

Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Someday baby, you gonna learn that
If you play with fire you're gotta get burned
Baby, you better treat me right
