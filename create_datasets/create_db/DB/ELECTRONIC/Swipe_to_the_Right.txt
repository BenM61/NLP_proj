Like a glove
Hand to hand
We seep together
Like water into sand
The far away is calling
Hello, Hello
I am starring
Following
Caught in your web
Losing my head

You seem so cold to me and yet
You rapture me and I forget
You know my appetite
With just a moment of a swipe
To the right

Swipe to the right
Swipe to the right
Swipe to the right
Swipe to the right

Cypher love
All a glow
Light up your face
With a soft halo
The day to day Is wearing me
I am following
Caught in your web
Losing my head

You seem so cold to me and yet
You rapture me and I forget
You know my appetite
With just a moment of a swipe
To the right

Swipe to the right
Swipe to the right
Swipe to the right
Swipe to the right

You know my appetite
With just a moment of a swipe
To the right
