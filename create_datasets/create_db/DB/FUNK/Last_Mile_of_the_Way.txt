If I walk in the pathway of duty
If I work ?til the close of the day, Lord
I shall see the great king in all his beauty
When I've gone the last mile of the way, Lord, yes sir

When I've gone the last mile of the way, oh yeah
I shall rest at the close of day
For I know there are joy awaiting
When I've gone the last mile of the way

If I were, for Christ to proclaim the glad story, oh Lord
If I see for his sheep who gone astray, oh Lord
I am sure he will show me in his glory
When I've gone the last mile of the way, Lord, yes sir

When I've gone the last mile of the way, oh yes
I shall rest at the close of day, oh yeah
For I know, there are joy awaiting
When I've gone the last mile of the way
