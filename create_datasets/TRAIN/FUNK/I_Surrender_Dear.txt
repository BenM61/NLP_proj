We've played the game of 'stay away'
But it costs more than I can pay
Without you I can't make my way
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud and I may act gay
That's just a pose, I'm not that way.
Cause deep down in my heart I say,
I surrender, dear.

Those little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game
Lending a spice to the wooing
Oh, but I don't care who's to blame

When stars appear and shadows fall
Then you'll hear my poor heart call
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear

Oh, to you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear
