In a hundred wars across the earth,
Men and guns are thought to prove their worth,
Women stay behind and grow the food,
Placing soldiers in a dangerous mood.

Women around the world at work,
Working, working...

There's a man who must be sixty-five,
Makes his living running other lives,
Tells them when they can't and when they can,
They're so busy they don't give a damn.

Women around the world at work...
Working, working...

In The Daily X, May '81,
Back-page human interest story runs:
"GIRLS OF TWELVE STILL SOLD FOR LOVE TODAY",
Just so men can have their bloody way.

Women around the world at work...
