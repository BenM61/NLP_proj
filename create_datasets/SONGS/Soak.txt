Born with a scar far above my head
I count the stars crowding my vision
And I feel nothing instead
I feel nothing instead

Soak in decay, spoil into loam
Give what I take but it never feels enough
So, I give nothing instead
I give nothing instead

Take me to the water
I am not free but I am sorry, I am stone
You should know I would never let you down
You should know I would never let you drown

Loan by the skin, a vessel with two hands
Touch what I can before I hand it in
So, I touch nothing instead
I touch nothing instead

Born into debt, a line of no request
Pay what I can but the rest, I have no chance
So, I pay nothing instead
I pay nothing instead

Take me to the water
I am not free but I am sorry, I am stone
You should know I would never let you down
You should know I would never let you drown

Take me to the water
Let me soak in slaughter
I will sink into the bed like a stone
Take me to the water
Let me soak in slaughter
I will sink into the bed like a stone

Take me to the water
I am not free but I am sorry, I am stone
You should know I would never let you down
You should know I would never let you down
You should know I would never let you down
You should know I would never let you drown
