(Jake Burns)

So you're living on a false reputation
You're a big man in this town
And it seems by your own estimation
That you're a character of renown
But it's all deceptive
Your facade's defective
Yet it's what's expected
When you're really just the same as all of us

You're living on Hope Street
(Living on Hope Street)
You're living on hunger and desire
You're living on Hope Street
(Living on Hope Street)
And I hope that you never loose the fire

Whole lives lived under the burden
The strain of the buying age
Believe me I know it for certain
That you can break from the cage
By holding your head high
Get a little self pride
Self respect on your side
And you'll find that all the doors fly open wide

You're living on Hope Street
(Living on Hope Street)
You're living on hunger and desire
You're living on Hope Street
(Living on Hope Street)
And I hope that you never loose the fire

And all the problems at your door
Don't let them bother you no more
Just take them all down one by one
You'll find they fall apart
If you face them with head and heart
And what was hard doesn't seem so hard no more

You're living on Hope Street
(Living on Hope Street)
You're living on hunger and desire
You're living on Hope Street
(Living on Hope Street)
And I hope that you never loose the fire
