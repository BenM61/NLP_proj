I feel so unsure 
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor 
As the music dies 
Something in your eyes 
Calls to mind a silver screen 
And all its sad goodbyes 

[Chorus] 
I'm never gonna dance again 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
Though it's easy to pretend 
I know you're not a fool 
I should have known better than to cheat a friend 
And waste the chance that I've been given 
So I'm never gonna dance again 
The way I danced with you 

Time can never mend 
The careless whispers of a good friend 
To the heart and mind 
Ignorance is kind 
There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you find 

[Chorus] 

Tonight the music seems so loud 
I wish that we could lose this crowd 
Maybe it's better this way 
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say 
We could have been so good together 
We could have danced this dance forever 
But now who's gonna dance with me 
Please stay 

[Chorus: x2] 

Now I'm never gonna dance again 
Now it's easy to pretend 
I should have known better than to cheat a friend 
Maybe, maybe
