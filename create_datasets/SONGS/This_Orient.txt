And now it's just gone after dark
And we move to the other part of it
Secret part of your restless heart
To glide past every city light
Like a satellite careering through the sky
This colour, this summer night

It's your heart, it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
It's your heart, it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
Do you know, you give me
You give me this western feeling

Now look back see how far you've come
Will you unravel in the sun
Come undone find your place
Held up high said from string as well
No return to that restless place
You've reached it you've found your grace

It's your heart, it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
It's your heart, it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
Oh do you know, you give me
You give me this western feeling

It's your heart, it's your heart
That gives you this western feeling
It's your heart,
That gives you, that gives you
This western feeling

It's your heart,
That gives you, that gives you
This western feeling

It's your heart, it's your heart,
That gives you,
This western feeling

Oh do you know, what gives me
What gives me this western feeling?
Oh do you know, what gives me
What gives me this western feeling?
