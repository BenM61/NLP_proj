It's been so long for us
We've learned to love and trust
Through thick and thin this love will never end
My heart belongs to you
Seems like, just yesterday
We fell in love this way
They say in life that everything must change
But your love still remains

You love me just like the first time
And you hold me just like the first time
And it will always be the first time
For us

My heart still burns for you
And your love it feels brand new
Everyday I want you even more
Than I did the day before
Fire burns so bright
And I love when you're holdin' me tight

Through thick and thin this love will never end
My heart belongs to you

You love me just like the first time
And you hold me just like the first time
And it will always be the first time
For us

Oooooooooooooo yea
And everything's all right with you by my side
And I want you and I need you to be there
Until the morning light
I will hold you...

You love me just like the first time
And you hold me just like the first time
And it will always be the first time
For us
