He had her down in the cellar with a knife pointing at her throat 
He wouldn't let her go oh no, he wouldn't ler her go 
She kicked and screamed 
Someone heard through the walls from next door 
'What's the crack? what's the score?' 
Next door neighbour gave a call 
No one answered, so the boys are coming 
The boys are coming for you 

They'll take you on a holiday 
Maybe to the seaside, maybe they'll just give you away 
They'll drop you off and say goodbye 
You're looking pretty dangerous 
You're looking pretty dangerous tonight 
And nobody knows just quite what you will do next 
So we will send in the boys, the boys are coming for you 

Coppers came heavy handed 
Closed the street and demanded us to stay at home today 
Oh you must stay at home today 
Calm him down, reassure him 
Leave the girl this is stupid, hold your hands up 
We'll get you through this, yeah we'll get you through this 
So the boys are coming, the boys are coming for you 

They'll take you on a holiday 
Maybe to the seaside, maybe they'll just give you away 
They'll drop you off and say goodbye 
You're looking pretty dangerous 
You're looking pretty dangerous tonight 
And nobody knows just quite what you will do next 
So we will send in the boys, the boys are coming for you
