I'm reaching deep within myself
I'm trying to tell you what I know
I even kept the photograph
Of when I nearly let you go
You separate your love for me
From every single one you had
Away with all that's gone before
Let your shoulder fall

I'm coming for your love today
It's lucky that you came this way
I'm loving how I think about you now
For many years it's been so slow
And only now we start to know
Just what it is to shoot out of our minds

I'm shaking like a newborn tree
My idol left without a trace
I never thought you'd understand
You licked the tears right off my face
I couldn't trust the telephone
It doesn't say the lies you mean
Away with all that's gone before
Let your shoulder fall

I'm coming for your love today
It's lucky that you came this way
I'm loving how I think about you now
For many years it's been so slow
And only now we start to know
Just what it is to shoot out of our minds

Waves of sadness came
On the beach today
Hold on now it won't be long
'Till we're on our way

I'm home for national holidays
Let's hook up in a coffee bar
Won't you bring your friend who's lost in space
Don't you worry if it's not your car
I'm joking, and I think you know
I love it when you're playing dumb
Away with all that's gone before
Let your shoulder fall

I'm coming for your love today
It's lucky that you came this way
I'm loving how I think about you now
For many years it's been so slow
And only now we start to know
Just what it is to shoot out of our minds
