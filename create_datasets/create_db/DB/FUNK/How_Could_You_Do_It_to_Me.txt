Hey, my mind is full of sad memories
My heart and soul is full of pain
Oh, I said my mind is full of sad memories
My heart and soul is full of pain

Since I lost your love, baby
Oh, my whole life it don't mean a thing

How could you do it to me, baby?
Didn't you know you would break my heart?
Oh, I wanna know, how could you, how could you do it to me, baby?
Didn't you know you would break my heart? Yeah

I thought you loved me like I love you, yes I did
Oh, but I guess you were playing a part

I, I went to see my doctor
But I stopped outside the door
Cause I knew that he would tell me
What I already know

You see a doctor, he can't fix no heartache
He can't even ease the pain
What I need is your arms around me
Oh, I'll never, never, never be the same

It's a sad situation
I'll tell you I'm blue as I can be, yeah, yeah
When you put your [?] on the plane, baby
Oh, don't you know you put some pain through me

Oh, oh
How could you do it to me?
Oh, no
