I told ya a million times how I Love you.
But honey your old shriveled heart won't let me in.
So I'll just relax here, with this glass of gin,
Headed for the ozone again.

Here we go now...
I'm lost in the ozone again.
I'm lost in the ozone again.
One drink of wine, two drinks of gin...
And I'm lost in the ozone again.

Now the neon lights are shining bright downtown.
There's a thousand swinging doors gonna let me in.
I tucked the kids in bed, he! Eight o'clock and then...
I'm gonna head for the ozone again.

Just watch me...
I'm lost in the ozone again.
I'm lost in the ozone again.
One drink of wine, two drinks of gin...
And I'm lost in the ozone again.

I'm lost in the ozone again.
I'm lost in the ozone again.
Tell me about it now...
One drink of wine, two drinks of gin...
And I'm lost in the ozone again.

One More time now...
I'm lost in the ozone again.
I'm lost in the ozone again.
Now what you drinking?
Well, I'm drinking wine, I'm drinking gin...
And I'm lost in the ozone again...
