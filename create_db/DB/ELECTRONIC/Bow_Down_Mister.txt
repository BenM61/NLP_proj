From Bombay to Bangalore
Al the Hindus know the score
If you wanna live some more
Hare, hare, hare

If you do not take the vow
You can eat the sacred cow
You'll get karma anyhow
Hare, hare, hare

Bow down mister
Hare Rama, Hare Krishna
Bow down mister
We say radha syam

Do the right thing with your hands
Lay down on the pleasing sands
Whatever else your faith demands
Hare, hare, hare

They put kun in their hair
At the westemers they stare

Open like a lotus flower
It's time to check your karma now
Hare, hare, hare
