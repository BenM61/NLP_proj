The time is coming soon to say goodbye
A time of sadness it will be
But honey listen to my parting sigh
And linger on awhile with me

The stars shine above you
Yet linger awhile
They whisper I love you
Oh, linger awhile

And when you have gone away
Every hour seems like a day
I've something to tell you
Oh, linger awhile

The stars shine above you
Yet linger awhile
They whisper I love you
Oh, linger awhile

And when you have gone away
Every hour seems like a day
I've something to tell you
Oh, linger awhile
Yes, linger awhile
