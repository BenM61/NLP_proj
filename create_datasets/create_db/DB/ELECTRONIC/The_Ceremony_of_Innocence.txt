There was a dark
And all this
There was a darkness I liked
Dancing on the sails on dawn
Dancing on the sails and they're gone

I brought this
I brought it for you
I brought the sight, I brought the light
I brought the time you wanted
I brought it like a savior and I
Knew what I couldn't do
Drowning like a savior
And I knew what I couldn't do
So much I could never do

You said it was easy
To see you with your eyes closed
That there was nothing to me
Seeing through me
There was nothing to me
No one knew me
The lightless floor, the closing doors
Falling up, just see me once more
I know I'm scared
