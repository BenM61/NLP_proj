Three months in him
Can't catch the tears
Time never lands
Our love is all that stands now
Streets feel strange
And longer lovers will never change

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I feel out of place
Just look at my face
Stuck in the mud
Knee-deep in blood girl
Eyes, blindfold
You never said I'm growing old

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse
I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

My my my heart is still reliant

Tell them I've gone
And nothing's wrong
In from the past
A sudden blast bang
Spring has gone
And summer keeps on coming on

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse
I'm so glad to have you
And I'm getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse
I'm so glad to have you
And I'm getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I've a plan to save you from my misery
I'm a man too brave to follow history
