If I learned to sing I would in a telephone booth.
Urine, junk and chewing gum looking down on my street.
I'm cracking up I'm happy you noticed.
I wrote a song for all of us I forgot how it feels.

I am a weird superman.
I could not fly but on alcohol I can leap tall buildings.
I'm indestructible yeah you could try but I'm a weird superman.
I have been called.
I have been called.

I'm giving up I'm going under.
She said "I really loved your early stuff"
Wait here for the sequel I'm throwing up.
I'm happy you noticed.
Erode a song for all of us.
I forgot how it feels.

I am a weird superman.
I could not fly but on alcohol I can leap tall buildings.
I'm indestructible yeah you could try but I'm a weird superman.
I have been called.

You won't find out.
You won't find out anyway.
You won't find out because I've bean using my x-ray.
I see through you.
You see through me.
But that's OK (maybe).

I am a weird superman.
I could not fly but on alcohol I can leap tall buildings.
I'm indestructible yeah you could try but I'm a weird superman.
I have been called.
I have been called.
