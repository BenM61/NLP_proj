I hold a vision that all visions are impure
The rising of the serpent the apple and the fall.
Don't trust the angels .may be devils in disguise
Don't trust the preacher. all his words don't make him wise
There are no promises that anyone can keep
The future's full of secrets
The past can never keep

Yes I know, I'm falling down
This incline is far too steep
Tell when I hit the ground
You're too high for me to reach

We can weather unchartered oceans
Though the map reads," lost at sea "
When we breakthrough or get broken
Will you stand here close to me
Close to me

You are the universe and god knows I'm the fool
I've journeyed round the outer worlds to return home to you
I've found a lover knows me better than myself
Sees through all my subtle lies and touches me to health

We can weather unchartered oceans
Though the map reads lost at sea
When we breakthrough or get broken
Will you stand here close to me
Close to me

Here come the choices
It's consume or be consumed
Jump if you feel crazy
And jump if you're a fool
