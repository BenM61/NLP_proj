I keeps that dirty money, I'm talkin' fast cash, I'm talkin' razor shaving,
I'm talkin' duffel bags, I'm talkin' you can count it papi its all there.
I'm talkin' hooking up that slum dog millionaire,
I like the fast girls, who like them fast cars,
Who rather sell it to ya than ask for more tomorrow,
I know those Y-S-L platforms ain't coming cheap,
And plus I like to show I gets it from the streets.

Dressed like I belong on T-V
Settle for less you know that wouldn't be me
Hey now, all eyes on me, hey now,I skipped the line for free,
Hey now, its loud, how it got to be, so hey now, all eyes on me

I see your name in lights, your face on the big screen,
Lets cruise drop the top, you deserve to be seen.
Rockin' those Prada goggles your my next top model,
Your style like Jackie yo now just sit back and let em marvel.
I know you see this paper I bet you count my cash.
Countless trips to sex with her make ? bags,
New kimora purse let that quench your thirst damn right those bitches here
Cause they just had it first

Dressed like I belong on T-V
Settle for less you know that wouldn't be me
Hey now, all eyes on me, hey now,
I skipped the line for free, hey now, its loud,
How it got to be, so hey now, all eyes on me

Jockin' my swag, ill pop tags you'll be borrowing,
No drinks in here y'all thirsty well be swallowing,
Don't matter where I go those haters be following, baby, so hey now

I know what girls like, know whatchu looking for, those ? fittin' right,
You hyped them up some more.
You pulled that hair back, stick that ass out for them boys to see,
You damn near broke your hole from oozing trying to catch a g. Gucci, Fendi, Louis,
Your man don't do that do he.
Now take the stage the floor is yours comeon and make a movie,
Pump that camera mama, rip that runway baby,
Now pop that collar, see them dollars, see them dollar signs, why they hatin'
