Prepare the masses 'cause this means war
And if it's a fight they want, we'll bring the hell they're looking for
With bullets blazing, the cowards hit the floor
Stand up and fight like men, let God decide who's goin'

Now sit back and watch the story unfold
Of the fair Juliet and her Romeo
Two young lovers with one heartbeat
In their devoted grave is where they'll sleep

They are the passion in a city of hate
Watching two families quarrel, ruining lover's fate
You are the ones who took your children's lives
See your two martyr's dying in love's true light, light

Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers married, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips

In every war there will be casualties
Even family members and best friends bleed
Another tally on the body count
So how many more until we're all bled out?

Let's not forget about this tale of love
Replay the story as it's told to us
Life is precious but worth giving away
For ideals of beauty and better days, days

Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers married, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips

I'm killing cousins, revenge I seek
In fair Verona I will lay him down, down to sleep
In desperation, poison becomes
This story's ending in a tomb of lover's trust, trust

Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers married, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips
