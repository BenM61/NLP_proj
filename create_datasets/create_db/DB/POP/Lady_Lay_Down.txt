Too many times I didn't try to hold you
I never kept the promises I told you
Now it's time I give in, I know
To the words that I should have said long ago

Lady, lay down beside me
Wrap your love around me
I need you to stay
Don't turn away from me now
Lady, lay down

You've been alone
I guess I've known about it
You gave me love
And learned to live without it
Now that you've turned to go
Let me beg you to stay
The best way I know

Lady, lay down beside me
Wrap your love around me
I need you to stay
Don't turn away from me now
Lady, lay down
