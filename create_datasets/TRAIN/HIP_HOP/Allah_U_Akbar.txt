 

Verse One: Sadat X 

This is the stick up boom music for styles to flow free 
But y'all know it's me or could you tell by the spree 
The deuce crew of the new, yeah makes the whole shit clear yeah 
Give the question, I'm tired of brothers guessin 
The Nubian brought the X a lot of fame 
But wouldn't it be a shame if it all up and ended 
That ain't the plan I had and shit like that ain't intended 
For the slick headed wonder, wearer of saggy pants 
Old school kicker, reviver of the circumstance 
Got a backpack with a fat stack of fac 
I got a three-oh, so P.O. step back 
I'm with the uptown baldies, kids that were Lords 
Kick for kids that's paid, I kick for kids with no funds 
Whole blocks come for classes kids with contacts kids with glasses 
Hardrock punks crack heads and even trunks 
want to know the truth, so they flock to my roof 
New York I got the grip, I told ya I told ya 
This means war, as if by Sister Souljah 
To think that the X would ever take a fall 
After gettin all of this, man you're crazy 
The only way I'd fall is if I got fat and lazy 
And I won't cause I work real hard 
Wake up in the morning at the hour of God and make beats 
Later hit the streets for some forty-fifth sweets 
So all y'all been told, black youth essential 
From the hard urban blocks of Now Rule residential 
That the God, rocks real hard 

Verse Two: Lord Jamar 

God damn right, the L-O-are-D, J-A-M-A-are 
Says peace and Allah you Akbar 
Back like a motherfuckin head to crack 
Brand Nubian tracks are filled with black facts 
Now I ain't Humpty Dumpty chump, see 
I ain't fallin, you can go call in 
All the king's horses and all the king's men 
Try to knock me off you never see another day again 
My seven-twenty-one-fourteen's ready 
And my scope with the laser beam steady 
So if you're feeling lucky, then come and catch a buck 
How could I kill a man, well I just don't give a f*ck, so 
Check out the dreadlock, make the dead rock 
With my baldhead, aiyyo like the top ten 
We're bound to win, cause God don't like ugly 
You get slugged rushed raped robbed and mugged G 
I don't want to be the man, I just want to make jams 
Cuttin sharp like Edward Scissorhands 
It's ninety-two and of course we grew seeds 
they're planted like a farmer, so let's reap what we sew 
And if you're thinking that we're a hoe in the game 
We gettin wreck to your brain
