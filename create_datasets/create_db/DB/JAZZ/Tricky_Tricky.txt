She likes bars, she likes diamonds too
She likes stars if they rendezvous
She likes champagne to maintain her style
She likes a man only for a while
She likes access to your bank account
She likes dollars, she likes British pounds
She likes money only in high amounts
Baby's cool, she knows what counts

She likes to pay with credit cards
Ride expensive cars, stays in the President Suite
(And)
And every day she is looking for a man
Who can gives her more to satisfy her needs

She is a soulshaker, troublemaker
She is a heartbreaker, undertaker, moneymaker
She is a lovefaker
Soulshaker, troublemaker
She is a heartbreaker, undertaker, moneymaker
She is a lovefaker
Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
She is tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
So damn good

I like holidays when there is nothing to do
I like fun for free and a ice cold brew
I like to watch, football on TV
I like to sleep and wake up around three
I like to hang out with my boys, making lots of noise
Dancing in the club, there is no choice
She will never understand that I can't be her man
I am what I am, so damn

She likes to pay with credit cards

And every day she is looking for a man
Who gives her more, to satisfy her needs

She is a soulshaker, troublemaker
She is a heartbreaker, undertaker, moneymaker
She is a lovefaker
Soulshaker, troublemaker
She is a heartbreaker, undertaker, moneymaker
She is a lovefaker
Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
She is tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
So damn good

Tricky, tricky
Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
(Pretty, pretty)
Tricky, tricky
Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
(Pretty, pretty)

Ohh aah
