MONOLOGUE:  I'll be loving you, babe, only always.  With a real crazy love that's 
true    always.  When these dreams that you've planned.. need a little helpin' hand, 
well, say, honey, I'll understand   always.  Yeah, always!  'cause things may not be 
fair,   always.  But that's exactly when I'm gonna be true   always.  Not for just sixty 
minutes, not for twenty-four hours,  not even for a whole darned YEAR, three 
hundred and sixty-five days, but I mean always!!

Things may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour
And not for just a day
Not for just a year but always
