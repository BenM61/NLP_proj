She Wants To Rock
It's Thuesday night it's twenty to eight
I'm picking up my baby and I'm already late
There's a blond hair beauty in the liquerstore line 
She asked me to share her bottle of wine
It's just my luck would'nt you know
She wants to rock but I gotta roll
We play in the dent'nt got one more show
Pretty little honey's on the ferry front row
Blue jeans skirt climbing way up her knees 
I was crawling on stage she was winkin'at me
It's just my luck would'nt you know
She wants to rock but I gotta roll
She wants to rock but I gotta roll
She wants talked about love but I gotta strole
There's always a way my life go's
She wants to rock I gotta roll
Sittin'in a diner it's three am there's a girl in the corner 
Who's name is Sin 
She wants to take me home and make me feel right
Gotta get home to my sweety tonight
It's just my luck would'nt you know
She wants to rock but I gotta roll
