Just another day
That my Lord, my Lord has kept me
Yes it is
Just another day
That I've been in my saviors care
Yes it is
Wanna say through he do his loving
Arms al around me
And then I found, I found peace and joy

Another day, I've been working in Gods vineyards
Another day, you know it kept me by your side
Another day, I knew just how hard you've been living
He said I want you to sit down and rest a while

When I get on home in my Gods kingdom
And he'll be there, be there with arms spread open
I'm gonna hear him saying, my servant welcome home
