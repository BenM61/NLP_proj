Baby, baby
Please throw this old dog a bone
Baby, baby
Please throw this old dog a bone
Well, well, well, 'cause I'm driftin' and driftin'
Like a ship out on the sea
Baby, baby
I ain't got no place to stay
Baby, baby
Babe, I ain't got no place to stay
Well, well, well, well, well, baby, um
And please throw this old dog a bone
When I first met you, baby
Honey, way down south somewhere, um
Yeah, yeah
When I first met you, baby
Baby, way down south somewhere, um
You didn't go no place, now, baby
But in, church an the Sunday school
Yes, yes
You way up here now, baby
You run around now, baby
Every notoriety joint in town
You up here, up here, now, baby
Run around, every notoriety joint in town
You got to the place now, baby, you
You don't pay me no mind
