One day I looked up and there you were,
Like a simple question looking for an answer.
Now I am the whale listening to some inner call,
Swimming blindly to throw myself upon your shore.

What if I don't find you when I have landed?
Will you leave me here to die on your shore stranded?

I think I know why the dog howls at the moon.
I think I know why the dog howls at the moon.

I sing dela, dela ngyanya dela when I'm with you,
Dela, sondela mama sondela, I burn for you.

I've been waiting for you all my life hoping for a miracle,
I've been waiting day and night, day and night.
I've been waiting for you all my life waiting for redemption,
I've been wating day and night, I burn for you.

A blind bird sings inside the cage that is my heart,
The image of your face comes to me when I am alone in the dark.
If I could give a shape to this ache that I have for you,
If I could find the voice that says the words to capture you.

I think I know, I think I know, I think I know,
I think I know why the dog howls at the moon.
I think I know why the dog howls at the moon.

I sing dela, dela ngyanya dela when I'm with you,
Dela, sondela mama sondela, I burn for you.

I've been waiting for you all my life hoping for a miracle,
I've been waiting day and night, day and night.
I've been waiting for you all my life waiting for redemption,
I've been wating day and night, I burn for you.

Sondela, sondela, mama sondela, I burn for you.

I've been waiting for you all my life hoping for a miracle,
I've been waiting day and night, day and night.
I've been waiting for you all my life waiting for redemption,
I've been waiting day and night, I burn for you.

Burn for you, I burn for you
