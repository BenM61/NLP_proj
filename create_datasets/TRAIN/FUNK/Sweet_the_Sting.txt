With a strut into the room
With his hat cocked sure defiantly
He said "I, I have heard
That you can play the way I like it to be played."
I said, "I can play, anyway that you want.
But first I want, I want to know

Baby is it sweet sweet
Sweet the sting
Is it real this infusion
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so then somebody
Shake shake shake me sane
Cause I am inching ever closer to the tip of this scorpion's tail

He said "I laid my weapons
Down with my pistol
Fully loaded, a hunted man
To my root, will it end
Or begin in your cinnabar juice?"

Is it sweet sweet
Sweet the sting
Is it real this infusion
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so then somebody
Shake shake shake me sane
Cause I am inching ever closer to the tip of this scorpion's tail

Love let me breathe
Breathe you in
Melt the confusion
Until there is
There is your - union
