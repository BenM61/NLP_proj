Tonight Ill treat you like a super star
doesn't matter where we are
Baby doll
As long as I'm with you 
Oh, Ill treat you like a superstar
Drive you around in my fancy car
Baby doll
As long as I'm with you

(Verse I)
Baby girl let me break it down to you
I haven't been quite the man I should've
I didn't do all the things that I couldve
To bring back your smile
All this time I was out there grinding
Trying to make life a little more exciting
Couldnt see I was leaving you behind n
It look me a while

(Pre-chorus)
Girl don't hold a grudge with me
Tonight Ill sweep you off your feet
And make it how we supposed 2 be
I only want you

Tonight Ill treat you like a super star
doesn't matter where we are
Baby doll
As long as I'm with you 
Oh, Ill treat you like a superstar
Drive you around in my fancy car
Baby doll
As long as I'm with you
(Verse II)
Your body, I want to hold
You got my back when then world is so cold
From day 1 I swear I was sold
On you
So Ima do the things that you like
Ill take my time and do it all night
Freak that dress
Then one that I like
Lets ride

(Bridge)
Girl its your night (its your night)
Well do what-ev-er you want to do
Ooh, I will make it right (Ill make it right)
As long as I'm with you (you)
(Bridge)
Girl its your night (its your night)
Well do what-ev-er you want to do
Ooh, I will make it right (Ill make it right)
As long as I'm with you (you)
