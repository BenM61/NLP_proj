As I walk this line, I am bound by the other side
And it's for my heart that I'll live
'Cause you'll never die
Well if you want to know me, I'm a war
Companion

Nothing you can say can tear me away from my guy
Nothing you can do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather, we stick together
I'm telling you from the start, I won't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you can buy could make me tell a lie to my guy
Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy
I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful and I'm gonna
You best be believing, I won't be deceiving my guy

As a matter of opinion I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop
As a matter of taste to be exact
He's my ideal as a matter of fact
No muscle-bound man can tear me away from my guy

If she wants to go, if he wants to go, if she wants to go, if he wants
If he wants to go, if she wants to go, if he wants to go, if she wants
If she wants to go, if she wants to go, if she wants to go, if she wants
If she wants to go, if she wants to go, if she wants to go, if she wants
