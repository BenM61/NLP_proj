I got Aretha in the morning
High on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues in springtime 'cause I know that I'll never have the right shoes

Momma she'd notice but she's always crying
I got no one to confide in, Aretha nobody but you
Momma she'd notice but she's always fighting
Something in her mind and it sounds like breaking glass

I tell Aretha in the morning
High on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues in springtime 'causee I know that I'll never have the right shoes

You got the words, baby you got the words 
You got the words, baby you got the words 

Aretha
Aretha, I don't want to go to school
'Cause they just don't understand me and I think the place is cruel
Child singer, raise your voice
Stand up on your own, go out there and strike out

I tell Aretha in the morning
High on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues in springtime 'cause I know that I'll never have the right shoes
But I got the words
