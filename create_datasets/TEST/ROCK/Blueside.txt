The colors have built up in my mind
They're bleeding through my heart
But nobody knows that they exist
Look at my bursting veins
Now do you see the red in me?
It's a sign for the end
Only the end of the red
Will show you my blue side
I've given my brush and plate 
Where will I paint my life?
And will the buyer in the sky
Believe in what I dream?
It's so hard for me to explain
Only the end of the red
Will show you my blueside
