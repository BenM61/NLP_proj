Silhouettes of a perfect frame
Shadows of your smile will always remain (always remain)
Beginners luck soon fades away, oh baby
We go on, I'll always say

(Long as I live) Long as I live, you will be my
(My first love) oh baby, you and only you
(Long as I live) Long as I live
(My first love) you will be my first love
And I'd choose you again

I'll keep an old candy coated Valentine
Memories of you, you when you were mine
A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain
Times keep changing
Come sun or rain, yeah

(Long as I live) Long as I live, you will be
(My first love) my first love and my only love
(Long as I live) Long as I live
(My first love) you will always be my, only my first love
(Long as I live) Long as I live
(My first love) you will always be my first love
And I'd choose you again

Oh
Oh
A tarnished ring, on a tarnished chain, oh
Times keep changing come sun or rain, yeah

(Long as I live) Long as I live, baby yeah you will always be
(My first love) I'll always love you baby, my first love
(Long as I live) for the rest of my life you will always be
(My first love) only, oh yeah
(Long as I live) oh yeah
(My first love) oh oh
