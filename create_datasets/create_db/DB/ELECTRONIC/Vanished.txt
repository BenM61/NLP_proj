We cling to each other
Like a child and a mother
A desperation of separation
I feel I'm going under

To the left to the right to the middle
My head is spinning around
To the left to the right to the middle
I am going under ground

Untrue as true can be
We're seeking endlessly
No answers for tomorrow
We'll drown in our sorrow

Vanishing horizons
We leave each other cold
I am dying on the inside
No where left to go
The bruises on my skin
Means you held too tight
The evil that you spoke of
Doesn't make it right

I know what you're feeling
I know what you're thinking
I know what you're doing
I know what you're feeling

Vanishing horizons
We leave each other cold
I am dying on the inside
No where left to go
The bruises on my skin
Means you held too tight
The evil that you spoke of
Doesn't make it right
