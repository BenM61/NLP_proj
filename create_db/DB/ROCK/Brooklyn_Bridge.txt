Well I had me a girl with the golden curles she vowed to treat me right
But here I am and I'm all alone on the Brooklyn Bridge tonight
On the Brooklyn Bridge tonight
A thousand thoughts run through my mind as I watch the city lights
My love is gone I'm all alone on the Brooklyn Bridge tonight
On the Brooklyn Bridge tonight
Well it really has been a blue blue day and the water is cold in East River Bay
Water is cold in East River Bay

Standing by the long steal rail looking far below
I've heard the voice that seemed to say darling please don't go
(Darling please don't go)
So I hurried home and waitin' for me standin' by the door
I saw the girl with the golden curls said I'll never leave you no more
I'll never leave you no more
Well it must have been my lucky day cause the water looked cold in East River Bay
The water looked cold in East River Bay
