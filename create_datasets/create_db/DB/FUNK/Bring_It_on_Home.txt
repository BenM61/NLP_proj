Baby
Baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
Done bought my ticket, got my load
Conductor hollered, "All, aboard"
Take my seat way way back
Watch this train go down the track

Baby
Baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
Think about the good times we once have had
Soul got happy, my heart got glad
Think about the way you love me too
Oh you can bet your life, I'm comin' home to you

Bring it on home

Baby
Baby 
Baby 
Baby 

Bring it on home 
Bring it on home
