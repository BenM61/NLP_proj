We are difficult to understand
It was hard to make the simple plan work
Difficult, that's what made it burn

You're a satellite
Around my heart
One million miles before the start
Indescribable, that's what makes it you

Shivers up and down my spine
Feet to the deep
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world

You rage against the dying
Rage against the dying light

You're mysterious, you make no sense
I love you 'cause you're innocent
You fell out through a hole inside the sun

So magnify the best inside me
Fill the parts that you can't find me
The parts that won't give out when things get hard

Shivers up and down my spine
Feet to the deep
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world

Round and round in the setting sun
Round and round in the setting sun
Round and round in the setting sun
Round and round round and round and round

Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world
Inside this big, bright world

Rage against the dying
Rage against the dying light

I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
