I'm gonn'a kiss you in a special way: make me your baby.
I'll find a way to please you every day: make me your baby.

Make me, make me your baby. (doo - aaa)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe (doo - ooo)
You'll see, paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby, (make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby. (make me your baby) oooh

You'll know a love no one has known before: make me your baby;
A love that we would share forever more, when I'm your baby.

Make me, make me your baby. (doo - aaa)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe (doo - ooo)
You'll see paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby, (make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby. (make me your baby)

Make me your baby.
Oh, make me your baby.

Make me, make me your baby (doo - aaa)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe (doo - ooo)
You'll see, paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby. (make me your baby)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and make me your baby (make me your baby)
Can't you see I want to be your baby...
