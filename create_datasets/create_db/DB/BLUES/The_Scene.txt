Now take a look at me
And tell me what you see
I'm only 6 feet tall
But I'm righteous y'all
And I want you to know 
That I'm good to go

(Uh uh oh) ain't you a god
(Nuh uh oh) don't you pass me by
Here I am I'm on the scene 

You're like I just came loose
And I got a shine on my shoes
You don't know my name
But I'm here just the same

(Uh uh oh) I ain't a natural man
(Nuh uh oh) I'm doin the best I can
Here I am I'm on the scene

(Check it out)

I wanna know 
Do you like to get high
I'm too afraid to try
I ain't your fantasy 
But I can shake your tree
And I want you to know 
I'm still good to go

(Uh uh oh) ain't been in the sun
(Nuh uh oh) but I can still get the job done
Here I am I'm on the scene
Yes I am I'm on the scene

I'm on the scene
Yes I am
