featuring Phiness 

Chorus: Phiness 

We came here to party  join together everybody 
Let's celebrate (it's a party goin on) 
It's a holiday (it's a party goin on) 
We came here to party  throw your hands up everybody 
Let's celebrate (it's a party goin on) 
It's a holiday (it's a party goin on) 

[Vinnie] 
Once again  it's on  it's been awhile since you heard the style 
Yes it took a little time but now we worth your while 
To all of you from my crew who been waitin so long, this 
track caps off at that official Naughty bomb shit 
The Ill-town party rhyme sayer 
Depletin MC's like the ozone layer 
May acquire my desires and like vintage wine 
we shall sell no rhyme, before it's time 
I'm, the Nineteen Naughty Nine MC 
Microphone controller, master of ceremonies 
So remember why you hate me 
I'm Naughty By Nature you're Severed By Association 
Which meanin that you FAKE ASS NIGGAZ who connected to them 
SNAKE ASS NIGGAZ, don't come up in my FACE, ASS NIGGAZ 
You try to keep on rhymin like you didn't know 
Naughty By Nature came to save ya from them BULLSHIT shows 

Chorus 

[Treach] 
The Feds pick up the balance, watchin everything that we touch 
But yeah I see the D stuck in the V-S-E-and-G truck 
They watchin us, plan on knockin us, threw binoculars 
My nigga I connect the bottom LOCK to the top of us 
You take the topic, ain't no profit 
But give me a picture, and a compass, and I'll do a Nostradamus 
Find that ass on a quick spot, catch you slippin 
like ice and silk solks, the cover of your album 
be the back of milkbox 
See I'm an iffer hit a shitter like an old timer 
Momma, I dig a vagina like a gold miner 
I'ma, rebel rhymer time trauma minus your momma 
equal a lot less drama, let me talk to you mami 
Maybe you could come to Dirty Jerz, New Jeru, witcha crew 
You bring that ass, I'll bring the brew 
And hit some Thug Passion, and roast some D 
From incense to hash'n, niggaz HOT, talkin bout crashin 

Chorus 

[Phiness] 
Do we (uh-huh, uh-huh) 
Do we 
Do we, dumdum-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb 

[Vinnie] 
So yo the moral of the story in this game called rap 
Either we all gon' clap, or somebody gon' get clapped 
And I'm not down with that, sure as my name's Vin Rock 
In '99 I will officially re-open up the block 
And dedicate my life to preservation of hip-hop 
I'm tired of seein the people of my culture gettin shot 
And now I must step up because I know that's all we got 
I must do it, pursue it, before all the maggots make it rot 
Hip-Hop, it ain't gon' die, it's gon' diversify 
And as long as I'm alive, I'm gon' promote the I 
And no matter how many people try to use or difuse it 
It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music!! 

Chorus 2X 

[Phiness] 
Do we .. doo-wee 
Do we .. doo-wee-yeah.. 
Do we, dumdum-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb
