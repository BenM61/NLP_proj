[Chorus]
Why you want to play around with my heart
You make me feel like you care
Why you want to play around with my heart
My love was there i thought that you cared

Until that day you turned and walked away
Your love was special to me
My heart has fallen apart and i know
That you're the one to blame
You said the love would never change
Then you go out and play

[Chorus]

I never knew that you could put me through
All the pain tha i feel, yeah
Saying sorry won't make it right
'Cause it will never be the same you're the one to blame
Tell me why

Tell me why you're living a lie
You never really loved me, baby
And now my heart is falling apart
You should have told me from the start
That you would break my heart, baby

[Chorus]
