Fe-fe, fi-fi, fo-fo, fum
I smell smoke in the auditorium

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
He's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)

That's him on his knees, I know that's him
Yellin' "seven-come-eleven" down in the boys' gym

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
He's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)

Who's always writing on the wall?
Who's always goofin' in the hall?
Who's always throwin' spit balls?
Guess who (who, me?) Yeah, you!

Who walks in the classroom, cool and slow?
Who calls the English teacher Daddy-O?

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
He's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)

Who walks in the classroom, cool and slow?

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
