Baby, Baby, I just don't know what to do
I fell in love again, but why am I so blue
And darling, darling, it's all because of you
You put a hold on my heart and soul
Leaving me so confused, so confused
Sweet baby, sweet baby, please have mercy on me
I've never loved anyone quite like this before.
First time you, first time me
But I need to know, I need to know 
How long you plan on dragging me through
So much pain, so much hurt
It's so hard to stand on two feet
'Cause it's all about what you're doing to me
So why won't you love me like I need to be
You tell me you love me 
Then you show me something else, 
But I can't blame you 'cause you didn't know how I felt
And I don't know what to do baby, I'm so confused.
And baby, baby, baby 
I don't really wanna bother you
Yo gotta make it right and I mean right now 
Or I'm puttin' on my walkin' shoes
