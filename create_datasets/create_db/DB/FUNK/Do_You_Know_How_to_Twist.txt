Everybody is twisting now
Everybody is learning how
Put on a tight dress
We're on our way
We'll twist til
The break of day

(CHORUS)
Let's twist (let's twist)
Oh, baby, let's twist (let's twist)
If you resist, look what you miss

Baby, if it's late at night
Or if the sun is shinging bright
The twist is the thing to do
It's good for me and you

(CHORUS)

Do you know how to twist
If you don't, I'll show you how
Log on to Top40db.
Do you know how to twist
If you don't, you're out of style

The gang is on the move
They're in a twisting groove
Now that you've got the news
Put on your twisting shoes

Let's twist (let's twist)
Oh, baby, let's twist (let's twist)
If you resist, see what you miss

Do you know how to twist
If you don't, I'll show you how
One more time now
Do you know how to twist
If you don't, you're out of style

thank you
