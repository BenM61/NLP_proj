Everybody always seems to talk about
The light of the hills on fire
Create a hype and then turn it around
You've turned me into a conspire

What to do, who to see
I can tell a joke but this one's on me
Now I'm falling down, falling out
Falling backwards, farther behind you

Don't go, don't be tired
You gave a world then you set it on fire
Unforgiven in the end
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend
Stay and defend

Now everybody always seems to talk about
The sun setting in the west
Do we give up and just enjoy the lights
And say we did our best, we did our best

What to do, who to see
When we both know that we can't agree
Now I'm falling down, falling out
Falling backwards, don't be falling backwards now

Don't go, don't get tired
You gave a world then you set it on fire
Unforgiven in the end
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend

Don't go, don't go
Stay and defend
Don't go, stay and defend
Don't go,  stay and defend

Now everybody always seems to talk about
The light of the hills on fire

Don't go, don't be tired
You gave a world then you set it on fire
Oh, unforgiven in the end
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend

Don't go, don't go
Don't be tired, don't be tired
You gave a word
Set it on fire
Unforgiven in the end
Maybe we run, or maybe we stay and defend
