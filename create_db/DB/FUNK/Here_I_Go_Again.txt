Here I go again.
Watch it now 'cos
here I go again. 

I've been hurt so much before.
I told myself,
yes I did,
no more, no more won't get hurt any more. 

There I was by myself
doin' all right
until I saw you last night. 

And then I knew that
here I go again.
I cannot help it.
Here I go again. 

Making the same mistakes,
heading for more heartaches.
What can I do when there's nothing I can do?
I looked in your eyes and I knew that I was blue. 

What 's the use?
I'll just give in.
Try as I may,
and I do,
I'll never win, never win, baby I'll never win. 

Now, you're here, so close to me.
I can't resist you,
and I knew when I kissed you. 

I'm gonna sing now
here I go again.
Watch it now 'cos
here I go again. 

Falling in love, in love.
Falling in love, in love.
Falling in love, in love.
Falling in love.
