When you know that you know
Who you love, you can't deny it
Or go back, or give up
Or pretend that you don't buy it
When it's clear this time you've found the one
You'll never let him go
'Cause you know and you know that you know

When you feel in your skin, in your bones and the hollow
Of your heart, there's no way you can wait till tomorrow
When there isn't any doubt about it 
Once you come this close
'Cause you know and you know that you know

You can feel love's around you 
Like the sky 'round the moon
This is how love has found you
Now you know what to do

When you know, that you know 
Who you need, you can't deny it
Or go back, or give up
Or pretend that you don't buy it
When it's clear this time you've found the one
You'll never let him go
'Cause you know and you know that you know
Yes baby
And it's time you come in from the cold
And you know that you know

I know that I know
I feel so happy
In my heart
In my soul...
