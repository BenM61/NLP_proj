She walks with a beat as she works 
The street in the dead of night 
She's been laid off 
And her kids must eat 
And his money's right 

A world away beneath the sun 
The earth goes dry 
A hungry starving people search 
For food as their babies die 

I tell you, we can touch the world 
When we meet them all at their need 
We can touch them where they are 
Help them to believe, touch the world 

He's on the pipe and he's got the shakes 
As he takes a puff 
Their badges shine and there's no escape 
As they lock him up 

Fourteen years old and without love 
The girl is livin' wild 
How can it be a four month pregnancy 
And she's the child 

I tell you, we can touch the world 
When we meet them all at their need 
We can touch them where they are 
Help them to believe, touch the world 
I tell you, we can touch the world 
When we meet them all at their need 
We can touch them where they are 
Help them to believe, touch the world 

Round the globe people need to know 
The answer's theirs today, 
Someway 
Somehow 

We must let them know that God 
Gives hope and Jesus is the way
