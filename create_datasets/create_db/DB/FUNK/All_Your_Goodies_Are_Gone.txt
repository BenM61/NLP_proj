"All Your Goodies Are Gone"
I am through with you 
Baby, I refuse to be blue
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat (x5)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel (hurt put you in the loser's seat (x3))

Shame, shame on me
For thinking that I could possibly be
The exclusive one of your choice
In this world infested with boys

Well, now I know that I am first on your list
And if I leave, I'm gonna be missed
I cannot take a chance on you
It's so easy to become number two

And I refuse to be blue
Baby, I'mcutting you lose
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat (x5)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel (hurt put you in the loser's seat (x3))

Let you see how does it feel (let you see how it feels)
To be un-for-real (to be un-for-real)
To be without a love of your own (without a love of your own)
And all your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone) (x2)

So good 
I had known that your love was good
But it don't rectify how I'll cry
If you ever say goodbye

I refuse to be blue
Meaning, I'm cutting you a-loose
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat (x5)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel (hurt put you in the loser's seat (x3))

Let you see how it feels (let you see how it feels)
To be un-for-real (to be un-for-real)
To be without a love of your own (without a love of your own)
And all your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone) (x2)
All your goodies are gone (x10)

Doo doo doo
Oh, lord

So good to you
What's good to you is good to me

Cause whatever makes my mama feel nice
Y'all sing it for me
Whatever makes my baby feel good

All over you
And I'd make you feel good

Just for you
And I'd make it sound good
Oh, early in the morning

Cause whatever makes my mama feel nice
Whatever makes my baby feel good (Whoo! He's gone home!)
Whatever makes my baby feel good (you can't say too much about her)
Whatever makes my baby feel good (play for my baby, brother)
Whatever makes my baby feel good (x4)

 "Presence Of A Brain"
Mmmm, mmm-hmmm
Have you ever felt the presence of a brain?
We have all seen them standing
Amidst the surprise
Sometimes a man smiles
At what, I often wonder
You can tell he's a thinker 
By the far away look in his eyes
The far away look in his eyes

A penny for his thoughts can make you richer
His eyes can see what other eyes could not
What is the power of Napolean
But not mere power, but magnetism
And magnetism is more intelligent than force
Magnetism is more intelligent than force

A duba diba diba duba duba
Bump bump da day ooh ow

Have you ever felt the presence of a brain?
We have all seen them standing
Amidst the surprise
Sometimes a man smiles
At what, I often wonder
But you can tell he's a thinker 
By the far away look in his eyes
The far away look in his eyes

When god's children start thinking together
Learning to live and love one another, hey, hey, hey
  (x6)
