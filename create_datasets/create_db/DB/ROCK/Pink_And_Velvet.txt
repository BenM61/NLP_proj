No more lines tonight
So you want just a loving touch
Hold on to me and you won't hurt so much
I want you to be free
But I can't do it all

I'll wear
Pink and velvet for you
I'll wear tonight
Pink and velvet for you

Lost the only love I knew
Hearing death released you
I need someone to talk to
Who can help at all

I wear tonight
Pink and velvet for you
Where is my shining knight
Pink and velvet for you

No more lines tonight
So I will use my loving touch 
I give nothing for free 
So it won't hurt so much
The needle was our life, our hope 
Our trust
Turning into dust

I wear tonight
Pink and velvet for you 
Are you my shining knight 
Pink and velvet for you
