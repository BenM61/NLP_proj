Brother Jukebox, Sister Wine, 
Mother Freedom, Father Time.
Since she left me by my self,
you're the only family I've got left.
 
I go down to that same old cafe,
where I try to wash my troubles away.
I'm still down and I'm still alone.
But it means staying home all night long.
 
Brother Jukebox, Sister Wine, 
Mother Freedom, Father Time.
Since she left me by my self,
you're the only family I've got left.
 
I go home and I climb that old stairway
and I tell myself tomorrow's  a new day.
But I know I'll just go out again,
spend my time with my new next of kin.
 
Brother Jukebox, Sister Wine, 
Mother Freedom, Father Time.
Since she left me by my self,
you're the only family I've got left.
 
Brother Jukebox, Sister Wine, 
Mother Freedom, Father Time.
Since she left me by my self,
you're the only family I've got left.
You're the only family I've got left.
You're the only family I've got left.
