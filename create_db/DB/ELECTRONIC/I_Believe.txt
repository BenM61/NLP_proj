Shattered dreams, Worthless years
Here am I incased inside a hallow shell
Life began, Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
Living sounds that greet our ears
The sights our eyes befall
We'll open up our merging hearts
And feel our empty souls

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

Without despair, we will share
And the joys of care will not be erased
What has been, must never end
The joys of caring will not be replaced
When the seeds of love are plentiful
They won't be hard to find
And the songs of love I sang to you
Will echo in my mind

Hey!
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. I said.
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. Yeah!
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. Yeah!

I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.
You know god has answered my prayers
Won't you listen to me now
God's soul answered my prayers
Won't you listen to me now
God will answer all your prayers
Just ask him and God's soul will answer all your prayers
Oh come on and lets start and love

Your the woman I've been waiting for
Come on lets start and love
Your the woman that I adore
Don't you want to
Fall in love with me baby
Don't you want to
Fall in love with me this time, this time, this time
Oh, no no no
Don't you want to fall
Don't you want to fall in love
Oh, no no no

This time

O.K. I want you to sing this after me
It will be forever
It will be forever
Don't you want to fall in love
Come on, Come on don't you want to fall in love
With me forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
With me forever
Don't you want to
Don't you want to fall in love with me, baby, Yeah!
Don't you want to
Don't you want to fall in love with me this time, this time, this time
Oh, no no no
