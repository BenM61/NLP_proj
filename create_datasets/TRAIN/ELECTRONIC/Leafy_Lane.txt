Walking down leafy lane 
In a shady dream 
People rushing by 
Finding reason for flight 
But I don't feel that keen 
When the spark in your eye 
Starts to fade 
It's just what you need
Lazy acres 
Under my feet 
Nearly found myself wishing 
You were there 
Reaching out for me 
Waiting for the breeze 
Waiting for the breeze 
And the world of life 
Goes by everyday 
The city fell in silence 
As I began to pray 
I wish you well 
I hope you're safe 
I hope you're stretched out 
A million miles high 
Running down narrow streets 
Narrow minded 
Thinking all I want 
All I need 
People pass me by 
But I feel like the only one 
Stars in the scarce low light of winter 
I could leave again 
Lock into that big one 
Escape to open places 
But I won't undermine 
The truth may come home 
Through the windows in the wall 
Reaching out for me 
Waiting for the breeze 
Waiting for the breeze 
And all that is beauty 
Floats around in suspended air 
The life with no ending 
The fearless love is there 
Waiting for the breeze
