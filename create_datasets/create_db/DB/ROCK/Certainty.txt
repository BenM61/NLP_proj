I've got, I've got, the picture and the details
Outside, under within the sights
We stand, we land the form of parallelogram
On the sun to the Netherlands
We appear and go on

Tonight, the bridge is growing to the other side
Onto, off and beneath the sun
You land lone there disposed to nether Netherlands
In a boat to the Netherlands
We appear and recall

The way is a way, think slowly
The sun is standing lighted

I want to know that certainty's in my life
I want to know that certainty's in the light
I want to know that certainty's in my life
Isn't lonely and more defined

You've got, you've got the mission and the pieces
In hand off beneath you stand
We turn we make the sceens to nether Netherlands
On the sun to the Netherlands
We appear to rule

The way is a way, think slowly
The sky turning, sending light in

I want to know that certainty's in my life
I want to know that certainty's in the light
I want to know that certainty's in my life
Isn't lonely and more defined
