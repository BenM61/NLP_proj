My, how you've grown
I think I'll call you on the telephone
And tell you all the things that I've been missing

Turn out the lights
Where we're going we don't need 'em tonight
We're at your daddy's home but he's not listening

You make me crazy when you
Talk like that
I might go crazy when you
Talk like that

You know I love it when you
Talk like that
And girl I'm crazy when you
Talk like that
You make me crazy when you

Our time has come
Start of the race and we're ready to run
We're on a roll tonight and you won't fight it

Don't like to see
Sitting (?)
They ought to try sometime they might just like it

Talk like that
I might go crazy when you
Talk like that

A little creepy when you
Talk like that
Girl I love it when you
Talk like that
You make me crazy when you

You make me crazy when you
Talk like that
I might go crazy when you
Talk like that

A little scary when you
Talk like that
But kid I love it when you
Talk like that
You make me crazy when you
