Cypress Hill, Cypress Hill

Crusing through the neighborhood
Some say I'm no good
Claimin' I'm a criminal
But lets make it understood
I'm just one man man with a whole lot of homeboys
(Whole lot)
You get the click of the Glock
When I pull of the chrome toy
Check me and I'll check you back
(Check you back)
Then jump back to the big Buddha
Like I'm not a bad guy
But don't take advantage
I'm throwin' out the garbage
Just show me where the can is
All I was doin' was searchin' for the boom
Then some punk tried to hit me with a broom
Lucky I ducked quick
Or else I'd be assed up
Last thing I wanted
Was have to pull the gatt out
Here comes a nigga
And he's got a 38
Well my roundhouse said
Hey yo, I'm shootin up straight

'Cuz I put away the shotgun
Borrow me a Glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me
But homie got shot
La la la la la la la la

Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense

Couple niggas from the east side
Fuckin' up your program
No one witnessed
But they heard the gun blast
It left the problem unsolved
Now I'm gonna sum up
People gettin' hurt in the process of the come up
Gotta with the fools
That'll wait for you to run up
Rollin' in the hood
That's already shot up
Pocket full of gatts
And see if we can spot the
Homie that's slick
In the process of the dip
When we find this out
Gonna unload the clip
Then take a little trip down to Rio
Neighboorhood's hot, so I got to go chill

'Cuz I put away the shotgun
Borrow me a Glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me
But homie got shot
La la la la la la la la

Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense

Kickin' that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll load a clip
Lets see if you can deal with
'Cause the bulletproof vest ain't shit
When the infra-red's
Pointin at your head, kid
And that's just too bad yo
Now I'm headed up a river in a boat
With no paddle
Should 'a put the Glock down
(Glock down)
Now they got me in lock down
Livin' like a nigga whose done lost his mind
'Cuz self defense turns to the offense
But nobody even really knows that
(Knows that)
All they see is me and the gatt
Up in the court room
Lookin at the jury
Starin' down the punk ass
District attorney
La la la la la la la la
Verdict's in
You're not guilty as charged

When I put away my shotgun
Borrow me a Glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me
But homie got shot
La la la la la la la
