A Bebop Baby  A Bebop Baby
A Bebop Baby she's the gal for me
She's got plenty of rhythm got plenty of jive
And when we dance I really come alive
My love for her is so tender and sweet
My heart starts pounding every time we meet
 
My Bebop Baby still in her teens
Just as sweet as she can be
My Bebop Baby in her old blue jeans 
Is the Bebop Baby for me
A Bebop Baby for me
 
A Bebop Baby  A Bebop Baby
A Bebop Baby she's the gal for me
I'm gonna find her tonight
I'm gonna have a time
I want that baby to be mine all mine
A big day is comin' for my baby and me
The day she says she belongs to me
 
My Bebop Baby still in her teens
Just as sweet as she can be
My Bebop Baby in her old blue jeans 
Is the Bebop Baby for me
