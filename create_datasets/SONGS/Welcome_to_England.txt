Do a dance for me
Baby it is ?
Don't want ?
Let the liquid take off what you won't or (your on)

You've been down before
Boy and I like this
I'm in quicksand
I am sinking fast

Perfect, heal it
Because your other half has got himself
A devil's excess or Access

Welcome to England, he said
Welcome to my World

You better bring your own sun, sweet girl
You gotta bring your own sun
Don't you forget your
Bring your own sun
Just enough for everyone

Heels on, go on
Bang a or(men can) tango but do not get tangled
Who can stay strong
When they only give us lies to lean on

When your heart explodes
Is it deathly cold
You must let the colors violate the
Blackness or (Blankness), the rest
A magic world in parallel
So leave your daily hell

Welcome to England, he said
Welcome to my World

It's not a question, if I care (or can)
Fight by your side
And we'll stand (or and withstand)
Anything but
But I forgot
That you said, girl
If you come

You better bring your own sun, sweet girl
You gotta bring your own sun
Don't you forget yours
Bring your own sun
Just enough for everyone

Welcome to England
