If I could trace the lines that ran 
Between your smile and your sleight of hand 
I would guess that you put something up my sleeve 
Now every time I see your face the bells ring in a far-off place 
We can find each other this way I believe

From the hills and up behind, my town 
Is naked from the horizon down 
The curvature is pressed against the raise 
We walked up in the fields alone 
And the silence fell just like a stone 
That got lost in the wild blue and the gravel gray

Come and find me now

Though I'm here in this far off place 
My air is not this time and space 
I draw you close with every breath 
You don't know it's right until it's wrong 
You don't know it's yours until it's gone 
I didn't know that it was home ?til you up and left 

Come and find me now 

I keep you in a flower vase 
With your fatalism and your crooked face 
With the daisies and the violet brocades 
And I keep me in a vacant lot 
In the ivy and forget-me-nots 
Hoping you will come and untangle me one of these days 

Come and find me now
