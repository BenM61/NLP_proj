Rock star, sing my song
Be my brand new toy
You're a Marvel Man
A fallen poster boy

Rock star, sing my song
Make me yours alone
You're the highest high
The lowest of the low

You look down at me
I hear in whispers what you want
Seeing where you go
I follow on the spot

I want to know you I want to know your name
Push me to the wall
I want to know you I want to know you'll stay
I know I'm going to want it all
I want to know you I want to know your name
Sacred and profane

Rock star, sing my song
So close I hear you breathe
I love you Marvel Man
And your obscenity

You look down at me
All wrong, so real
How do you know me
And everything I feel

I want to know you I want to know your name
Push me to the wall
I want to know you I want to know you'll stay
You know I'm gonna want it all
I want to know you I want to know your name
Sacred and profane

I want to know you I want to know your name
Push me to the wall
I want to know you I want to know you'll stay
I think I'm gonna have it all
I want to know you I want to know your name
Sacred and profane
