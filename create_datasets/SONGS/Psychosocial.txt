I did my time, and I want out
So effusive fate
It doesn't cut,
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Back at you, subversion
Pseudo-sacred with psycho virgin
Go drill your deserts,
Go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth
With all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
Undone, it has begun
I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all,
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see,
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

Oh, there are cracks, in the road we lay
From where the devil fell
The secrets have gone mad!
This is nothing new,
But would we kill it all?
Fate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes
And say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness,
But a message to bring
I think we're done
I'm not the only one!

And the rain will kill us all,
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see,
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

The limits of the dead,
The limits of the dead,
The limits of the dead,
The limits of the dead,

Fake and defenseless lie,
I tried to tell you first,
Your hurtful lies are given out,
Can't stop the killing idea,
If it's hunting season,
Is this what you want?,
I'm not the only one!

And the rain will kill us all,
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see,
The preservation of the martyr in me
And the rain will kill us all,
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see,
The preservation of the martyr in me

The limits of the dead,
The limits of the dead
