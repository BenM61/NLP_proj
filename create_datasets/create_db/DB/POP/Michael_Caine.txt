(I am Michael Caine)

He's walking where I'm afraid I don't know
I see the firemen jumping from the windows
There's panic and I hear somebody scream
(aaaah)

He picks up useless paper
And puts it in my pocket
I'm trying very hard to keep my fingers clean
I can't remember tell me what's his name

(My name is Michael Caine)

And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep

The sun is laughing its another broken morning
I see a shadow and call out to try and warn him
He didn't seem to hear
Just turned away

The quiet fellow follows and points his fingers
Straight at you
He had to sacrifice his pride yes throw it all away

(I am Michael Caine)

And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep

His days are numbered he walks round and round in circles
There is no place he can ever call his own
He seems to jump at the sound of the phone

Staring out the window there's nothing he can now do
All he wanted was to remain sane
He can't remember his own name

(My name is Michael Caine)

And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep
And all I wanted was a word or photograph
And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep

And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep
And all I wanted was a word or photograph
And all I wanted was a word or photograph to keep
