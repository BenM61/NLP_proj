Remembering so well 
The day that I met you 
You took me in your arms 
And caused dreams to come true 
From the fear of what would be 
You came and rescued me 

[Chorus]
Lord I pray today 
For the rest of my life 
Live inside my heart 
Please stay 
For always 
Til that timeless place 
When we're face to face 
And we'll embrace 
For always 

I look ahead and see 
The hills that I must climb 
Some high and some low 
But if you lead I'll go 
And at the end I'll see 
You were always there with me 

[Chorus: x 2]
