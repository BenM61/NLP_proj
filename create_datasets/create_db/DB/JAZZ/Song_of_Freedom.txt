Freedom, freedom
That's my song for today
Listen to this American troubadour from the U.S.A.

I'm singing a song of freedom
For all people who cry out to be free

Free to sail the seven seas
Free to worship as we please
If the birds up in the trees can be free
Why can't we?

I'm bringing a song of freedom
To all people wherever they may be

Free to speak and free to hear
Free from want and free from fear
Sons of freedom far and near who agree, sing with me
That all God's children shall be free
