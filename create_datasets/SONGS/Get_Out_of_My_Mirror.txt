I know, honestly
What's wrong with you and me
There's no space, we can't breathe
Get out of my mirror so I can see
When it comes to push and shove
Your hand is bare, I wear the glove
At this point you might disagree
Get out of my mirror so I can see

There's rows of spotlights shining on me
Turn them off, don't invade my privacy
Turn a stone into sand and watch it bleed

I liked how it used to be
There was no strain on you or me
We'd come and go as we pleased
Get out of my mirror so I can see
