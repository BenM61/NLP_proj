What's inside your heart can't be concealed
'Cause now or then you'll find, you reveal it

So bring your body close to me, and let me make it right
'Cause I can see forever in your eyes

Take this love, baby love me tender
Take this love
All I wanna do is give my love to you

Don't be afraid to give your all
If something is this good, can't be wrong, oh baby, must be right
If it's real inside our hearts
Just look into my eyes, you can see it

So bring your body close to me, and let me make it right
'Cause I can see forever in your eyes
