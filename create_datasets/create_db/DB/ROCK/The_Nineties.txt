No way I'm ready for 2001
Some things have got to change before that day comes
It's touch and go, excuse me have you got the time
We know what happened here we don't need a judge

When someone shouts "incoming" now it's, here comes the sun
And we don't have to wait 'til 1999
So are you ready for some changes
And if we're gonna do it, let's be dangerous

So when the nineties come
We'll do what must be done
And when the nineties come
We'll sing a different song

I don't know to patch a hole in the sky
I only know that we had better try
This is the game and you don't have to qualify
We only get one chance so let's make it good

Unless you think you'll need some firewood
And we can hardly wait 'till 1999
So are you ready to make some changes
And if we're gonna do it, let's be dangerous.

So when the nineties come
We'll do what must be done
And when the nineties come
We'll sing a different song
