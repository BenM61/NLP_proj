Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry (so lonely)
Nowhere to go, nothing to do with my time
I get lonely, so lonely, living on my own

Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast (so lonely)
And everything is coming down on me, down on me
I go crazy, oh so crazy, living on my own (living on my own)

Dee do de de, dee do de de
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de de, dee do de de
I get so lonely lonely lonely lonely yeah Got to be some good times ahead

Sometimes I feel nobody gives me no warning
Find my head is always up in the clouds in a dream world
It's not easy living on my own, my own, my own

Dee do de de (lonely) dee do de de (lonely)
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de de, dee do de de
I get so lonely lonely lonely lonely yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Dee dup de dup de dup, come on baby!

Dee do de de, dee do de de
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do dc de, dee do de de
I get so lonely lonely lonely lonely yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Dee dup de dup de dup, hey

Living on my own, living on my own
Living on my own, living on my own, oh!
