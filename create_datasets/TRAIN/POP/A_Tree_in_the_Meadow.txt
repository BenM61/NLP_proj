There's a tree in the meadow
With a stream drifting by
And carved upon that tree I see
"I love you till I die"
I will always remember
The love in your eye
The day you carved upon that tree
"I love you till I die"
But further on down lovers' lane
A silhouette I see
I know you're kissing someone else
I wish that it were me
By that tree in the meadow
My thoughts always lie
And wherever you go, you'll always know
I love you till I die
