Sometimes you have no choice
Sometimes you've got no voice to say
Say if you will the words
Say if your world is so gray
We can decide this
There'll be no tears
No tradgedy
Sure I wouldn't break and cry, if...
You walk away
Believe me

Hey, goodbye
Goodbye is forever
Hey, forever
Goodbye is forever
And ever...

Sometimes it makes no sense,
This side of cruel coincidence
Caught up in our own barbed wire
To set us free
Believe this

Hey, goodbye
Goodbye is forever
Hey, forever
Goodbye is forever
And ever...
