Doctor doctor tell me if you can
What is wrong with me
I can't seem to find the key
Doctor doctor I'm begging on my knees
Won't you tell me please
What could be my malady?

When I'm down feeling kind of low
I don't want to be the last to know
When I'm down crawling cross the floor
I don't want to be, I can't stand to be
The last to know

Doctor doctor help me through the day
Give me something natural I can depend on
Doctor doctor it's something that I need
It's a natural panacea
Like a cure for every fear
It's some of her sweet love
Mixed up with her young blood
True love and devotion
What a wonderful potion
Tonight, tonight

Doctor doctor why am I alone
Listening to my heart
Beating through the cold dark night
Doctor doctor I'm shaking in the gloom
Could this be defeat
Please don't stop, don't miss a beat

When I'm down feeling kind of low
I don't want to be the last to know
When I'm down crawling cross the floor
I don't want to be, I can't stand to be
The last to know

Doctor doctor help me through the day
Give me something natural I can depend on
Doctor doctor it's something that I need
It's a natural panacea
Like a cure for every fear
It's some of her sweet love
Mixed up with her young blood
True love and devotion
What a wonderful potion
Tonight, tonight
