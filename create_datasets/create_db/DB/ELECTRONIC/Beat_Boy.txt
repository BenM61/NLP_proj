The siren screams to start the day
You get up early to earn your pay
Push the button throw that switch
Turbines roar their unholy pitch
I listen I can hear
Pounding like thunder
Pistons push the steel on steel
Steam filled air turns the wheel
The wheel in turn takes the strain
Pounds the beat again and again
[Chorus:]
Metal on metal
The feeling of steel
Someone is driving
But you've got the wheel
The workers sing the same old song
Machines in motion they're never wrong
You think in time you will be free
But a factory man is what you'll be
I listen I can hear
Pounding like thunder
Pistons push the steel on steel
Steam filled air turns the wheel
The wheel in turn takes the strain
Pounds the beat again and again
[Chorus]
Angry young men look to the west
Speak for yourself you'll pass the test
Fortune beholds the brave so they say
Questions unanswered the risk they might pay
I listen I can hear
Pounding like thunder
[Chorus]
Fade
