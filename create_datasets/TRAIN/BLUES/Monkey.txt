Hey little lady have you got a cigarette to spare
I like your high heels and the shade of your hair
All those secrets you promised not to tell
I'll monkey on you baby, you've got me in your spell
I'm like a monkey up a tree
I'm like a monkey you will see
I'll monkey on you baby
If you monkey on me
Do you fancy drivin' to the house of ????
And I was made for lovin' and I'm lovin' you
You say you're a student, well understudy me
I'll monkey on you baby if you monkey on me

(- guitar solo -)

Those goody-good girl looks have bowled me over clean
Not exactly our love but then I'm not really keen
Imagine we're walkin' alone along the sand
I'll monkey on you baby and I want to hold your hand
I'm like a monkey up a tree
I'm like a monkey you will see
That I'll monkey on you baby
Tell me that you'll monkey on me
I'll monkey on you
If you monkey on me
I will monkey on...
