Are they laughing "at or with me"
Oh, baby those are such great shoes
And I think that I'm so happy now
And I think this is a better you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are they laughing at or with me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why can't we just say what we mean

People are just trying to fit in
But is there something telling you
You can't trust anyone in this town
Oh, baby those are such great shoes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are they laughing at or with me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why can't we just say what we mean

Don't put your money where your mouth is baby
We don't want to see you choke
Nobody's joking around here anymore
Nobody's broking any high scores
No dancing shoes have touched these dusty floors
For such a long long time
For such a long long time
For such a long time

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are they laughing at or with me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why can't we just say what we mean

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
