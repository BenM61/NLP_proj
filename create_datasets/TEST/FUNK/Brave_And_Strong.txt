Frightened faces to the wall
Oh can't you hear your
Mama call?

The Brave and Strong Survive!

When you walk
Know where you're walking
When you talk
Know who you're talking to

Brave and Strong Survive! Survive!

Out and Down
Ain't got a friend
You don't know who turned You in
The Brave and Strong, Survive!

Brave and Strong
Survive!

Before me was a Cowboy star
Indians!
And there you are

The Brave and Strong, Survive!

The Brave and Strong, Survive Child!

Yeh Jones, Survive
