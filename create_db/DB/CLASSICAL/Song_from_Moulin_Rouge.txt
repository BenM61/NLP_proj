When ever we kiss
I worry and wonder
Your lips may be near
but where is your heart?

It's always like this
I worry and wonder
You're close to me here
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts
When we kiss, do you close your eyes
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell
this cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell, darling
where is your heart?
