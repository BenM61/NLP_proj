I walk across the rooftops
I follow a broken Thread
Of white rags falling slowly down
Flags caught on the fences
I am in love, I am in love with you
I am in love, I am in love with you
I walk across the rooftops
The jangle of Saint Steven's bells
The telephones that ring all night
Incommunicado
I am in love, I am in love with you
I am in love, I am in love with you
The traffic lights are changing
The black and white horizon
I leave the quiet redstone
And walk across the rooftops
I walk across the rooftops
On graduation day
To look for independence, yeah
I am in love, I am in love with you
I am in love, I am in love with you
The lights are always changing
The black and white horizon
I leave the redstone building
And walk across the rooftops, yeah
I walk across the rooftops
I walk across the rooftops
I walk across the rooftops
