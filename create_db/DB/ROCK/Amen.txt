Amen:

Amen-there's a ring around the
Moon
I'm going to fly all night down to see
You

there's a road drifting through the
Mountains
I'm gonna fly down that road
Till I get to where I'm going- Amen

there's a light inside my chest
That switched on when we first met
And it will not let me rest- Amen

and the silvery moon so fine
And the air tastes like wine
And the road slips and slides
Amen...

there's a road slipping through the
Mountains
I'm gonna fly till I am there
I'll put a kiss behind your ear-
Amen...
