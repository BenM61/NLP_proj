I've been alone and gone too far
For so long I can see what you are
And I've been accused of being hard
Of hibernating in my yard

But if you could see me now
You should see me now
I got my feet back on the ground
If you could see me now
You should see me now
If you could see me now
You should see me now
If you could see me now

You were always just a bit ahead of me
But I was never far behind
Though I watched you running
I looked the other way
But you well you went away

But if you could see me now
You should see me now
I got my feet back on the ground
If you could see me now
You should see me now
If you could see me now
You should see me now
If you could see me now

Craved your initials in my tree
But not as deep as you cut me
Well I wept at the way you walked out on me
I lit cigarettes and cigarettes
Lit incense made no sense
I laid down on straw and sawdust

But if you could see me now
You should see me now
I got my feet back on the ground
I got my right foot out in front of me
My head's makin' up with my heart
There ain't a thing in this world I can't do
Without you
If you could see me now
You should see me now
If you could see me now
