Goodbye to the summer 
Sold down the river 
Unhappy ever after 
Well did you ever? 
Did you ever reach for the 
Glued down penny? 
Same old joke and it's not funny 
Burns are red bruises blue 
Out with the old cheated by the new 
Do you suffer from long term 
Memory loss? 
I don't remember
You sing the same old verse 
Stick like glue for better or worse 
What goes around comes around 
Again again again 
This heart pulled apart 
Hydra fighting head to head 
Burns are red bruises blue 
Out with the old cheated by the new 
Do you suffer from long-term 
memory loss? 
I don't remember.
Amnesia 
Do you suffer from long-term 
Memory loss? 
I don't remember.
