Everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

There was a little girl I had planned to marry
This was my love I didn't want to share it
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn't love me 'cause he didn't have no money

So, everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

I got me a girl
I guess I really loved her
Every night now I was thinking of her
But you can't mix love with money
'Cause if you do it's gonna hurt somebody

So, everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

Although I know that she's just a poor girl
Is it wrong to love 'cause he's not a rich boy?
Every time you mix love with money
Every time you hurt somebody

So, everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry

Everyday I have to cry
Everyday I have to cry
Oh, oh
