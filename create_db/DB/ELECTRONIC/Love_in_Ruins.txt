Show me how we move
Now I'm learning
Three is more than two
You are the one I see
You are a half of me
As much as we bare our souls, we're animals
I'm aching to see my boy lose control

I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
But I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?
I know that we could leave our love in ruins
Or maybe we should both be unafraid
I wanna see you bend the rules
Me and you
(Stop hiding yourself away)

I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
But I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?

Show me how she moves
All this time and
We're too strong to lose
And I promise you
You are the one I see
You are a half of me
As much as we share our souls, we're animals
I'm aching to see my boy lose control

I know we might refuse
Honey, your love
Life is a breeze

I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet (six feet)
I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?
I know that we could leave our love in ruins
Or maybe we should both be unafraid
I wanna see you bend the rules
Me and you
(Stop hiding yourself away)

(So why don't we play a game?)
(Hiding yourself away)
I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?
