(So be careful of stones that you throw)

Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's lo-o-ow
So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw

A neighbor was passin' my garden one time. She stopped and I knew
right away that it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind. And this is what I heard
my neighbor say-"You know, that girl down the street should be run from our midst. She
drinks and she talks quite a lot. She knows not to speak to my child and me." My neighbor
then smiled and I thought

Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's lo-o-ow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw

Just then a car speeded by in the screamin' of brakes-a sound that
made my blood chill. For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
and saved by a girl lyin' still. The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out "Oh,
who was that brave girl so sweet?" I covered the crushed broken body and said
"The bad girl who lived down the street."

So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw
