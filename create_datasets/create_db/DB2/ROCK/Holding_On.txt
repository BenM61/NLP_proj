Once I was alive and I could feel
I was holding on to you
And I redefined the way I looked at dawn inside of you

I went down a crooked highway
I went all outside the line
I've been rejected, now the light has turned and I'm out of time

Ain't no way I'm gonna last
Hiding in the seams, I keep moving past
Feel like I'm about to crash
Riding on my line, keep keeping on, yeah, ooh

Once we were apart and I could see red
Never trying to turn back time
Never meant to bring my pain into the front and into your life

Now I'm headed down a different road
Can we walk it side by side?
Is an old memory just another way of saying goodbye?

Ain't no way I'm gonna last
Hiding in the seams, I keep moving past
Feel like I'm about to crash
Riding the same line, I keep keeping on, yeah, ooh

I ain't never going to change
He never gonna learn
I keep moving on the path, yeah
Holding on to mine

When you talk about the past
What are we talking of?
Did I let go too fast?
Was I holding on too long?

Ain't no truths from the past
As silent as the sea
Am I holding on too long?
But you're right in front of me

And I'm moving on a cast
Shadows on my seam
I keep moving to changes, yeah, ooh

Heart or hope
Heart or hope
Heart or hope
Heart or hope
