I fell in love with you so deeply
I never thought it'd be so hard
'Cause I'm a man whose art is dreaming
I should have told you from the start

When it comes to love it?s always complicated

You don't know how to deal with it but I do
Cause everything I do I do just for you
You don't know how to handle it but I do
Just leave it up to me I've got love for two

The way I'm smiling makes me crazy
You're the brightest of the stars
Seems I'm that infatuated
That loving you could be so hard

Ohh no

When it comes to love it's always complicated

You don't know how to deal with it but I do
'Cause everything I do I do just for you
You don't know how to handle it but I do
Just leave it up to me I've got love for two

I got love for two

(you don't know how to deal with it but I do
You don?t know how to handle it but I do)

But I do

Ooooh

Forever is the moment we might miss
I can't help but wishing you were mine
But instead its just the wishes I kiss
My whole life is running out of time

You don't know how to deal with it but I do
'Cause everything I do I do just for you
You don't know how to handle it but I do
Just put your trust in me I've got love for two

You don't know how to deal with it but I do
And everything I do I do just for you
You don't know how to handle it but I do
Just put your trust in me I've got love for two

You know I've got love for two

Got to deal with it baby
Say you got to deal with it
