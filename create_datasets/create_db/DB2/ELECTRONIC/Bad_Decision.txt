Don't know what's happening
But this ain't what I'm about
It's only been a week
And I'm parked outside of your house
I ain't tryna creep
Just let me in and hear me out
'Cause its about to go down

I'm not thinking straight
Since I'm stuttering and slurring my speech
I could be your slave
You got me like a dog on a leash
Ain't too proud to beg
Your body makes me wanna believe
And I'm down on my knees

Take out all my money from the bank
Take you round the corner buy a ring
You're all up in my head
But I ain't even mad
You make me wanna make a
Bad decision

Lets book a shopping trip
Maybe I could charter a jet
And I don't give a shit
If I never get outta debt
I say you'll be my girl
And I promise you I'll handle with care
What you doin' to me?

Take out all my money from the bank
Take you round the corner buy a ring
You're all up in my head
But I ain't even mad
You make me wanna make a
Bad decision

I took you to the jeweler
Told you pick a ring
I took you to the dealer
Told you pick a Range
I took you to the parlour
Spent a hundred dollars
On a tattoo of your name and your face
And when all the cash out
Credit card maxed out
Buy myself a house
Baby you the realest date
See I don't even stress for a sec
'Cause your lovin' is the best
If I just make a bad decision

Take out all my money from the bank
Take you round the corner buy a ring
You're all up in my head
But I ain't even mad 

(You make me)
I wanna make make a bad decision 
(You got me)
Confess and make you my new religion
(You make me, you make me)
