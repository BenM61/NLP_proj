It's a real life story that never was
 Tomorrow's scandal for true love
 And how one man learns to rise above
 The ball and chain
 It's either a bust or the big chance
 A struggle for wealth and romance
 So tired of trying to understand
 This dirty game
 I see my arms start to open
 I feel my heart want to hold them
 I know that I'll never be the same
 I want a kiss
 I want to do a dance
 I want to live
 I want to lay down and raise up
 And feel like I can start again
 No satisfaction guarantee
 It's just the way things turn out to be
 No sentimental nights left to haunt me
 In my sleep
 I believe in making the action
 Just a little more sex and distraction
 A I can live the everlasting
 Fantasy
 Only now can love make a difference
 Crying out as I stop to listen
 Never quite believing all that I see
