You may not know how to make words rhyme,
Carry a tune, or clap on time now
You may have no knowledge, you musical thing
But deep down inside of me,
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song that my heart sings
You may not know what quarter notes are
Or what I mean by "four to the bar" now
Such musical terms may be Greek to your ears
But deep down inside of me,
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song that my heart hears
Now, it's a tender song
It's like a rhapsody, a symphony
This song I find in this heart of mine
And it's begging you let nothing keep us apart
Oh, my darling, 'cause you put a song in my heart
Ooh, ooh
Now, this song that I find in my heart for you
Every lyric and line, I swear it's true
The number one song on my personal chart
Deep down inside of me,
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song that's in my heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Deep down inside of me,
You have created a symphony
You're the composer (you're the composer)
You put a song in my heart (you're the composer)
You put a song in my heart (you're the composer)
