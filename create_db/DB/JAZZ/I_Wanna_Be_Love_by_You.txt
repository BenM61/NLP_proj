I want to be loved by you, just you,
And nobody else but you,
I want to be loved by you, alone!
Boop-boop-a-doop!

I want to kissed by you, just you,
Nobody else but you,
I want to be kissed by you, alone!

Boop-boop, I couldn't aspire,
To anything higher,
Than, filled with desire,
To make you my own!
Boop-boop-a-doop, boop-boop-a-doop!

I want to be loved by you, just you,
And nobody else but you,
I want to be loved by you, alone!

Aa-ah-um! Boop-boop-a-doop!
Daddle-at-dat-dat-dumb, I couldn't aspire,
To anything higher,
Than, filled with desire,
To make you my own,
Bup-bum, butle-doodle-dumb-bum!

I want to be loved by you, just you,
Nobody else but you,
I want to be loved by you, a-lup-a-dup-a-dup-a-dup!
Boop-boop-a-doop!
