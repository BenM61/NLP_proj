Do I look the same to you? 'Cause I don't feel so.
You know everything must change as time goes by.
Though it feels like yesterday when we first met.
I feel I'm sinking deeper.
Do you look the same to me? Well, I don't think so.
You know everything must change as time goes by.
Like the flowers that dry, locking inside
Forever their beauty.
And they said this feeling fades,
It gets stronger everyday.
And they said that beauty fades.
You're more beautiful than ever.
They said we'd drift away,
We're still standing here.
And it feels like everyday is our anniversary.
Well, I stumble through the dark and light a candle
And the path the wax will take, no one can know.
And you said it looked like snow or maybe clouds,
And I think it looks like heaven.
So we make it into a ring and make a mold.
And we welt above the flames the whitest gold.
When hot and cold collide what's left in place
Is forever and ever.
Some say things worth having take some time.
As they get older they get better.
