Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the radio

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Suki Zuki
I'm coming in the Cherokee
Gasoline
There's steam on the window screen

Take it, take it
World's bouncing like a trampoline
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you trembling

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

Yeah back it, back it
Yeah pull up to the bumper game
Yeah with a signal
Cover me, cause I'm changing lanes

Had a handle on it
My life, I broke it
When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you saying it

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang
