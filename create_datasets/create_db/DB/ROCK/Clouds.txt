God of the rich man ain't the god for the poor.
God, men and the state hospital is closed, and wouldn't you know
Winos and office girls in the park.
Wanted you alone to walk beside her,
Wanted you alone to live beside her, it was morning,
Better roads with light on them.

Can your diamonds talk to you, can you see them shine.
Keep them hiding in your room, can they guide you in your time.
Can they guide you in your time.

Windows were broken by your dear one's hands,
Gates left swinging by your dear one's hands,
An old book salesman asked if he could step in.
The sidewalks you slept on held no rest.
Gave away the money you saved
In your trust, you're sorry now.
Light hits you funny at the time.

Can your diamonds talk to you, can you see them shine.
Keep them hiding in your room, can they guide you in your time.
Can they guide you in your time.

The sidewalks, you slept on
They're so broken. they're so broken down
I'll meet you there. i'll meet you there.

Years before and the trees would start to bloom,
You walked outside, wanted back in your room, what did you hope for.
Turn the corner while you slept ?
God of the rich man ain't the god for the poor.
God, men and the state hospital is closed, and won't you know
Winos and office girls in the park.

Can your diamonds talk to you, can you see them shine.
Keep them hiding in your room, can they guide you in your time.
Can they guide you in your time.
