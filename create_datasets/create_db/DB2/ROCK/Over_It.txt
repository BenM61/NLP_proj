Can not make it here
I'm over it,
I've been feelin' weird
Get over it,
Cannot wind up free
I'm over it,
Is there more to see
I'm over it,

What else should I do,
If I run around for you,
What am I supposed to do,
Keep it comin' oh they do,

We still last so long
Got over it,
Up on the late
An all go over it,
Cant escape the task
Not over it,
Wait if you need a ask
I'm over it,
Oh wo hoo

Its you
Having picked me out its true,
I would do
Life's so easy to get through,

I'm in arms offense now its makin' sense I see,
If I go any where I can buy most things I need to believe

I got lost in thought I'm over it,
All I almost lost not over it,
I got friends to get, get over it,
Hasn't happened yet I'm over it,

Now its time to do
All the things you say are true
I been waitin' now we do
Wen I needed you came through,
Can I run right into you
Gettin' lost in nothin' blue,
I need everything that's true
Would you pick me over you,
Now after all that's been I'm glad I show all we've seen
