Helpless, when I'm with you 
I'm helpless, what can I do, 
When you're near me I'm dumb 
My heart's become 
Helpless 
Helpless, at your command 
I'm helpless, please understand 
I can never be free 
I'm all at sea 
Helpless 
There are words that I should speak now 
But I can't seem to start 
You are near and I'm so weak now 
Oh, why can't I speak with my heart... 
I'm helpless, I love you so 
It's hopeless, if you should go 
I'd be helpless I fear 
Don't leave me here 
Helpless...!
