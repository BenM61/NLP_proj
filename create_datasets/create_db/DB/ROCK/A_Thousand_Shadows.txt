Lost in your dreams...
(I did it all for her, my flower child)
Lost in your dreams
Said the ride's so long and the nights so black
A thousand shadows can never look back
You're flying off toward an isle of dreams
And now you're lost, and lonely it seems
Said there's a dreammaker in every corner
JUst waitin' to weave a web of sin
Said better watch yourself, little girl
I said better keep away from him
I said the rides so long and the night's so black
A thousand shadows can never turn back

[CHORUS:]
I said, run, little girl just as fast as you can
Run like the wind
Said, run, little girl just as fast as you can
Run away from him ahhhhhhhh
I lost the heart I had before
And now my spirit can't cross the door
Oh what can I do, I made a mistake
But know I know, I know it's too late
I said ah ah ahhhh
I've tried so hard, now I'm lost again
I didn't listen to what they say
And now I'm losing, I've lost my way
The road so black and the night's so dark
A thousand shadows can never turn back
I said ah ah ahhhh
The ride, the ride, the ride's so long
The night, the night, the night's so black
Ah ah ah ah child child child child child
