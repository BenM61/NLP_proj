Sound is time until I find a place where I can touch

And we waited
And we waited
And we waited

And we waited
And we waited
And we waited
And we waited
And we waited
And we waited
And we waited

Sound is time until I find a place where I can touch
The frozen ground
Sound is time until I find a place where I can touch
The frozen ground

And we waited
And we waited
And we waited
And we waited
And we waited
