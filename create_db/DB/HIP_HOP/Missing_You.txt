I'm not in love
It"s just some kind of thing I'm goin through
Goin' through, goin' through
And it's not infatuation
Ain't nothin' goin' on between me and you
Me and you, me and you
But I dream about it every night, baby
Wantin' you here with me
Makin' love to me
And oh

[Chorus]
I'm missin you like crazy
Body and soul is achin'
I'm out of control
Missing you so

I'm missing you
Missing you
I'm missing you
Missing you
I'm missing you

I'm not in love, oh no no no
And that's what I just keep tellin' myself
Over and over again
And I'm not the least bit amused by it baby
Yet still I don't want to be with nobody else
No no no
And I dream about you all the time
Touchin' and kissin' me
And makin' love to me
And oh

[Chorus]

God knows I'm tryin' to keep you out of my head
I ain't tryin' to love no one
I ain't tryin' to get hurt again, no
But there's something that just gutts in my skin
And all I know is I can't let go
And that's the way it is

[Chorus]
