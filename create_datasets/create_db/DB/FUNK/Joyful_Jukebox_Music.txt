Give me some joyful jukebox music
And some genuine alligator shoes
Give me a Chevrolet car and a honky tonk bar
It's a rhythm that I can't refuse
Give me a quarter for that jukebox
So I can play my favorite song
Give me a touch of the past so we can bop so fast
And everybody sing along
(1st chorus)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Remember how to rock n' roll
Are you ready (are you ready)
Ready (are you ready)
To boogie down and lose control
Play that record again for me
The one with the rock n' roll melody
Just make me a believer in rock n' roll fever
And bring back the memories
(2nd chorus)
Remember when you saw the beatles
And heard the music of the rolling stones
Well baby we'll be rollin' in at seven in a make believe heaven
The good ol' days have aged my bones
(1st chorus)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Remember how to rock n' roll
Just make me a believer in rock n' roll fever
And bring back the memories, oh yeah
One more time
Give some joyful jukebox music
That gets me out on the dancin' floor
Give me a Saturday night to hold my baby tight
And watch me shake it up once more
(2nd chorus)
(1st chorus)
