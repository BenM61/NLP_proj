Did I ever tell you about the man who changed my life?
The one I thought, oh. Lord, when I saw him walkin' back in that bar, all tall and
lean with them broad shoulders, sweet lips, I knew that I had died and gone to
Chocolate Heaven

He had a real deep voice, white pearly teeth, his shoe was always shiny.
Long slender fingers manicured perfectly.
The man wore 800-dollar Italian suit, straight from, I dunno, what would they call it,
Milan or Rome or someplace like that?

I knew it wasn't local. 
I said, I got to get next to that.
I haven't seen him in a long time. 
The man was so fine, he could get any good girl into trouble
Can you guess what his name was?
Well
'The Jackal'
'The Jackal'
Say. 
'The Jackal' 

He was fat back cat cool like a Friday afternoon martini, chillin' at a quarter after 5.
Twist of lime, Coke on the side.
The brother loved the high life. 
Had a Ph.D. in street stride.
They called him 'The Jackal'.

He was big Mack daddy super black stylin' a diamonds in the back Cadillac.
Fur-lined boards, white wall wheels, cruise control, built for speed, chrome on evray-thang.
And stereophonic speakers, though he really didn't need them.
When they called him
'The Jackal'.
Say. 
'The Jackal'.

Fly boy was in the buttermilk, hard, livin' fast, livin' large, 6 foot 4 and not an ounce of fat!
When women asked, 'is you a Cat?' He said 'I did more that that.
I'm the firmest of the firm
And in case you, hadn't known, they call me 'The Jackal'.

Served the 18-year bid First Reicker's Island then they hid him in the state
penitentiary. Said the charge was Grand Larceny.
That was 1975, and today, if he's still alive, he'd be living in the park.
Hm. The brother whose claim to fame was that they called him 'The Jackal'.
'The Jackal'"
