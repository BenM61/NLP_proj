Kiss away, kiss away
Guess that's all that's left to say
Please come back and kiss these tears away

Smile again, let me smile again
Make my life worthwhile again
Please come back and kiss my tears away

Only you can change these sad and blue days
Only you can make them I love you days

Kiss away, kiss away
Still there's nothing left to say
Please come back and kiss these tears away.

Only you can change these sad and blue days
Only you can make them I love you days

Oh, kiss away, kiss away
Though there's nothing left to say 
Please come back and kiss these tears away.
