Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, ah ah ah ah
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
