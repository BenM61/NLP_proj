Maybe I'll be the things I dream
And not the things I seem
Maybe I'll get to change the world
Before it changes me
And maybe my life
Will always be
Just as happy as it seems

Long ago tomorrow
Long ago tomorrow
Long ago tomorrow
In my dreams

Maybe I'll learn to face the truth
And like the truth I face
Maybe I'll get to find myself
Before I'm lost in space
And maybe a love
Will always be
Just as faithful as it seems

Long ago tomorrow
Long ago tomorrow
Long ago tomorrow
In my dreams

And maybe a love
Will always be
Just as faithful as it seems

Long ago tomorrow
Long ago tomorrow
Long ago tomorrow
In my dreams
