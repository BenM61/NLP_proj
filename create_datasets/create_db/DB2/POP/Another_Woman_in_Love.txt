Looking back on rainy days
How I'd hate those rainy days
Stayin' home, watch the wind blow
All alone by my window

Now, I love those rainy days
You and I just locked away
Lying here, love surrounds us
The skies are clear all around us

Funny, for me, everything has changed
And the bad days feel so fine
Funny, you see, when you call my name,
And it happens every time,
Somehow, the sun starts to shine

Storm clouds comin' right this way
Guess we're in for more rainy days
We just laugh at the weather
'Cause here we are close together

Funny, for me, everything has changed
And the bad days feel so fine
Funny, you see, when you call my name,
And it happens every time,
Somehow, the sun starts to shine

Those clouds are comin' right this way
Guess we're in for more rainy days
We just laugh at the weather
'Cause here we are close together
