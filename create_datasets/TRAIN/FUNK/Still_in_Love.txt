It's alright, it's okay
To try and hide your feelings today
Been around, been away
But I won't let it stay the same

I remember when you lit me up with your touch
The fire within me
When I'm feeling empty
You fill me up right up baby
You fill me up right up
I remember when you lit me up with your touch
The fire within me
When I'm feeling empty
You fill me up right up, baby
You fill me up right up

I guess I'm still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you

I believe in many things (I believe in, I believe in)
All of which account to faith (i believe in you too)
You been here on different counts (you been here on different counts)
So I'm steady counting away

I remember when you lit me up with your touch
The fire within me
When I'm feeling empty
You fill me up right up baby
You fill me up right up
I remember when you lit me up with your touch
The fire within me
When I'm feeling empty
You fill me up right up, baby
You fill me up right up

I guess I'm still in love, still in love
