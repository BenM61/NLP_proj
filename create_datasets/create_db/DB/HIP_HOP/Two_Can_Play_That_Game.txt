Drop it

Stay with me but if you want to leave 
Take your things forget all about me
Tell me why you failed to realize 
That you might not ever get another try

Girl think about it before you leave 
Bobby's got a brand new swing
And if you want to do your own thing
I hear what your saying 
Two can play that game
Your game
Two can play that game
Two can play that game

Lately you've been acting mighty strange
To me it seems your attitude has changed
And suddenly you just don't seem the same
Instead of playing all those silly games

Girl think about it before you leave 
Bobby's got a brand new swing
And if you want to do your own thing
I hear what your saying 
Two can play that game
Your game
Two can play that game
Two can play that game

To me it seems your attitude has changed

And if you want to do your own thing

Your game
Two can play that game
Two can play that game
