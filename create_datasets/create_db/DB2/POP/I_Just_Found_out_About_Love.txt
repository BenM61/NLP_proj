I just found out about love and I like it, I like it
I like what love has been doing to me
I hold you close in my arms and I like it, I like it
Oh, what a wonderful future I see

It's a one time only, 
It's a lifetime deal
And I know it's real, 
I can tell by the way that I feel

Right now I'm livin' it up and I like it, I like it
Hey you give me a clue
What's love doing to you
Looks like you could be liking it too
