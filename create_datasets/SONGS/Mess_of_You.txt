I'm so unsure
It drags me underground
Where not a sound is heard
Through this distance
This distance I have found
The days and weeks go by
Without a word

Oh
I'll make a mess of you
Oh
the hell i put you through
Oh
I'll make a mess of you
You can trust me
Trust me

Sometimes we fall
Into our desires
It leaves no room for anyone
Despite it all
It's how I'm weird
I get so close and the I come undone

Oh
I'll make a mess of you
Oh
the hell i put you through
Oh
I'll make a mess of you
You can trust me
Trust me

As the days get longer
You might start to wonder
How everything turns into one mistake
I'm one mistake after another

Oh
I'll make a mess of you
Oh
the hell i put you through
Oh
I'll make a mess of you
You can trust me
Trust me 
Trust me
