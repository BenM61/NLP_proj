Memories are fading, 
A single voice complaining
While days are stacking up
It's hardly worth debating, 
The people are frustrated
Drink from poison cup
The system is collapsing, 
Conscience is relapsing
The damage has been done

On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up

Vision is rejected, The people's choice is tested
So ignorance has won
Children are infected, Remedy suggested
Don't drink from tainted cup
Overpopulation, a media sensation
The damage has been done

On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up

On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up
On the day you come rising up
