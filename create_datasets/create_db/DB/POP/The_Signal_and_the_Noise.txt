Take off those headphones and let this world pour into you
Throw off those glasses and then you'll start seeing
Forget those battles, those ones that mean nothing to you
Know you're alive and just smile, you'll start hearing

Somewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere
Somewhere out among the silence there's a voice
There's a feeling that takes over and it has no fear
When you're caught between the signal and the noise

Shout out the names of everyone that feels most dear to you
Praise to the moon and the sun and you'll start feeling
Shut out those ghosts with their talk is far too negative
Make love your armor and smile and you'll start hearing

Somewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere
Somewhere out among the silence there's a voice
There's a feeling it takes over and it has no fear
When you're caught between the signal and the noise
And the noise
And the noise

And the noise
And the noise

Somewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere
Somewhere out among the silence there's a voice
There's a feeling it takes over and it has no fear
When you're caught between the signal and the noise
You're just caught between the signal and the noise
