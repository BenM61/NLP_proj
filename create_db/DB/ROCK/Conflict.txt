Looking for an answer to end all the violence 
But you'll find no solutions behind the white paper 
Searching for a way to break down that fence 
Do you really believe in this ludicrous caper? 

Mountbatten murdered - a rebel gunman's been shot dead 
"They're all murdering bastards" - or was that something that I read? 
Well, whatever - it's just the same -death, destruction, violence and pain 

This side, that side, that side, this side 
What side? Any side. You can't side me 
That side, this side, this side, that side 
What side? Any side. You can't side me 

Where could it end? What could the outcome be? 
One thing's for sure there'll be a lot more corpses before the Government can see 
A lot more screaming bullets. A lot more children dead 
And a lot more 'Bloody Sundays' all painted in red 

A lot more pointless talks and a lot more death walks 
A whole lot more of whose tribe should rule 
The squaddies on the corner. The gunman's on the roof 
Who's the real terrorist? Well don't look to the media for your proof 

The British Empire ain't what it used to be, mate! 
And it's a bit late to try and make it great 
So, what's the point in fighting out there? 
British Constitution on a land's fate 

The 'Vengill' computer sums it all up 
It's just packed with reasons to cut people's lives up 
Well whatever, it's just the same 
Death, destruction, violence and pain 

I see no point in deciding 
Because I won't fight for troops in Ireland 
I won't shoot the IRA dead 
And I won't smash no bastard's head 
Because I don't want to die 
Do you want to die? 

This side, that side, that side, this side 
Right side, wrong side. Can't side me 
This side, that side, that side, this side 
What side? Your side. Can't side me
