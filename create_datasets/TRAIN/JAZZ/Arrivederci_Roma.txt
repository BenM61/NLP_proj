Arrivederci, Roma
Goodbye, goodbye to Rome
  
City of a million moonlit places
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home
  
Arrivederci, Roma
It's time for us to part
  
Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please, be sure the flame of love keeps burning
In her heart
  
City of a million moonlit places
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home
  
Arrivederci, Roma
It's time for us to part
  
Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please, be sure the flame of love keeps burning
In her heart
  
Arrivederci, Roma
Roma, Roma, Roma
