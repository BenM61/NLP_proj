Ooh yeah, oh yeah, hmm listen

Baby, I know that you really think he loves you
And it would hurt you so if you knew the things that I knew, baby
'Cause I see the things that he does behind your back
And I ask myself, how can he treat you like that?
'Cause if I had your love I'd never let you go and I just don't know

How could he hurt you?
(How could he hurt you?)
How could he treat you so bad?

How long can it take for you to see the pain he's causing you?
If I had the chance I know I'd be the perfect man, huh
'Cause he couldn't really know what a good thing he has
If I had your love I'd never let you go and I just don't know

If I had your love I'd do the things that he don't do
