Big diamonds, big blue diamonds, on her finger
(On her finger)
Yes, 'stead of a little band of gold
(Big blue diamond)
Big diamonds (big blue diamonds)
Big blue diamonds (big blue diamonds)
Tell a story of the love
That the one man could ever hold
(Of them all)

She wanted more than I had money to buy
So she left me, then got lonesome, I am told
Big diamonds, blue diamonds
Now she'll trade them in
For love behind little band of gold
(Little diamonds)

Big diamonds (big diamonds)
Big blue diamonds (big blue diamonds)
How they sparkle
But what can they do to warm your soul?
(Warm her soul)
When you're lonesome in the moonlight
Want the lovin', yes
Big as diamonds (diamonds)
They're blue diamonds (diamonds)
They're so wreckless and cold
(Big blue diamonds)

I'd gladly do my part to mend her broken heart
But the last one over grows cold
Big diamonds (diamonds)
Big blue diamonds (blue diamonds)
I don't want them, no-no
I just want a love behind a band of gold.
(A band of gold).
