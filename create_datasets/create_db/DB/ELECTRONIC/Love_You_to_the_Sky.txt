I wanna be near you baby
I wanna kiss you baby
I wanna be near you baby
I wanna kiss you baby, ooh woah

And you blow me away to the soul
Will you be my port in a storm
And I want to climb inside your head
I'm stronger to know that you care

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
You can be my summer romance
Say it's not an omen
Tell me that you want me

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
Baby say it's me you're holding
We got time for something
Say that you're mine only

I wanna see you baby
Come closer baby
Ain't gonna hurt you baby
Know that I miss you baby, ooh woah

And you know that I'm laughing inside
You can see through my disguise
And I want to climb inside your head
I'm stronger to know that you care

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
You can be my summer romance
Say it's not an omen
Tell me that you want me

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
Baby say it's me you're holding
We got time for something
Say that you're mine only

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
You can be my summer romance
Say it's not an omen
Tell me that you want me

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
Baby say it's me you're holding
We got time for something
Say that you're mine only

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
You can be my summer romance
Say it's not an omen
Tell me that you want me

I love you to the sky, sky, sky, sky
I'll not tell you lies, lies, lies, lies
Baby say it's me you're holding
We got time for something
Say that you're mine only
