Any old time, you want to come back home
Drop me a line, and say no more you'll roam
You had your chance to play the game fair
When you left me, sweetheart
You only left a load of care

Now that you're down
I'm going to stick by you
If you will only say
Your roamin' days are through

Well, now, you'll find me here
Like the day you left me alone
Any old time
You want to come back home
