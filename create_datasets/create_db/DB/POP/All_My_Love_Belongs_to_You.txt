You know I love you so,
I'll never let you go,
And darling, I'll be true,
For all my love belongs to you.

You set my world on fire,
You are my one desire,
Tell me you love me too,
For all my love belongs to you.

That's why I want you to know
I could never let you go,
Our love was meant to be.
It would be oh, so thrilling
To know that you were willing
To spend your life with me:

So make your answer, "Yes!",
You are my happiness,
And darling, say you do,
For all my love belongs to you.
