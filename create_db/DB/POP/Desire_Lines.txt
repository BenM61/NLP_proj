I went to California
I needed sun, I warned you
When the green of your eyes met my blue by surprise
There was a storm yeah

We could send letters
Beautiful, let us?
I could illustrate for you my day to day
Would that mend us?

Desire Lines sent me to Badlands
But I am on my way back now
I'm going to love you as I know how
I know how

The shade of Jacaranda
The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter
You mention the name
That fills my lungs with pain, eyes like Panda
I could bottle up this love
Find a stall and serve it up
It won't be the same, my heart's calling your name, love

Desire lines sent me to Badlands
But I am on my way back now
I'm going to love you as I know how
I know how

Desire lines sent me to Badlands
But I am on my way back now
I'm going to love you as I know how
I know how

Desire lines sent me to Badlands
But I am on my way back now
Let me love you as I know how
I know how

Ginger Rogers Road
I was heading home
With an official polling card to vote for you, lad
I vote for you, lad
I vote for you, lad
I vote for you, lad
I vote for you, lad
I vote for you
