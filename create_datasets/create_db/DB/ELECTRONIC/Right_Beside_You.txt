I'm dancing in the shadows of life
And death is all around me tonight
I miss you making love to me right
Beside myself I'm holding you tight
Someone is waiting for me to rise
And dive into the ocean I cried
And I cried and I cried my baby to sleep
Beside myself my soul to keep

Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

We're dancing in the shade of the summer sun
The drums are playing
The change to come was yesterday
In the heat beside myself I need to keep

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

Driving into town with the top down
Sun sinking low into the water I can feel your speed
One hand on the wheel one hand on my knee
I can tell you what I want you can do what you need
Darling nights are getting cooler in the city so close
There's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coast
We'll arrive on time just a little bit late
It's not a matter of style just a lesson in taste

I remember when I was your child
You made me up to be your lover
Now I'm standing right beside you
Other people still exsist
I don't pretend to love them less but darling
When you drive this way I lose my breath

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Always

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always
