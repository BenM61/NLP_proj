Delivering protests of intellect and 
Persevere over singular verbs 
Your head is fucked 
And the sequel is indirect 
And we don't know which way to turn 

Still we had fun, fun, fun, fun 
While you're dancing 
We had fun, fun, fun, fun 
With you all 
We had fun, fun, fun 
While you're dancing 
And we'll have fun, fun, fun 
When you go 

Deviation 
Step on your fingers 
Deviation 
Step on your toes 
Deviation 
Step on your fingers 
Deviation 
Comes and goes 

Engineering love on the autobahn 
Germanic hands positioned by you 
They're making love without precision 
And we don't know just what to do
