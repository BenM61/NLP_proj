Baby, baby, babe
I'm coming home
To your tender sweet loving
You're my one and only woman
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want
I wanna be around
I wanna be around you girl
I wanna be around
Ooh I wanna be around

Baby, how I'd be grieving
If you wanted to leave me all alone now
By myself, I don't wanna party anywhere else
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want

I wanna be around
I wanna be around you girl
I wanna be around, girl
Ooh I wanna be around

Baby, baby, baby
I'm coming home
To your tender loving
You're my one and only woman
The world leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, girl
You're the only one that I want

I wanna be around
I wanna be around you girl
I wanna be around, girl
Ooh I wanna be around girl

I need you baby, girl I
I need your loving darling
Wanna hold you close
Girl, girl
