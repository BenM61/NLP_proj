Silence
To hear once more
Her footsteps
Down a shadowed corridor
Frightened
You're overdue
The darkest day
Goes on until it's blessed by you

Archangel risin' on the moon
Just to save me from this tomb
I'll cry the tears of time all day
'Til she wipes them all away

Outside my window
On silver druppets children play
I stand here waiting
The dying of an ageless day
Dismiss young couples
Who go home to their knowing bed
And watch the rooftops
Where silent shadows slowly spread

Sleeping their dreamless sleep
They'll never know
What secrets this room keeps
They'll wait when
I'm born again
The rent's been paid
So hurry
Carry me away

Archangel risin' on the moon
Just to save me from this tomb
I'll cry the tears of time all day
'Til she wipes them all away
