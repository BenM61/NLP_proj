What's it gonna be?
Please tell me
Is it really me?
Please tell me
Are you out for fun?
Only lovin' on the run
And leave me cryin', ahh, cryin'

What's it gonna be?

Gotta know for sure
A broken heart don't have a cure
It just keeps hurting, ahh, hurtin'
And when I'm hurtin'

The kind of love that I can count on everyday

You know it

Want a love that's so
But I'll turn around and go
'Cause I can't take it

My heart won't make it

I want a love that's here to stay

The kind of love that I can count on everyday, mmm
