He said, I've been watching everything that you did
I know what time you came in last night,
Don't like all the company you keep
And you need someone who will see that you're all right

And you make me feel so mad
Going around with another man
You're gonna be sorry, 'cause I'm not going to take this lying down

And you know that its not true, 
I wish nothing bad on you,
I could be your heaven too

He said, though I met you only once
And we never said a word to each other 
We were meant to be together
No one could love you like I do 
And when you want to get away
You know that you're the only one that I will fight for
I would die for

You don't know how you make me feel
How can I make you believe
If I can't have you no one will

But you know that its not true, 
I wish nothing bad on you 
I could be your heaven too

Light a candle in your dark
Come and find you where you are
I could be your heaven too

He said, I've been calling every day
I can see there's something wrong with your line 
So I wrote you a letter

Can't think of all I need to say 
But when I do I'm gonna sit back down and start writing you another, 
And you'd better answer

You'd better hear me when I say
Don't you ever turn away
'Cause if you do I'll make you pay

But you know that its not true 
I wish nothing bad on you
I could be your heaven too

Light a candle in your dark
Come and find you where you are
I could be your heaven too

I could be your heaven
Let me be your heaven
I could be your heaven too
