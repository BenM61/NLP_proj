I get used to thinking, love is such a curious thing
It's tough and it's cold, it's the fools and the folds
I don't speak your language, no I don't get the first thing you mean
If I thought you'd get hurt by the things that I wrote

Well it's tough and it's cold, it's the fools and the folds

I can't tell you cos I don't wanna bring you down
Can't tell you cos I don't wanna bring you down
It's not as bad as some people would make it
I can't tell you cos I don't wanna bring you down
Can't tell you cos I don't wanna bring you down
It's not as bad as some people would make it sound
