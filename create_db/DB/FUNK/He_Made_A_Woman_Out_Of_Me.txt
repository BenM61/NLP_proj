I was born on a levy
A little bit south of Montgomery
Mama worked at the big house
And daddy he worked for the County
I never had no learnin'
Until I turned 16
When Joe Henry come up the river, y'all
Law, made a woman out of me
Lord, he made a woman outta me

I used to tease Joe Henry 
I guess I teased to hard
And one day it all happened
Right in my own backyard 

Joe Henry had his way
He wouldn't set me free
I'm hear to tell everybody
That the man made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me

When I think back to that day
So long ago
I get a little feelin' on my mind
Even though it hurt me
There's one thing I know
When he left, he left him a woman behind

When I meet another young man
Wantin' to love and run
My mind goes back to Joe Henry James
And a heck of a job he done
Ain't no other man let me down
You see I been set free
Ever since way back yonder
When Joe made a woman outta me

Lord, he made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me
Joe made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me
Joe made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me
