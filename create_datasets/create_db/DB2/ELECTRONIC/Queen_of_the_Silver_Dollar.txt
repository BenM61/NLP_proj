She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
And she rules this smokey kingdom
And her scepter is a wine glass
And a bar stool is her throne.
And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favor
And see which one will take the Queen of the Silver Dollar home.

She arrives in all her splendor
Every night at nine o'clock
And her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block.
The old piano minstrel
Plays her song as she walks in.
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar is home again.

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
And she rules this smokey kingdom
And her scepter is a wine glass
And a bar stool is her throne.

And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favor
And see which one will take the Queen of the Silver Dollar home.

Her royal gown is a satin dress
That's stained and slightly torn;
Her sparkling jewels are rhinestones
And her shoes are scuffed and worn

From the many roads she's traveled
And the wondrous sights she's seen
I watch her and I pray, God save the Queen.

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
And she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass
And a bar stool is her throne.
And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favor
And see which one will take the Queen of the Silver Dollar home.

The Queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems.
She was once an ordinary girl
With ordinary dreams.

'Til I found her and I won her
And I brought her to this world.
Yes I'm the one who made a queen
Of a simple country girl.

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
And she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass
And a bar stool is her throne.

And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favor
And see which one will take the Queen of the Silver Dollar home.
