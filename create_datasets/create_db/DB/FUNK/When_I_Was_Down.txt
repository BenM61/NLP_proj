When I was down you wasn't there for me 
Pushed my love right out the door 
At this point I can't take no more 
When I was down you wasn't there for me 
That's the reason I'm leavin' you 
Girl I'm through 
 
My all and my everything 
She couldn't do no wrong 
Until the cash was gone 
And she fronted like she cared for me 
But what's the possiblity that she was gettin' 
Me for my money 

When I was down you wasn't there for me 
Pushed my love right out the door 
At this point I can't take no more 
When I was down you wasn't there for me 
That's the reason I'm leavin' you 
Girl I'm through 
 
My all and my everything 
She couldn't do no wrong 
Until the cash was gone 
And she fronted like she cared for me 
But what's the possiblity that she was gettin' 
Me for my money 
 
No more lies 
Baby things done change 
I'm not the man I used to be 
I gotta look out for me 
And after all that we've been through 
I can't believe that you would think 
That I could love you 
 
Oh!! 
Things done change 
And my life just ain't the same 
And you been tryin'to come back home to me 
That ain't gonna happen 

When I was down you wasn't there for me 
Pushed my love right out the door 
At this point I can't take no more 
When I was down you wasn't there for me 
That's the reason I'm leavin' you 
Girl I'm through 
 
My all and my everything 
She couldn't do no wrong 
Until the cash was gone
