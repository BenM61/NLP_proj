I've got that old-fashioned love in my heart
And there, it shall always remain
You're like that old ivy vine
Cling a little closer all the time
Through the years, joy and tears, just the same

I've got that old-fashioned dream in my heart
And there it shall always be
Although the land may change to sea
It will never make any change in me
I've got that old-fashioned love in my heart
