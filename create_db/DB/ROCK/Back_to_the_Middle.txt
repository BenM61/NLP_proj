Back to the middle
This is where love has left me
It's an endless cycle
Please don't take it away from me

Look at me
Your hair is falling out now
Your two by four
You left me doubting

Back in the middle
Everyone knows your name now
It's all accidental
Your love is such a sick, sick game

How could he?
The basic way you used me
Why does it have to be so brutal?

Back in the middle
Take me where I can see some stars
Take me to your cabin
Like you promised so many times

You and me
You broke free
You broke me
And you left me these little pieces
