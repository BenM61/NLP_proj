Baby, when there's only one embrace 
One is just enough for two 
When do I learn young fingers get burned 
Never my love 

And when ev'ryone has been a friend 
Windy day we never knew 
Now nothing can stand the way it was planned 
No, baby 
Nothing could be good as 
Nothing could be good as lovin' you 

Even tho you're far away 
You're movie plays in my mind 
You're world is what you see 
Let it be me 

And I can make you warm at night 
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know 
Never,never 

And when every cloud has lost it's glow 
Raining on my avenue 
When do I hide that feeling inside 
When baby 
Nothing could be good as 
Nothing could be good as lovin' you 

Even tho your far way your movie plays in my mind 
Your world is what you see 
Let it be me 
And I can make you warm at night 
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know 
Never,never 

And when everyone has gone away 
Sing to the Almighty if it's what you need to feel (do) 
The world is real(true) 
And baby, nothing could be good as 
Nothing could be good as lovin' you 

As loving you
As loving you
