I ain't got nothing but money
Riding on a silver ray
I'm not waiting for a sign inside of me
Living in my sweet virgin nursery
Are there some better ways
Maybe pieces of today's
Are there some better ways
Maybe some pieces of today's

Now I got to see what's inside of me
Inside of me
Now I need to feel
In front of me
In front of me

Where is that waiting caring place
Where is the life from outer space
All the things that I can say
It's not about discovery
Then I heard some kind of friendly voice
That tells me "you will have a choice"
And I've only myself to blame
'Cause things will never be the same
And I've only myself to blame
'Cause things will never be the same

Now I got to see what's inside of me
Inside of me
Now I need to feel
In front of me
In front of me
Now I got to see what's inside of me
Inside of me
Now I need to feel
In front of me
In front of me

I know
Just let it go
I know
Just let it go
I know
Just let it go
I know
Just let it go
Now I've got to see what's inside of me
Inside of me
Now I've got to feel it in front of me
In front of me
