I catch my breath and ready for the race to come
No prizes call, the contest is my opium
Since you can never be sure
When they're keeping the score
You must always be ready to run
I tense myself Waiting for the starting gun
No time for fun Because

I work all day and I think all night
I break my body but that's alright
'cause it'll take my mind and all my might
To keep one step ahead of you

I think to myself living is a winning school
Winning on your feet, winning on the street
Winning as a golden rule
It's seems there's always a test
And I'm doing my best
But there still seems a long way to go
I try myself Trying everything I know
Pushing me so So

Don't want to know why
Don't want to know how or when or who
One step ahead
One more step ahead just to get me through

I try my best
Here comes another test
So wicked, no rest Because

Don't want to know why
Don't want to know how or when or who
One step ahead
One more step ahead just to get me through
Don't want to know why
Don't want to know how or when or who
One step ahead
One more step ahead just to get me through
