Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner,
I'm a King and she's my Queen,
Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner,
I'm a King and she's my Queen,

Dream, dream again in your way
Always knew that you would
Loose yourself to the scene
Am I only a dream.

Shoot the runner, Shoot shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen, bitch

Bang, bang away with my change,
Always know that I can,
Get you on to the floor,
Abs in the make you a whore.

Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner,
I'm a King and she's my Queen,
Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner,
I'm a King and she's my Queen, bitch.

Kings, kings may come and then go,
By this sword you must know,
That all things come and then pass, 
Live your days like the last. 

Aahh... and you're my queen, that's it,
Shoot shoot the runner, 'cause I'm a King and you're my Queen, bitch.
