You said only a back page
Will get as read as the first page
Now you're observing the corners
Are showing the first signs of aging
I'm not trying to read you anymore
Just keep on turning me through the days
Until the latest chapter unfolds

You look aroused, you look awake
You are the light turned on

A slumber will fall on you again
But in your dreams you're being held
Underneath the elephants in the room
You were trampled stampeded down

Broken all our hearts
You've broken all our hearts
But they no longer ache now
They don't hurt

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned on

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned on

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned on

You look aroused
You look awake
You are the light turned on
