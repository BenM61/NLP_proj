In the wilderness uncountable voices
Earplugs for the birds and the animals
And blinders for your beast of burden, the will For learning
These books were made for burning
In the wilderness
Beneath the ancient sand lies crushed and tanned Those sapphire girls
May we never forget you

Alert status red
But the sun comes up instead

In the wilderness the only place to find freedom is in the dictionary
Under "F"
Men in holes, men in caves, men in chains I ask But the store clerk needn't check
Man I forget which came first
The bad idea or me befallen by it?
Not giving a shit may we never forget you
May we never forget you

Alert status red
But the sun comes up instead
Alert status red
But the sun comes up instead

In the wilderness
Senile live the zealous
Lost to the treasures that compel us
Muted down like patriots amiss
You know I'm jealous of how you can just turn them off
Those bad ideas that feel so soft
May they never forget you

Alert status red
But the sun comes up instead
Alert status red
But the sun comes up instead
Alert status red
But the sun comes up instead

Alert status red
But the sun comes up instead
