Tell me baby 
If maybe we could put the top down 
The sun is flying so high today 
And the shine off your cherry fenders 
Would be too much but not too much 
With your hand reach out 
With your mouth shape the phrase 
And say 

Just so you know 
Just so I know 
Just so we know 
We're together 
If I can look in your eyes 
And see what I feel then it's real 
And I know 
We're together 

With your eyes look over 
With your car pull over 
That's all it's gonna take 
'Cause I have been paying very close attention to your habits 
Somebody over there at the counter 
In the diner on the corner in the corner of my mind 
Wears your face 
On a different day I am someone else too 
And we disappear together 
We fold up and fly away like paper airplanes 
We rub each other's creases and line up each other's angles 
And we choose the brightest papers and we fly 

Just so you know 
Just so I know 
Just so we know 
We're together 
If I can look in your eyes 
And see what I feel then it's real 
And I know 
We're together 

'Cause we could really take our time 
We could really get our shapes just right 
And fly off each other into the night 
And where we land is out of our hands 
And so in this way we don't stop 
We never stop 
We don't stop 
We won't stop baby 

Just so you know 
Just so I know 
Just so we know 
We're together 
If I can look in your eyes 
And see what I feel then it's real 
And I know 
We're together
