Give me your hand, give me your sign,
Give me your hand, give me your time
La ola hand in hand, la ola hand in hand 
Give me your hand, give me your sign,
Give me your hand, give me your time
La ola hand in hand, la ola hand in hand 
Oh oh oh la ola hand in hand
La ola hand in hand
Oh oh oh la ola hand in hand
La ola hand in hand 

Get the feeling, come and take me away
Get the feeling, everything is OK
Get the feeling, and do it right
Come on baby feel good tonight
Get the feeling, can't you understand
Get the feeling, 'cause I am your friend
Get the feeling, reach out your hand
La ola hand in hand

Everybody reach out your hands
We could be forever friends
Around the world together we stand
Sing la ola hand in hand

If you look at the world from the sky
From out of space way up high
I think to myself as I fly
Life could be better if we'd try
So free your mind, stand by my side
Face to face don't try to hide
Around the world, together we stand
Sing la ola hand in hand
