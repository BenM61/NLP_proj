I hope that you're the one
If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do things I know you like

I think I'm in love again

Today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like catch a manatee
Baby you are the prototype
I think I'm

I think I'm in love again

If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now

I think I'm in love again

The Scene
Come here

I think I'm in love again

Girl, right now I want to say, I want to say
I want to say stank you very much
For picking me up
And bringing me back to this world
I can't, I'm not
I can't afford to not record
I thank I want to say
I thank I want to say stank you, stank you
Smelly much!
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world
Hey, hey John! Are we recording our ad libs?
Really? Were we recording just then?
Let me hear that, that first one
When I first started
