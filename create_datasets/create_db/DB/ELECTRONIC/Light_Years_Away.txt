I feel the sky falling down
I'm picking up the pieces
Left on the ground

And some days
Are very long
I don't know where I'm meant to belong

Don't you hide from me
And don't you erase
What we used to be
Yesterday is far away
I'm lost in space

But the fire's burning
The fire's burning
Oh, I feel this love
And I'm giving up
'Cause nothing left for me to say

I'm reaching up
'Cause we're burning now
A million light years away

It's pulling me like gravity
It's telling me it aren't over
Light years away
Light years away, away, away

Satellites are crashing down
I watch you disappear at the speed of sound
Much feelings out of control
And where my heart lays
Now a black hole

Miles and miles away
Closing my eyes
Just to see you again
Memories are not enough
To leave me with

And my fire's burning
The fire's burning
Oh, I feel this love
And I'm giving up
'Cause nothing left for me to say

I'm reaching up
'Cause we're burning now
A million light years away

It's pulling me like gravity
It's telling me you aren't over
Light years away
Light years away, away, away

A million light years away
A million light years away
Light years away
Light years away
Light years away
Light years away, away, away
