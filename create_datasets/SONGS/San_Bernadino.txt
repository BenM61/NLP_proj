I've been all around this great big world
to Paris and Rome
And I've never found a place that I could
really call my own.
But there'se one place where I know
the sun is shining endlessly
And it's calling me across the sea
so I must get back to SAN BERNADINO.

I remember when I was sixteen
my daddy said to me: You could travel
round this universe until eternity
But you'll never find that peace of mind
that you've been dreaming of.
Not until you finally decide to
come on home to SAN BERNADINO.

Oh
I'm longing for SAN BERNADINO!
Oh
I'm longing for SAN BERNADINO!

I've been all along the water right up
to the Rio Grande
And I've never found the paradise
they call the Promised Land.
I was young and foolishly I thought
the world was at my feet.
But I'm no diff'rent now and so I'm
homeward bound for SAN BERNADINO.
Well I'm older and I'm wiser and I've seen
the light of day
and I think it's time
to realize my dreams have gone astray.
But I've tried so hard to rech that star
that was so far away.
But now I've got to find that road
that's leading home to SAN BERNADINO.

Oh
I'm longing for...
