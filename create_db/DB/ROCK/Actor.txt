Spend the morning with the mirror
All the moments that we share
A little secret, don't you know?
To make you feel good, do you?

I look better when I'm weak
When I'm tired and I don't eat
My life is dreamy, don't you know?
You wanna be me? Maybe

You can be an actor for a while
Practice taking pictures with the smile

It's even better than they say
Star-lit nights, extended days
You get the feeling watching it
Was gently dreamers dreaming

Of the movies that I see
All the things that make me free
But give me personality
It's so much better knowing

You can be an actor for a while
Practice taking pictures with the smile
I wanna be an actor for a while
It would be a clever use of time

Tell me who holds the answers
The answers, the answers
The place is just full of chancers
The chancers, the chancers

I wanna have all the answers
The answers, the answers
Can somebody turn the lights on?
I wanna see

Oh, you can be an actor for a while
Practice taking pictures with the smile
I wanna be an actor for a while
It would be a clever use of time
