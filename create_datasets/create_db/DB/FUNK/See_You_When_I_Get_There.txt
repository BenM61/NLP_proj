Pardon me, do you have change for a quarter?
I gotta make a phone call, thank you
Oh, I hope this woman don't take me through no changes today
'Cause I've had a hard day today, man, you know
Let me see what's happenin' at the address 'fore I go home

How you doin'? I hope you're fine
Did your day take you through changes
And mess up your mind?
I just called to say that I'm on my way

Whoa, and I'll see you when I get there
I hope you're in a good mood
You know a man's home is his castle
And I'm comin' home to groove

Whoa, and I'll see you when I get there
I'll see you when I get there
And you be ready for good lovin'
You be ready for good lovin'
'Cause I've worked hard all day
Now I'm comin' home to be with the one I love

Candlelight, cold wine, soft music on the radio
And you got everything you need from the store
'Cause I'll be in for the evening
And I don't wanna come out no more

Whoa, and I'll see you when I get there
I'll see you when I get there
And you be ready for good lovin'
You be ready for good lovin'
'Cause I've worked hard all day
Now I'm comin' home to lay and relax my mind

Whoa, I'll see you when I get there
I said, I'll see you when I get there, baby
I said, I'll see you when I get there
I said, I'll see you when I get there, baby

I said, I might have to run all the way
(You be ready)
Because the bus might be slow today
I've been thinkin' about you all day long
And I just can't wait to get home

I'll see you when I get there
I'll see you when I get there, baby
(You be ready)

I've been workin' hard all day, you've been on my mind
(You be ready)
I can't go on without you, darling, by my side
(I'll see you when I get there)

I'll see you when I get there
(I'll see you when I get there)
(I'll see you when I get there)
I'll see you when I get there, baby
