Every time I turn around
Struggle's looking back at me
Life was suffocating
But now I got to let it be
I'm gonna get back up
Won't be falling down
No, I won't lose, nah,
I'll rise above it all, it all, it all, it all

Ain't got no worries
Ain't got no worries
Ain't got no worries
Ain't got no worries
I will sing it again
Ain't got no worries, oh
Ain't got no worries, oh, no no
Ain't got no worries, oh
Ain't got no worries,
No, I'm not worried about a thing
(Money, cars, house)
No, I'm not worried about a thing
(Friends, family, life)
No, I'm not worried about a thing

Done with all the stressing
Forget the bills, I've paid my dues
Now I'm counting all my blessings
You won't hear me sing the blues
No, no
Get back up, won't be falling down
No I won't lose, no
I'll rise above it all, it all, it all, it all, above it all

Ain't got no worries
(Ain't got no worries, got no worries)
Ain't got no worries
(Ain't got no worries, got no worries)
Ain't got no worries
(Ain't got no worries, got no worries)
Ain't got no worries
No I'm not worried about a thing
Money (no worries)
Cars (no worries)
House (no worries)
No, I'm not worried about a thing
Friends (no worries)
Family (no worries)
Life (no worries)
No, I'm not worried about a thing

Oh, oh no no
Money (no worries)
Cars (no worries)
House (no worries)
Ain't got no worries
Friends (no worries)
Family (no worries)
Life (no worries)
Ain't got no worries
Money, cars, house
Friends, family, life

Ain't got no worries
(Ain't got no worries, got no worries)
Ain't got no worries
(Ain't got no worries, got no worries)
Ain't got no worries
(Ain't got no worries, got no worries)
Ain't got no worries
(Ain't got no worries, got no worries)
No I'm not worried about a thing
