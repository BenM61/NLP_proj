(Chorus):
I can't go nowhere unless you're by my side
I gotta heve you here I said right here by my side

I can't roam the town unless you're by my side
I gotta have you around, right here by my side

So where's my moonshine
'Cause I'll be all up in the club with you yeah
So where's my moonshine
You know I spend my last dub for you yeah
So where's my moonshine
I feel so nice with you yeah
So where's my moonshine
want to spend my whole life with you yeah

I snuck into this club when I was 15
And I met my girl at the bar, such a sweet thing
Every time I held her she would always kiss me
Every touch of her lips would always make me tipsy
I told her, man I love you
Pulled her to the dance floor
And that's when she whispered
Be careful what you ask for
I grabbed her by the waist 
And I sat her on the table
Explained how the heartburn
She's giving me is painful
And now you want to leave
'Cause you feel empty inside
Well none of my friends trust me with you to drive
I'm so into you, I hope you're feeling it
I need you in my life and the reason is

(Chorus)
How many times I gotta tell you
Why you stressin' me for
Yeah I see you need attention
I ain't tryin' to ignore
I gotta straighten up now, I got work to do
You want me to drop everything
So it surrounds you
Man I love you so much
It makes me sick to my stomach
And I love it how I can vomit
And you think nothing of it
I never meant to argue with you, please forgive
Girl I need you in my life and the reason is

(Chorus)
Ya see my moonshine
She keeps me warm when it rains
I forget my problems when she eases the pain
And my friends keep telling me to call it a day
She don't love ya Savage, it's all in your brain
See I don't believe a word
That you say to my face
I'm in love and I know she feels the same
I'll buy you all the ice you want
And I'll keep you safe
Man I love my alcohol, what more can I say

(Chorus)
