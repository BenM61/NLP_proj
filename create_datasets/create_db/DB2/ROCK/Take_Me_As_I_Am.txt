I hear the words of a thousand voices
Sinking in my head
Long time since I've seen you last and
You talk to me like this
I can't remember the last time 
We talked until forever
It's far too hard 
I've tried so long

Here I am with out a dollar to my name
Will you take me as I am?
I'm holding on

You couldn't find just one good reason 
To take me as I am
I confess that at times I'm broken
Drifting in my head
And why can't life be a little easier on me?
It's far too hard
I've tried so long

Here I am with out a dollar to my name
Will you take me as I am?
I'm holding on

Will you take me as I am?
