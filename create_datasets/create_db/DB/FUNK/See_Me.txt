Yesterday was the first time
That I didn't hear from you
Almost felt like the world had ended
What was I to do?

You're the one for me
And only you can be my love fantasy
You lift me up higher; you're who I desire
I just love what you do to me
Don't leave me waiting too long
Come by and

See me
You need love, baby
I need love, baby
See me
Hurry baby

I can't hide my emotions
It never turns out right
And without you there was no-one
To get me through the night
Well, I had never cried so much
For anybody else's touch
I even scared myself
What a way to spend my time
Hopin' for even one line
From you and no-one else

I really need you here with me
See, all these lonely nights keep
Messin' with my mind
I'm so satisfied I asked you to come on by 'cause
I know soon you'll be by my side
And, oh you won't keep me waiting too long
When you come by to

See me
You need love, baby
I need love, baby
See me
Hurry baby
