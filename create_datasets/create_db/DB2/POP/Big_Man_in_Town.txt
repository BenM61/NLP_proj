Big man in town
Each day as I grow older
The nights are getting colder
Some day the sun will shine on me
Money, I don't have any
I'm down to my last penny
But darlin' don't cry over me

I'll be a big man in town, honest honey
I'll be a big man in town, promise darlin'
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see
You'll be proud of me
Big man in town

They think that I'm a rover
But my rovin' days are over
Some day your folks will welcome me
I went away a small man
But I'll come home a tall man
Then what a pretty bride you'll be

I'll be a big man in town, honest honey
I'll be a big man in town, promise darlin'
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see
You'll be proud of me
Big man in town

Big man in town
I'm gonna make it, just wait and see
Oh, I'm gonna make it, just wait and see
Girl I'm gonna make it, just wait and see
