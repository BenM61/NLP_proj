You know, me and my woman
We've been going through a lot of changes for about
Six months or so
It's been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain't nothing without
Communication
How we were lying in the bed
The both of us looking at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open, about 3 in the morning
I said, "Baby, we can't go on this way"
She said, "you're right"
I said, "I know you love me and I love you too"
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

[Chorus]
Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry (Cry), cry (Cry), cry (Cry)
We cry together (Oh, oh, oh)

Ain't nothing wrong with you, no
And there ain't nothing wrong with me

(We're not the only people in the world)
Who go through ups and downs
(All we have to do is talk)
We can work it out

Oh, oh, let me kiss you eyes
Let me wipe your tears away
Oh, let me hold you tight
Tomorrow we'll feel better cause baby, it's a brand
New day

[Chorus]

Now we had ties when we laughed hearty
We'd go out on the town and we'd party, party, party

(Every day the sun doesn't shine)
Sometimes it has to rain
(Just like we enjoy the pleasure)
We have to stand the pain

Oh, let me kiss you eyes
Let me wipe your tears away
Oh, let me hold you tight
Let's talk to each other, I want to hear what you got to
Say

[Chorus]

And then we and then we and then we and then we made
Love

Love like we never made love before
You know we stopped hugging each other
And the tears would rains down my face
(Cry, cry together)
And there was love all over the place, yeah, yeah
(Cry, cry together)
Said we cry (Cry, cry together)
There ain't nothing wrong with me (Cry, cry together)
There ain't nothing wrong with you (Cry, cry together)
We?re not the only people in the world who go through
Ups and downs
And changes and turn arounds
Girl, yes
