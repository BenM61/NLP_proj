It's catching up to me right now
Everything that I said
The night I left her there
When I said I wanted out
I was angry and upset
And at the time I couldn't care less
About staying there
I had to prove I didn't care
As much as she thought I did

I showed her
I let my pride take me far away
From the only woman I love
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but 
I showed her oh oh oh

I hear that she's in love
But it took a while for her
To get over the hurt
Now I know that I messed up
I was trying to give us time
But I see she took that time to find somebody else
What happened to the things she felt
For me, am I really part of her past?

I showed her
I let my pride take me far away
From the only woman I love
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but...
I showed her woah oh oh's

I showed her
I let my pride take me far away
From the only woman I love
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but
I showed her

I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but
I showed her whoa I showed her
I showed her.
