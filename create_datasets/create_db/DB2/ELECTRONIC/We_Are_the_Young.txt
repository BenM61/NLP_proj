Were the ones 
with the runaway eyes 
Were the ones 
who can improvise 
is there doom 
in the hard situation? 
We believe in 
positive stipulations 

 
Log on.
We are the young 
with the modern attitude 
breaking down the walls 
breaking all the rules 
 
Tomorrow comes 
and we might go away 
so we dont worry 
bout the price we pay 

We are the young 
oh! 
we are the young 
 

Every street 
is an arcade of dreams 
I go on downtown 
exploding at the seams 
with lights and sounds 
and a soul parade 
light and blue color 
promenade 

 
We are the young 
with the modern attitude 
breaking down the walls 
breaking all the rules 
 
Tomorrow comes 
and we might go away 
so we dont worry 
bout the price we pay 
 

Another way to gain control 
a brand new day to rock and roll 

 

Another way to gain control
