Guerilla getting trained up

From over the rooftop

Row the boat - straight to the ocean
Give em a run, a run at his own game
Signal the plane and I landed on the runway
A survivor, independent foreigner
First your beats had me running to the running man
Then your chat had me want to do the bogle man
Click suits and booted in the timberland
Freaking out to missy on a timberland

Growing up, brewing up
Guerilla getting trained up
Look out! Look out!
From over the rooftop

You should have been good to me
Then I wouldn't get so rowdy, rowdy
You should have kept ya eye on me
Then I wouldn't get so baddy, baddy

Whether you are,
Swinging out to swing beat
Laying low and jacking up to Lou Reed
Chasing out to Pixies and the Beasties
Doing accede with hair-colored geek freaks
F-F-W-D onto the '04
Got my own flow get you to the dance floor
Little mama doing the booty rolls
Crump clowns got me rooting for the Linos.
