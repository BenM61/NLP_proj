Relax, Max
Your nerves are just like jumpin' jacks, Max
Your heart is thumpin' with a crazy sound
Hear it pound
Bumpin', bumpin', bumpin' 
Jumpin' up and down

Stay cool, fool
Just take it easy
That's the rule, fool
The evenin' hasn't even started yet
So, my pet
Control yourself, control yourself
Don't get upset

Don't think I'm cold if I say you're too bold
I've been fooled by that moon up above
I want your kiss just as you want my kiss
But a kiss is no kiss without love

So relax, Max
I hate to stop you in your tracks, Max
But first you gotta prove your love to me
When you do
I'll love you, love you, love you
Like you want me to

I hate to stop you in your tracks, Max

I'll love you, love you, love you
Like you want me to

Ah, come on, relax, Max
Your nerves are kinda bad there, boy
Hold it
Down, boy
Take it easy, fool
Relax yourself
The evening's young yet
Mmm, come on and relax, Max
Relax yourself
