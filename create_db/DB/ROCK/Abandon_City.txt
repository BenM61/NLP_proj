Did you see the color of the water coming out of the tap?
 Did you hear the chatter of the hammer
 when you're trying to nap?
 There's nothing on the counter at the A&P store
 The bank don't even bother now to open
It ain't pretty, pity
 Abandon city
Everybody over the side
 The hour is late, they're closing the gate, no time to decide
 Abandon city
 Yeah, you better run for your lives
 There's nothing to spare
 The cupboard is bare
 The bees have all left the hive
 Someone's doing a non-stop performance of "The Rape of the Lock"
 No one's got the nerve to take a tiptoe after seven o'clock
 And everybody's looking for a piece of the rock
 And I just want to get my Cadillac out of hock
 Too much nitty gritty
