Moving on
So I just see this on my own
Just let me go
You never saw this in my eyes before

You're moving on
You decided to go on your own
Just let me know
That you can feel the way you did before

Moving on
So I just see this on my own
Just let me go
I got out of it to reach for more

You're moving on
You decided to go on your own
Just let me know
I'm not the reason that you came before

Moving on
