Take my hand or you'll be sorry
I'm the music for your story
Walk with me
Through the lonely nights

Follow me through the darkness
Down deep, give me your kiss
Come on baby
I won't let you down

Take my hand, don't ask why
I can't wait forever
Put your hand on my heart
Swear to me when you say

I might lie
When I look into your eyes
I could love you 'til forever
When I look into your eyes
Tell me why
When I look into your eyes
I could love you 'til forever
When I look into your eyes

I don't know why I love you
When I don't even know you
Trust in you I do the best I can

Take my hand, don't ask why
I can't wait forever
Put your hand on my heart
Swear to me when you say
