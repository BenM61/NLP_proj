I was over in Aberdeen 
On my way to New Orleans
Well the Aberdeen women told me
They would give me my gasoline
Aberdeen is my home
But they just don't want me around
Aberdeen is my home
But they just don't want me around
I'm gonna take these women
Take them out this town
Well just look over yonder
Coming down the road
That must be my baby coming
Tell me she don't want me know more
Well there's too many women
I bring too many women
Back from New Orleans
I was standin' 'round cryin'
With my heart right in my hand
I was standin' 'round cryin'
With my heart right in my hand
I was lookin' for that woman
One ain't got no man
Well just look over yonder
Where we used to live
Don't you know it's killing me, baby
How we can't live here no more
Well it's goodbye, baby
If I'm never gonna see you no more
Well it's goodbye, baby
If I'm never gonna see you no more
I'm gonna tell everybody you've been
Still knockin' at my door
