So many faces cold and warm
Stranded in this world
So little time, there's no rewind
Must be strong and carry on

As the light of the moon catches me
I live, I live
As the stars shimmer bright for me
I live, I live

I am the footprint in the sand
I am the wind that sweeps the land
I am the eyeglass of a blinded man
In the heat of desire
I'm a starfire
Fallen down from the sky

So many choices, where will they lead us?
Don't know where to go
Grateful children for they are future
Teach them how to play

As the light of the moon catches me
I live, I live
As the stars shimmer bright for me
I live, I live

I am the footprint in the sand
I am the wind that sweeps the land
I am the eyeglass of a blinded man
In the heat of desire
I'm a starfire
Fallen down from the sky

As the light of the moon catches me
I live, I live
As the stars shimmer bright for me
I live, I live

I am the footprint in the sand
I am the wind that sweeps the land
I am the eyeglass of a blinded man
In the heat of desire
I'm a starfire
Fallen down from the sky

I am the sunshine and the rain
I am the hurt, I am the pain
I am the soldier without a name

So many voices
So little time, there's no rewinding
I am the sunshine and the rain
I am the hurt, I am the pain
