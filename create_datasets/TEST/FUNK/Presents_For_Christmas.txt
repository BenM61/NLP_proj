Oh this is gonna be a groove for me
It's gonna be a little something different
But we're gonna give it to 'em anyway
Are you ready? Come on, ha!

We want to give out a present to everybody this Christmas
All around the world for every man, woman, boy and girl
Are you ready right now, come on here we go
Aaa I like it like that, come on that's it
Alright come on

Christmas presents around the world
Is something mighty sweet to see
If only I just had a present for everyone
Under one great big Christmas tree

For every boy that wants a brand new toy
For every Johnny that wants a car
For every junior that wants a mobile bike that
Rides and a rides and rides
Now my little daughter
She wants a doll that cries
One that walks and wipes it's eyes
And I see there someone 
That wants somebody home
Just to mere have in their arms

What a Christmas present mmm this Christmas
Oh what a gift you could be
You know if I could just give out
Christmas presents to every one
Under one great big Christmas tree

You know I'm even fat enough to be
The world's biggest Santa Claus
And everybody could just
Just stand around and just say
Ooh is that for me?

Ha, come on 
A Christmas present for everybody this year
And we want to give it to 'em are you ready?
Come on everybody, come on one more time together
Merry Christmas baby

A present for you Christmas directly from me
For all the disc jokeys around the world Merry Christmas
All the policeman and all the pretty girls ha!
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha!
That's for my old friend y'all and all the soul friends 
Christmas brothers baby, here we go
Come on let me hear you, come on
Alright now listen to me

Somewhere in this big wide world
There's some little girl and boy
Who's wishing for a great big Christmas
Maybe one, two, or three toys
But sadly enough believe me as it seems
They won't get these things we know
But the best thing that we can do
Is wish a Merry Christmas to you
And hope next year
Things will have a lot of joy

Christmas presents for every one
Ha ha ooh what a gift it could be
If I could just have a great big
