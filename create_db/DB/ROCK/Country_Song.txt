Well I can't stand to look at you now
This revelation's out of my hands
Still I can't bear the thought of you now
This complication's leaving me scared

Stay when you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey keep your sickness off me tryin to get through
Blame all your weakness on me
Shame that I'm so contrite
Hey keep your fingers off me, why can't I get through?

You think you have the best of intentions
I cannot shake the taste of blood in my mouth

[Chorus]
(Hey) I keep on thinking that it's
(Hey) all done and all over now (whoa)
You keep on thinking you can save me, save me
(Hey) My ship is sinking but it's
(Hey) All good and I can go down (whoa)
You've got me thinking that the party's all over

Well I can't stand to be myself
This liberation's seemingly rare
And I can't stand the taste of your mouth
This sublimation's out of my hands

Stay when you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey keep your sickness off me tryin to get through
Shame you cant take this from me
Bane on the empty mind
Hey keep your fingers off me, why can't I get through?

[Chorus]

Lay down
Just stay down
Lay down because I am trying to get through

Say what you want but you're not gonna win this time
Take what you want, but just leave me alive
Say what you want but you're not gonna win this time
Take what you want, but just leave me alive

[Chorus]

Lay down
Just stay down
Lay down because the party's all over

Lay down
Just stay down
Lay down because I am trying to get through
