My mind is full bursting over
With all these things I can't remember
Every little single memory
Reminds me of you

My eyes were weary with all these tears
You left your shadow in my dreams
And all my doubts seem to disappear
When you came along

Flowers melting up into the sky
Hear my heart where our love collides
We hear the songs we found
In the times we lost our way

Gentle memories replace our tears
All the love we had is still right here
We hear the songs we found
In the time we lost our way

From without words can not describe
What caused the stars to fall deep inside
Every little single memory
Reminds me of you

Our days are gone lost forever
Reflecting light glistening under water
Naturally this could be everything
That seems so unreal

Flowers melting up into the sky
Hear my heart where our love collides
We hear the songs we found
In the time we lost our way

Gentle memories replace our tears
All the love we had is still right here
We hear the songs we found
In the time we lost our way

Flowers melting up into the sky
Hear my heart where our love collides
We hear the songs we found
In the time we lost our way

Gentle memories replace our tears
All the love we had is still right here
We hear the songs we found
In the time we lost our way
