Paint two eyes, make them cry
Paint two lips, make them lies
And you're painting the portrait of a fool

Paint one heart that's been untrue
Paint one soul make it blue
And your paintin' the portrait of a fool

There are somethings that look so familiar
Strange what this resemblance can be
And now as I look in the mirror
I know, I know the fool you are painting is me

Paint one fool let it talk
Paint two hand that once held it all
And you've painted a portrait of a fool
