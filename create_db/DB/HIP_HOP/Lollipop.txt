Just blaze
Oh, really?

You know what? You talk too much
Hoe get up out my face unless you tryin' to f*ck
'Cause on the real a nigga kinda drunk
And right now the way you lookin' bitch you fly as f*ck

I don't even know if I done had too much
You play too much, I had to f*ck
Cuddled you up and put my hands on your butt
Rubbin' your stuff and now your pants full of nut

You can't tell me nuttin'
Let me shoot my thang on your bellybutton
I got to, keep it gangsta
Your home girl want some, I just might bank her

Shank her, bank her, and take her bankroll
Big Snoop Dogg and my game is way cold
Never ever overexpose
I usually got a car with a room full of hizzoes

Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, fake this thing for me
'Cause you just flow so viciously

Soopa-duper, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, fake this thing for me
'Cause you just flow so viciously

Now bitch, check it out, where my money, c'mon wreak it out
Just sayin' hoe, I ain't playin' c'mon, take it out
Dick down the track, c'mon, we gon' work it out
Straight pimp shit we on, we gon' church it out

If you don't know I'm quick to change up stick
My dick in yo' mouth and aim up
Open up your eyes you'll see my navel
Flip down my drawers, you'll see that label

Sniffed so much kane, the bitch got abel
Put the switch on, directed my cable
Splash! What head work and what ass
Bitch stop my dick hurtin', now f*ck daz

Run fast if I tell ya bitch walk
Get caught, I'm takin' all that bitch got
I don't need no relationship
All I really had in mind was my dick, yo' face and lips, c'mon

Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, fake this thing for me
'Cause you just flow so viciously

Hovi baby, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, fake this thing for me
'Cause you just flow so viciously

She wanna meet the only king on the east coast
Hook me up witcha boy Snoop she said he so low
I never get the chance to get at him
Only on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah

Listen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him
If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen
Hov ain't into backwards mackin'
How backwards that is

I don't love 'em though
'Less makin' a little paper then I love 'em the most
If she's, sneakin' in the club with the toast
I'm flyin' the friendly skies with 36 hoes

Shit, I can get a chef to cook for me
Talk about some paper if you tryin' to book me
Ma, you can keep your head
I got expensive habits that need the bread

Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, fake this thing for me
'Cause you just flow so viciously

Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, fake this thing for me
'Cause you just flow so viciously

Let's go do the bump, give me that funky stuff
Let's go do the bump, give me that funky stuff
Let's go do the bump, give me that funky stuff
Let's go do the bump, give me that funky stuff

I like the way you shakin' that ass, so don't stop
Slang that ass like I used to slang rocks
Bend over trick let me get to that spot
Later on you can lick on my lollipop

I like the way you shakin' that ass, so don't quit
You know you get a hella response from my dick
Don't put your fuckin' clothes back on 'til you rich
The type of woman I want tonight, a straight bitch
