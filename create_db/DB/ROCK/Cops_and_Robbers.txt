If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers

We're at a revolution
And we're baying for your blood
We're laying down the law
And your name's mud

You'd like to be a member of the human race
You want to be a good boy
But you couldn't stand the taste

Blame Simon
'Cause he said
You've got two lives down
And one life left
Blame Simon
Because he said
You could think better with a hole in your head
You could think better with a hole in your head

If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers

Catch a revolution
Now your waging war again
Marching on the spot when you should have made amends
Cause you say you fight for us
Cross your heart and hope to die
You're the bully in the playground and we'll hang you out to dry

Blame Simon
Because he said
You've got two lives down
And one life left
Blame Simon
'cause he said
You could think better with a hole in your head
You could think better with a hole in your head

If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal

Line them up against a wall and shoot them all
Oh oh oh

If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
Play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers
If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
Play cops and robbers

If we catch a criminal
There's nothing you or I can do

Line them up against a wall I'll get a gun and shoot them all
