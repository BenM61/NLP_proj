Something is here
I can hear them breathe
Something is here
And I'm scared
Beg to your gods
But I don't believe
Nothing in here
Can help me now

Cold warning comes for me

Something is here
And I've got the nerves
Something is here
And I'm cold
I'm so lonely
Do you know how it feels?
All I can do
Now is lose

Cold warning comes for me
