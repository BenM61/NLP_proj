Tender was the night
Took an early flight
Rushing' home tonight
Something' wasn't right

I can't believe my eyes
I know I must be dreaming

Did I come home too late, too soon?
You in his arms told me the truth
Too late, too soon

I wish I would have known
I wouldn't have left you all alone
Temptation led you wrong
Tell me how long has this been going on?

'Cause I thought our love was strong
But I guess I must be dreaming, yeah

Did I come home too late, too soon?
You in his arms told me the truth
Too late, too soon, baby, yeah

What was I supposed to do?
You had to see it for yourself
Had to see it for yourself

'Cause I thought our love was strong
But I guess I must be dreaming

Did I come home too late, too soon?
You in his arms told me the truth
Too late, too soon
