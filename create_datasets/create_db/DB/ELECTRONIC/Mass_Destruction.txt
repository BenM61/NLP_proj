With a long range weapon or suicide bomber
Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether your stowaway's son or BBC 1
Dis-information is a weapon of mass destruction

You could a Caucasian or a poor Asian
Racism is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether inflation or globalization
Fear is a weapon of mass destruction

My dad came into my room holdin' his hat
I knew he was leavin', he sat on my bed told me some facts son

I have a duty, callin' on me
You and your sister be brave my little soldier, and don't forget all i told ya
Your the mister of the house now remember this
And when you wake up in the morning give ya momma a kiss, then I had to say goodbye

In the morning i woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid,
Even though I'm only a kid, certain things can't be hid
Momma grabbed me, held me like i was made of gold, but left her in the story untold
I said, momma it will be alright, when daddy comes home, tonight

My story stops here, lets be clear
this scenario is happenin' everywhere
and you ain't goi'n to nirvana or favana
You comin' right back here to live out your karma
with even more drama than previously, seriously
Just how many centuries have we been waiting for someone else to make us free
And we refuse to sleep, the people overseas are just like we
Mad leadership, amigos, unfettered and free
They feed one the people they're supposed to lead, i don't need it
We need to pray away, for the lord to make it all straight
Its only now we do it right, 'cause I don't want my daddy, leavin home tonight
