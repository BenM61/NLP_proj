Talking like old way
Remember them old ways
Knock out that door-way

'Member the days we used to keep the covers sleep on the floor way
Rain dance, rain dancing
Rich boy, play dazing
I can be raw let you ride here
Baby I'm slowly dying
Keeping your thoughts inside me
Keeping your thoughts inside me
Only think about it, whatever we do we all in private
Keeping your thoughts beside me
Keeping your thoughts behind me
Yeah we ball, we riding
Baby, I'm slowly dying
Keeping your thoughts inside me
Keeping your thoughts inside me
Only think about it, whatever we do we all in private
Keeping your thoughts inside me
Keeping your thoughts behind me

Yeah, remember them old ways
Knock out that door-way
Years I was Kawasaki
