Destroy emotions (and they)
Employ devotions (and they)
Can't seem to take it away
It's just bureaucracy 
Just like hypocrisy
And it's always the same

F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you!
F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you!
Conditions and restrictions 
Religions and revisions
It never goes away
Controlled emissions (and they)
Control decisions (and they)
Can't seem to find a way
F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you!
F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you!
Conditions and restrictions 
Religions and revisions
It never goes away
Controlled emissions (and they)
Control decisions (and they)
Can't seem to find a way
Feeding equality
Breeding brutality
There's supposed to be a better way
Deter incrimination
Infer discrimination
Destroy the system that we've made

F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you!
F*ck you! F*ck you! F*ck you!
Conditions and restrictions 
Religions and revisions
It never goes away
Controlled emissions (and they)
Control decisions (and they)
Can't seem to find a way
Feeding equality
