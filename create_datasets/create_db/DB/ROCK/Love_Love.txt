Oh love love you tear my world apart
Oh love love you always break my heart
It's been too long since you left me
It's been too long since the start
Oh love love please don't break my heart

Oh love love you always bring me down
Oh love love you turn my life around
Oh I don't know how tell you
Oh I don't know what to say
But my heart is yours love in every single day

And at night I sit and cry it seems
Wondering why love is not like my dreams
Wondering why I am still here all alone
And at night I wish that you were there
Touching my face and stroking my hair
Telling me things, telling me stories
Telling me you love me in all my glory

Love love you're always in my heart
Oh love love I've known it from the start
Oh I wish that I could tell you
Oh I wish that I could say
That my heart is yours in every single way

And at night I sit and cry it seems
Wondering why love is not like my dreams
Wondering why I am still here all alone
And at night I wish that you were there
Touching my face and stroking my hair
Telling me things, telling me stories
Telling me you love me in all my glory

Love love I wish that I could see
What in the world you mean to me
Oh love love you always bring me down down down
Oh love love I wish you'd stick around.
