A-round the corner, ooh-ooh,
Beneath the berry tree
A-long the footpath, behind the bush
Looking for Henry Lee.

A-round the corner, ooh-ooh,
Beneath the berry tree
A-long the footpath, behind the bush
Looking for Henry Lee.

(A-round the corner ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh)

Tonight all the folks will cut the corn
(Cut the corn)
Tonight I'll be glad that I was born
(I was born)
For my Henry Lee I'll see
He'll be cuttin' corn with me
And we'll meet `neath the bitter berry tree

A-round the corner, ooh-ooh,
Beneath the berry tree
A-long the footpath, behind the bush
Looking for Henry Lee.

(A-round the corner ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh)

Tonight all the stars are shining bright
(Shining Bright)
Tonight all the cornfields are a sight
(Are a Sight)
I have reached the meeting spot
But my Henry Lee has not
And I wonder can it be that he forgot

A-round the corner, ooh-ooh,
Beneath the berry tree
A-long the footpath, behind the bush
Looking for Henry Lee.

(A-round the corner ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh)

Tonight as the moon begins to sink
(Begins to sink)
Tonight there are footsteps that I think
(Which I think)
Will at last bring him to me
My beloved Henry Lee
But I don't see why so late he has to be

Oh Henry Lee why did you make me wait
(Make me wait)
I'm late `cos I had another date
(Another date)
It was plain for me to see
He'd been keepin' company
With another girl beneath another tree

A-round the corner, ooh-ooh,
Beneath the berry tree
Here on the footpath, behind the bush
Looking for Henry Lee.

(A-round the corner ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh,ooh-ooh)

I told my Henry Lee to go away
(Far away)
But now I'm sad because he didn't stay
(Didn't stay)
And tonight in case that he
Might come searchin' round for me
I'll be sittin' `neath the bitter berry tree.

A-round the corner, ooh-ooh,
Beneath the berry tree
Here on the footpath, behind the bush
Looking for Henry Lee.
