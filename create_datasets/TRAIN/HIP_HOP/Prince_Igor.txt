"Fly on the wings of the wind 
to the homeland, our home song 
where we sang freely loving 
where me and you felt so freely" 

Warren G. top dog 
Patrolling the beach 
Riggers say they hard as bricks 
But they soft as a peach 
Climbin the G of all G's 
Please 
I come blowin through like the breeze 
Sitting on the threes 
Post it coast it and mash it down 
Pacific coast in the bomb chrome rims 
Black on black Yukon 
With nuts hangin from the city 
Where the bangers be bangin 
It don't seem like shit is changin 
I hollered at a homey the other day 
G'd up at the park 
Sippin Alisay 
One of the homies took a beatin 
So now we'll start to be a gang 
Checkin at the meetin 
Life cycles repeatin
Life cycles repeatin
It's just another sunset fall and see 
I can hear the homies that pass 
Calling me 
And you know what I discover 
What they keep sayin 
Keep your mind and your money 
Motherfuckers 
And shake busters 

Uletaj na kryl'jach vetra 
Ty V kraj rodnoj, rodnaja pesnya nasha
Tuda gde my lubya svobodno peli
Gde bylo tak privol'no nam s toboju

Have you ever sold millions 
But yet you niggas persist to talk shit 
Get off my dick 
Ya never catch me slippin 
Rollin with the heat 
Slap the clippin 
I never thought the world 
Would start trippin 
My life's a though 
Hit the crypto 
Blow the whistle 
They think I bang 
So I pack a pistol 
Warren to the G. is a G. 
I don't f*ck with you nigga 
So don't f*ck with me 
Let's ride to the East Side 
Slide like a fo 
I pack a 44 
When I'm steppin out dough 
To the bang to the boogie 
If I speak then I spoke 
Warren G. you do it every time 
Till ya low 
Get the party lit 
Like blazin smoke 
The East Side of the beach 
West side of the coast 
You know the niggas that arrive 
With hogs 
Attack dogs 
To say niggas are down to die 
With motherfucker 

Uletaj na kryl'jach vatra 
Ty why kraj rodnoj, rodnaja pesnma nasa
Tuda gde my lebja svobodno peli
Gde bylo tak privol'no nam s'toboju

Who's the man 
I've been from London to Japan 
Stomp land to land 
And to the Egyptian sands 
You can't check me 
Disrespect me 
Ya mock me up 
With the bass bumping out my truck 
And all these police tryin to lock me up 
Money rules the world 
And I made the loot 
So don't make me shoot 
Cause trying to match'll get you down 
Every time 
I ain't trying to hurt nobody 
But I'm down for mine 
Biatch 

Money over power 
Power over money 
Money over power 
Power over money 
Money over power 
Power over money 
Money over power 
Power over money 
Money over power 
Biatch biatch 

Uletaj na kryl'jach vatra 
Ty why kraj rodnoj, rodnaja pesnma nasa
Tuda gde my lebja svobodno peli
Gde bylo tak privol'no nam s'toboju

Uletaj na kryl'jach vatra 
Ty why kraj rodnoj, rodnaja pesnma nasa
Tuda gde my lebja svobodno peli
Gde bylo tak privol'no nam s'toboju
