I used to dream myself to somewhere else each night
I dreamed in color, â€˜cause I lived in black and white.
Until I chanced upon this road that led to you,
I couldn't see how anything could be

Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation,
it's better than a dream.
Higher than the moon,
Hazy like a beautiful illusion.
Crazy and in confusion,
And better than a dream.

I used to wish I was beyond some distant door,
I knew there must be more to life
And now I'm sure.
No dreams of pirate caves,
Or Indian braves, or magic carpets could
Ever be this good,

Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation,
it's better than a dream.
Higher than the moon,
Hazy like a beautiful illusion.
Crazy and in confusion,
And better than a dream.

And better than a dream.
