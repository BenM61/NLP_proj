Step inside the tent ladies and gentlemen to see 
The freak they call Jacko the dog face man 
He walks like a man and talks like a man 
But was born with the face of a dog 
An actual freak of nature 

Bright Lights 
Blind me 
And I am whizzing by the people 
Pushing rushing to the music 
And my eyes are running 
And my legs are aching 
And there are people winning 
And the carnivals spinning 

Merry go round 
Go round 
And they make me dizzy 
People shouting as they shot and win 

And my head is ringing 
My ears are flitting 
And my hair is thinning 
And the carnivals spinning 
 
After the people have gone 
I walk along down sideshow ally 
And from the tent I hear some crying 
The sound of someone in pain 

And written brightly on the canvas and woodwork 
So that everybody could see 
Was the question they pose to the public 
When is a man not a man 
When he's a freak in the sideshow 

But we all got to cry 
Yes, we all got to cry 
And we all got to cry 
Bright lights blind me 
And I am questioned by the people 
Pushing rushing 
To the organ grinders music 

And my eyes are running 
And my legs are achy 
And their are people crying 
And the carnivals dying
