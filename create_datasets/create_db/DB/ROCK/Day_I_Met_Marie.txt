Imaging a still summer's day. 
When nothing is moving. 
Least Of All Me. 
I lay on my back in the hay. 
The warm sun was soothing. 
It made me feel good. 
The day I met Marie. 

The Sound of her whisper hello. 
Came tiptoing softly into my head. 
I opened my eyes kinda slow. 
And there she was smiling. 
It made me feel good. 
The day I met Marie. 

With the laughing eyes. 
She'd toss her hair and tantalize. 
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze. 

I remember her kiss
So soft on my brow
And the way that she said
Baby go to sleep now
Baby go to sleep now

I woke with the chill in the air
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky
I reached out but she was not there
She'd gone where she came from
But I still feel good
To think I've known Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze
