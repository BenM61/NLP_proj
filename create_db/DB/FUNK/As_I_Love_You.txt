I will love you as I love you All my life Every moment spent with you Makes me more content with you Just as you are You are all I could pray for All that you are That's what I wake up each day for Every single Touch and tingle I adore Every kiss from you to me Always seems so new to me Each one warmer Than the one before As I love you more and more and more Every single Touch and tingle I adore Every kiss from you to me Always seems so new to me Each one warmer Than the one before As I love you more and more And more (in the 1969 version repeating the last verse during fade out) (transcribed by Roman )
