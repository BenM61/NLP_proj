The Emperor of the bathroom
Is a friend of yours and mine
He's got his own religion
And can explain it in one line

He stands up on his gold throne
And tries to wire the lamp
And his kingdom falls to darkness
As his arms begin to cramp

And it offer you the mirror
And it offer you the sun
And he makes you feel so special
Like he does to everyone
Everyone
Everyone

The Emperor of the bathroom
Has been around for quite a while
A ruler of the heavens
But no stranger to the tile

With his heavy ropes and razor
He prepares to face the fight
And his subjects line the hallway
And salute with their flashlight

And it offer you the mirror
And it offer you the sun
And he makes you feel so special
Like he does to everyone
Everyone
Everyone

Everyone with half a mind is gonna be their
Anyone with anymore is gonna be elsewhere 
Everyone with half a mind is gonna be their

The Emperor of the bathroom
Has unpleasant work to do
The water will be blooded
By the time that he is through

Attendance cover their eyes
As they pull in from the back
With a tablet of instructions
To reveal the aftermath 

And it offer you the mirror 
And it offer you the sun
And he makes you feel so special
Like he does to everyone
Everyone
Everyone

Anyone with half a mind is gonna be their
