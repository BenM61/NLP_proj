Planes fly over my head
Drawing lines in the sky
Destined to be forgotten
Words you dared to say
That left the clouds in my eyes
On hold to be forgiven

Can't you see it in my face?
The struggle and the grace
Some things you cannot hide
We're dodging bullets with this game
But the pleasure and the pain
Are only there for a while

'Cause nothing lasts forever, forever
No, nothing lasts forever
We only have what we remember
We only have what we remember
We only have what we remember

Though life plays hard to get
Somehow I keep the smile
And let my heart do the rest
One thing I can regret
Is when I'm too afraid to try
To give it my very best

Don't want my memory of you
The love that once was true
Slowly fades away
Something that I can't undo
Can break my heart in two
Is what they called the twist of fate

'Cause nothing lasts forever, forever
No, nothing lasts forever
We only have what we remember
We only have what we remember
We only have what we remember
We only have what we remember
We only have what we remember
