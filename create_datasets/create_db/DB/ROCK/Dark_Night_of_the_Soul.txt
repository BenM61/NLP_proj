Dark dream world
All alone
Shadows movin'
Shadows have long gone by
Shadows have long gone by
Dark night of the soul

Our souls
Time slippin' by
I call out your name
All alone
Shadows movin'
Shadows movin'
Shadows have long gone by
Dark night of the soul

If you had only liked my face
Where are you baby?
Where are you baby?
Dark dream world
Shadows have long gone by
Dark night of the soul

Distant bell ring
But steps echo
No one on these streets
Callin' out your name
Where are you baby?
It's a dream world
Dark dream world
Dark night of the soul
