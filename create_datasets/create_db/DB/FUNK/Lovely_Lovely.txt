With your fingertips when you kiss my lips
I know that you love me the way you move your hips
I know that you love me

An earthly joy, a pleasure
I'm grateful, so grateful

Your love is lovely, lovely
Oh, beautiful one
You're lovely, lovely

You're careful of who and what you let in your mind
I want to protect what's yours and what's mine
I cherish you and I'll honor you, babe

Your love is lovely, lovely
Oh, beautiful one, beautiful one
You're lovely, lovely
