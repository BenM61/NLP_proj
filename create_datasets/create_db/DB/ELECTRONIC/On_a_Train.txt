Thanks I'm fine
But I've nothing to give
But I just have to leave
Head off I would rather live on a train

And now I'm dying
'Cause I don't want to be here
I don't want to be seen
Head off I would rather live on a train

Yes I lie
If I tell you I'm right
Oh baby I lie
If I tell you I'm right

Thanks I'm down
'Cause I've nothing to lose
I'm alone in a cruise
Head off I would rather live on a train

And now I'm crying
'Cause I don't want to be here
I don't want to be seen
Head off I would rather live on a train

Yes I lie
If I tell you I'm right
Oh baby I lie
If I tell you I'm right

Oh baby I lie
If I tell you I'm right
Oh baby I lie
If I tell you I'm right

Destination nowhere on this train
Destination nowhere on a train
You got nothing to lose
Except you

Yes I lie
If I tell you I'm right
Oh baby I lie
If I tell you I'm right

Oh baby I lie
If I tell you I'm right
Oh baby I lie
If I tell you I'm right
