Someone said you was, runnin' 'round 
Like you owned the world 
It's no secret, you're the talk of the town 
You know, the best of the girls 

That's right, and now you 
Walked right out of my heart 
You know it's all over town 
I said you walked walked, right right, out of my heart 
You know it's all over town 
Now it's all over 

You're so neat, you're so cute, you're so fine 
You know that everybody wants some action 
They see you comin' and they act like it's cool 
Because they know that something's happenin' 

That's right, because you 
Walked right out of my heart 
And now it's all over town 
I said you walked walked, right right, out of my heart 
You know the word's goin' 'round 
Now it's all over, now it's all over 

I don't care (he don't care) 
I don't care 

I don't care care what they say about us anymore 
I don't care what they want to do 
Baby all my heart is for you 
No matter what happens 

There's no reason why we still can't be friends 
You know we all need someone we can talk to 
No matter what they say, we both know I'm right 
After all we've been through 

And now you walked right out of my heart 
You know it's all over town 
I said you walked (walked), right (right), out of my heart 
You know the word's goin' 'round 

Now it's all over 
I said you walked, right out of my heart 
I said you walked (walked), right (right), out of my heart 
You walked right out of my heart 
And now it's all over town
