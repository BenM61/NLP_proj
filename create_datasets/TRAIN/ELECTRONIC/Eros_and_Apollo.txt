Yeah, with a boy like that it's serious 

There's a boy who is so wonderful 
That girls who see him cannot find back home
And the gigolos run like spiders when he comes 
'Cause he is Eros and he's Apollo 

Girls, with a boy like that it's serious 
Senoritas, don't follow him 
Soon, he will eat your hearts like cereals 
Sweet Lolitas, don't go 
You're still young 

But every night they fall like dominoes 
How he does it, only heaven knows 
All the other men turn gay wherever he goes 
Wow! 

Girls, with a boy like that it's serious 
Senoritas, don't follow him 
Soon, he will eat your hearts like cereals 
Sweet Lolitas, don't go 
You're still young 

Yeah, with a boy like that it's serious 
Senoritas, don't go 
Please don't go 

Soon, he will eat your hearts like cereals 
Sweet Lolitas, don't go 
You're still young 

Sweet Lolitas, don't go 
You're still young

Still young, still young, still young
Still young, still young, still young
Still young
