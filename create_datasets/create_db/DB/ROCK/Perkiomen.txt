Perkiomen, somewhat cloudy
Indian water slipping down a mountain stream
You know what I mean

Painted lady touch the water
Forest standing, sentry over mossy wall
She comes when you call

Outside, you've got me slipping like a honey slide
I'll take a ride with a willow weeping
Tears of strength into the stream
And the waterfall is a tense of all

Perkiomen, somewhat cloudy
Indian water slipping down a mountain stream
You know what I mean, ooh woo

Outside, you've got me slipping like a honey slide
I'll take a ride with a willow weeping
Tears leading to the stream
And the waterfall is a tense of all

Perkiomen, somewhat cloudy
Indian water slipping down a mountain stream
You know what I mean, I feel Perkiomen
