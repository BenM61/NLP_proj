I know what you're thinking
Your eyes give you away
We've been talking all night long
And there's nothing left to say
It's a mutual emotion
Nothing's standing in the way

I've got this feelin' babe
That this was meant to be
You've been playing hard to get
I've waited patiently
It just keeps getting harder
There's a point of no return
'Cause the heat is in the moment
And the moment's in your hands

CHORUS
Take this love and let the night begin
(I want to give it all to you)
Time for you to show the way you feel
(You know how long I've waited)
I need a reason, a meaning in my life
So open up and take this love tonight

Too many wasted nights of hollow victories
But I know this time is diff'rent babe 'cause you mean so much to me
You're the answer to my question
And I need the answer now
'Cause the heat is in the moment
And the moment says it all

CHORUS
