If you need somebody around you
Well then I'll be the one who's there
If you need somebody to listen
Well then I'll be the one who's there

But you seem to think you'll manage alone
I'll be around and I'll be waiting for your call

If you need somebody to love you
Well then I'll be the one who's there

Yes I'll be the one who's there
