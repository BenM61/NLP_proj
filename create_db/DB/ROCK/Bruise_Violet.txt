You got this thing that 
Really makes me hot 
You got a lot and more 
When you get caught 
You got this thing that 
Follows me around 
You fucking bitch well 
I hope your insides rot 

Liar, liar, liar 

You see the stars through 
Eyes lit up with lies 
You got your stories 
All twisted up in mine 
You got this thing that 
Follows me around 
You were born with glue 
Instead of spine 

Liar, liar, liar 

Of thee I sing 
Tied to a string 
You got this thing that 
Follows me around 
You got this thing that 
Really makes me hot 
You got a lot and more 
When you get caught 

Bruise violet 
Bruise violet 
Bruise violet
