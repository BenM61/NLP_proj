I got seven nights to rock
I got seven nights to roll
Seven nights, I'm gonna have a whirl
Seven nights with a different girl
Seven nights to rock
I got seven nights to roll 

Monday, at sister Suzy's ball
Tuesday, at the old dance hall
Wednesday, at the road house inn
Thursday, at the lion's den
Friday, at the chatter box
Saturday and Sunday, everybody rocks 

Seven nights to rock
I got seven nights to roll
Seven nights, I'm gonna have a whirl
Seven nights with a different girl
Seven nights to rock
I got seven nights to roll 

I got seven nights to rock
I got seven nights to roll
I got seven nights, I'm gonna show my face
With a different chick and in a different place
Seven nights to rock
Seven nights to roll 

Monday, I'm gonna rock with Jane
Tuesday, it's gonna be Lorraine
Wednesday, I'm taking Nancy Lee
Thursday, it's Betty Lou and me
Friday, I'm gonna jive with Sue
Saturday and Sunday, any chick will do 

Seven nights to rock
I got seven nights to roll
Seven nights, I'm gonna show my face
With a different chick and in a different place
Seven nights to rock
I got seven nights to roll
