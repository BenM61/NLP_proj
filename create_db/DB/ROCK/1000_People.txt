A thousand people yell
Shouting my name
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

And a thousand people smile
Smiling at me
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am
When the sky is filled with stars
I find a place inside my heart

Some people can take a blow
And won't ever drop
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

She will tell me she loves me
And she won't ever stop
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die

The coldness in my soul
And I reach out for her to hold
Then I watch her close her eyes
It's only me that needs to cry

And if I stay with you
Do you believe that I'll pull through?

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am
When the sky is filled with stars
I find a place inside my heart

Then I watch her close her eyes
It's only me that needs to cry

A thousand people yell
Shouting my name
But I wanna die in this moment
I wanna die
