I had no intention I would get fucked up tonight
But I looked in your eyes and they went through me like a knife
I came here with my crew, I lost them
Came with my cool, I dropped it
And if I'm being honest, I'm being honest

I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that (yea)
I'm too weak and I'm never like that
Light-speed and I think I might crash
One trip, damn, I'ma never go back

But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife (yeah, I said it)
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (alright)

Maybe it's the music or the red stain on your lips
I'm wondering when the right time is to go in for a kiss
But I'm thinking past that lover, I'm ready to meet your momma
If I'm being honest, I'm being honest

I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that, like that
I wish you knew what I'm thinking right now
I don't know if I can say it out loud
I don't know if I can say it out loud

But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife (yeah, I said it)
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife

Baby, baby, baby
You got me talking crazy
I figure if I say it
You just might be my lady
Baby, it's you, yeah
Baby, it's you, yeah
And oooh, I feel like something good is 'bout to be going on
And baby it's you, yeah yeah
And baby it's you, yeah

And everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife
Yeah I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (c'mon)
Everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife (sing it with me)
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife (alright, c'mon)

(Everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife)
