Go on, go on
Leave me breathless
Come on

The daylight's fading slowly
The time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak

I cannot lie
From you I can not hide
I'm losing will to try
Can't hide it
Can't fight it

So go on, go on
Come on leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
'Till I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Let me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah come on

And if there's no tomorrow
And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow

It's like a dream
Although I'm not asleep
I never want to wake up
Don't lose it
Don't leave it

So go on, go on
Come on leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
'Till I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Let me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah come on

And I can't lie
From you I can not hide
I've lost my will to try
Can't hide it
Can't fight it

So go on, go on
Come on leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
'Till I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss

Go on, go on
Come on leave me breathless
Go on, go on
Come on leave me breathless
Go on, go on
Come on leave me breathless
Go on, go on
