Oh my (oh my), my troubled mind (my troubled mind)
Never rested, never still
(Never rested, never still)
(Never rested, never still)
I've found (I've found) that nor you nor I (nor you nor I)
Would ever compromise our lives
(Would ever compromise our lives)
(Would ever compromise our lives)

Even though I sound selfish
I'm all right, better off your mind
Even if the best years of my life have been lived I don't mind

I've been stalling on the coastline, staying out of sight
Been stoned and overthinking, misreading all your signs
I'm done watching on the action, eyeing from the side
So tired and out of patience, been blunt and out of line

Oh I keep moving but I know
I ain't fooling anyone
I'm an old soul, my love, a victim of
Slowly giving up the ghost

Hanging 'round out of habit
Should have walked or taken off by now
You keep on pushing 'til I break down
Let me break up like a man

I've been stalling on the coastline, staying out of sight
Been stoned and overthinking, misreading all your signs
I'm done watching on the action, eyeing from the side
So tired and out of patience, been blunt and out of line

Never rested, never still
Never rested, never still
Never rested, never still
Never rested, never still

I've been stalling on the coastline, staying out of sight
Been stoned and overthinking, misreading all your signs
I'm done watching on the action, eyeing from the side
So tired and out of patience, been blunt and out of line
