Every Sunday morning in front of the TV
Recording with a microphone Naya Zindagi
Pioneer Gurdas Maan
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan

Kept our parents alive
Gave them the will to survive
Working inna de factories
Sometimes sweeping de floor

Unsung heroines an heroes
Yes they open de door
They came a long time ago
But now it seems we've arrived

Naya Zindagi! Naya Jeevan
New Way New Life
Stayed an we fought an now de future's open wide
New Way New Life

Naya Zindagi! Naya Zindagi!
New Way New Life
Naya Zindagi! Naya Jeevan
Tjinder pon de radio

Dis is England's new voice
Censorship for years
But now dem have no choice
Running through de playground

We could never have known
Dat in de future
Our role models would be home grown
And now we're walking down de street

Wid a brand new pride
A spring inna de step
Wid our heads held high
Young Asian brothers an sisters

Moving forward, side by side
Naya Zindagi! Naya Jeevan
New Way New Life
Our opportunity will no longer be denied

New Way New Life
Naya Zindagi! Naya Jeevan
And we're supposed to be cool
Inna de dance our riddims rule

But we knew it all along
'cause our parents made us strong
Never abandoned our culture
Just been moving it along

Technology our tradition
Innovation inna the song
Now de struggle continues
To reverse every wrong

New heroines and heroes
Inna de battle we belong
When we reach de glass ceiling
We will blow it sky high

Naya Zindagi! Naya Jeevan
New Way New Life
Stayed an we fought an now de future's open wide
New Way New Life

Naya Zindagi! Naya Zindagi!
New Way New Life
Naya Zindagi! Naya Jeevan
