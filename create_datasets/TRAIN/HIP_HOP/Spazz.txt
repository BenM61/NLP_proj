I'mma make money fast
Balmain's on my ass
Dump a nigga like ash
I'm the best he never had
I'm a real street bitch
I don't like checks bitch, I want cash
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz
Put a foreign on smash
Ride it 'til it's no gas
Flame a blunt and won't pass
See through niggas like glass
Skipping cities and the gang with me
We been doing numbers like math
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz

Spend a feature on Balenciagas
Then I put the rest up in the stash
Through the city, probably doing fifty
But I got two-hundred on the dash
Ask your nigga, do he got milk?
'Cause I left him with a cum-stache
Hit the BM went to Jupiter
Bitches only getting stupider
Keep a nigga with the Ruger tucked
All this switchin', don't know who to trust
They get money, this ain't new to us
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I'm coming and I gotta put money up
Thumbin', I run through them C-Notes
Broke nigga, we don't speak your lingo
Walking in my new Valentinos
I come through the back, with my niggas in tact
And we dressed in all black like we emo
Flame up, we get high like a hero
Got money, we don't give a f*ck if it's legal
I might call your number like bingo
If you cash me out like casinos
Won't get in my feelings and he know
Could never play me 'cause I'm single

I'mma make money fast
Balmain's on my ass
Dump a nigga like ash
I'm the best he never had
I'm a real street bitch
I don't like checks bitch, I want cash
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz
Put a foreign on smash
Ride it 'til it's no gas
Flame a blunt and won't pass
See through niggas like glass
Skipping cities and the gang with me
We been doing numbers like math
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz

Wake up in the morning
Only thing I'm thinkin' 'bout is how to get richer
Took your nigga to the spot, he saw a bag of money, he thought I was a stripper
Ever since I could remember I been balling like I'm really at the dipper
Shawty used to talk shit now she want a pic to put up on her Twitter
Treat a nigga like a treat, call him when I need a fix
I'm in the gang getting tit, I was broke, now I'm lit
Hop in the whip and pull up on the curb
If he on foot he get hit with the curve
All of my niggas is strapped like the Purge
Pick up a check at the mall and I splurge

Might not let a nigga hit but if he getting pension, I let 'em lick it
If I gotta make the call, then we set it off, nigga, Jada Pinkett
Cellphone steady ringing, if I ain't the money callin' I'mma miss it
Diamonds on me and they wicked, I can't stop, I need a ticket

I'mma make money fast
Balmain's on my ass
Dump a nigga like ash
I'm the best he never had
I'm a real street bitch
I don't like checks bitch, I want cash
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz
Put a foreign on smash
Ride it 'til it's no gas
Flame a blunt and won't pass
See through niggas like glass
Skipping cities and the gang with me
We been doing numbers like math
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz
