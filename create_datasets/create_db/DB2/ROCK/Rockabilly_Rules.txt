There's a crazy sound that sends my soul
It's part hillbilly part rock and roll
All you need is a guitar, bull bass and a big ol'drum
Well the cats and I get a kick from this song
Cause our feelings about it run deep and strong

We're naming this song rockabilly rules okay
Well rockabilly rules. Okay
Rockabilly's cool. Oh yeah
Rockabilly rocks. Let's bop
Well rockabilly billy bop. Let's bop
Well rockabilly rules. Okay

Well it's a sound that's around to stay
I said rock rock rockabilly rules. Okay

Well we packed our bags and we hit the trail
Now we're always on time just like the U.S. mail
Through wind and through snow
We never ever miss a show
Well we rocked all around this great big world
And I'm telling you man we're gonna give it a whirl
