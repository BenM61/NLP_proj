I need you to get me off 
I'm your bomb, baby, ready to explode 
I need you to get me off 
Be your slave, do anything I'm told 

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affection

I need you to pull my trigger, baby 
I can't do it alone
I need you to be my main thing
Plaything, pillar of stone
Ooh, hoo

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affection
Come on, kiss the gun
Whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa...

Come on, kiss the gun
Guaranteed for fun

Sex shooter 
Shootin' love in your direction 
Oh, I'm a sex shooter 
Come and play with my affection

Listen boys... 
No girl's body can compete with mine
No girl's rap can top my lines
No girl's kiss can ring your chimes
Come on boy, let's make some time

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction, oh yeah
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affection
Everybody sing it

Sex shooter 
Shootin' love in your direction
(I can't hear you!)
Sex shooter
Come and play with my affection
All the nasty people sing it

Sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction (Oh baby, everybody
Sex shooter
Come and play with my affection
