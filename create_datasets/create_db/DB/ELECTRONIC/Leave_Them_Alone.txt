When will we start livin'
By da rule
Of takin' & givin'
When will we start 2 try
2 open up & wonder why
Can you hear them prayin'
Listen 2 what they're sayin'
This is an indian call
So listen 2 it all

Why don't you leave me alone
Oh le la la
eh le la la la
Oh le la la
eh le la la la
Oeh le la la
eh le la la la
Oeh le la la
eh le la la la

What is black & what is white
Tell me what's wrong & what's right
Is there a way 2 say
What's going on today
Indians tryin' & cryin'
Da chief of a redskin is dyin'
Da message is very clear
Listen while they're near

Why don't you leave me alone ...
Force!
If you dare go 4 yours
Here is mine & I'm opening doors
Have a break when you travel
& take back your culture
2 a hi level
I's of a chinaman in my face
Da blood of an indian
Mixed in my race
So come on
gimme some
Close your I's
& go where you're from
I'm not white
I'm not a blackskin
& let me tell you this
I'm not a redskin
We are human beings & equal
Da same flesh & blood
Da same people
So here we go with da flow
Twenty 4 Seven is here
2 let you know
Pay respect 2 da indian home
Leave them alone!!!

Why don't you leave me alone ...
