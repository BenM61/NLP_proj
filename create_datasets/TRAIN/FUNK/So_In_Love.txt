Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm glad this week is over
I need to get away
Go home and throw my clothes on
Come get you right away
Can't wait to see you looking lovely
I hope you're thinking of me
'Cause all I want is time with you
And only nothing more

(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So in love with you)
(So)

I see you cross the room
Talking with some men
I love your mannerisms, babe
The way you handle them
Oh, I'm so proud to do you
So attracted to you too
You're so damn good to me
In everything you do

'Cause I'm so in love 
Oh I'm so in love, babe
I'm so in love
Oh, baby, I'm so, so, so, so, so, so

Listen, I'm so in love with you
That I can't help myself
(Can't help it)
As long as it's me and you
We don't need nothing else
I've got you
Got you
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Oh, let's make it last forever

I'm so in love
First ting in the morning
When I open my eyes and see you
I feel like a breath of fresh air
I feel like I can fly
That I can get by

You know that I love you baby
Any obstacle that come my way
You know I'd do anything for you, babe
'Cause in your love, oh baby, oh baby

I'm so in love, yeah
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything 
I'd do anything for you
I'd do it, I'd do it baby, I'd do it
Do anything for you

Anytime is all right
If you want me baby you got me (know that I love you) 

Anything for you want me to do, I'll do it for you
Anytime is all right
(If you want me baby, I'm bad)
So good to me
Anytime is all right
If you want me baby, I'm bad (I'd do anything for you)
Anytime is all right
If you want me

Anything you want me to do
Oh, it'd be a blessing for me too
Oh baby, oh baby
Sugar is sweet but not like you
Raindrops fall
Sunshine 
But when I look at your eyes
Don't want nobody else baby
