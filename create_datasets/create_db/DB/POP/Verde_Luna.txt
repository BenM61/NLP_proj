It sounds so nice, what you're proposin'
Just once or twice, and not disclosin'
And not disclosin' how we're really really feelin'
What you're proposin' the other night
As I was leavin', I looks left and right

And not believin'
And not believin' that I'd finally be leavin'
What you're proposin', now get it right
If I'm composin', but then I might

Be runny nosin'
I might be runny runny runny runny nosin'
But you're supposin'
Don't be so sure, and just supposin'
We yell for more, and compromisin'
And compromisin' leads to really really feelin'

And just supposin', don't get me wrong
I'm only dreamin', it can't be long
I must be dreamin'
I must be dreamin', dreamin', only only dreamin'
Am I just supposin'?

It sounds so nice, what you're proposin'
Just once or twice, and not disclosin'
And not disclosin' how we're really really feelin'
What you're proposin' the other night
As I was leavin', I looks left and right
And not believin'
And not believin' that I'd finally be leavin'
What you're proposin'
And not believin' that I'd finally be leavin'
What you're proposin'
And not believin' that I'd finally be leavin'
What you're proposin'
