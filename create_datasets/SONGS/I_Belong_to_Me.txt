I belong to me

It's not that I don't wanna share my life with you, baby
It's just that I'm the one I need to be true to, baby
And I won't give up me to be part of you

It's not that I don't want to have you in my life, baby
It's just you gotta know that it's got to be right, baby
Before I open up my heart to you

I don't need somebody to complete me
I complete myself
Nobody's got to belong to somebody else

I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection

I belong to me
I'm one, not half of two
And if you're gonna love me
You should know this, baby
That I belong to me

I gotta let you know before I let you in, baby
That who I am is not about who I am with, baby
That don't mean I don't wanna be here with you, I do

I don't need somebody to complete me
I want you to know
I'll give all my love but I'm not givin' all my soul

I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection

I belong to me
I'm one, not half of two
And if you're gonna love me
You should know this, baby
That I belong to me

Love don't mean changin' who you are
To be who somebody wants you to be
Nobody's got to belong to nobody

I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection

I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection

I belong to me
I'm one, not half of two
And if you're gonna love me
You should know this, baby
That I belong to me
