At the very mention of your name
Get shivers down my back and in my brain
The parts that used to function normally
Are now as you can see
Acting very strange
Oh at the very mention of your name
Don't know why but if I were tied up in chains
I would somehow be released
All problems too would cease
My heart would never feel no pain
At the very mention of your name
At the very moment you arrive
I stop living and I start to feel alive
You have the power that's taken over me
Led me to believe
Call it what you like
At the very moment you arrive
I suspect that I will pinch myself to find
That it really isn't true
It really can't be you
Walking up the garden drive
At the very moment you arrive
And although it's been said well over a thousand times
Here's a thousand more
Will you still be mine forever and evermore
At the very mention of your name
What am I to do and who am I to blame
The effect upon my life can only be described
A bit like being hit my a train
At the very mention of your name
