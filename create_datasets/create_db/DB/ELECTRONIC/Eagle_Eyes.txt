Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes

Marching down the street in my lightning feet
And the shine's too fine to be real
Fake it so I care for the glisten and the glare
And now it's something I'm starting to feel

Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes
I caught with my eagle eyes
Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes

Oh
My, my, my eagle eyes

Left it up to the great wide open
To find out the places I'd be
In my sleep they were growing all the time
And now they've grown too far for me

I didn't know how to wait out the ages
So I wrecked my only way through
Blind bravery forgets the wars it wages
But I'll fight just to see if it's true

Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes
Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes

Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes

Left it up to the great wide open
To find out the places I'd be
In my sleep they were growing all the time
And now they've grown too far for me

I didn't know how to wait out the ages
So I wrecked my only way through
Blind bravery forgets the wars it wages
But I'll fight just to see if it's true

Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes
Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes
Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes
Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
My, my, my eagle eyes

Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes
