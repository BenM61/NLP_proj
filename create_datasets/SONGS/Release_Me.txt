Why rise and shine,
another 21 hours ruined by my voice
Fine gift of mine, offensive cloudiness showers though not by choice, yet
Not just unrelatable, just

Release me, from what I've done
Release me, from what I've done

Tying the binds,
a bitter will still empowers, but wont fill the void
Blind by design, another stellar potential view has been destroyed, again

Not just unattainable, just

Release me, from what I've done
Release me, from what I've done

I've let down what I care for most, it's hypocritical, and unforgivable
Lock me up when I'm intentional, and unpredictable, not forgettable, please
