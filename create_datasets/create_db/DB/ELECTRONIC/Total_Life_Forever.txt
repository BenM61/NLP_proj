I know a place, where I can go when I'm low down
To your house, down to your house
I will go, when I'm low.

I know a face, who I can show my true colours 
To your arms, into your arms,
I will go, when I'm low.

'Cause total life forever, will never be enough, no

To your house, down to your house

To your arms, into your arms,

Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down, down low.
Let's take life slow.
Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down, down low.
Let's take life slow.
Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down, down low.
Let's take life slow.

I know a place, where I can go when I'm low down
To your house, down to your house
