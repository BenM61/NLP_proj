It was fascination, I know
And it might have ended right there at the start
Just a passing glance, just a brief romance
And I might have gone on my way empty-hearted

It was fascination, I know
Seeing you alone with the moonlight above
Then I touched your hand and next moment I kissed you
Fascination turned to love

(It was fascination)
