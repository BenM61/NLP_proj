I just got a letter, a letter, a letter 
The sweetest little letter from my honey today 
I opened up the letter, the letter, the letter, 
It made me feel much better, here's what it had to say
It said, "I had a dream last night 

I dreamed I held you awfully tight 
You don't know how I'm missing you 
I wish that I were kissing you..." 
I just got a letter, a letter, a letter 
The sweetest little letter from my honey today!
