Open your eyes and see my face 
Slow down for me in this dirty rat race 
You could be fat, you could be thin 
Wake up with me in the Raddison 
It's two for one or one for free 
Get it now 'cause it's a freebie 
One, two, three, four 
I'm the one that you adore 

99 cents 

I'm not crazy about money, but 
I like what it can do 
Shopping is a cultural activity 
In this worlds nothings for free 
Buy a book or buy a car 
Look what a stud you are 
Its not the what, its more the where, 
Who you know and how 

99 cents 
Luxury, the income tax of vanity 

Supermarket shoppers all over the world 
It's not as cheap as it may look 
Rob you blind 'cause I'm a crook 
Read all about it in John Pilgers book 

Rattrap, I see a rat trap 
But the cheese I want the sleaze, sleaze sleaze so 
Jimmy up the street singing something great to the beat 
Goody goody boy, got you back in town 
Gotta go gotta go 
Gotta go gotta go 
Where is what with who and how 
You want it fast you want it now 
Give it to me right now high and low 
Fun and free got loads of dough 
Life is fast life is cheap 
Got nothing to do but hang in the street 
Where is what with who and how 
You want it fast you want it now
