I've been, I've been so focused, got me so locked on you
Ever since you walked in baby, you light up the room
Scared to approach you but I think it's what I wanna do, do
Yes you, look in my eye, you wanna know why it's me
Something you got and something I'd die to see
The way that you smile, I think that it needs to be, be

I just want 24 hours or even less if that's too much to hold you close
To hold you close
You got this look like it's ours, I want it all to be ours
Even if tomorrow, I have to let you go, oh

And if you're too smart to love me, dumb
If you've seen too much to love me blind
Can I use my hands to cover your eyes?
Just for one night, just for one night?
And if you're too smart to love me, dumb
If she was too cold to leave you kind
Can you forget her look into my eyes?
Just for one night, just for one night?

Here now, close as I've been, I feel you breathing on me
Don't wanna give it up, pour another drink so we
Can get lost in the music, lost in the bass of the beat, beat
Yeah yeah, I really can't help it boy, you like a magnet pulling me
So here I am in the palm of your hand, don't you see?
Promise me, promise you won't make a fool of me, me

I just want 24 hours or even less if that's too much to hold you close
To hold you close
You got this look like it's ours, I want it all to be ours
Even if tomorrow, I have to let you go, oh

And if you're too smart to love me, dumb
If you've seen too much to love me blind
Can I use my hands to cover your eyes?
Just for one night, just for one night?
And if you're too smart to love me, dumb
If she was too cold to leave you kind
Can you forget her look into my eyes?
Just for one night, just for one night?

And if you're too smart to love me, dumb
If you've seen too much to love me blind
Can I use my hands to cover your eyes
Just for one night, just for one night?
Just for one
Just for one night, just for one night
Just for one
Just for one night, just for one night
Just for one

And if you're too smart to love me, dumb
If you've seen too much to love me blind
Can I use my hands to cover your eyes?
Just for one night, just for one night?
