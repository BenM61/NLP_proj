Uh oh, OK I got these girls quite hype, only thing on right now, like a night light,
While my brother Wayne rockin' out like a white stripe, I'm a kill the game,
I'm the young money white night (white night) Yeah
Plus I'm looking for the right type cautious of a flood so I always lay the right pipe
West put me on the mart, keep life light plus I go hard for the women that I might wife
I put the ring on her index finger so if you wanna keep your girl please don't bring her
I bet that I'm the type of guy that she got a thing for,
You would block me but this ain't jinga
Yeah, and she someone I would work with, 
That's what I could tell from what she's showing on the surface.
I ain't saying that I'm requesting anyone 
That's perfect but I just need a woman that'll make it all worth it

[Chorus: x2]

Knock, knock , knock, knock, knock,
Knock, knock , knock, knock, knock,
This that knock, knock , knock, knock, knock
This that knock, knock , knock, knock, knock

I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one,
I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one,
I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one,
I'm the one, one, one, one, one, one
