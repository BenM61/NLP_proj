You give me the reason, you give me control
I gave you my purity, my purity you stole
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat
And lies, lies, lies

It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin

You give me the anger, you give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence, well I get what I deserve
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced, to be defaced
Your need for me has been replaced
And if I can't have everything
Well, then just give me a taste

It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain it gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin

You give me the reason, you give me control
I gave you my purity and my purity you stole
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat
And lies, lies, lies

It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
Well, my sin, it comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin
