Shake down the stars, pull down the clouds
Turn off the moon, do it soon
I can't enjoy this night without you
Shake down the stars
Dry up the streams
Stop all my dreams.

Cut off the breeze, do it please
I never thought I'd cry about you
Shake down the stars
I gave you my arms, my lips, my heart
My love, my life, my all
But the best that I had to offer you
I found was all too small
Crush every rose, hush ev'ry prayer
Break every vow, do it now
I know I can't go on without you
Shake down the stars
