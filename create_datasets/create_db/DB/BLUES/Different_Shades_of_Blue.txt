The sun's been shinin' down on me day and night
Gettin' away with murder, livin' a lucky life
All good things finally come to an end
Hit ya like a train if you try to beat it
Everybody knows that she broke your heart
Everybody knows that it's tearing you apart
The row you've been sailin' on sprung a leak
You won't admit, but it's startin' to make you weep

When you got nothing left to lose
Might sound good, but I'm not sure that's true
You carry the pain around and that's what sees you through
The different shades of blue

Tell by the way you hang your head
The way you cast your eyes and things you haven't said
You've gathered past ten years written on your face
Your whole damn life's been one big race
Everybody goes there whether they want to or not
Everybody starts to hold on to what they got
And start to settle in with the long hall
Real life baby, oh, you can't have it all

When you got nothing left to lose
Might sound good, but I'm not sure that's true
You carry the pain around and that's what sees you through
The different shades of blue

When you got nothing left to lose
Might sound good, but I'm not sure that's true
You carry the pain around and that's what sees you through
The different shades of blue
