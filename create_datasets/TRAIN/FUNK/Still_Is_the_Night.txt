Still is the night, not a sound
Not a movement in this whole house
Listen, it's been that way since you've been gone
Oh, just a lonely man in an empty home

Still, still, still is the night
Oh, more tears, oh, I'm gonna have to cry
You took the one thing that I really need
Oh, yes, I do now
When you took your love way from me

Bring it on home, bring your sweet love home to me
Cause I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, oh, oh, oh
Oh, how still is the night
I wanna say one more time

Oh, how still is the night
Oh, how still is the night
Oh, how still is the night
