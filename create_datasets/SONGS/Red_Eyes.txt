She could never be closer
And ever closer then tales can tell
But I can't fail

She could never be closer
And who's the one who casts the spell
Oh, I can't tell

Pieces falling in the games you play
And even castles could not get away

Red eyes
Red eyes

Her lips are around you
You feel the sweat against your skin
Oh, the mess you're in

Pieces falling in the games you play
And even castles could not get away

Red eyes
Red eyes

Pieces falling in the games we play
And even lovers could not get away

Red eyes
Red eyes
