(Verse 1:)
Brace yourself cause here we come
Us three unite to become one and get this party started
So get up outta your chair cause we're taking you there not a worry or care
Gonna dance until you feel it all in your soul
Come on and lose control
You can't sit still cause the music is taking you where you want to be

We make it hot and you know that we came to blow this spot
So lets go we keep it moving
Rock to this beat you hear me pumpin through your town
Because we're down for the get down
Stop, look and listen this is how we do it
Shock through your system when you listen to it
Rock to this beat you hear me pumping through your town
Because we're down for the get down

(Verse 2:)
We're here to let you know that we ain't foolin around
When the music hits your body it's hard to sit down
So everybody get on up and dance away your blues
Grab somebody show them that you're down for the get down too
You can't sit still cause the music is taking you where you want to be

We make it hot and you know that we came to blow this spot
So lets go we keep it moving
Rock to this beat you hear me pumpin through your town
Because we're down for the get down
Stop, look and listen this is how we do it
Shock through your system when you listen to it
Rock to this beat you hear me pumping through your town
Because we're down for the get down
We make it hot and you know that we came to blow this spot
So lets go we keep it moving
Rock to this beat you hear me pumpin through your town
Because we're down for the get down

(Bridge:)
Stop, look and listen this is how we do it
Shock through your system when you listen to it
Rock to this beat you hear me pumping through your town
Because we're down for the get down
You can't sit still cause the music is taking you where you want to be

We make it hot and you know that we came to blow this spot
So lets go we keep it moving
Rock to this beat you hear me pumpin through your town
Because we're down for the get down
Stop, look and listen this is how we do it
Shock through your system when you listen to it
