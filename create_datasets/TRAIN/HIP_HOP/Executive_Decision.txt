Diamond cut vocals carved sculptures
Gats and holsters, MAC's and four-fifths
Two plagued veracious
We smoke spliffs when the dro's lit hoes get hit
Have them blow dick, blow the whole clique
Jeeps, Tahoe, shoes be Salvatore Ferragamo
Catch a homo, guns long like Mutombo
From Atlanta Hawk, rap fans I'mma stalk y'all
While we ban the pork, thought Farrak taught y'all
The god sports all dejoun, four wheel
Push the Range all year, vision a war near
I lay it out for y'all, its money and ice
That's how I'm running your wife
Stay whipping that Vipe
Clip in your life, down to pint size
Firm slice pies, couple of trife guys in tinted up white 5

Who's the first to set it?
At times my thirst's pathetic
Nature one of The Firm, our word's phonetic
At seven digits, first class trips to some I'll never visit
Outlook, remain pessimistic
Used to jostle in hostile environments buying whips
Cheating life out of its requirements
Psychics predict that I'll be dying rich
Until then catch me chilling, flying in a giant six
On some next shit, went from humble, now it's hectic
Reminiscing when they use to call me desperate
Minor drawbacks, I had to learn not to f*ck with small cats
And fake cartier and straw hats
Stick them on a mixtape, they think they're all that
But just speeding through, never sounding reasonable son
Whatever's the cause I know it's feasible
Bought your way in the game, the rates is seasonable

If we keep going hard, we're gonna take this money
Take money money take take money money
Take money take take money money
If we just play our part, we're gonna make this money
Make money money make make money money
Make money money make make money

You know how we're living, Firm shit nigga

Yo, circle through the orbit
Stock bonds, I own corporate
Rock velour shit
Filthy rich from Coke endorsements
You must've lost sense
My whole Firm we walk with offense
I push a Porsche bent
F*ck your main bitch of your expense
Laws intense, high ways
Death throughout the tri-state
Who violate? '98 Lex, NY plates
Well modernized, wide body cup with foreign eyes
You far behind, I'm rock the reptiles, it's still Karl Kani's
Guard your eyes, mystical movements hard to size
We harmonize and blew force that's way beyond the skies
Love position, parlaying, ducking drug convictions
Thug intentions every few months of this mission
Its principles, master my square, no identicals
Invisible, I've figured you wise so play it sensible

If we keep going hard, we're gonna take this money
Take money money take take money money
Take money take take money money
If we just play our part, we're gonna make this money
Make money money make make money money
Make money money make make money
If we keep going hard, we're gonna take this money
Take money money take take money money
Take money take take money money
If we just play our part, we're gonna make this money
Make money money make make money money
Make money money make make money

Yo you see, yo see what we're doing son
You stick 20 and we're making 40 (See how's going down)
And 40 gon' make 80 and 80 gon' 60 son
We're entre-preneuring right now, (It's simple arithmetic)
Grossing development man (Corporate world)
You know what I mean? (I hope they're ready for the Firm niggas)
(They're ready for the Firm niggas?) Man, I don't think so
Son, hold up, pull that, pull that
(I don't think there's no other) They're mosquitoes right now
(I don't think there's no other families out there) The allegiance
(That has the strength to survive in today's game, fo'real?) Ha ha ha
Playing with big boys now, man
You will recognize or feel what we're trying to do
(Millionaires behind bitches) Or either feel what we're trying to do
(Word up)
