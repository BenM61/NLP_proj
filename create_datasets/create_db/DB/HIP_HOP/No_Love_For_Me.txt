If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'mma play 'til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin

And I keep spot that we can go to chill

You fuckin' wit' me, ain't keepin' your health right
'Cause me and my Rolls, we keep it jail tie
The shit I pack is heavy, but the shells live
When they drop the same time, you drop without a fight
Burnin' anything that I'm puttin' my name on
You might take a 'Drag', but you can't flame 'On'
I know y'all niggas don't know me, wit a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know who we are
Niggas spittin' mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me leaned at the bar
Spittin' fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
'Cause dog you don't wanna see how my semi act
Fake hustlin' niggas you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (C'mon)

Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me

Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Uh, uh
What you niggas want? 'Cause I got it right here
Y'all niggas front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
F*ck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit, will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I f*ck with Drag-On, 'cause he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all takin' over ain't shit the same
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no other cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no other cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me, c'mon
