Na-na-na-na (woo!)
Na-na-na-yeah (woo!)
Na-na-na-na

I'm so, so done of waiting
Got my glory days in sight
Got my glory days in sight, oh yeah
Gotta find my fears and face them
Get day back on my side
Get day back on my side, oh yeah, yeah

The hard times have been the longest battle for me (oh oh, hey yo)
But freedom's inside, it's time to take what I need (oh oh, hey yo)

More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing

Yeah, I've been down in the deep end
Uh, but now I know how to roll
Went through the struggle for a reason
Can't get in, they got a foot against the door
Tired of the tension, tired of the waiting
Tired of the day shift, uh
I've been tripping in the Matrix, time for me to face it
Tying up my laces, finna get wild
So shine and get shine
Well, you can't imitate, it's all mine
Better make the mistakes, it's go time
Get up off that thing, it's alright
I keep bleeding, I'ma teach you to heal up
Join the force you know 'cause you can't beat us
I'ma seize the moment that I live
But I don't mess up my thing

The hard times have been the longest battle for me (oh oh, hey yo)
But freedom's inside, it's time to take what I need (oh oh, hey yo)

More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing (more mess on my thing)

I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh
