Soft and warm is your gentle touch
When you give the love that I need so much
You are the dream that came to life
An answered prayer that I say tonight

You are the heart of me, the very life of me
You're everything to me that a love could ever be
You are my everything, my everything
You're everything to me that a love could ever be

Where you are is where I wanna be
Close to you for all eternity
You're the summer sun on a winter's day
You're the starry night over moonlight's bay

You are the heart of me, the very life of me
You're everything to me that a love could ever be
You are my everything, oh, the very life of me
You're everything to me that a love could ever be

You are the heart of me, oh, the very life of me
You're everything to me that a love could ever be
You are my everything, oh, the very life of me
You're everything to me that a love could ever be

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, everything
You are everything (you're the one)
Everything (you're the heart of me)
Everything (you're the one, whoo)
Everything (you're the heart of me)
You're everything (you're the one)
Ah (you're the heart of me)
You're the heart of me (you're the one)
You are my life (you're the heart of me)
You're my heart (you're the one)
You are my life (you're the heart of me)
You are the (you're the one, ah-ah)
You are my life (you're the heart of me)
Everything (you're the one)
Everything (ooh baby) everything

Ooh, baby (you're the one)
Oh, oh (you're the heart of me)
