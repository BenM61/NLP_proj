Choo choo train is riding, all aboard ! 
Riding on a train 
Think of you again 
Your love has got me high 
High 
High 
You know I need you 
Baby. 
Since we've been together our love has been forever young 
So don't stop what you're doing 
Baby 
'cause you do it right 
Right 
Right. 
I have missed you so 
Don't you know it 
Babe ? 
And I can't wait to hold you in my arms 
Hey 
Hey 
I'm riding on this train for you. 
Riding on a train 
Think of you again 
 
Got myself a ticket 
First class one way there 
You're my destination valentine 
Now the train wheels are turning 
Got my heart burning. 
Darling 
Darling 
Darling 
Hold me tighter 
Please 
Oh yeah 
Ooh 
Ooh 
Ooh 
Now I see your face shining brightly 
I'll never leave you again 
'Cause I'm staying home 
Oh well 
I'm staying home with you 
Girl. 
Riding on a train 
Think of you again

We'll be together 
Together 
Together 
Together. 
Choo choo train keeps riding

Oh 
Sitting here on this train 
Wondering what I would do without you 
Girl 
I don't know 
I don't know what's going on 
Baby.
