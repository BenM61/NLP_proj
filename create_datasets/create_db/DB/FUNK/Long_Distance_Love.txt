Ah, hello...Give me missing persons, they said 
What is it that you need? 
I said oh, I need her so...She said you've 
Got to stop your pleading 
 
'Cause no matter what you do, 
Even pray to heaven above, ooh 
All you'll ever get from her is 
Long distance love 
 
I read the papers 
And I got the blues 
I'm so sad to hear the news 
Help wanted, but not enough 
You know these times are gettin' rough 
 
'Cause no matter what Ido 
Even pray to heaven above 
All I ever get from her is long distance love 
Woo-oh-ah-ha 
 
You know her toes were so pretty 
And her life so sweet 
I wonder do she know 
Do she she know she hurt me so 
 
'Cause no matter what I do 
I even pray to heaven above 
All I seem to get from her is 
Long distance love 
Long distance love
