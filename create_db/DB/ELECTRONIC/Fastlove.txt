(Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Ooh ooh, baby baby)

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes, it's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fast love, is all that I've got on my mind

(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Ooh, yeah yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)
What's there to think about, baby?
(Ooh ooh, baby baby) hey baby, oh yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)

Looking for some affirmation, made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies, they're all having babies
But I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the detail, baby
You gotta get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe, you could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
That's love in your eyes, it's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fast love, is all that I've got on my mind

(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Ooh, yeah yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)
What's there to think about, baby?
(Ooh ooh, baby baby) get yourself some lessons (ooh ooh, baby baby)

So close I can taste it now baby
So close

In the absence of security, I made my way into the night
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me
And I see lovin' in his eyes
I miss my baby, oh yeah
I miss my baby tonight
So why don't we make a little room in my BMW, babe
Searchin' for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

Oh, you really oughta get up now, that's right
Oh, you really oughta get up

Looking for some affirmation

Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
Gotta get up, get down
