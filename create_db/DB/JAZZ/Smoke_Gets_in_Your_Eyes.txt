They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
"Something here inside
Cannot be denied"
They said "Someday you'll find
All who love are blind"
When your heart's on fire
You must realise
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
"When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes"
