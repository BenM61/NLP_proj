Young emotions are mixed emotions
For it's a world where love and confusion reign
A world of hope and laughter and tears and pain
At times a gentle breeze in a hurricane
A world full of doubt but love works it out

Young emotions are strange emotions
For though we're brave, sometimes we are so afraid
But knowing there are memories to be made
We'll face each new tomorrow, dear, undismayed
For our love will keep us together
And our love will help us to weather
These young emotions

For though we're brave, sometimes we are so afraid
But knowing there are memories to be made
We'll face each new tomorrow, dear, undismayed
For our love will keep us together
And our love will help us to weather
These young emotions
