Think twice about big tall cities
That's right
Think twice about big tall cities
Think twice 
Right

He closes his eyes to the world 
When he wakes up at night
And she, she reaches tenderly
Kisses him and holds him tight

He, he lies awake by her side
And waits for the cold sweat to dry
She, she comforts he and tells him
Scary things in your sleep can't bite

Tomorrow they'll pack up their buckeye ties
Head for the big city
Past the driving rains 
And desert plains touching Mexico

They'll see sidewalk stars
Luxury cars and even Disneyland
Reach the land of plenty
With the hopes that maybe they can 
Make a new start on the world

But my advice?

You're gonna
Think twice about big cities
Think twice that's right
Think twice about big tall cities
Right
Think twice about big cities
Think twice that's right
You're gonna
Think twice about big cities
Think twice that's right

I'm sorry old man
Its nothing personal you understand
But I've just gotta run
This lead pipe on someone

For tomorrow they ride upon 
A sour wind that's gonna push them west
With Mojave dust, paper cups 
And Greyhound immigrants
There's the sidewalk saviors
And drunken sailors 
And she-men in leather like cops
You got the calling
Stop stalling
The big city's waiting for you

But my advice?

You're gonna
Think twice about big cities
Think twice about big cities
Think twice about big tall cities
Think twice that's right
