He might just look a little bit kooky
But he thinks that's okay
He needs a job to pay off his mortgage and his chevrolet
If tricks you want then he ain't your person
All he does is stand
Except the time when he is running from the policeman
Ah...Ah...Ah...yeah

Banana Man! 1 2 3!
Banana Man! I'm Banana Man!
Banana Man! Dance with me!
Whoa, Oh!
Banana Man! 1 2 3!
Banana Man! I'm Banana Man!
Banana Man! Dance with me!
Whoa, Oh!

It might surprise you he went to college
And got his degree
It's hard to find a job with a major in plant psychology
His identity he tries to keep secret
But not because he's great
Cause the girls will just keep on laughing
And he'll never get a date

Ah...Ah...Ah...Yeah!
Banana Man! 1 2 3!
Banana Man! I'm Banana Man!
Banana Man! Dance with me!
Whoa, Oh!
Banana Man! 1 2 3!
Banana Man! I'm Banana Man!
Banana Man! Dance with me!
Whoa, Oh!

Banana Man! 1 2 3!
Banana Man! I'm Banana Man!
Banana Man! Dance with me!
Whoa, Oh!
Banana Man! 1 2 3!
Banana Man! I'm Banana Man!
Banana Man! Dance with me!
Whoa...oh...yeah!
