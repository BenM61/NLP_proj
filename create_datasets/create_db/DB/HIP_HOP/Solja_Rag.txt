Verse One: 

You 'bout dat paper? 
You on top? 
You handlin' business? 
You doin' swell? 
Down with yo' niggaz to da finish? 
Are you willin'? 
To hit da streetz up and make a killin'? 
Are you a villain? 
Pushin' a Bentley makin' millions? 
Do you do your time? 
Without rattin' on your partners? 
Do you kill your beef? 
With a pistol or a chopper? 
Is you da man? 
Do you pay all of your bills? 
Did you make a plan? 
And won't stop 'till it fulfilled? 
Can you handle coke? 
Can you handle dope? 
Ain't afraid to go? 
Even though you know? 
Look... lil' Daddy... 
Do you take care of yo' kids? 
Is it clean in yo' crib? 
Can't you stand to eat some ribs? 
Ain't it scandalous how we live? 
You ball with Cash Money? 
Do you like Manny track? 
Ain't it shive how I rap? 
Puttin' New Orleans on the map!

Is you a paper chaser? 
You got your block on fire? 
Remainin' a G? 
Until the moment you expire? 
You know what it is? 
To make nothin' outta somethin'? 
You handle your biz? 
And don't be cryin' 
And its somethin' 
Your niggaz is in ya? 
You got your girlfriends witcha? 
Since you was a kid? 
You was a instant wig-splitter? 
You twinkle your slug? 
You ain't no bitch huh? 
You stompin' ya box in the mud? 
A Hot Boy microwave oven 
Tatooted up, booted up 
None of you bitches lovin' 
Your windows are tinted? 
You got a g and a half and you ready to spend it? 
You don't f*ck with dem Nike tennis? 
You play with Barettaz? 
You sleep in the Royal Sonesta? 
You won't f*ck Vanessa? 
You got chopperz up on ya dresser? 
You believe in GOD? 
But can you handle it when its hard? 
And represent your ward? 
You be stalkin' the boulevard?
