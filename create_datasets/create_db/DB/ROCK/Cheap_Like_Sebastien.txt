The smallest truth is the brightest
A tiny undeniable fire
The smallest truth is found hiding
Youre scared but youre not a liar

You cheat like Sebastien
Cheat like Sebastien
Cheat like Sebastien

My life is desperate and private
I'm reckless there's one [?]
I spent that weekend in Niagara Falls
It was new, it was love, it was cheap
It was new, it was love, it was cheap

Cheap like Sebastian
Cheap like Sebastian
Cheap like Sebastian

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

Substitute strata for status equate
All those foolish things I exclude
Awake we thought that was surreal
I stand still but I still dont feel

Feel like Sebastien
Feel like Sebastien
I feel like Sebastien

A true professional is [?]
So just do whatever they say
You know sometimes I just distract
The arrows of love in me
The arrows of love in me
The arrows of love in me

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

Here comes Sebastien
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
