So we waved our hands as we marched along
And the people smiled as we sang our song
And the world was saved as they listened to the band
And the Banner-Man held the banner high

He was ten feet tall and he touched the sky
And I wish that I could be a Banner-Man

Glory, glory, glory

Listen to the band
Sing the same old story
Ain't it something grand?
To be good as you can
Like a Banner-Man

And the drums went, boom as the cornets play
And the tuba, "Umba'' "D", all the way
And the kids and the dogs were laughing as they ran
And the Banner-Man held the banner high
With an Allelujah in his eye
And I wish that I could be a Banner-Man

Glory, glory, glory

So we reached the square, on the top of the hill
And the music stopped and we stood still
And a few were saved and the people said
Amen

Then we all got up and we formed a queue
And the drums went, bang as the trumpets blew
And we marched back down into the town again
