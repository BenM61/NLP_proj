Dig me out
Dig me in
Out of this mess
Baby, out my head
What do you want?
What do you know?
One to get started
Three till we go

Dig me out
Dig me in
Out of this mess
Baby, out of my head
Dig me out
Dig me in
Out of my body
Out of my skin

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

What do you want?
What do you know?
Do you get nervous
Making me go?
Get into your sores
Get into your things
Do you get nervous
Watching me bleed?

Dig me out
Dig me in
Out of this mess
Baby, out of my head
Dig me out
Dig me in
Out of my body
Out of my skin

I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows

Oh, God, let me in
There's nowhere else to go
Oh, God, let me in
And let me go, go, go, go

Dig me out
Dig me in
Out of this mess
Baby, out of my head
Dig me out
Dig me in
Out of my body
Out of my skin
