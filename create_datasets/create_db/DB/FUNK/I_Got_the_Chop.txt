Went down in the valley
I jumped back in the alley
Scaled the highest peak
I even plugged the biggest leak

ain't none quicker than I
Slicker than Superfly
I don't even have to try
I got the chop

I got the chop
I can't be stopped
I'll never get popped
I got the chop, hey now

I possess the keenest mind
perhaps of all mankind
My cranium do contain
Undoubtedly the greatest brain

My (sight?) is not the type
Baby get sucked up all night
I maintain outta sight
I got the chop

I got the chop
I've been through a lot
Give it all I've got
I've got the chop

If somehow you still have doubt as to what I'm talkin' 'bout
Your insights extra dumb if you can't tell where I'm comin' from
'Cause if I ain't got the chop, if I ain't got the chop

Moby Dick was a minnow
Dumbo was a drunk
Popeye was a pussy
And Pinocchio was a punk

No! That's a buncha bunk
I will fulfill your every need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Double your money back
Your gonna swear I got the true knack

Ain't no haughty boast
It's a fact that I'm the most
Just the most from coast to coast
I got the chop

I got the chop
I hit the spots
Call all the shots
I got the chop

Oh, girl, I am the cream of the crop
See, I'm the most from coast to coast
I won't get popped, I can't get stopped
I've been through a lot
Give it all I got
I got the chop
Oh-oh, girl
Oh, now,
Satisfaction guaranteed
