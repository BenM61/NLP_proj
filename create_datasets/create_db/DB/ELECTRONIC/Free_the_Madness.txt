If the leather fades and the children age
And the love we share, separates
In a perfect world do we know we're done?
But I don't wanna grow up, not for anyone!

I wanna be alone, with six at home
I wanna take control of my main oh
If I could free this
I said if I could free this
If I could free this fuckin' madness in my mind!

Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind

Kells
And if tomorrow I wake up and I'm sixty years old
I hope when I look in the mirror and ask have you lived
I look right and back and say, "shit, you tell me!"

So I smoke this herb with my homies (Park the car with my homies)
Couldn't afford a roof over my head
Now I let that bitch burn with my homies
We living life in the moment huh
Walk in this bitch like we own this
Screaming out f*ck the world 'til it's morning
And if I can free this
Madness, stop the screaming!
Inside of my mind needs freedom
And it's magic, a perfect evening
All I wanna do is have a little sunlight
All I wanna do is drink a little moonshine
I can show these motherfuckers how its done right
But don't nobody ever wanna have a good time

I wish I can see this
I wish I can free this
I wish I can free this
Fucking madness in my mind

Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
