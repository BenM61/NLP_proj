Whadda they do on a rainy night in Rio?
Whadda they do when there is no starry sky?
Where do they go when they can't go for a walk?
Do they sit at home and talk,
Or do they sit and sigh, "Aye Aye!"?

Where do they woo on a rainy night in Rio?
How can a guy meet a sweetheart by the sea?
Maybe the girl wants a tender kiss, and yet,
How tender can you get
When you're beneath a wet palm tree?

Whadda they do in Mississippi
When skies are drippy?
And whadda they do when it's murky
In Alberquerque?
And whadda they do in Old Arkoona
When the moon above ain't bright?
Well, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!

But whadda they do when skies are dreary
Along Lake erie?
And whadda they do in St Louis
When nights are dewy?
And whadda they do in Colorado
When a shadow dims the light?
Well, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!
(scat)
Yes, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!
