How does it feel when all you're counting on is scatterbrained
Every wind that you have sailed upon, a hurricane
Every summer you have seen was filled with April rain
It doesn't get easy, don't you know

Fortune smiles on you
You're not watching, dig that hole deeper
Fortune smiles on you
You're not watching, create your own fate

Count your blessings and prepare to change your point of view
All those days that you spend waiting won't come back to you
Take off the glasses that have treated your world black and grey
It doesn't get easy, don't you know

Fortune smiles on you
You're not watching, dig that hole deeper
Fortune smiles on you
You're not watching, create your own fate

It keeps raining, keeps raining, keeps raining

It keeps raining, 'Cause we are blind, keeps raining, 
'Cause we are tired, keeps raining, 
'Cause we are blind to fortune's guidance now
It keeps raining, 'cause we are blind, it will keep raining, 'cause we are tired
It keeps raining, 'cause we are blind oh, it will keep raining 'cause we are tired

Fortune smiles on you
You're not watching, dig that hole deeper
Fortune smiles on you
You're not watching, create your own fate
