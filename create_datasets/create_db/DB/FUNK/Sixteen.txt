I saw her dancing with the devil
And he was wearing my shoes
Black and white Jordan leathers
And she was looking for abuse

Now she look just like heaven
But her mind reek of hell
Now I know shouldn't be telling
But I guess, I guess if you know her well

She's the kind of girl
She can't believe me when I say, she can't
She's already there
Sixteen
And already there
Sixteen

Now what the devil want
Believe the devil gonna get
He gonna stretch her out
Like a tape in a cassette

And when you see these kind of girls
They all look pitiful
But the devil know, the devil knows
There's only one thing tonight she gonna suck

'Cause she won't she can't
Believe me when I say, she can't
She's already there
Sixteen
She's already there
Sixteen

We got sixteen year olds
Acting like they're forty year olds
Now we need to reclaim some souls
I got an idea
Let's take a massive
Hydraulic system
Let's flush them out

'Cause she won't, no she can't
Believe me when I say
She's already there
Sixteen
She's already there
Sixteen
