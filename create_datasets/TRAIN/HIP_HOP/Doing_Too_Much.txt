I'm leaving messages and voice-mails
Telling you I miss you
Baby, am I doing too much?
Why you trynna dis me
When I just wanna kiss you
Baby, am I doing too much?

Baby, tell me what's the issue
Who I give these lips to?
Baby, am I doing too much?
This is turning into
Something I ain't hip to
Baby, am I doing too much?

See you got me all alone
Waiting right here by the phone
For you to call me
Just to hear your voice tone
I keep on wonderin'
If you was even feelin' me
I keep on wonderin'
If this was even meant to be

Tell me am I wastin' time
Boy you're showin' me no signs
Is it cause you on your grind
Cause you always on my mind
I keep on wonderin'
If everything you said was true
I keep on wonderin'
If you were really coming through

Now here I go again
Blowing you up
And my girlfriends keep telling me
I'm doing too much
Oh, now here I go again
Blowing you up
And my girlfriends keep telling me
I'm doing too much

I'm leaving messages and voice-mails
Telling you I miss you
Baby, am I doing too much?
Why you trynna dis me
When I just wanna kiss you
Baby, am I doing too much?

Baby, tell me what's the issue
Who I give these lips to?
Baby, am I doing too much?
This is turning into
Something I ain't hip to
Baby, am I doing too much?

I'm out with my girls
Trynna have a good time
And you know I'm lookin' fly
Trynna meet someother guys
but it gets hard sometimes
Cause there ain't no one just like you
I try my best but I can't shake this
spell you got me through

All I can picture is the color of your eyes
And the way you make me smile
I ain't felt this in a while
But I came to the conclusion
That this is an illusion
Chaos and confusion

But I'm not goin' let it ruin
The way I feel about myself
Cause I got self-esteem
Sometimes I wonder
If I'm just chasing a fantasy

I'm leaving messages and voice-mails
Telling you I miss you
Baby, am I doing too much?
Why you trynna dis me
When I just wanna kiss you
Baby, am I doing too much?

Baby, tell me what's the issue
Who I give these lips to?
Baby, am I doing too much?
This is turning into
Something I ain't hip to
Baby, am I doing too much?

Just leave your name and number
And Imma holla at cha
Just leave your name and number
And Imma holla at cha
Just leave your name and number
And Imma holla at cha
Just leave your name and number
And Imma holla at cha

'Round your way all day
Women in the hallway
(?)
Losing track of the people
Trynna call me
Don't take this the wrong way
I've been havin' long days
Doin' it, movin' 'round town
Where ever I'm gettin' my song played

Now here I go again
Blowing you up
And my girlfriends keep telling me
I'm doing too much
Oh, now here I go again
Blowing you up
And my girlfriends keep telling me
I'm doing too much

I'm leaving messages and voice-mails
Telling you I miss you
Baby, am I doing too much?
Why you trynna dis me
When I just wanna kiss you
Baby, am I doing too much?

Baby, tell me what's the issue
Who I give these lips to?
Baby, am I doing too much?
This is turning into
Something I ain't hip to
Baby, am I doing too much?
