It's not the way it used to be
We used to live in harmony
Things will never be the same again
Now it's only me, myself and I
Living on a memory cloud

Now I've got to hope someday
Is gonna be my resurrection day
Things will never be the same again
Now it's only me, myself and I

Living on a memory cloud
You know what it means to me
Living on a memory cloud
You know what it means to me

It means a lot
It means a lot
To me

It means a lot
It means a lot
To me

Life will never be the same
Without you by my side again
Surrendering to every pain
Now it's only me, myself and I
Living on a memory cloud

Only got to hope someday
Is gonna be my resurrection day
Things will never be the same again
Now it's only me, myself and I

Living on a memory cloud
You know what it means to me
Living on a memory cloud
You know what it means to me

It means a lot
It means a lot
To me

It means a lot
It means a lot
To me

Living on a memory cloud
You know what it means to me
Living on a memory cloud
You know what it means to me

It means a lot
It means a lot
To me

It means a lot
It means a lot
To me ...
