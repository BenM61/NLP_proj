Journey is a long and
The journey is a wild man
Then I don't care
I'll take chance

I know it's a rough times
I know a be tough times
But I don't care my
Love is here, so (unverified) stay

Loving you, it don't come easy
It just something that just gotta do
(Something that just gotta do)
Loving you, it don't come easy
It just something that just gotta do

Doesn't matter if we (unverified) up, some downs
(Is it downs?)
And doesn't matter if we're real up we have found
And doesn't matter when we (unverified) find
And doesn't matter got we know that love is right

Loving you
(Loving you)
It don't come easy
It just something that just gotta do
(Something that just gotta do)
Loving you, it don't come easy
It just something that just gotta do

I'll be your rap, babe
You sailin' rap, babe
You should a the lean on
With a lone

I'll know it'll be bright days
And now'll be right there
Shining bright me
'Cause I'm loving you

Loving you, it don't come easy
It just something that just gotta do
(Something that just gotta do)
Loving you, it don't come easy
It just something that just gotta do

I know a it's something
And I know a it's gotta do
