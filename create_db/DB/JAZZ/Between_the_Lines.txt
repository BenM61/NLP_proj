Well we can't change the world
We sure can change the way we live
We can't only take
Also got to learn to give

People do wrong cause they don't understand
There's a book of truths
And a book of lies
Think with your heart
Read between the lines

Things aren't always how they seem
We've got to make the best of it
Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Sometimes we're blind
We can still see the truth

Well we can't change the world
We sure can change the way we live
We can't only take
Also got to learn to give

Sometimes you're lost
Sometimes you're blind
Think with your heart
Read between the lines
