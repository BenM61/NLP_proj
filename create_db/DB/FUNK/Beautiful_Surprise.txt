For the first time in my life
I just might be tongue tied
For me to wake up with you kissing me
Saying you've been missing me
What a Beautiful Surprise
Cause I wasn't expecting too late tonight, no
And I didn't hear you come inside
But there's nothing in this world I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms
All I can say is

Ooh, Aah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, Aahmy man is back by my side
What a beautiful surprise (yea)

I ain't that easy to shock
But it looks like you hit the spot
For me to wake up with you holding me and
Telling me that you're lovin' me
You got my heart on lock (yeah)
Cause I wasn't expecting too late tonight, no

And I didn't hear you come inside
But there's nothing in this world I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms
So I can say is

Ooh, Aah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, Aahmy man is back by my side
What a beautiful surprise (yea)

I was needing you so bad, how did you know?
It feels like I'm dreamin', my mind is blown
For you to be the first thing that I see when I open my eyes
It's such a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful SURPRISE

Ooh, Aah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, Aahmy man is back by my side
What a beautiful surprise (yea)

Ooh, Aah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, Aahmy man is back by my side
What a beautiful surprise (yea)

Yeah Yeah Yeah, Beautiful surprise yeah Yeah Yeah
A Beautiful surprise yeah Yeah Yeah
A Beautiful surprise yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah (yeah yeah)
