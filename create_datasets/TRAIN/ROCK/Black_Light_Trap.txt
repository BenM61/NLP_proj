An eliptical Movement
With the attitude of a snake
Then make our incisions
Stand on one leg and deviate
All American action
All lemonade high
Old and cold and going gold

A fanatical schism
As impeccable as a swan
Psychedelic exactions
That lay me down or lead me on
In the ballet of Black-Light
And the agony of the fly
We divide and then collide...

IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP- We make all our mistakes
IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP- Go in and out like tiny snakes
IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP- We fool around but that's ok
IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP... In the black-light-trap...

Pornographic implosion
Sticky animals on the air
An implacable suction
That pulls us in and keeps us there
Cryogenic excitement: Dionysian repartee
Creamed and steamed and quite obscene

All chemical all funny-man all belly-flop all dilly dally
All muddy moan all billy bolly all wobble-why all shilly shally
All chemical all funny-man all belly-flop all dilly dally
All muddy moan all billy bolly all wobble-why all shilly shally

IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP- We make all our mistakes
IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP- Go in and out like tiny snakes
IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP- We fool around but that's ok
IN THE BLACK-LIGHT-TRAP... (Watch him go now)... In the black-light-trap...

All chemical all funny-man all belly-flop all dilly dally
All muddy moan all billy bolly all wobble-why all shilly shally
All chemical all funny-man all belly-flop all dilly dally
All muddy moan all billy bolly all wobble-why all shilly shally

IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP
IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP
IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP
IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP

IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP
IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP
IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP
IN THE BLACK LIGHT TRAP
