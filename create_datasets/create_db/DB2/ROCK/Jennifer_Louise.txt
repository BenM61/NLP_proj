Jennifer Louise you don't know me but we're cousins
Your mamamama and my mamamama are sisters
Jennifer Louise I haven't seen you since I was a kid
When my family spent the weekend at your house
And your father helped when my eyelashes stuck together

My mom told me that now
You're a young professional
Living with a significant someone

Jennifer Louise we know so little about each other
I'll probably never call you up,
Write you a letter or see you in person
Basically Jennifer Louise you don't know me
And we're not friends
But I was just wondering about you
Wondering if you ever think about me
