River it like to flow
Eagle it like to fly
Eagle it like to feel
Its wings against the sky

Possum it like to run
Ivy it like to climb
Bird in the tree and bumble bee
Want freedom in autumn or summertime

Ever since that day
When the world was an onion
"Twas natch'ral for the spirit
To soar and play

The way the Lawd'a-wanted it
Free as the sun is free
That's how it's gotta be
What ever is right

For bumble bee and river and eagle
Is right for me
We gotta be free
The eagle and me.
