[Chorus]
Concede and believe me
I won't give up, I won't give out on you
Concede and believe me
I won't give up, I won't give out on you
Oh no no no-la la la la la
You
Oh no

Now hear, I promise to listen
Why won't you go for that
Now hear, I promise to hold you
Why won't you go for that

If I had wings and I could fly
Well I'd still walk with you
If I had a safe place to lie
I'd want to lay with you

[Chorus]

So now you shut off and you shut down
Won't let nobody in
And when you shut off and you shut down
Won't play that fool again

I've seen your inside, you stay inside
And I won't go for that
I've seen your quarters
Seen your crooked sacred pictures on the wall

[Chorus]

I'll be your jester, be your fool
Compromising fool
I'll be your jester, be your fool

[Chorus]
