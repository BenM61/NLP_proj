Jeans, I love you, you keep me warm
Love, you give me content and form
Oh, you feed me and keep me strong

So I'll be alright
And I don't mind being sugared, 'cause

Oh, without my love, I'd be incomplete
And without my love, I'd be all empty
So, without my love, I would not be me

Friends, I love you, you understand
Thanks, you keep me as a good man
Fans, you're lovely, you like our band. It's good.

So I'll be alright
And I don't mind being sugared, 'cause

Oh, without my love, I'd be incomplete
And without my love, I'd be all empty
So, without my love, I would not be me

We're alright
And we don't mind being sugared, 'cause

Oh, without our love, we'd be incomplete
And without our love, we'd be all empty
So, without my love, I would not be me
