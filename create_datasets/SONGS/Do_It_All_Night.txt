Pardon me, I want to talk to you
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you what I'm going to do
Someone over there says he wants to get to know you
I don't care 'cause I really want to hold you
And I'm so scared that he might do something to you that you like
I've been waiting such a bloody long time just to get this close to you
Now that you're near me
I want you to hear me
I'll tell you what I want to do
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right

Giving up so easy
Is something that I never do
But I'm so easy, so easy when it comes to loving you
Can't you understand that I want to hug and kiss you
I'll do anything I can just to give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby, in your arms
Come on baby, can't you get to this?
I've been waiting such a bloody long time and you're talking to someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I want to mention

I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right

Do it all night
I, I want to do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right

I, I, I want to do it, oh
Do it all night
Do, do it to you, do it, oh
Do it to you right

Gotta, gotta do it, do it
Do it all night
Do it to you right

Do it all night
Do it to you right
