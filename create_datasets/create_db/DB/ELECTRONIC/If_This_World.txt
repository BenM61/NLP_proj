Do you feel you've been disowned
Left outside in the cold
And without a home?
Do you think that no one cars
That you're lost an alone 
And without a prayer?

Don't give in to the lie
That there's no one you can turn to
Don't lose heart, there is hope
There is someone who will never desert you

CHORUS:
If this world is a lonely place for you
Fall into the arms of love
If this world is a lonely place for you
There's a God who you can trust
Who'll comfort you and live you up

Are you looking for a friend
Who will stand by your side
To the very end?
Someone who is always true
To his word, be assured
He won't turn from you

Put your faith in the One
Who will never let you down
He has proven His love
Open up to all He has for you now

CHORUS

He hears your cry, He sees your tears
He knows your pain and all your fears
He waits for you with open arms
He longs to live inside your heart
You'll never be alone again

CHORUS
