You deserve a boy who's willin', namely me. 
One who'd love to raise my chillun, namely me. 
Comin' home when the work is over at the close of day. 
I'd be with you all the way, to love, honor, and obey. 

'Cause you deserve two arms to hold you, namely mine. 
There to comfort and enfold you, Rain or shine. 
I deserve someone sweet and tender, bashful and shy and true. 
And I know just the one who'll do, namely you. 

Who's the one you're waiting for? 
You're the one that I adore! 
I deserve someone sweet and tender, bashful and shy and true. 
And I know just the one who'll do, namely you.
