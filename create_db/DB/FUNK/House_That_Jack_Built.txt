This is the house that Jack built, y'all
Remember this house!

This was the land that he worked by hand
The was the dream of an upright man
This was the room that was filled with love
This was a love that I was proud of
This was a life of a love I planned
Of a love and a life we loved
Of the house that Jack built.
Remember this house!

There was the fence that held our love,
There was the gate that he walked out of
This is the heart that is turned to stone
This was the house, but it ain't no home
This is the love that I once had
In a dream that I thought was love,
This is the house that Jack built, 
I'm gonn' remember this house!

Oh oh what's the use of crying?
You know I brought it on myself
There's no denying
But it seems awful funny
That I didn't understand
Was it a house of an upright man

Up on the hill
There's a big stand still
In the house that Jack built
Gonn' remember this house

Listen!
I got the house
I got the car
I got the rug
And I got the rack
But I ain't got Jack
And I want my Jack back!

I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
Oh, Jack
You oughta come on back
Oh Jack
You oughtha come on back
To the one where you live
Back to the thing that you built
You oughtha come on back
I didn't understand until
I lost an upright man
