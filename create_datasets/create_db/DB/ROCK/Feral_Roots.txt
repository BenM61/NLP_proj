On the mountain where I was born
There are trees that would call my name
On the wind, they would bring a song
For every feral lead to claim
They said keep your eyes open
And we'll teach you to dream while you are awake
Well, they haven't spoken
Since their branches were broken for the fire that they told me to

Feral roots calling me back home
Feral roots are calling me back home

On the book where my page was torn
There are words that I don't understand
All my elders they tell me those ones
Were not writ by human hands
Well, I just don't believe that's true
If the truth can be written, then the truth can be hid
Those words are commanding you
Though your body may grow old in your mind
You must remain a kid

Feral roots are calling me back home
Feral roots calling me back home
Feral roots calling me back home
Feral roots calling me back home

Feral roots calling me back home
Feral roots calling me back home
Feral roots calling me back home
Feral roots calling me back home
