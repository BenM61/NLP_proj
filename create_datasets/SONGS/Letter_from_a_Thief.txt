They know what everybody knows
Better sit, a letter from a thief says
I lead when everybody sleeps
So feel the ways to cover up the old wounds
Lost in a finger frosted lie
These sensors medicating through it all. 

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
To fend it off and fool them all
Stay there

Faceless, so little there to judge
Left wing, let's separate the cold out
Opposites, we never need to tell
One's thing, I found I'm having to
I'm having to

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
To fend it off and fool them all
Stay there, you'll live
To fend it off and fool them all

Solitude
Waste of a man
This fades as soon as the sun sets

I know all these fade or all that lives
Imagine here's a better feel
Told to dissolve or choose to fade
Or stay here
You'll live

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
To fend it off and fool them all
Stay there, you'll live
To fend it off and fool them all

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
To fend it off and fool them all
Stay there
