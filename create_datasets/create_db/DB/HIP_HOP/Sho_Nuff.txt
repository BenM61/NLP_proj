[Tela] 
It was this bitch that I knew back from '86 
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks 
Now who the f*ck you be, bitch you know me 
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key 
 
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold 
It's cold On The Outside lookin' in (brrrr!) 
 
You'd best a make yourself worthy 
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty 
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit 
Ain't this a bitch 

I remember when you would not give me shit 
Now you down for them habits 
Put your numbers on them naturals 
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom 
 
[Chorus] 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothe sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love 
 
[Eightball] 
No different from the rest 
She's just an ordinary hoe 
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo 
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix 
 
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks 
Niggas in love 
Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots 
 
Real dogs don't pay for cats, that's 
For real baby 
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sure enough 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[MJG] 
Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe 
Wants to get close to me 
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me 
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow 
 
Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the f*ck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me 
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I 
 
Really just don't plan on takin' it out cause I 
MJ fuckin' G you needs to knows 'bout these hoes shakin' 
They ass with no clothes like some pros, sure enouogh
 
[Chorus]
