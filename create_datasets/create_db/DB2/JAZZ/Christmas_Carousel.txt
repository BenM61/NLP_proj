Christmas is a carousel
And round and round we go
Busy doin', wrapping things
For ev'ryone we know
Trim the house and trim the tree
And let the spirit show
Sing some carols loud and clear
And set the lights aglow

Hang your stocking for Saint Nick
And he will fill it up
Don't forget to leave some cookies
And a Christmas cup
Leave some food for all his reindeer
And the Christmas mouse
Leave a little bit of cheese
Somewhere around the house

Now I think that we're all set
So let's all take a ride
Don't you feel the Christmas joy
That makes you glad inside
Hold your candycane way out
As round and round we go
And if you should catch the ring
It's made of mistletoe
