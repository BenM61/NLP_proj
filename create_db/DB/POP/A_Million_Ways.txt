A million ways to show that I love you
I'm gonna try every one
A million ways to show I think of you
I've just begun
Took a long time to realize
Love was staring me straight in the eyes
Now I know, now I know
And I'm never gonna let you go

A million ways to say that I need you
It took me so much time
A million ways to say I'll never leave you
It would be a crime
But the way that I feel inside
Such a shame to let my feelings hide
Can't conceal how I feel
Now I know that love is real

Oh, baby baby what you done to me
Once I was blind but now I see
I know deep in my heart
It's never too late for love to start
Oh, I love you so
Never gonna let you go

And in the morning sun I will kiss you
You'd better hold on tight
Until the day is done I will miss you
Then we'll spend the night
Makin' love by the light of the moon
Hold on baby it's comin' soon
Now I know, now I know
And I'm never gonna let you go

Oh, baby baby what you done to me
Once I was blind but now I see
I know deep in my heart
It's never too late for love to start
Oh, I love you so
Never gonna let you go

Oh, baby baby what you done to me
The love shining in your eyes has set me free
I know deep in my heart
It's never too late for love to start
Oh, I give my heart
Never never shall we part
Oh, I love you so
Never gonna let you go
Never let you go
Oh, I love you so
