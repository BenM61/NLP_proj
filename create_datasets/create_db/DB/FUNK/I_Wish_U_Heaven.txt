Doubts of our conviction
Follow where we go
And when the world's compassion
Ceases still I know
For your every touch I
Thank you so much
For your every kiss I

I wish you love
I wish you heaven

If I see eleven
You can say it's seven
Still I wish you heaven

I wish you love
I wish you heaven

La la la la la, do do do do do

I wish you heaven
