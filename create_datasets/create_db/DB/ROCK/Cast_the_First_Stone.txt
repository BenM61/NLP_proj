When war cries echoing all begin
Never know any other way to fight, just win
Blood on the enemy, with dependencies due
You know that sacrifice starts with you

Cast the first stone
Standing my way
Impedance you owe
With blood you will pay

Live for battle, the intensity knows no fear
Your defiance will prove severe
Choke your own blood, beaten in pain
Realize you now find it all in vain

Cast the first stone
Standing my way
Impedance you owe
With blood you will pay

When war cries, and it sacrifices you

If you feel that sweeping everywhere I want
Like a devastating fire every time I cough
Man infested component you can't stop
A block of granite on my shoulder you can't knock off

Cast the first stone
Standing my way
Impedance you owe
With blood you will pay
In fields of blood you will pay?
