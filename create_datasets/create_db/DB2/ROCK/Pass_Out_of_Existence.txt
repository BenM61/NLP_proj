Oh, I'm that sick, I see it that way
I'd rather be dead than have you stay
You pretend that it's okay
Right now, it's my time to take

Feeding off my hate today
Feeding off the lives I waste
Now, it's time to change my ways
Now, it's time to erase my name

Can't see my face, you can't see my face now
Pass out of existence, gone

Disgusted by your presence now
I wonder what it would be like if you were down
Could you cope? Could you really cope?
Could you hope or would you sit and wait for me?

Seeking for my placement now
Seeking for my placement now
Now, it's time to change my ways
Now, it's time to erase my name

Can't see my face, you can't see my face now
Pass out of existence

When I close my eyes, I see myself dead
I know you want it this way, don't you?
When I close my eyes, I see myself dead, gone now
