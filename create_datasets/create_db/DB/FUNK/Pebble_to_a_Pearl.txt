Baby girl too shy to shine
Let everybody else take the light
Didn't want to burn too bright
So she kept it all inside

Little girl go beat your drum
Go and see what all you can become
Playin' small don't serve no one
Face your fears and you will overcome

Cause the tears that we been cryin'
Been workin' overtime

It's about time that we got our joyful
That we got our joyful on

Don't be afraid to live out loud
Never squash who you are be proud
You're a universal sound
What you gotta say, say it loud

Baby don't ya act demure
So nobody else feels insecure
Be yourself and liberate the world
Don't ya be a pebble be a pearl
