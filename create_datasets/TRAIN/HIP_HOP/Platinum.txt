'Bout to make the night shine
Snoop Kellz
Platinum through the doors

V12 rolling nigga goin' platinum
V12 rolling nigga goin' platinum
V12 rolling nigga goin' platinum

Swag like a lighter
And I keep my swag lit
Man I'm on fire
That can't tell a nigga shit
V12 rolling
Got some honeys up in it
Say your pussy golden
But I only f*ck with platinum chicks

Only talk platinum shit
Only swallow platinum spit
Speak my own slang-uage
Still I am the real-iest
Surrounded by Ciroc but your boy sipping Hennesey
Loves is a hospital and I was born in V.I.P.
Sick and there's no cure
Bad case of V.I.P.
Still in the game killing you can call us M.V.P.

Game through the door slow with a foe foe 
Limping, crimping and pimping mixing 'em all
Fixing them all drifting listen dog

Record sales hoe sales detail retail you fail 
We sell ding dong get your momma ring your bell
Back in the club with my nephew Kell
Twenty-five girls in the Dogg cartel 
And they do what the Dogg say gifted or walkway

Platinum car with mink on the seat
Hoes on the feet, hoes on the street 
'Cause they all wanna make that trip to the promise land
