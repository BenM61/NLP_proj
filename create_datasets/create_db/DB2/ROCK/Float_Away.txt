All of the streets are lonely
All of the faces are cold

I'd float away down the whispering way
Somewhere as far as it seems, boy
I'm proud to say that I feel faraway
So shame on remembering me, boy
I'd disappear just as I'm sittin' here
Blame it on nothing to say, boy
I've failed to stay
So I'm flyin' away
To wake up tomorrow
If we wake up tomorrow at all

(All of the streets are lonely
All of the faces are cold)
Only love can stop you now
Float away from what you found
Only wheels can slow you down
Float away your floating...

Any time at all
Any kind of blue sky over
Any kind of fall
Could land you on the lonely streets
Of anyone at all
Who's drifting from the arms of
Somebody, Somebody, Somebody...

I've found my way from the city of gray
To the sunnier side of the street, boy
I'd roll away on the wheels of a dray
Or sail on a ship made of steam, boy
I'd flit to air maybe no one would care
For ever remembering me, boy
I failed to stay so I'm flyin' away
To wake up tomorrow
If we wake up tomorrow at all...

Only love can stop you now Float away from what you found
Only wheels can slow you down
Float away your floating...

Any time at all
Any kind of blue sky over
Any kind of fall
Could land you on the lonely streets
Of anyone at all
Who's drifting from the arms of
Somebody, Somebody, Somebody...
I'd disappear just as I'm sittin' here
Blame it on nothing to say, boy
Lovers today only faded away
To wake up tomorrow
If we wake up tomorrow at all
All of the streets are lonely
All of the faces are cold
