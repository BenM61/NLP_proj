I get so weary in the evenin when the suns goin down.
I get so weary in the evenin when the suns goin down.
I get so lonesome when my baby's not around.

When I go to bed at night,
And the birds begin to call.
When I go to bed at night,
And the birds begin to call.
I feel so sad and lonely,
For my baby that ain't all.

Well I get up in the mornin',
Just before the break of day.
When I get up in the mornin',
Just before the break of day.
Thinking about my baby,
But I know she's going to stay.
