I'm flat-busted
Wild-eyed and free
I couldn't get arrested if I tried
A has-been at a mere thirty-five

Straight, honest, forthright and true
Great expectations for someone
Doesn't anybody know how to have fun
But I'm

Gonna be a Big Star
I'm gonna be a Big Star someday
I'm gonna be a Big Star someday

Grape's bitter
I'm no quitter
Revolutions come one by one
Seems it's high noon and I ain't got no gun

But it's so hard
So hard
So hard getting by

Gonna be a Big Star
I'm gonna be a Big Star someday
I'm gonna be a Big Star someday

Fine bourbon, Cuban cigars
Rude remarks observed at the C.C. Bar
I'm perfecting the finest art of wasting hours
But I'm

Gonna be a Big Star
I'm gonna be a Big Star someday
I'm gonna be a Big Star someday

I'm gonna be a Big Star
I'm gonna be a Big Star someday
