Make us fight on the hill in the early day constant chill deep inside 
Shouting gun on they run through the endless grey on they fight for the right 
Yes but whose to say 
For a hill men would kill why they do not know 
Stiffened wounds test their pride 
Men of five still alive through the raging glow gone insane from the pain that 
They'll surely know 

For Whom the Bell Tolls 
Time marches on 
For Whom the Bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die, its the last time you will 
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky, shattered goal fills the 
Soul with a ruthless cry 
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery, hears the silence so loud 
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be. 
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see... 

For Whom the Bell Tolls 
Time marches on 
For Whom the Bell Tolls
