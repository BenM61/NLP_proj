I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exiting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he
Began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced
All night

I could have danced all night
I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings
And done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exiting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he
Began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced
All night
