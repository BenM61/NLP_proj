I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I feel real black right now
Real black right now

I never knew you like I should've known you
But my father spoke of you trough that liquor
Can we get a curtain call
Let us pray your idea outlives you

'Cause everywhere there is a Chicago
The only way we're getting out of here is if hit the Lotto

My Mama left the incense burning on the dresser
A hard way to learn one lesson
She said never be impressed with
A man with no message

I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I'm feeling real black right now
Real black right now

And I'll never be Mr. Madiba
I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you

You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now

The oppression of a young Malcolm
The shots rang out across the balcony
The day we lost a dream
Too young to sing Marvin Gaye's "Whats going on"

Since then ain't been a lot going on
Enough pain can a make a whole race bitter
They say the right amount of love can heal us
Reminiscing back when Hilfiger made us feel like niggas

And that's the kind of thing that sticks with you
I never felt this black

I'm feeling real black right now
Real black right now
I'm feeling real black right now
Real black right now

And I'll never be Mr. Mediba
I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you

You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now

Somebody take us home
Take me home (Whoa)
Baby let's go home (Whoa)
Let's go home (Whoa)

You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now

You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now

You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now

You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now

Somebody take us home

You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now

Y'all got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now
