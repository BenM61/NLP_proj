If I could be any tree in the ground
I'd wanna be a tree where the birds hang around
'Cause everybody needs to be loved
And I'm no exception, I was born to reject rejection

If only for today
Send a little love my way

Every day begins with hope
No one ever need despair
Hand in hand, we all can cope each of us
Alone is only half a pair, we've got to share

If I could be any star up above
I'd wanna be a star people wish on for love
'Cause everybody needs to be loved
And I'm no exception, I was born to reject rejection

If only for today
Show me that you want me
Show me that you need me
Send a little love my way

If I could be any star up above
I'd wanna be a star people wish on for love
'Cause everybody needs to be loved
And I'm no exception, I was born to reject rejection

If only for today
Show me that you want me
Show me that you need me
Send a little love my way
