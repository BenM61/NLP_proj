Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye

Step back as I'm kicking up dust
For a while
As I put motherfuckers to rest
And pull their files

Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigga

Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold

Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls
And you're coughing up a lung anyhow

You can't shake
That nigga that's gonna brake
Fool
On any one member of your bitch crew

As I pull the trigger
On my nine
Say goodnight nigga
Boom biddy bye bye

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye

You ain't never caught a rabbit
So you ain't no friend of mine
It's a habit
Barkin' up your tree with my nine

Keep your bitch on a leash or at home
A nick knack
Paddywack
Give the dog a bone
The raw dog
F*ck a law dog
Still handin' out beat-downs wit' my sawed-off
'Cause a every now and then I got to knuckle up
Buckle up
Chin checking
It's on I reckon
It's the wild wild west
Get your 40 and your blunt and your Glock and your bulletproof vest
Let me guess
Everybody want to test
Everybody burning up, gonna get burned like Ses
Laudy daudy
We're fucking everybody
Boom biddy bye
Sing the lullaby
In the party

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye

Yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all
Watch a punk slipin' see the puto fall
I'm buck-loody
Looking for the nigga who want to cut me
'Cause the nigga gets so funky
Fool I'm the one
From
The big bad Cypress Hill clica
Number one son of the funk freaka
Yes yes y'all
I'll be the one with the mad Buddha blast y'all
Comin' from the west y'all
But I figure
You'd cry like a bitch
Don't twitch
'Cause I just might pull the trigga
Now lay down
Stay down
Don't move a muscle if you see your homeboy's brains on the ground
Don't f*ck don't say nothin'
You f*ck around and I might get ragamuffin
Boom biddy bye bye
Line up on the floor now you' all gonna die

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put the Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put the Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye

Boom biddy bye bye
It's time to die
Boom biddy bye bye
Time to say good-bye

Boom biddy bye bye
Now it's time to die
Boom biddy bye bye
Now it's time to die
