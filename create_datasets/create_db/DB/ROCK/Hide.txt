To what do I owe this gift my friend?
My life, my love, my soul?
I've been dancing with the devil way too long
And it's making me grow old
Making me grow old

Let's leave, oh let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide

Let's leave, oh let's get away
Run in fields of thyme
Where there's no reason left to hide
No reason to hide

What are you going to do with your gift dear child?
Give life, give love, give soul?
Divided is the one who dances
For the soul is so exposed
So exposed

Let's leave, oh let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide

Let's leave, oh let's get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide

No reason to hide

There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide

Let's leave, oh let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide

Let's leave, oh let's get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide

Let's leave, oh let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide

No reason to hide
There is no reason to hide

No reason to hide
There is no reason to hide

No reason to hide
