Searching for some company
Feel the rhythm
Dance with me.
Them beat boy blues seem out of place
Now they want the party pace
Party pace.
Dance
Dance on the floor; dance
Dance
Feel some more
Dance
Dance
Feel the heat, hit that perfect beat boy
Hit that perfect beat beat boy.
I've got that feeling
That beat boy feeling
Soon I've got that feeling
That perfect beat
I've got that feeling
That perfect feeling
That perfect feeling all over me.
Beat boy

Hit that perfect beat boy

Hit that perfect beat boy.
Come
Come close to me
I want this to be
That perfect feeling all over me.
Come
Come close to me
I want this to be
That beat boy feeling all over me.
Too close for comfort
Too close for joy
Boys in the back room
Their house destroy.
Touch and kiss a stranger if all else fails
Hiding from the danger that's been sent from hell.
I've got that feeling
That beat boy feeling
Beat boy
Beat boy
Hit that perfect beat boy
Beat
Beat
Beat
Beat
Beat
Beat
Beat
Beat boy.
Hit

Be, be, be, beat boy.
I've got that feeling
That beat boy feeling
I've got that feeling
Beat boy feeling
I've got that feeling
That beat boy feeling
I've got that feeling
That beat boy feeling
