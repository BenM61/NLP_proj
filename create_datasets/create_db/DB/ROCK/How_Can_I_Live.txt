I am so alike you,
In so many ways.
I know I'm just a copy,
That carries on the stain.

But, we make the same mistakes.
Cause, we are one in the same.
But, we leave behind the stain.
I cannot separate.

All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?

I am your mirror image,
I'm all you left behind.
You made me what I am,
Then who the hell am I?

But, we make the same mistakes.
Cause, we are one in the same.
But, we leave behind the stain.
I cannot separate.

All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?

Why, you're nor guess or forget,
I know that our lives are the same,
Maybe we've got,
Just a guessing game,
A dirty stain,
That I cannot play.
But I follow your steps,
In the same way that you just walked away,
And blocked the way through.
I, will, not, live!

Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you.

Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you.

All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me,
All that dies in me.
How can I live without you?
