Oh yeah...
Well I don't care about the Victory
If I can still have your company
I don't need a golden diamond ring

As long as you still let me in
I never dream of being a millionaire
Money can't buy a love affair
True love is such a rarity

It lives all through eternity
The nights we share
It seems they'll never end
Oh Lord above, she must be heaven sent...

I know you, and you know me,
That's the way it was meant to be
I know you, and you know me
I know that you will always stand by me

If I'm down in the hole, or out in the streets
Nothing else matters baby, if it's you and me...
I pick up my guitar and I start to sing
About all the troubles that I've been in

Now the clouds have finally disappeared
Go straight ahead the road is clear
It ain't so easy baby, when you're all alone
Now I'm glad I kept rollinng on

I know you, and you know me
That's the way it was meant to be
I know you, and you know me
I know that you will always stand by me

If I'm down in the hole, or out in the streets
Nothing else matters baby
If it's you and me...Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
It's beating faster and faster

And it doesn't seem to stop
Well I'm so crazy about you when I look
In your eyes, I realize
The kind of love that never dies 

Girl I love you, I really do
My heart will always be true to you
Oh don't be a fool, we're gonna prove
With real love, we can never

Loose, never loose!
I know you, and you know me that's the way
It was meant to be
I know you, and you know me

I know that you will always stand by me
If I'm down in the hole, or out in the streets
Nothing else matters baby, if it's you and me Yeah!
