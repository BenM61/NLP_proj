It takes a big, big man to handle everything
It takes a big, big man to handle everything
We're the people wearin' and it doesn't mean

We need a big, big man to look out all our fears
You're a big, big man to shoot the world in tears
Oh, yes, world of troubled years

It takes a big, big man to handle all the men
It takes a big, big man to handle all those lands
No one seems to have a plan

It takes a big, big man to make the world go 'round
It takes a big, big man to make the world go 'round
Hey Miss Junkyard, no one can be found

Big, big man no one can be found
Takes a big, big man to make the world go 'round
Looking for a leader, no one can be found
Takes a big, big man to make the world go 'round
