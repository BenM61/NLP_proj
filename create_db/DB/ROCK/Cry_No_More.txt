I heard the news, they told me on a Sunday
Opened my eyes, the skies they turned to grey
I count the years, the roll so slowly by me
Wish I could see you again
Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

When I was young my daddy always taught me
To speak the truth and never tell lies
Now that I'm old and no one ever told me
The life you live, the truth you can disguise
Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

[Chorus:]
I always looked but never found a trace
I always saw a smile without a face
I knew in time that I would find a way
I should have started by settin' my soul free
I can't make the time, stand still
But I will survive, the treason
No reason, alive... To cry no more

I heard your life was filled with hurt and pain
I never saw the tears roll down your face
There was nothing left for you to say
The day had shocked all your dreams away
Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

[Chorus]

Down and out, I need a friend
Who'll be there until the end
Wait for me, and make my dreams come true
Make them all come true
I can't make the time, stand still
But I will survive, the treason
No reason, alive... To cry no more

To cry no more
On and on
To cry no more
On and on
To cry no more
