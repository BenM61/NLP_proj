You know I'll miss you, when you're gone
And I can't pretend that I know when
Our love started to go wrong

I know we planned to stay together
We just ran into stormy weather
We couldn't see the dark clouds in the sky

But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm movin' on

We talked it over, we've said it all
But who could say it would be this way
But the writing's on the wall

And now the sun has finally set and
This is where the story ends
We didn't count upon a rainy day

But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm movin' on

But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm movin' on

I'm movin' on, I'm movin' on

I know we planned to stay together
We just ran into stormy weather
We couldn't see the dark clouds in the sky

But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm movin' on

But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm movin' on

I'm movin' on

But I had no way of knowing
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm movin' on
