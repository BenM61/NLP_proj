We move surface to air
Will you follow me anywhere?
Try to rise up, you lied up
Into the silence
If you know what I know
Maybe then someday you will go
Seize the night far below

Take my hand, shift in sand
While the other on solid ground
Side by side, rising tides
Stay up together
Hit the ground, feel revived
No, I had rather be right now
Just in surface to air

Open up every door
Was it the future that you saw?
Now it's more than, it's less than a truth we're telling
Step to the fire and then walk away and leave it
The clock is keeping time
Now you'd better hear it
Step to the fire and then I can almost feel it
Don't spend a half-lifetime
Thinking while make-believing

We've been weightless too long
Over everything we have done
Never hide out, let's ride out
Above horizons
Light out, let it burn
Show me a way I can return
Just a surface to air

Open up every door
Was it the future that you saw?
Now it's more than, it's less than a truth we're telling
Step to the fire and then walk away and leave it
The clock is keeping time
Now you'd better hear it
Step to the fire and then I can almost feel it
Don't spend a half-lifetime
Thinking while make-believing

Step to the fire and then walk away and leave it
The clock is keeping time
Now you'd better hear it
Step to the fire and then I can almost feel it
Don't spend a half-lifetime
Thinking while make-believing

Step to the fire and then walk away and leave it
The clock is keeping time
Now you better hear it
Step to the fire and then I can almost feel it
Don't spend a half-lifetime
Thinking while make-believing
