Oooh...
Ha - ha - hey - yeah, ohh...

You make me want to get up in the morning
You make me want to stay up all night long
You make me want to get up to the dancing
You make me want to reach up to the sky
I feel so high

When I first met you, I read in you
Something special happened I never knew before
Was it in your eyes, feelings you can't disguise
Something's telling me that
Destiny knocked on my front door

It's better to believe that to let by
The happiness I feel inside
Don't let go
I know that you feel safe
Let passion grow
And this better day by day

You make me want to get up in the morning
(Get up in the morning)
You make me want to stay up all night long
(All night long)
You make me want to get up to the dancing
(Get up to the dancing)
You make me want to reach up to the sky
I feel so high
