I've seen a picture from the Days Gone By
Lookin' worn and withered, I heard a lonely cry
Of what could have been
And what wasn't quite
Now I'm swearin' to the wind
We were doin' it right

Here in the night so far away from it all
Out of my sight, how far down did we fall
From grace created
Oh how we related
In the picture from the days
The Days Gone By

You were letting your friends get in the upper hand
I had to turn the other way
You could not understand
And now we're out on our own
You have to wonder what lasts
When all that's left to recognize
Is a scene from the past

Here in the night so far away from it all
Out of my sight, how far down did we fall
How far down did we fall
How far down did we fall
(In the Days Gone By)
