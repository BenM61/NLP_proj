I'm cherry alive
Every morning I am something new
I am mother, I am child
I'm a shrine for the sublime
There will be nothing we couldn't try
Take, take, take me alive

I'll bring you to your knees
I'm not even here
I am movement, I am breath
And I'm not even real
I'm a bubble inside
Any moment I may burst

I am movement, I am breath
I'm the essence of a little death
There will be nothing we couldn't try
Take, oh make, take me alive
I'll bring you to your knees
I'm not even here

I'm only in your dreams
I'm not even real
I am sweetened by love
Any movement I may feel
I'm sensation, I am touched
I am innocence revealed
There will be nothing we couldn't try
Take, I want to take, take me alive
