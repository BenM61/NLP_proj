Your house that sits behind me
Is covered in ivy green

The windows that we watch from
Are old and chipping at the beam

It takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

It takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

The scent you wear moves in lines
From your apartment into mine

You act like you don't know me
My god, you tempt my anxious mind

And it takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

It takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you
Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you

Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you
Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go I
