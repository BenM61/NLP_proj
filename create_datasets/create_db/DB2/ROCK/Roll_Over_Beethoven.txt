Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a jumping little record I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

My temperature's rising, the juke box's blowing a fuse
My heart's beating a rhythm, singing out rhythm and blues
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up now
Go for cover and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

Early in the morning I'm giving you my warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle diddle, gonna play my fiddle
I ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

She wiggles like a glow worm, dances like a spinning top
She got a crazy partner, you should of seen her reel and rock 
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?

Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?

Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
