Life's too short to go too long like this
Forget where you came from or came here with
Let's talk some serious business
Like just one kiss from your sweet lips

(chorus)
Are you with me baby
We're waistin' precous time
Are you with me baby
Then put your little hand in mine
We're burning moonlight baby
Please don't let me down
Are you with me now

Don't wanna make a scene,
Don't wanna cause a big fuss
I got a little feeling 'bout the two of us
My heart's beatin' hard and it's about to bust
Let's leave this party in a cloud of dust?

(repeat chorus)

(bridge)
As far as I can see we got an open road
It can go on forever if we choose to go
It's not a dream if you believe it's so
There's just one thing that I need to know?
