I'm up at moms place taped up 
3 months re-habilitating finally got my weight back up 
She told me "I'm gonna pray to God that you'll be alright" 
That's my only mama nigga, she knows what's on my mind 
You shot my girlfriend when she was 3 months 
There went my children found out it was more than one 
You've got me limping and I can't move as fast 
But I swear on baby grave that I'm gonna get that ass 
What about my little sister, she used to get good grades 
But now she's paranoid goin' to school with a 38 
Now how much of this you think I'm gonna take 
Nigga I'm coming back 
(Hook) 
All I'm sayins is you betta not go to sleep 
I'm coming to get you Nigga you made too big a mess 
I'm comin' back- 
And you betta be watchin' everyone you meet 
Might not be the one who stick ya 
It could be one of your friends 
I'm coming back 
I won't lay down before you do that's on me 
I'm tellin' you f*ck what you've been thinking 
All I'm saying is you betta not go to sleep 
Because I'm waiting to hit ya 
Because I'm coming back... 
Friday night again and I get a new Benz 
Bus' a left on 120th - I see you slippin' 
This nigga's in my hood tell me how can this be 
Gotta thank the Lord for sending this blessing down to me 
I get my glock ready, Beanie can't shoot this time 
As much as I been feelin' and dreamin' this mutha fuckers mine 
I let my heat fly, I see him fallin' down 
And all I'm hearing is "K-Plaw, K-Plaw, Paw Paw" 
After the smoke clears I hear a baby screamin' 
I'm tryin' to make out but all I see is demons 
Father forgive me if I hurt this child let me die tonight 
Walk up to the Beemer see the kids alright 
I hand him to his cryin' mama tell her turn away 
Somebody punched up daddy's number and it's Judgement Day 
For anybody askin' questions you didn't even see my face 
Or else I'm comin' back
