Why do people believe in some old sign? [Repeat: x2]
To hear a hoot owl holler, someone is surely dyin'

Some will break a mirror, cry bad luck for seven years [Repeat: x2]
And if a black cat crosses them, they'll break right down in tears

To dream of muddy water, trouble is knockin' at your door [Repeat: x2]
Your man is sure to leave you, and never return no more

When your man come home evil, tell you you are getting old [Repeat: x2]
That's a true sign he's got someone else bakin' his jelly roll
