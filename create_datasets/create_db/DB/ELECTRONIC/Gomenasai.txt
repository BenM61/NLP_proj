What I thought wasn't mine
In the light
Was one of a kind,
A precious pearl

When I wanted to cry
I couldn't cause I
Wasn't allowed

Gomen nasai for everything
Gomen nasai, I know I let you down
Gomen nasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now

What I thought wasn't
So innocent
Was a delicate doll
Of porcelain

When I wanted to call you
And ask you for help
I stopped myself

Gomen nasai for everything
Gomen nasai, I know I let you down
Gomen nasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now

What I thought was a dream
An illusion
Was as real as it seemed
A privilege

When I wanted to tell you
I made a mistake
I walked away

Gomen nasai, for everything
Gomen nasai, Gomen nasai,
I never needed a friend,
Like I do now

Gomen nasai, I let you down
Gomen nasai, Gomen nasai,
Gomen nasai till the end
I never needed a friend
Like I do now
