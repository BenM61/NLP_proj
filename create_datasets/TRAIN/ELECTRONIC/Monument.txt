Make a space
For my body
Dead or whole
Push this side apart
This is what I'm controlling
It's a mold, the inside that I cart

This will be my monument
This will be a beacon when I'm gone gone gone
When I'm gone gone gone
When I'm gone
Soon when that moment comes,
I can say I did it all with love love love
All with love love love
All with love

Make a cast of my body
Pull back out,
So that I can see
Make a world
Are you ruling?
Make a world
That I used to be

I will let this monument
Represent a moment of my life life life
Of my life life life
Of my life
I will let this monument
Represent a moment of my life life life
Of my life life life
Of my life

Make a cast of my body
Pull back out,
So that I can see
Make a world
Are you ruling?
Make a world
That I used to be
