Why do you play with fire and run towards disaster
Your head is filled with drugs rid of all realizations
It slows time to a dimension you're flying through your brainspace
You've created a land of milk and honey where everything seems to be funny
You forget drugs' danger your life lost every kind of value
You fall into a hole but no one is there to help you
You're a fucking fool with drugs you are a tool
You're lying with your stinking breath sorry you are near to death
