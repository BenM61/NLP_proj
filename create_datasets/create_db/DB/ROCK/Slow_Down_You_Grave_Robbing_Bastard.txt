Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream
Slow down you grave robbing bastard
If they think they're gonna catch me
They're all in a dream

Digging in the graveyard, late at night,
I need to boil up the bones
A crowd of locals heading my way
Why can't they leave me alone
(They're all shouting at me)

Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream
Slow down you grave robbing bastard
If they think they're gonna catch me
They're all in a dream

Can't a poor boy work in peace
I need to make me a shilling
I sell my wares to the doctors in town
They couldn't be more willing

Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream
Slow down you grave robbing bastard
If they think they're gonna catch me
They're all in a dream

(Mid viii) pick up my shovel and run
No time to act tough
Coppers running fast
But the long arm of the law ain't long enough
(So he's shouting at me)

Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream
Slow down you grave robbing bastard
If they think they're gonna catch me
They're all in a dream

Solo
Dead is dead, but coin is coin,
And now its pissing down with rain
I don't know what all the fuss is about,
You don't hear the corpses complain

Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream
Slow down you grave robbing bastard
If they think they're gonna catch me
They're all in a dream

Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream
Slow down you grave robbing bastard
If
