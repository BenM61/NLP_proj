From a catacomb to a hot air balloon
Chase the dragon across the sand dunes
If I've been noticing bruises on your skin
Have you been walking into furniture again?

Let's take it outside, the kids are sleeping
I'll pay you to do me some damage
Let's take it outside, the kids are sleeping
I'll pay you to do me repairs
Let's take it out

Is there a back way out of here you can tell me?
Down the fire escape, piggy-back, I hope my knees don't
Fail me
Son, be careful on that country bend
Someone hit a moving wall here last weekend

Let's take it outside, the kids are sleeping
I'll pay you to do me some damage
Let's take it outside, the kids are sleeping
I'll pay you to do me repairs
Let's take it out

There's a mansion on the hill
We can get into their pool
You have a lot to learn
And I have a lot to forget

When will you write this cheque book out?
Your autograph's a rainstorm in a drought
