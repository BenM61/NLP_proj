[R. Kelly - talking (continues behind Chorus)]
Roll, cheah, cheah
Roll, cheah, cheah
Roll, cheah, cheah
[Chorus]
You can catch me in the club with a gangsta girl
When I ride, I'm gonna ride with a gangsta girl
When I smoke, I'm gonna smoke with a gangsta girl
When I freak, I'm gonna freak me a gangsta 
[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]
I'm lookin' for them gangsta girls, not them fake ass Wanksta girls
Just them ghetto fabulous girls, gotta keep 'em in my world
Mama makin gangsta moves, rollin with this gangsta dudes
Sittin' on, spinnin' 24's, openin' up Bentley doors
Drunk at the party, hands up in the air but still she sexy when she shake her body
That type of chick that says hey girl, let's go to the after party
After that we go to my room for the after, after party
y'all know what happens next, Hypnotiq and a rated X, got her singin' the greatest sex
Now on dubs, rollin' up, into the club, raisin' 'em up
Now we in the back, blazin' 'em up, dice in hand, shakin 'em up
I need a chick like that to come and share my gangsta world (woo)
And if you in the club with hands up, you can gangsta girl
[Baby - talking behind Chorus]
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - Baby]
Ok, mami your so gangsta cause she f*ck with nothin' but gangsta (gangsta)
Type a nigga that a stank a gangsta
Drink Hypnotiq and she roll big body, and she got a body, that is gangsta hottie
And she f*ck with nothin' but gangstas that is 'ol 'ol G 'ol G, 24's on that brand new G
At a gangsta party, she'll be drinkin' Bacardi, and she pops her body, don't you hurt nobody
Got my killers in here, they'll squirt somebody, but that Benz so fast, it'll jerk your body
And we smokin' that Cali dro, totin' that Calico
Bird man and Kelly mami, let your body roll
No one will never know, what happen behind the door
I like it fast or slow, a freaky chick fo sho
Street life is all I know, hustlin' and stackin' dough
I feel to keep it gangsta, until my cats get closed
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Mannie Fresh]
Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his stick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin' round and round
Do the Snake, stop and shake, bottom like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, f*ck her up
Now we leavin' from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, 
Feelin On Her Booty
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin' mami with some ice,
Takin' me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin' titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin', grabbin', pullin', stabbin' (what is your name?)
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came
[Chorus]
[Verse 4 - Mannie Fresh]
Slim Teresa, and Lakeisha (they some gangsta girls)
Tanya, Wanda, and Laneisha (they some gangsta girls)
'Bout fifty Kims all in Tims (gangsta girls)
A hundred shorties, all at parties (gangsta girls)
Full of drama, baby mama (she's a gangsta girl)
When they freakin' on the weekend (they some gangsta girls)
But they knowin' where they goin' (the gangsta girls)
Fly wheels, pay they bills (the gangsta girls)
[Chorus]
