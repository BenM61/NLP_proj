Far and away out on the edge
There's a difference on a fringe
Turn it around, closely inspect evolution on to the next
Take a look around!
No we're not done and we never will be,
Look at what I've found, harmony! Yeah!

As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
Uhuuu, uhuu, hey!

Blink of an eye, natural select,
Infinite wave, *butterfly effect,
All from* the one, the first and the last,
The future present is past!
Memories of now become meaningless,
And history is what comes next!
All that is left, are dreams and wishes,
Come to accept it is what it is!

As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
Uhuuu, uhuu, hey!
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
As above so below
Uhuuu, uhuu, hey!
