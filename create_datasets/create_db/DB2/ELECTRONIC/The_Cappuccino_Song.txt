The woman smiles, the cafe feels like home to you
And as she glances through the magazine you feel somehow, she's seen you, too 

All my life I thought you said 
All my life I heard you say 
It'll be all right 
(All my life) 
If you stay for all my life, for all my life 

As she turns her face I feel unsure, is it foolish to want much more? 
And as I place the moments in the frame it's to these, I return again 

All my life I thought you said 
All my life I heard you say 
It'll be all right 
(All my life) 
If you stay for all my life, for all my life 

Tell me, tell me 
We could be together 
We could be forever in my company
