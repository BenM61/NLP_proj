I rhyme rhyme, that's why I shine shine
And you can roll anyone of my shows
No lights in my bag no eye sight 
I gotta keep on rhymin' man
So I keep on shinin' man 
I ain't gonna be a one hit wonder
I am forever, call me diamond man

I've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings 
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit 
Oh oh oh you've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings 
Because my new diamond rings
They're what's in 
And if you're looking at me
You gon' be looking at them 
'Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk 
And if you're listening to me
You gon' be listening to them 
'Cause they're the slick that you hear in my talk 

Hit me one screen, West End 
(Flawless) shine like I'm a girl's best friend (diamonds) 
Girls see me and scream 'cause I'm on the TV
But I still take walks in my ends 
14 when I entered the game 
All I wanted was a little bit of fame (just a bit) 
And now I'm fuckin' with the grown-ups 
Go mad like sh*t I forgot my age 
Oh chipmunk you're so cute 
I'm a call you the diamond dude 
And my rings got so many carrots 
And you usually call this rabbit food 
And the sales is custom made 
No water involved I pay 
Good lord I remember the days 
I pray for Roland Cartier 

I've been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings 
Because my new diamond rings they're the shit 
Oh oh oh you've been talkin bout my new diamond rings 
Because my new diamond rings
They're what's in 
And if you're looking at me
You gon' be looking at them 
'Cause there the swagger that you see in my walk 
And if your listening to me
You gon' be listening to them 
'Cause there the silk that you hear in my talk 

Eh uh see I'm such a classy guy (yeah, I know) 
Designer shades hide my eyes 
I know lord, with a face like mine 
How the hell could I be camera shy 
I make it look easy man 
But that don't mean it's easy man (no, it ain't) 
Got my middle finger up to the world 
With a ring on the thing 'cause I froze my hand 
Yeah in that position, right back clear your position 
I'm everythin' you're not, you work I'm the boss 
I reverent run this man 
I could turn your house into mine 
And I could turn your girl into mine (one time) 
I'm a stay in my grind you could be in my life 
And never let a nigga take my shine 

Ive been talkin' 'bout my new diamond rings
