I've wasted so much time believing
That in this life you try to get all you can take
When all along I've been needing was to find one good reason
To give myself, really give myself away

Every smile that lights my face
Every teardrop, every trace
Every secret hidden place belongs to you
Anything that's good in me all I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you

You know the me that I remember always thought
You had to keep it all inside
Get in trouble being tender so you never say surrender
But it took you to finally prove me wrong

Every smile that lights my face
Every teardrop, every trace
Every secret hidden place belongs to you
Anything that's good in me all I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you

I'm letting go I'm letting go now
Of everything I've ever held onto

Every place I've ever been
Every chance I'll get again
Every secret, every sin, belongs to you
Anything that's good in me all I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you
It all belongs to you
