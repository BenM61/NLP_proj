They do it, they did it
They do it again
So ordinary
But just not me

I've seen through the dream-time
A world upon it's knees
Weaving a vast web of lifelines
Into a giant key

For the paper-god
And a world as thin
Little man goes blind
For the light within

Like a dragons breath
Over concrete walls
Comes the kiss of death
To the lips of all

They do it, they did it
They do it again
So ordinary
But just not me

Here we go

They do it, they did it
They do it again
So ordinary
But just not me

I'm one in a million
But everyone's the one
We're the chrome and the silver
Reflecting our sun

Some have come to shine
From the roofs and streets
Wizards of the word
Pilgrims of the beat

Some have seen the seers
Some have heard their call
Through the ether, to your speaker
It goes out to all

Tell them K
