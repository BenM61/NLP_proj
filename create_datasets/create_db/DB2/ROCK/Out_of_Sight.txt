Out of sight is always out of mind
I think out of mind is out of sight
I was just looking for some peace of mind
I just couldn't find a peace of mine

They say that pride comes just before a fall
I have fallen and I wasn't sure
You know that I have fallen further before
I just cannot stand fallin' no more

If I am good, I could add years to my life
I would rather add some life to my years
Life is really what you make it they say
I can't even make my mind up today

The world keeps turnin', it keeps me in my place
Where I stand is only three miles from space
Standin' space is all the space I can stand
Gravity just keeps on keepin' me down

Out of sight is always out of mind
I think out of mind is out of sight
I was just looking for some peace of mind
But I just couldn't find a peace of mine

They say that pride comes just before a fall
I have fallen and I wasn't proud
You know that I have fallen further before
I just cannot stand fallin' no more

If I am good I could add years to my life
I would rather add some life to my years
Life is really what you make it they say
I can't even make my mind up today

The planet spins and it keeps me in my place
Where I stand is only three miles from space
Well getting closer now to bein' apart
I (Incomprehensible) people right from the start.
