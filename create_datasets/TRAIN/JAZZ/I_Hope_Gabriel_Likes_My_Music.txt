I hope Gabriel Likes My Music
When I meet him way up there
If I play to sweethearts and lonely
Oh-spel-dah-doo-di 

I hope Gabriel likes my music
When I meet him way up there
If there's too much toot, I'll use my mute
Oh-spel-dah-di-doo 

Do not come knockin'
Oh, please start rockin'
Oh, the place starts swingin'
Golden bells will be ringin'
Oh-spay (Scat singing)

I hope Gabriel likes my music
When I climb that golden stair
If there's too much moan, I'll change my tone
Play too sharp, I'll try that harp
If he says no, I'll bolt the door
I hope Gabriel likes my music

Gabriel!

Gabriel!
