I've kept it open, and wanted nobody to be my friend
I've wasted moments in the Bowery light, and lost it all
So are you smoking, don't tell me baby you can't work this out
I've wasted moments in the Soho nights, and lost it all

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on, it is what it is

On your own worries, I'm nothing even when I'm with my friends
But you make me think that I'm alive, when I'm alone

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've had your eye on, it is what it is

Why wasn't it real?

Talk me through the stages before I go home, why wasn't it real?
Roxy got me twitching and I'm home alone
Taking it for granted that you're here with me, just tell me the truth
Am I just a lonely fabled obsessive?
That ain't got no clue
