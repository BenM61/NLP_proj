I don't kiss the future like the fortune tellers do
So I can't dream with you at night
Pessimism's hunger changes everything
I wish I walked with faith and not by sight but

You know with anything you do
there's a hundred people bringing you down
No matter who you are

Don't let 'em make you cause they'll break you
Don't let 'em love you cause they'll hate you even more

So if no one else believes in you
I'm completely yours, and I've got so much faith in you
No matter what this life puts in front of you
You can save this world
I've got so much faith in you

Anyone who knows you sees the renaissance in you
And I have to try and act surprised
I'm a "prime demotivator" says my point of view
I wish I had some cheer to lead you to but...

No matter how much good you do
There's a million people wishing you harm
(I'm telling you) No matter who you are

Don't let 'em make you cause they'll break you
Don't let 'em love you cause they'll hate you even more

So if no one else believes in you
I'm completely yours, and I've got so much faith in you
No matter what this life puts in front of you
You can save this world
I've got so much faith in you

Oooo there's a million things that I could say to you
Oooo don't let 'em change you inside
Because anyone who matters will try to understand who you are

So if no one else believes in you
I'm completely yours, and I've got so much faith in you
No matter what this life puts in front of you
You can save this world
I've got so much faith in you
