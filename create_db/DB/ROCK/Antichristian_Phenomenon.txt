Been haunted be the paws ov fear
And felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
And my voice was heard no more in heaven

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
In not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee

Come over to seduce your angels
Been born to rape your mother's holy womb
Rebel
So call me now
As I stand above ye all

Leave me unworshipped
In the dens below forever I shall dwell
Malice in heart was bred and lives again
My legions hid in south eden
My flaming passions
Oceans ov love
And all thou call'st
The evil
I summon thee
Bringer ov war
Bearer ov light
Earth's son

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
In not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee
