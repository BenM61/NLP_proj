I know that I could never be the first one to kiss you
'cause darling there's been many men before me
I guess that I could never be the first one to love you
'cause all of those days of being gone
And every city street
And every night and day
It's a world war trying to get your own way
If I had a wish
I swear you'd hear me say
Could I be the last give in
Say you'll never start again
Could I be the dream, the dream for you
Could I be, would I do
Could I be the last surrender
Could I be the number one contender
Could I trust you if you don't come home
Could I leave you all alone
You're tougher than the rest of us
You're making out like it never was
You say you've got the thing thought through
You'd rather walk away than fight
And you'd rather do what's wrong than right
You paint yourself in the darkest shade of gray
And every city street
And every night and day
It's a world war trying to get your own way
If I had a wish
I swear you'd hear me say
Could I be the last give in
Say you'll never start again
Could I be the dream, the dream for you
Could I be, would I do
Could I be the last surrender
Could I be the number one contender
Could I trust you if you don't come home
Could I leave you all alone
Every street
And every night and day
It's a world war trying to get your own way
If I had a wish
I swear you'd hear me say
Could I be the last give in
Say you'll never start again
Could I be the dream for you
Could I be the last surrender
Could I be the number one contender
Could I trust you if you don't come home
Could I leave you all alone
