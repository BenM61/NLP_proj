Let me tell you all about my life
Grab a seat, get strapped in tight
You may have heard about an earthquake ride
But these ones happen deep inside
My life is a chain of troubled times
That which only last a little while
And then when the next one comes along
I'm getting ready to jump, jump, jump

Earthquakey people, jump around
Nothing they can do or say to bring us down
Earthquakey people, jump around
Get ready to shake with the power of sound

Break me up, break me down
Turn my life upside down
Brush it off, there and then
Pick my life up again
I'll still keep on dancing
I'll still keep on dancing

When my daddy left my mum
When I got kicked from the prom
When I got my first pink slip
When my only tooth got chipped
It doesn't matter what you got in store
I'm able to handle so much more
And I never hide away in me
Let's shake it up, shake it up right here

Earthquakey people, jump around
Nothing they can do or say to bring us down
Earthquakey people, jump around
Get ready to shake with the power of sound

Break me up, break me down
Turn my life upside down
Brush it off, there and then
Pick my life up again
I'll still keep on dancing
I'll still keep on dancing

Don't be afraid to dance
Don't be afraid to take a chance

Don't be afraid to dance
Don't be afraid to take a chance

Earthquakey people, jump around
Nothing they can do or say to bring us down
Earthquakey people, jump around
Get ready to shake with the power of sound

Break me up, break me down
Turn my life upside down
Brush it off, there and then
Pick my life up again
I'll still keep on dancing
I'll still keep on dancing
