Baby, you ain't a man
'Cause my heart's carried in
Your hand.
Any fool can see,

I love my misery.
Bad news
It's born in my blood
Bad news

Some live to undo,
some live to be undone
My grey sky's growing dark
I feed on my own heart.

Bad news
It's born in my blood
Bad news
Whisper's what you done,

Crazy I've bought a gun
My finger's to your window,
Whiskey's on my clothes
I'm bad news

It's born in my blood.
Bad news.
It's born in my blood.
