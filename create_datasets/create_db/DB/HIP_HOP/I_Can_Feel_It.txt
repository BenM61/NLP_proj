Sometimes, sometimes you just know, you just know, that's all

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on, hold on

The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your heads
Cats I fucked with are real, but hey, those are your friends
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Shut the casket door, this one here, it is done
And thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It's comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on, hold on

I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an him 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me and he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin', up or down what have you been provin'?
Just that you a fuckin' clown
Bitch seen through the bullshit, but never spoke on it
'Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I would of traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on, hold on

There's a lot of shit that I let slide, 'cause its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans
And a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, feedin' them to the morgue
Full moon, the howlin',
The growlin', and prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth
Is what's gonna let niggas know, why you bad in your house
When they lied to your spouse, told her it was suicide,
But you an I both know the truth, fool would never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
'Cause you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah

I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, hold on, hold on
