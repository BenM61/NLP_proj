Come on children
You're acting like children
Every generation thinks
Its the end of the world

And all ya fat followers
Get fit fast
Every generation thinks it's the last
Thinks its the end of the world

Yes dream down a well
There's a lone heavy hell
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
It's a feeling we transcend
If we're here at the end
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
You never know

Come on kids
You're acting like children
Act your age
Put back the black metals and pearls
All ya sword swallowers pull yourselves together
Every generation thinks its the worst
Thinks it's the end of the world

It's a secret I can't tell
There's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
It's a long heavy hell
Super-size it by ten
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
You never know
You never know

It's a dear to transcend
Everyone here, at the end

I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
You never know
