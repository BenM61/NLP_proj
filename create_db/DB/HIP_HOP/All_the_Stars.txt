Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
I get a feeling on you (on you)
I get a feeling on you (on you)

'Cause maybe the night and my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
'Cause maybe the night and my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me
F*ck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize you far as confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You're the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage, whom I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my momma that's the realest shit

Girl, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
I get a feeling on you (on you)
I get a feeling on you (on you)

'Cause maybe the night and my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
'Cause maybe the night and my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered with ego
Get to talking like a end-forth, like a rebound
No control, no off switch in the way that you bringing me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Let me mourn, keep away from me
That is so wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day, for the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all gonna feel good?
You let it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We are running out of time

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
I get a feeling on you (on you)
I get a feeling on you (on you)

'Cause maybe the night and my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
'Cause maybe the night and my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
