It's been a long road gettin' from there to here
It's been a long time but my time is finally near
And I can feel a change in the wind right now
Nothing's in my way

And they're not gonna hold me down, no more
No they're not gonna hold me down

'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm goin' where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe I can do anything

I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith, I've got faith, faith of the heart

It's been a long night trying to find my way
But through the darkness now I'll finally have my day
And I will see my dream come alive at last
I will touch the sky

And they're not gonna hold me down no more
And they're not gonna change my mind

'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm goin' where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe I can do anything

I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith, faith of the heart

I've known a wind so cold
I've seen the darkest days, yeah
But now the winds I feel
Are only winds of change, oh

Oh, I've been through the fire
And I've been through the rain
But I'll be fine

I've got faith of the heart
I'm goin' where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe I can do anything

I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith, faith of the heart

I'm goin' where my heart will take me
And I can reach any star
I've got faith, I've got faith, faith of the heart, oh
It's been a long road
