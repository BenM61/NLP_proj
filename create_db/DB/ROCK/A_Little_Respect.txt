I tried to discover a little something to make me sweeter 
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart 
I'm so in love with you 
I'll be forever blue 
That you give me no reason, 
you know you're making me work so hard 
That you give me no soul 
I hear you calling 
Oh baby please give a little respect to me.
 
And if I should falter, 
would you open your arms out to me? 
We can make love not war, 
and live in peace with our hearts 
I'm so in love with you 
I'll be forever blue 
What religion or reason could drive a man 
to forsake his lover? 
Don't you tell me no soul. 
I hear you calling 
Oh baby please, 
give a little respect to me.
 
I'm so in love with you 
I'll be forever blue 
That you give me no reason, 
you know you're making me work so hard 
That you give me no. Soul. 
I hear you calling. 
Oh baby, please give a little respect to me. 
Oh baby, please give a little respect to me.
