Lord, I'm gettin' tired of bein' so lonely
I've got the fire inside that burns more than it likes
I've got a hunger that just won't let go
It's ridin' my soul, I can't take it no more

Who's gonna feed my fire
When I need it to sweeten up
And if you think you're man enough for me
Then, baby, do you like it rough?

I'm too hot to touch
Too hot, I'm too hot to touch
Too hot, I'm too hot
Too hot, too hot
Baby, are you man enough?
Too hot

I'm in the back
Seems like a dream, but it really was a nightmare (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Been fooled before
And I'll never do it again (Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
I'm a strong woman and I've got my own
I'm in control, I need somebody to hold

Who's gonna feed my fire
Need a man who likes it rough
And if you think you're man enough for me
Then, baby, is it hot enough?

I'm too hot, too hot to touch
Too hot to touch
All I need is someone
Too hot
All I want is someone to love
Too hot to touch
Too hot, too hot
Too hot to touch, too hot
Too hot, too hot
Too hot to touch, too hot
Too hot, too hot
Too hot to touch
Too hot, too hot
Too hot to touch

Too hot to touch
I'm too hot to touch
Too hot to touch
I'm so hot to touch, too hot
Too hot, too hot
Too hot, too hot

Who's gonna feed my fire
When I need it to sweeten up
And if you think you're man enough for me
Then, baby, do you like it rough?

I'm too hot to
Too hot, too hot
Too hot, too hot
Too hot, too hot
Baby, are you man enough?
