One kiss for old times' sake
Just like it used to be
One kiss for old times' sake
Could bring you back to me

If you'd give me a chance
To love you one more time
Maybe my lips on yours
Could change your mind

And you would know how much I want
I need you, I love you?
Oh, my darlin', please grant me this

One kiss for old times' sake
Just like it used to be
One kiss for old times' sake
Could bring you back to me

If there's a spark of love
Still left from our romance
You owe it to your heart
To give me one more chance

Oh, can't you see how much I want
I need you, I love you?
Oh, my darlin', please grant me this

One kiss for old times' sake
Just like it used to be
One kiss for old times' sake
Could bring you back to me

(One kiss for old times' sake)
