Here we are in a world of corruption 
Human nature is a violent breed 
Who cares if there's no tomorrow 
When I die for my future's laid out for me 
Can't you see? 

Rise, above the lies 

Morals on a backwards globe 
A sin to you for me it's hope
It's my life and provision 
Black or white some pay to pray 
You question why they act this way 
It's their fucking decision 

No more judgment day 
Only tranquility 
Peace signs, protest lines 
Mean nothing to me 

Honesty
Born in me 
Heresy 

I know what's right or wrong 
And my belief is stronger Than your advice 
People, they go to war 
Because religion gives them reason to fight, sacrifice 
Sacrifice

A group that caters no one's fees 
Or synthetic deities 
Is where I belong 
My stand is the human race 
Without a label or a face 
So they can lick my sack 

No more judgment day 
Only tranquility 
Peace signs, protest lines 
Mean nothing to me 

Honesty
Born in me 
Heresy

Honesty
Born in me 
Heresy
