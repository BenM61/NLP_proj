See yourself as a child reaching out
 In search of a landmark to guide your way
 Put yourself to the test, the trial by fire
 'Cause it's the only way, the only way
 The future in balance on a high wire
 'Cross a valley of stars
 Makes you dizzy so don't look down
 Just keep on walking towards the other side
 After centuries of history's unfolding madness
 The force of nature tempering the human race
 We ain't got it right yet, but we can still
 Turn the whole thing around,
 Get ready for the new crusade
 I will be your landmark
 Show you the way when the path is lost
 Secrets all revealed
 And if we band together
 The universe we'll measure
 Knowledge that we hold in trust is our battle shield

"Windows
 
"Emergency Splashdown
 Warning light flashes
 Emergency splashdown
 It's every man for himself now
 Too late to send out for help now
 Can't find the horizon
 My thoughts are capsizing
 Then the beam of truth shining clear
 Cuts through cloudy skies of doubt and despair
 And the pathway beneath your feet
 Will lead us on to solar mystique
 Temperature's rising
 Each moment it's climbing
 Strapped into this hot seat
 I can't take the heat now
 Life chain unwinding with split-second timing
 Let the power return to my hands
 Let it be in your own to command
 All illusions will melt like ice-cubes
 When at last, we master the past
