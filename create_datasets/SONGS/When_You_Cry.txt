When you cry, loved one, makes me cry, dear one
Don't you know you never cry alone
When you're sad, loved one, makes me sad, dear one
Don't you know you're never sad alone

Though my house is set on high
Doesn't mean that I don't hear you
When you cry I'm right there by your side

When you hurt
(When you hurt)
Makes me hurt loved one
Don't you know you never hurt alone

When you grieve
(When you grieve)
Makes me grieve dear one
Don't you know you never grieve alone

Though my house is set on high
Doesn't mean that I don't hear you
When you cry I'm right there by your side

If there's a sunny day I'll be right there with you
Could be a rainy day but I shall not be moved

No matter what we face we'll weather every storm
You can depend on me, I'll never leave you alone
No matter what we face we'll weather every storm
You can depend on me, I'll never leave you alone

When you smile
(When you smile)
Makes me smile dear one
Don't you know you never smile alone

When you laugh
(When you laugh)
Makes me laugh dear one
Don't you know you never laugh alone

Though in this life some rain must fall
And troubled tears they start to fill your eyes
When you cry I'm right there by your side
When you cry I'm right there by your side
