Well now I'm just a poor young boy
And these girl's 'bout to drive me wild
Ya, I'm just a poor young boy
And these girl's 'bout to drive me wild
Ya, I'm just a poor young boy
And these girl's 'bout to drive me wild
They way they rock and roll and hold me, angel child

The way they laugh, the way they sing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
The way they laugh, the way they sing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
The way they laugh and sing
Makes my heart go ting-a-ling
Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling

Well, I'm young and I'm free
And it's a real fine way to be
Well, I'm young and I'm free
And it's a real fine way to be
Ya, I'm young and I'm free
And it's a real fine way to be
I want a fine young gal that is so nice and free
