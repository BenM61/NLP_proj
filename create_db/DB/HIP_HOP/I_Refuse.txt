Intro:urban(woman) 
Yo baby (what?s up) 
What we had was so special (yea I know) 
What you doin now (left my man back at the 9 to 5 just trying to make things work) 
Yeah, I never thought I?d see you again (and I never thought I?d see you again) 
Yeah, (what a coincidence) 
Well that?s how things happen (yea I know, I wanna have you just one more time) 
But you know what (what's that) 
You know what?s odd (what is it) 

Verse 1: 
What are the odds of me bumping into you again (one in a million) 
What are the odds of me seeing my first lover friend (two in a million) 

It's been two years since we both graduated, I still can feel how we both celebrated
I can't get over your voice on my phone, we've been apart for so long. 

Chorus: 
So I refuse to wait, my patience is out the door baby 
I refuse to hear you say, you don?t want me no more baby 
I refuse to blame, you for anything - me for any thing 
Lets not take finding each other in vain its not a coincidence baby 

Verse 2: 
Remember we use to sneak off when your mama dosed off 
Hit the back seat of my Chevy fog up the windows 

Made love to sweet lady our favorite song 
Kept it moving slow and steady to the tempo 

Then we would lay there and hold on to each other like there wasn?t a tomorrow 
I can?t get over your voice on the phone, we've been apart for so long

Chorus: 
So I refuse to wait, my patience is out the door baby 
I refuse to hear you say, don?t want to hear you say you don?t want me no more 
I refuse to blame, you for anything or me for anything 
Lets not take finding each other in vain its not a coincidence baby 

Verse 3:
You know, damn well, you?re suppose to be in my life
Riding by my side (Oh yeah yeah)
You know, damn well, you?re suppose to be coming home to me every night

Baby if you?re not that far away
Maybe we can spend the day
Catch up on all the loving we lost
Let me kiss you in your favorite place

Chorus: 
So I refuse to wait, I don?t think you hear me baby
I refuse to hear you say, saying no, no no no no ? no no no no
I refuse to blame, blame you for anything or me for any thing 
Lets not take finding each other in vain its not a coincidence baby
