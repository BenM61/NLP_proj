The tequila sun is rising
And the Harvey's Bristol moon is sinking
Put the Binatone on snooze
Open up some special brews and start drinking

To the biggest mess in town
Then put on your dressing gown
Screw your head on upside down
Drink yourself into the ground

The bottles by the sink
They're the softest fucking drinks, find on the market
Yes sir, the Thunder Birds have gone
And the wagon's rolling on and I'm on it

There's no such thing as Dr. Seuss
Vodka and tomato juice
Disneyland or dipsomania
Pick a flavor

Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
There's a wonderful world you can share

Try acrophobic, schizophrenic, paranoid attacks of panic
Epileptic fits of laughter, twenty five million mornings after
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss, vodka and tomato juice
Disneyland or dipsomania, name your poison, pick a flavor

Moonshine, firewater, Captain Morgan, Johnnie Walker
Southern comfort, mother's ruin, happy hours of homeless brewing
Galloway's sore throat expectorant, after shave and disinfectant
Parazone and Fairy liquid, if it's in a glass you'll drink it

Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
There's a wonderful world you can share

Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
There's a wonderful world you can share

Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
There's a wonderful world you can share
