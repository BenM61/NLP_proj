i spy
i see through everything
but i know
i don't know anything
and on cold nights
my soul is like anyone's
and on slow nights
i'd forgive anyone

i've got a number with wings
i've got a number with wings

time flies
hands of the hourglass
getting born
watching the seasons pass
and on cold nights
my soul is like anyone's
and on slow nights
i'd forgive anyone

i've got a number with wings
i've got a number with wings

i know
i'll live through everything
but i cry
i'll cry about anything
and on cold nights
my soul is like anyone's
and on slow nights
well, i'd forgive anyone

i've got a number with wings
i've got a number with wings
i've got a number...
