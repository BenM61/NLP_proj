Don't get mad if I treat me
To a day I only shop for me
Don't get mad if I buy the clothes
That you think are not the style for me
Who I am is not what I wear
And what I think has nothing to do with hair
Love me by what my heart shows
But it seems like you just can't let it go

You keep talking bout my clothes
But the clothes don't make the woman
You keep talking bout my hair
But this hair can't give you lovin'

(Only me)
You keep talkin bout my shoes
But my shoes don't make me money
Now why you actin so hysterical
I'm so much more than material
Don't get mad if I treat me
To a day of cosmotology
Don't get mad if you see me
Exploring different sides of me
Deep inside of my outer shell
There's only so much I'd show and tell
Love me like the real girl you know
But it seems that you just can't let it go

You keep talking bout my clothes
But the clothes don't make the woman
You keep talking bout my hair
But this hair can't give you lovin'

(Bridge:)
More than material
More than the typical
More than just a video
A respectable
And effectual, girl


You keep talking bout my clothes
But the clothes don't make the woman
You keep talking bout my hair
But this hair can't give you lovin'
