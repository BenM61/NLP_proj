Are these sensible shoes on my feet 
I wear my shades so our eyes don't meet 
I'm scared every fuckin' day 
I wear my headphones so i can't hear what you    say 

Can i run 

Switch to paranoid from having fun 
Will he use his hands, knife, or a gun 
Knuckles are white, wrapped around my mace 
Comes from living in a terrorist state 

Can i run 

When he's following me 
He's not my brother, he's my enemy 
Is he behind the door or in back of the tree 
Is he under the bed, is he in the back street 

Can i run
