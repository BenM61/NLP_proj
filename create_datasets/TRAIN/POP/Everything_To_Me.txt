If life is like a jigsaw
Where would you start
You think you got the picture
Like it's written on your heart
You lay out all the pieces
One by one
But if you stare at it too closely
The answer never comes

So I take a breath
Cos I need time to figure this all out
I got lost inside
What I thought I need
But I understand now

Cause I don't need the sunlight shining on my face
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face
Nothing else matters cos you're everything to me to me to me 
You're everything to me

Can you tell me where I'm going
Tell me what comes next
Cause I know that it's not over
Haven't even started yet
I just wanna get there
But I hope it's not too late
Cause the closer that I'm getting
The more I feel the way

Let's take a break
Take our time
To igure this all out
I got lost inside
What I thought I need
But I understand now

Cause I don't need the sunlight shining on my face
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face
Nothing else matters cos you're everything to me

All that I thought I want
Is not what I really need
You're right here in front of me

No, I don't need the sunlight shining on my face
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face
Nothing else matters
No nothing else matters

Cos I don't need the sunlight shining on my face
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face
Nothing else matters
No nothing else matters

Yeah I don't need the sunlight shining on my face
And I don't need perfection to have the perfect day
I just want to see you happy a smile on your face
Nothing else matters cos you're everything to me to me to me 
You're everything to me
