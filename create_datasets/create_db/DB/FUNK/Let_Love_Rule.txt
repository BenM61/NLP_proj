Trust your heart
Trust what you're feeling
Let down your guard
Don't miss the moment

See what matters
Breathing air, being close
You right there, it don't matter
Who we are, where we've been, what we did
Just let love in, oh, let love in
Why don't you

Let love rule
Let love rule
Let love rule, let love rule, let love rule

Boy you leave me breathless before we touch
And I, and I, and I, I can't live without it
Close your eyes, oh, let's make a moment

See what matters
Breathing air, being close
You right there, it don't matter
Who we are, where we've been, what we did
Just let love in, oh, let love in
Why don't you

Let love rule
Let love rule
Let love rule, let love rule, let love rule

Our love goes on
On and on

Let love rule
Let love rule
Let love rule, let love rule, let love rule

Let love rule
Let love rule
Let love rule, let love rule, let love rule
