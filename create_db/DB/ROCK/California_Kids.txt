When you wake up
Cobwebs on your eyelids
Stuck in rigor mortis, whoa
Just get going
Til you hit the ocean
And you turn Californian, whoa

You don't have to
Have the answers
Don't you worry
Don't you worry

It's gonna be alright
If you're on a sinking ship
The California kids
Will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night
Thinking about some thing you did
The California kids
Will show you the sunshine

In your bare feet
In mid-January
Swimming in the mystery, whoa

Second guessing
Almost everything
Don't you worry
Don't you worry

It's gonna be alright
If you're on a sinking ship
The California kids
Will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night
Thinking about some thing you did
The California kids
Will show you the starlight

All your old friends
Chilling back in Boston
You never forgot them, whoa

It's gonna be alright
If you're on a sinking ship
The California kids
Will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night
Thinking about some thing you did
The California kids
Will show you the sunshine
The California kids
Will show you the starlight
