I'm a troubled man, changed by the things I do
True, but it's funny how they all remember you
It all could be different, time to do something new
I've given everything, I want to be a happy man too
Got to understand, blamed by the friends I lose
Who's getting outta hand, do you think they depend on you?
It all could be different, try to do something new
I've given everything, I want to be a happy man too

Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing

Gonna run it 'round, strange but it just won't do, no
When it's coming down, taking a hold on you
It all could be different, try to do something new
Given everything, all to be a happy man too

Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing

Closer
Turning it over
It all could be different
Closer
Time to do something new
I've given everything all to be a happy man too

Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream

No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on
No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on
