Hey  girl  stop what you're doin'!
Hey  girl  you'll drive me to ruin.
I don't know what it is that I like about you
But I like it a lot.
Won't you let me hold you
Let me feel your lovin' charms.

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane!

Hey  girl  I got something I think you ought to know.
Hey  babe  I want to tell you that I love you so.
I want to hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go,
'Cause I like your charms.

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane!

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane!

(Communication breakdown)I want you to love me all night
(Communication breakdown)I want you to love me
(Communication breakdown)I want you to love...yeah! I want you to love!
