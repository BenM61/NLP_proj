[Marc 7]
Syllable slasher, insurmountable mic gasher
Quick to vent with intent, you can't crash us
Constant link passers, styles'll skate past ya
Beats that we present will make you hate like a slave master(Hardcore)
Heated and hot, control the venomous plots
We be the cream of the crop, so keep our name out your mouth
We'll entertain your brain for three minutes and change
Ain't it strange, your fame is three minutes and change
Let me finish explainin', break it down like a layman
All the stuff that you sayin', Ain't it all entertainin'

[Akil]
Uhh, Yea
(Red hot) molten lava
Too hot for toddlers
Too hot for you and your crew so don't bother
I'm the globetrotter, party block rocker
Heart and show stopper, break it off proper

[Soup]
With lengths to go,Yo
The Jacques Cousteau with flow, and underground continental
The words that blow
The competitions straight to the door
We'll rock it, Herbie Hancock it like '84, Fo' sho'

A smooth brotha, for real we buckshots like that BlackMoon fella
The backroom sellers makin' rap tunes illa
The Killa flow spilla, the Chicago killa named 2na

[Marc 7]
We come tramplin', your city and stand in
We movin' in tandem, your crew couldn't phathom
We reppin' the fashion, no mushin' and mashin'

Your crew better cash in

[Soup]
The vangard of art
Quick to put pen to the thought
And nice from the minute I start, huh
Maneuver well, I tell girls that can't tell
That say since I don't look like Maxwell
They think I can't mack well

[Chali 2na]
We them backpack boys, at your backdoor
They can catch a cap like a hatch door
Givin' the exact score
Forever we fight for honor yo
Tight since we was lable mates with Mic Geronimoooo!

[Marc 7]
Walking, stompin' in my big black boots
It be the crew J5 and we're all in cahoots
(Soon) to bring it to ya live, yo that's what you paid for
With skills much sharper than a Texas Chainsaw

[Akil]
Yo, pipin' hot and your mic is not
We steam from the pot, you wet like rain drops
We fire with the brimstone
Heat up your girls erogenous zones with electrified sparks and poems

[J5]

If you like it or not, this jam is red hoooooot

So let the ash blow
We relieve static with a grammatic fiasco

Put us on a marque
We clutch without the car keys
