Hit the town, still dressing down
Looking for some action
Mr. Jagger said it best
He knows you never get, no satisfaction
But Mr. Dylan knows
That everyone is more or less a rolling stone
And Mr. Lennon, so quiet, knows better or so I've been told

That says it all, doesn't it?
We always want what we never get
Well listen hear, my friend
I can't continue to pretend 
That it's alright
Cause that ain't right
That ain't right

I hear you're gonna make it big, 
Rake it in with your master plan, 
Mr. Hendrix understood
Those are only castles made of sand
Mr. Wilson took some pills,
And I don't blame him
It's hard to be alive,
Mr. Page, how he played
Mr. Drake stayed up late and made me cry

That says it all, doesn't it?
We always want what we never get
Well listen hear, my friend
I can't continue to pretend 
That it's alright

They've said it all haven't they?
But what I want, what I want to say
Is listen hear my friend
I can't continue to pretend 
That it's alright
No matter what we get
We never find our happiness
Ain't that a crime? Maybe that's why I've been told
Since I was six years old to compromise
But that ain't right,
That ain't right
