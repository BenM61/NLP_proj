Tonight's the night I've been waiting for
Champagne is chilled and the lights are low
I've dreamed of this moment a thousand times or more
Come closer baby I need you so
Don't be afraid, afraid of what you feel
Now that we both know love is real
So baby take my hand and away we go
To a place called ecstasy a place where lovers go

Round and round and around we go
Hold on tight don't let love go
We'll take our time nice and slow
Hold on baby here we go

I feel your heart and it's beating so fast
Let's take our time ooh let's make love last
Cause we've got forever, we've only just begun
Let me love you tenderly, I'll never leave your side baby
Here is where you ought to be
You know you can always count on me
We've come too far to turn back
Now hold on girl cause we're heaven bound

Round and round and around we go
Hold on tight don't let love go
We'll take our time nice and slow
Hold on baby here we go
