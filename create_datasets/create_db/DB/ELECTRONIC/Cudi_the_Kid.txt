When I was a youngin'
Couldn't wait to get big
All in all, I stayed on my job
And you can call me Cudi the Kid

Can stop, but don't stop
Can stop, but don't, stop
Can stop, but won't stop
Can stop, but won't stop
Can stop, won't stop
Can stop, won't stop
Can stop, won't stop
Can stop, won't stop
Can stop, but don't stop

Clap, clap, clap
Drinking, drinking
Smoking, smoking
That's my daily routine after rocking shows and low-scoping
Focused on the wrong things like the ghosts out of your dreams
And it really truly seems that this is supposed to happen, man
If this were to happen then I'd probably still achieve
What I dreamed of even if I'm leaned up, I'm high up
All the damn kids that are listening to Gucci, man
Let the good times roll

Can stop, but don't stop
