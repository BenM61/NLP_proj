But oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am your daughter

The sky above me is silent and empty
I am an island a little freak of melancholy
But these hands they unbead your rosary of wisdom

Bewitched, spellbound I'm found and returned from superstition
You are my martyr I'm a vestige of a revolution
My alma, my mater and now I can let go my old addictive solutions

But oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am

Oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am your daughter

I used to be a connoisseur of hate, self hate, paternal hate
Hate cum gratis I connected every kind
Sipping it like red wine the insecurity was mine
The ties that bind were my design

But oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am your daughter

The sun is still unkind to those like you and me
Seekers of sanctuary though I'm not afraid
I'm sanctified and fortified because you sacrificed

I can call myself Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Men have adored you
