It's been a while I hit this station 
I've been away since didn't know where to go 
All I need is my liberation 
The place you once called home 

Has changed to strange and cold 
Where have you been 
Call 1-800-out-of-no-where? 
I'd rather stand on my own 

Where have you been 
Call 1-800-out-of-no-where? 
No friendly faces, I won't look back 
I'll move on 

Even as a kid I had my reputation 
I couldn't be what they told me to be 
I turned my back on education 
I'd buy the world for a song 

Damn close to prove them wrong 
Where have you been 
Call 1-800-out-of-no-where? 
I'd rather stand on my own 

Where have you been 
Call 1-800-out-of-no-where? 
No friendly faces, I won't look back 
I'll move on 

Have you heard I'm singing about you 
Look at me I'm fine without you 
I'm okey on my own, been out of no-where 
Have you heard I'm singing about you 

Look at me I'm fine without you 
Why did you hang up the phone?
