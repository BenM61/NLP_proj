So I'm sending my dawg to the liquor store for the blunts to roll
Only the Lord can tell who dies
So pick up the pussle and pieces and put it together my love 

My lordy Lord, maintain, it's hard 'cause I'm a soldier at war
Cause everybody want to try to bring out the devil in me
But the evils ain't betta then me, weed keeps me at ease
Take notes cause here it comes

Wake up and they sittin' and pullin' their gauge out, Murder
And they put it up to your temple and we blow your brains out, Die
