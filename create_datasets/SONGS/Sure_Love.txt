There's a new star in my sky
There's a new song in my life
Some may take love casually
But I know what it's worth to me

I would count the steps from here to heaven
Every heartache I was given
Tip my hat and walk through fire
To find sure love

I would chase old ghosts and watch them scatter
Drop old dreams and watch them shatter
Lose myself and all I own
To find sure love
To find sure love

I wake up and she is there
And for a moment I just stare
For the sake of love this true
There is nothing I won't do

I would count the steps from here to heaven
Every heartache I was given
Tip my hat and walk through fire
To find sure love

I would chase old ghosts and watch them scatter
Drop old dreams and watch them shatter
Lose myself and all I own
To find sure love

Some may take love casually
But I know what it's worth to me

I would count the steps from here to heaven
Every heartache I was given
Tip my hat and walk through fire
To find sure love

I would chase old ghosts and watch them scatter
Drop old dreams and watch them shatter
Lose myself and all I own 
To find sure love
To find sure love
Oh to find sure love
