Oh little girl of mine, gee you sure look fine 
Yes you appeal to me, I'll never set you free 
'Cause you're my lovin' baby till the end of time 
I can't seem to get you off my mind, my baby 
The boys will roll their eyes as we go strollin' by 
It's not so hard to see, they all envy me 
'Cause you're my lovin' baby, you belong to me 
That's the way it was meant to be, my baby 

Oh well now I know I love you so 
I'll never, I'll never let you go 
& I need your love oh so much 
That I thrill to your touch 

So little girl, stay true; that's all I ask of you 
Be mine and mine alone, don't leave your happy home 
'Cause I love you, baby, and I always will 
You're my one and only thrill, my baby 
My honey, my sweet thing
