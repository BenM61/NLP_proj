Ooh baby, ooh baby

When we're out in the moon light
Lookin' up on the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holdin' hands and makin' love

Ooh baby, yes oh baby
Yes oh baby, yes oh baby

Sandy beach and was makin' love
As a tide moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side
Wanna be with you all my life

Ooh ooh baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby

Dreams of you all the time
Feels so good when we're together, love
Just can't wait until tomorrow night
Hey baby, let's shake it

Oh hey baby
Hey hey baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby

When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up on the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love

Oh oh baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby

Ooh baby
Ooh baby
Ooh baby

Sandy beach and was making love
As a tide moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side
Wanna be with you all my life

Oh oh baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby
