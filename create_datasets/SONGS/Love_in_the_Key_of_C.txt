I've been through some hard love
Sweet love
Impossible love
Deep love

But there was always a hitch
Something couldn't be fixed
A bit out of tune
With ending it soon

And just when I felt I had enough
And I thought my life just wasn't living it up
You came to me so magically
Giving me
Love in the key of see
I've been impressed
Depressed
Satisfied
Completely denied

But with you it just feels so right to me
We both came together so easily
And I can't believe that I love you (and)
You love me
Love in the key of see

Love in the key of see
You're my life's sweet harmony
It's the key of Amazing Grace
'Cause you save my life
When it was all the way down
Your gentle love turned my life around

'Cause with you it just feels so right to me
We both came together so incredibly
And I can't believe that I love you (and)
You love me (thank you God)

Love in the key of see
Love in the key of see
