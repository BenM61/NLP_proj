I gotta get out, I gotta break free
Ain't gonna live in misery
My mind's made up; I'm leaving today
Come hell or high water, I will break these chains
Gonna scratch my way, claw my way, dig my way
Back to the top
'Cause I never say die, I never give in
I never stop giving it all that I got
I'm breaking out of Hell

From the bottom of the well
It's a long way down
From the bottom of the well
I gotta get out
From the bottom of the well

It's so dark and cold down here
I'm all alone, but I got no fear
'Cause I have the will to beat this fate
And get back up to the light of day
Gonna scratch my way, claw my way
'Cause I never say die, I never give in
I never stop giving it all that I got
I'm breaking out of Hell

From the bottom of the well
It's a long way down
From the bottom of the well
I gotta get out
Digging and clawing and scratching and kicking my way
Back to the top
I will fight for the light of day
Gonna find the way, yeah

I made a death wish and it came true
I'm under water, black and blue
But if you think I'm done, you better think again
You better think again 'cause I don't know the meaning of death

I'm gonna scratch my way, claw my way
Never stop giving it all that I got
I'm breaking out of Hell
I'm breaking out of Hell

From the bottom of the well
It's a long way down
From the bottom of the well
I gotta get out
I'm breaking out of Hell
