There's dew upon the ground
And not a soul in sight;
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight!
I hear a distant sound,
I see a far-off light;
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight!

The murmuring waters say
There's no time to delay,
So hurry on your way, my friend!
If you don't get there soon,
There may not be a moon
To guide you to that happy end!

My heart is riding high,
My blues have taken flight,
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight!

My heart is riding high,
My blues have taken flight,
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight!
