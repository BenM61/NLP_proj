Last year I hung my stockin's by the chimney
And ole Santa didn't bring me anything
Well I wrote a note and I told him what to bring me
But I didn't even hear his sleigh bells ring

So to heck with ol' Santa Clause
When he goes dashin' through the snow I hope he falls
I like to hit him in his (ho ho ho) with a bunch of big snowballs
To heck with ole Santa Claus

This year I'll build a big fire by the fireplace
I'll be like a little pig I read about
When that big bad wolf in red comes down my chimney
He's a gonna scorch his whiskers there's no doubt

So to heck with ol' Santa Clause
When he goes dashin' through the snow I hope he falls
I like to hit him in his (ho ho ho) with a bunch of big snowballs
To heck with ol' Santa Claus

I like to hit him in his (ho ho ho) with a bunch of big snowballs
To heck with ole Santa Claus
Yeah to heck with ole Santa Claus
