I wonder what's been on your mind
Baby I don't know, something strange is going on
Seems you've been so far away
Got to bring you back, next to me
Is there a thread we can hold on to, or just a broken seam
Is there a promise for tomorrow, or just a shattered dream
If only we could see things through

[Chorus:]
Show me a sign
Show me a sign, girl
Won't turn away
Hold on to the light
Never let go
I'll show you the way
Even in the worst of times
If we got love, baby we can work it out
I need to know you'll always be
Here by my side, next to me
I'll be the one that you can lean on, I'd never leave you behind
We've got enough to build a dream on, so baby say you'll be mine
You need me just like I need you

[CHORUS]
I believe our love's a miracle, we can find a way
Listen, baby
Show me a sign
You won't turn away
Show me a sign
Show me a sign
You won't turn away
Hold on to the light
Never let go
I'll show you the way

CHORUS]
