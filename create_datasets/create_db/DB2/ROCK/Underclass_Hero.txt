One, two, three, four

Well, I won't be caught living in a dead end job
Or pray to a government content god
No sense against them; we're here to represent
To stare right in the face of the establishment

I don't believe (The young are frankly nothing)
Stand on my own (You get no sympathy)
Wasting your youth (I'm feeling young and useless)
Speak for yourself

Well, because we're doing fine
And we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine
'Cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
'Cause we'll be just fine
And we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

(A call crossing in the crowd)

Calling out loud with no respect
I'm not the one, just another reject
I'm the voice you affect; I'll lose and protect
I saw you against the great America we'll rise against

Now we're desensitized (I'll be replacing nowhere)
Burning the flag (a different generation)
Everyone see (We hit the road, no future)
Down with the mass (You better listen now)

Well, because we're doing fine
And we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine
'Cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
'Cause we'll be just fine
And we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

May I have your attention, please?
I pledge allegiance to the underclass as your hero at large

One, two, three, four

We're the saints of degeneration
We don't owe anyone an explanation
F*ck the the leaders; we don't need this
We're the elite of disarray

Well, because we're doing fine
And we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine
'Cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
'Cause we'll be just fine
And we won't be bought and sold
Just like you
