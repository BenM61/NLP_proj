It's a great feelin',
You suddenly find
The clouds are silver lined
When the sun breaks through.
It's a great feelin',
You walk down the street
And see the folks you meet
Smilin' back at you.

As long as I've got someone to embrace,
As far as I'm concerned the world is such a lovely place!

It's a great feelin',
Your credit is nil,
You'll never make a mill'!
But nontheless, I stay;
If you're in love 
You're feelin' great!

Oooh, what a feelin'!
You suddenly find
The clouds are silver lined,
Yes, when the sun breaks through.
It's a great feelin',
You walk down the street
And see the folks you meet,
They're smilin' back at you.

As long as I've got someone to embrace,
As far as I'm concerned the world is such a lovely place!

It's a great feelin',
Your credit is nil,
You'll never make a mill'!
But nontheless, I stay;
Then if you're in love 
You're gonna feel so great!
