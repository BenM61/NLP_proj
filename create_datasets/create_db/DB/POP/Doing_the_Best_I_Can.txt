I'm doing the best that I can
Hiding my head in my hands
Proving without a conclusion or doubt a great deal
More than you'll ever feel
I'm giving up all that I know
It's possible to do and so
Here's to your mother
Who though I loved no other than she
Take off that silly grin
Put back that double gin
You'll need it in the morning
If I leave you without warning

I'm noticing words have been spoke
Since the day I began being broke
Now when I hear the smell
Of sweet damn all I shall tell you
Take off that silly grin
Put back that double gin
You'll need it in the morning
If I leave you without warning
I'm doing the best that I can
Hiding my head in my hands
Feeling the pinch and yet
Somehow I can't forget you
