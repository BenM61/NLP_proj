Command to Vietnam
Back into the jungles depth
Armed to the teeth
Cold blooded experienced
Mercenary paid to slaughter
Sector madness kill and destroy

Missing captive locked up
In contaminated camps
Only war of liberation
Let them gather fresh hope
Hostile crossfire finished eight lives
Bowels bury me alive
Green hell swallows a silhouette
I could get away

Persecution Mania, driven me mad
Persecution Mania, tremendous dreams
Persecution Mania, getting mentally ill
Persecution Mania, alarmed about my life

There are traps behind every line
The combat zone in trench and fire
I know the danger every step
The nerve gas falls in black and white
But slowly I near my destination
Lost is our war to do justice
The brothers of people shot and died
Persecution mania takes away my life

Persecution Mania, driven me mad
Persecution Mania, tremendous dreams
Persecution Mania, getting mentally ill
Persecution Mania, alarmed about my life

Something fierce
Something evil
Circles in the air
