There's a chapel in the valley 
In the valley of my dreams 
And the organ?s playing just for you and me 
There's a choir in the chapel 

In my reverie it seems 
I can hear their voices sing, "Oh, promise me" 
My heart began to falter 
As the bells began to chime 

We knelt before the altar 
For it was our wedding time 
It was there we made a promise, 
I was yours and you were mine, 

In the chapel in the valley of my dreams...
