Holding the key to unlocking the door
In your mind, in your mind, in your mind
Hard to believe, yeah it's hard to believe what you find, what you find, what you find
Bones, I'm strong enough to break your fall
So hard to see what you see with the sun in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes

Hoping, trying, players are losing
Live and dying, who are we fooling?

How can I believe when everyone's heart is breaking?
If it's up to me to say what I want, what I want is to say
No more, no more, no more blood on the surface
We've been cut to pieces
Well, how can I believe when everyone's heart is breaking

Broken and cheap like a token to keep to survive, survive, survive
Love is a tree but it's open and sweet
'Cause it's all gonna eat you alive

Hoping, trying, players are losing
Live and dying, who are we fooling?

Oh, how can I believe when everyone's heart is breaking?
If it's up to me to say what I want, what I want is to say
No more, no more, no more blood on the surface
We've been cut to pieces
Well, how can I believe when everyone's heart is breaking?

Everyone's heart
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no
Everyones heart (is breaking)
We've been cut to
How can I believe when everyone's heart is breaking

How can I believe when everyone's heart is breaking
How can I believe?
