Got your money on the table
And the devil in your eye
Who is that woman with the crooked smile?

You got to go with what you feel
A little loving is a dangerous thing
Black is the ocean a burning sky

Her nature's wild hard to beat the right stuff
It's mountain high river deep the right stuff
Got your pearls on a string

And your skin's so bare
Over your shoulder there's a world out there
You got the nerve you gonna win

Boy you're playing with a dangerous thing
So it goes without saying
She's the queen of the Nile

Lion woman with the crooked smile
You got the nerve who's gonna win?
Boy you're playing with a dangerous thing

Send me the woman on a bended knee
Emerald eyes in desert heat
She's mountain high river deep the right stuff

Send me the woman to fight for me nature's wild hard to beat
She's mountain high river deep the right stuff
