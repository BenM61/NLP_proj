You got a certain way I swear of sticking it in
Even though you only ever lose or you win
I always said I'd wait and wait and wait just to see
But I've been waiting here since nineteen-seventy-three

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

Looking back in time right now to seventy-two
I remember all the stupid things we'd do
Sitting 'round and speeding like its seventy-nine
There was always somewhere else I had to be in my mind
Swimming in my mind
Swimming in my mind
Swimming in my mind
In an electric sky
Looking below
Well, it changed my dreams
And now nothing is quite what it seems

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

You got a certain way I swear
Of sticking it there
Ridiculously obvious
And never less aware
I always said I'd wait and wait and wait just to see
I've been waiting here since nineteen-seventy-three
It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere
I didn't do it I swear
I wasn't even there
Elsewhere
Elsewhere
I must have been elsewhere
I must have been elsewhere
