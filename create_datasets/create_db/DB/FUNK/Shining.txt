You played around too long with my lo-ove
Now why won't you set me free
I'm beggin' you baby
I'm just a paw-awn in your game of love

But I was shi-ining, too bright to see
Shi-i-ining, 'cause love blinded me
Shi-i-i-i-i-i-i-ining, but now I'm here all alone

I've stayed around too long with no love
And I'm walking out 'cause now I'm free
I'm tellin' you baby-why, yeah
I've been your paw-awn, now it's my boot, my love

But I was shi-ining, too bright to see
Shi-i-ining, 'cause love blinded me
Shi-i-i-i-i-i-i-ining, but now you've gone
And I am here all alone

You said you loved me and you did lo-o-o-o-o-ove
But since you've changed your mind now
I've rearranged my life now
It's very straight how I've done all for you

And now I'm shi-ining, too bright to see
Shi-i-ining now that I'm free
Shi-i-i-i-i-i-i-ining, now that you've gone
And I am here still alone
