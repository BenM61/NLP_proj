Angela holds a grudge over nothing
Angela, what's the difference?
Today's a day like any other

Still reflexed and in the wind
Still your name rang true

You took the high road
I couldn't find you, up there
You kept your jaw wide and closed
I never noticed before

I used to see the sights
Now I dream of the time
I was holding onto you
For a lack of anything to do

Still the wake has rolled away
Still your name rings true
Mine is yours, yours is yours
Life goes on, life goes on all around you

Let's go up highbeam again
Just take your head from your hands
Take up the cause, just once more
I never noticed before

I used to see the sights
Now I dream of the time
I was holding onto you
For a lack of anything to do

Back to school, back to work
Can this go on forever?
Angela, what's the difference?
Life goes on all around you.
