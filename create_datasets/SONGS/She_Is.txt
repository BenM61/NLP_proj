Do not get me wrong
I cannot wait for you to come home
For now you're not here, and I'm not there
It's like we're on our own
To figure it out
Consider how
To find a place to stand
Instead of walking away
Instead of nowhere to land

This is going to break me clean in two
This is going to bring me close to you

She is everything I need
That I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want
That I never knew I needed
She is everything I need
That I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want
That I never knew I needed

It's all up in the air
And we stand still
To see where it comes down
I don't know where it is
Don't know when
But I want you around
When it falls into place
You and I
Your side into mine
Both behind
Its indication

She's going to bring me clarity
You take the heart right out of me

She is everything I need
That I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want
That I never knew I needed
She is everything I need
That I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want
That I never knew I needed

This is going to bring me to my knees
I just want to hold you close to me

She is everything I need
That I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want
That I never knew I needed
She is everything I need
That I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want
That I never knew I needed

She is everything I needed
She is everything
