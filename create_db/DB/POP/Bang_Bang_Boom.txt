Early morning, I got Mona Lisa by my side 
What's the story behind that devious smile 

Do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do

She's an angel, now she's the monkey on my back
She has freedom still she never lets me go now 

And my blood starts pumpin' and my heart goes jumpin'
Every time she says, 'I have to go now'
But it really don't matter for worse or for better 
She will always be my number one

[Chorus]
She goes
Do do do do 
Do do do do do do
Do do do do 
My heart goes bang bang boom 
Do do do do 
When she walks into the room
Do do do do
My heart goes bang bang boom 

She supplies me whenever ever I'm in need 
Still a thief from the day she stole my heart now 

And my blood starts pumpin' and my heart goes jumpin' 
Every time she says, 'I have to go now' 
But it really don't matter for worse or for better 
She will always be my number one

She goes
Do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do 
My heart goes bang bang boom 
Do do do do 
When she walks into the room 
Do do do do 
My heart goes bang bang boom 

When she walks into the room 
She makes me touch the sky 
A devil in disguise 
She makes me touch the sky
An angel in disguise 

It makes me cry, yeah, yeah

Mona Lisa by my side 
With a devious little smile 
She's a devil in disguise 
She can make me touch the sky, 
Love supplier when I'm in need 
Stole my heart and me bleed 
I don't mind 
I don't mind
I don't mind

When she goes 
Do do do do 
Do do do do do do
Do do do do 
My heart goes bang bang boom 
Do do do do
When she walks into the room
Do do do do 
My heart goes bang bang boom 

Do do do do 
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do 
My heart goes yeah yeah yeah 
Do do do do 
When she walks into the room 
Do do do do
My heart goes bang bang boom
