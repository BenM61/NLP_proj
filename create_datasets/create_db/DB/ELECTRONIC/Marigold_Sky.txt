If you had a dream did it happen
If you stop and think for a little while
Try to make up faces that once were real
Even though it seemed like a lifetime
Wasn't really more than a short ride
But it left me memories
That time can't steal

[Chorus:]
Oh my...marigold sky
Gold leaf reflections on the ocean
Yeah I was lost in the light
Like sand in a shell
She holds me

We were tryin' to be so enlightened
Movin' on from father, son and holy ghost
Trippin' on the passion, hooked on love
Was I ever yours were you ever mine
Did we ever loose
What we tried to find
Wasn't all that passion a dream enough

[Chorus:]

I realize, realize
When a love is lost! It's all so real
Broken heart needs oh so long to heal (oh no)
Though the magic happened some time ago
I know it's alive
It'll never grow cold
Marigold
Marigold sky
If you had a dream did it happen
If you stop and think for a little while
Can you bring back times that were once so real

[Chorus:]
