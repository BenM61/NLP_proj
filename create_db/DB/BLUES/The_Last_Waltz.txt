She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Holding a lantern light
Waitin' for a man who's a riverboat gambler
He said he'd return tonight

They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
[Unintelligible; doesn't sound like "Loving"] the whole night through
The riverboat gambler went off to make a killin'
And bring it on back to you
Evangeline, Evangeline, curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Now, Bayou Sam from South Louisiana 
Had gamblin' in his veins
And Mama Moo (??) who loves only you
Why do ya cause her such pain?

She went to the top of Hickory Hill
Stand in the lightnin' and thunder
Riverboat, it was sinkin?She watched that boat go under
Evangeline, Evangeline, curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

The last of November
Leaves on the ground
It's hard to remember
What city, what town (what town)
So many roads
Mothered (?) in stone
Surrounded by bones
It feels so alone
The last waltz, the last waltz
The last waltz with you
Don't mean the last dance is over
The last waltz, the last waltz
The last waltz was through
