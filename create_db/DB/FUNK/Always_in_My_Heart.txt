Where do they get off telling you
that I am not the least bit into
Just tell me how the hell the can tell you they know what's in my heart
What do they get from telling you
that I don't give a damn about you
Just tell me why the hell somebody wants to tear your heart apart

Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why do some people have to tell you lies
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way
I can't take much more, I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
You should know that from this moment you are always in my heart
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
love you
You'll be always in my heart

They're not the ones to be there for you
When you need someone to turn to
They won't be anywhere, be anywhere when things start falling down
Oh, yeah
They're only in it to confuse you
So they can turn around and use you
But it can't happen, it won't happen girl as long as I'm around

Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why do some people have to tell you lies
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way
I can't take much more, I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
You should know that from this moment you are always in my heart
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
love you
You'll be always in my heart

Oh, why
Why, why, why
Yeah
Why did you have to listen to the lies
Oh, girl
My sweet girl
Well, there is only you inside my world
Oh, please
Baby, please
I wish you could believe in me
Right now
Right now
If only you could know

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
You should know that from this moment you are always in my heart
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
love you
You'll be always in my heart
