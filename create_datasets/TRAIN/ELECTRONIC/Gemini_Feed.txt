Open up your eyes
There's nothing on my body left to see
I tried a thousand times
I tried to say "I love you", but you didn't hear me
And you're passive-aggressive
Convinced me other people didn't care about me

And you're passive-aggressive
You're passive-aggressive
You're passive-aggressive

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it that you wanted me smaller
If you would have let me grow
You could have kept my love

Ode to my two thighs
I still want you to kiss 'em 'cause they're lonely
And why are you so surprised?
And when I said "I miss you," you never believed me?
And we were so depressive
You and me together we were gemini feed

And we were so depressive
We were so depressive
We were so depressive, hey

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it that you wanted me smaller
If you would have let me grow
You could have kept my love

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it that you wanted me smaller
If you would have let me grow
You could have kept my love

And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it that you wanted me smaller
If you would have let me grow
You could have kept my love
