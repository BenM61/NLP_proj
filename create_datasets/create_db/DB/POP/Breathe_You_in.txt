Was it something that I said
Something that I did
Something that I once wrote
That turned your eyes to me
Made you believe

There was something in the air
Something I never felt
Somehow I needed you more
You took my breath away
I'll never be the same

There's something that you do to me
I lose my sense of gravity

Every time that you look at me
The air is filled with the love I need
And I breathe you in
I breathe you in
And every time we say goodnight
I hold your hand and I close my eyes
And I breathe you in
I breathe you in again
(Again, again, again, again, again)

I'm addicted to your scent
Addicted to your walk
I'm addicted to your smile
I cannot last a day
You take away the pain

With every breath that I take
Every beat of my heart
I feel you're running through my veins
Keeping me alive
I need you to survive

There is something that you do to me
(To me, to me)
I lose my sense of gravity

Every time that you look at me
The air is filled with the love I need
And I breathe you in
I breathe you in
And every time we say goodnight
I hold your hand and I close my eyes
And I breathe you in
I breathe you in again

Again, again, again, again, again

Every time that you look at me
The air is filled with the love I need
And I breathe you in
I breathe you in
And every time we say goodnight
I hold your hand and I close my eyes
And I breathe you in
I breathe you in again
(Again, again, again, again, again)

Again, again, again, again , again

And I breathe

And every time we say goodnight
I hold your hand and I close my eyes
And I breathe you in
I breathe you in again
