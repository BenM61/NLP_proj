Come on in take a seat next to me
You know we got
We got what you need
We may be liars preaching to choirs but we can
We can sell your dreams

You don't need sympathy
They got a pill for everything
Just take that dark cloud
Ring it out to wash it down, but

Don't pray for us
We don't need no modern Jesus
To roll with us
The only rule we need is never
Giving up
The only faith we have is faith in us

We're the ones who start little fires
Yet they burn out
But when they're on the rise they can't help but shine

And when the wave approaches Take our ashes to the ocean
Who cares if hell awaits?
We're having drinks at heaven's gate

Don't pray for us
We don't need no modern Jesus
To roll with us
The only rule we need is never
Giving up
The only faith we have is faith in us

We know that we're helpless
At least we always assume
But we don't need to prove nothing to you
Let's keep the cool
You don't need to feel blue
'Cause we won't sell you nothing
You can't use

Don't pray for us
We don't need no modern Jesus
To roll with us
The only rule we need is never
Giving up
The only faith we have is faith in us
