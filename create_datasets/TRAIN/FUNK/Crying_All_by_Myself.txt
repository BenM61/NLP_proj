maybe i'm right maybe i'm wrong
i've got a feeling
you're not coming home
and you're leaving me
cryin all by myself

I know your not angry 
there's not been a fight
but i won't see you after tonight

girl you're leaving me
cryin all by myself

You gave me love
i loved in return

you're leaving me cryin all by myself
