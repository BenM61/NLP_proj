Satellites are falling down tonight
I see you far away 
I'm floating into this inescapable bliss

Changing light, I know the symptoms of
I got myself to blame
I'm needing you, I just don't care anymore

Good boys never win
Good boys always fallow
Good boys never win
They all fall away and you remain

Fear of flight 
I'm so afraid of heights
Why are you asking why
I'm walking but my feet are never touching the ground

Good boys never win
Good boys always fallow
Good boys never win
They all fall away and you remain

Eyes wide in the middle of the night
Got more money than a body got right
Riding on the L 'til the sun comes up again

You got me on your face
A big disgrace
Shakin' your feathers all over the place
You woke face down on St. Marks Avenue

What a pity for you
