Outta her head
And outta her dreams
There he was just the way she's seen him
Lookin' at her a thousand times before

Said I can't believe
It's been five long years
'Cause tonight they just seen to disappear
You still look the same
You haven't changed at all

She said take me away with you
We can ride on the wind
'Cause I feel a gypsy honeymoon
Comin' around again
Throw the car in gear
Put the zoom on the lens
'Cause we're hot as a gyspy honeymoon
Comin' around again

He said I still remember
Her sweet perfume
When it filled his head
And it rocked the room
The walked the wire of passion
So alive

It's hard to hold on
In these times
Did one of us change
Was it yours or mine
You just can't imagine
How lonely I've been

She said take me away with you
We can ride on the wind
'Cause I feel a gypsy honeymoon
Comin' around again
Throw the car in gear
Put the zoom on the lens
'Cause we're hot as a gyspy honeymoon
Comin' around again

We chase our hearts like open fires
Give ourselves to old desires
Surrender sweet
And here we go again

She said take me away with you
We can ride on the wind
'Cause I feel a gypsy honeymoon
Comin' around again
Throw the car in gear
Put the zoom on the lens
'Cause we're hot as a gyspy honeymoon
Comin' around again
