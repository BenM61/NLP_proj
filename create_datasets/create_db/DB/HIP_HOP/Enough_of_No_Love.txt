I admit that you almost had me
I admit I was almost crazy
Had me thinkin' 'bout callin' that bitch that night
And let her know where she can come and meet me
But it's cool, I'ma be a lady
She think she cute but she don't phase me
And if you knew about all of this good love you'll be missin' out on
You wouldn't have played me

Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it

'Cause I, ay-ay ay-ay I can't stay here,
If there's no love
'Cause I, ay-ay ay-ay I can't stay here, 'cause I've had enough
Enough of no love,
Enough of no love
No love!

And I admit that I thought about creeping
So you could get a dose of how I feel
'Cause our hearts can never seem to break even
But what's the use I'd rather pack it up and leave it
'Cause here we are again, 'cause you're wrong again
Quit tryin' to tell me that you love me
'Cause your actions say another thing

Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it

'Cause I, ay-ay ay-ay I can't stay here,
If there's no love (Can you hear me lady)
Yeah 'cause I, ay-ay ay-ay I can't stay here, (Put your hands in the air)
'Cause I've had enough
Enough of no love,
Enough of no love

Uh, why you worry 'bout that other hoe
'Cause that other hoe worry 'bout another hoe
Yeah, you say it's over but you still fussing
You just clumsy, always tripping over nothing
That other bitch is just that other bitch
I give her space and give you the mother ship
We can't let her tear down what we built
I told you if you ride or die then I'll be your seat-belt
In sickness and in health for rich poor and I stay rich
But love is a bitch and bitches ain't shit
And I'm riding with a girl name Keisha smoking on Keish uh ('Cause I can't)

'Cause I, ay-ay ay-ay I can't stay here, (Young Mulla Baby)
If there's no love (I know I can't)
'Cause I, ay-ay ay-ay I can't stay here, (I've had enough) 'cause I've had enough,
Enough of no love, (No love no love)
'Cause I, ay-ay ay-ay I can't stay here, If there's no love
You ain't go no love for me, you ain't go no love for me
