Love here in the starlit hour 
Oh, heaven is in your eyes 
While the wind is sobbing 
Underneath the stars 
Both our hearts are throbbing 
Like two guitars 

Love here in the starlit hour 
Night whispering lullabies 
Let me dream forever 
Underneath the silvery skies 

Will it be just as sweet again, 
The glamor, the glory that we know 
Will I find when we meet again 
The glamor, the glory's still a glow 

But tonight let us forget tomorrow 
Here under the midnight blue 
Love will bloom and flower 
In the starlit hour with you...
