Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear
Thrill me, darlin', with words I want to hear
In your dark eyes so smilin' a promise I see
But your two lips won't say you care for me

Oh my darlin', if my daydreams would come true
You would meet me at a secret rendezvous
And I'd find the paradise that lies deep in your eyes
Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear
