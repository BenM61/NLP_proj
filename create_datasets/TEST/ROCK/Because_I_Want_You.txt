Fall into you
Is all I seem to do
When I hit the bottle
'cause I'm afraid to be alone
Tear us in two
Is all it seems to do
As the anger fades
This house is no longer a home

Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting
And everything that's true
Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting

Because I want you to
Because I want you to
Because I want you to
Because I want you
Because I want you

Stumble into you
Is all I ever do
My memory's hazy
And I'm afraid to be alone
Tear us in two
Is all it's gonna do
As the headache fades
This house is no longer a home

Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting
And everything that's true
Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting

Because I want you to
Because I want you to
Because I want you to
Because I want you
Because I want you

Because I want you to
Because I want you to
Because I want you
Because I want you

Fall into you
Is all I ever do
When I hit the bottle
'cause I'm afraid to be alone
Tear us in two
Tear us in two
Tear us in two

Because I want you to
Because I want you to
Because I want you
Because I want you
