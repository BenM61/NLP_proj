I don't want it, 
I don't want tonight to stop.
No more waiting,
And no more wishing from the top.

Do you hear it?
Do you hear the only sound?
No more doubting, 
And no more wishing from the ground. 

It's a glo-o-o-orious town,
It's a glo-orious town.
(and I can feel it in the air)

Yeah, it's a glo-o-o-orious town
It's a glo-orious town
(it's better with you around)

They don't like it, 
They don't like the way you look. 
Do you care about it?
And do you hear the words come out? 

'Cause I don't want it, 
No, I don't want tonight to stop.
No more waiting,
And no more wishing from the top.

It's a glo-o-o-orious town,
It's a glo-orious town
(and I can feel it in the air)

It's a glo-o-o-o-rious town
It's a glo-orious town

And I can feel it in the air, 
It's better with you around. 

It's in the knowing of your eyes, 
Oh oh oh-oh, 
We're tying a rope around, 
Oh oh oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh oh.

It's a glo-o-o-orious town,
It's a glo-orious town.

It's a glo-o-o-orious town,
It's a glo-orious town.

And I can feel it in the air.
(and I can feel it in the air)

It's better with you around
(It's better with you around)

Oh, oh-oh, oh oh oh.

Well I can feel it getting there.

Oh oh oh-oh, 

We're tying a rope around, 

Oh oh oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh.
