I'm being followed by someone I don't know
He's in the shadows, I see him below
He's got weird eyes, you know, he looks like a freak
He's a man I would lot like to meet

I've got these tingles up and down my spine
I feel his stare, he's right behind
I turn 'round fast just to see him clear
But all I find is the shadowy air

He's in my mind, didn't do no crime
He wants to bring me down just for being the clown
You know he walks right behind, he only talks in rhyme
He's really got me down, now that I've been found

He's my shadow man
Shadow man, shadow man, shadow man

I'm being followed by someone with a smile
He sneered at me back over half a mile
He's pigeon-toed, you know, he walks with a limp
I fear the worst, I can sense his grip

He's moving in so now I have to run
His icy eyes cut through me like a gun
I shed a tear as his hand meets my neck
I turn the corner, I'm away to the left

He's in my mind, didn't do no crime
He wants to bring me down just for being the clown
You know he walks right behind, he only talks in rhyme
He's really got me down, now that I've been found

He's my shadow man
Shadow man, shadow man, shadow man

Oh, c'mon!
