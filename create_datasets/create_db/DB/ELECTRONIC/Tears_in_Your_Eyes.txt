I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you
I noticed light upon your face
You gave it all with joy and grace
When I found you

When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you
I noticed light upon your face
You gave it all with joy and grace
When I found you

When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you
I noticed light upon your face
You gave it all with joy and grace
When I found you

When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you

When I found you
