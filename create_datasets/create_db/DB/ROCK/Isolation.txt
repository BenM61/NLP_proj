When all is lost to you inside
When all the darkness takes the light
The ritual warning has begun
And now you tear away from everyone
Disconnected so alone yeah
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be?
Yeah!

Justify you waste away
You dare to dream but still you're too afraid
And now you're broken and deceived
Lost to live this cruel reality
You're disconnected so alone
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be?
Yeah!

Maybe you'll stand
Maybe you'll give and break to find another way
And makes things better
Maybe you'll find
A you can live and learn to love along the way
And make things better
And make things better

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be?
Yeah!

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be?

You're disconnected so alone
What will come to be?
You're disconnected so alone
