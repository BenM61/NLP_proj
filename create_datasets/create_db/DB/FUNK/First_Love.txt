As summer was ending, you were walking in
It seemed my life was falling
But in this season we were friends
Six days into spring, is where our story begins
You didn't rush a thing,
But you knew you would win

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd be the only one
I dreamt of fairy tales ,that's how we begun
But I was waiting for some magical moment,
That would prove to me, forever would be fine,
Meanwhile my first love, was standing first in line

One of the first times I didn't feel alone,
Is when I was in your arms
You always made me feel at home
We watched the sunrise,cause the night had slipped away
And from then until now, we've been through some different phases
But you love the winter, love the challenge,
Always managed to think that we would make it

[Chorus]

So let me get used to things, cause gradual's my name
I don't dive into the cold, I get in slow
But every day, I'm making peace with loving you,
Peace with being me
Any pieces of us
I claim them all today

[Chorus]
