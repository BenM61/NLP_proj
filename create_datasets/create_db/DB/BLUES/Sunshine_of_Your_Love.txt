Well it's gettin' near dark
When the lights be closin' your tired little eyes
I'll soon be with you, my love
And give you that potato-headed surprise

Stay with you darlin'
Soon
I'll stay with you till all o' 'em stars start to fallin'
And fallin'

Ah! I've been waiting so long
(Ay! A-ha!)
Oh to be where I'm goin'
(Arriba! Arriba! Ay!)
In the sunshine of your love

Now hold down just a second, there
You leather-faced metal freak
And you potato-headed watcha'ma'callit!
(You talkin' to us now, son?)
Yeah, you bet I'm talkin' to you
I got something to say right here
(Ain't you the man in black?)
(sucker!)
Just get yourself ready
It's getting near dark

The light's shinin' through on you
I'll soon be with you, my love
(Whom love?)
It's the morning and just we two
I'll be with you darling soon
I'll be with ya when the sea's all dried up!
(The seas?)
The seas
(You're talkin' dried up?)
I'll seize ya, buddy
Oh! Wait a minute here! 
You shit kicker!

I said
I been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
(Andale! Andale! Anda!)
In the sunshine of your love!
