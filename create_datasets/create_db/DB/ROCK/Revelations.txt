You know what to do
You know what I did
Since you know everything, just clue me in
I am such a wreck
I am such a mess
I know what I know
Why don't you fill in the rest?
I will bring it down
I will make it bad
While you're feeling proud
Why don't you help me?

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in
I don't want to live without
Your revelations, revelations

You know what to say
You know what I said
You know what I dream sleeping in my bed
You hold all the keys
You know all the rules
Why don't you guide me in if I'm such a lost soul?
I'm spinning around
I will make you ill
Since I'm so broken down, why don't you fix me?

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in
I don't want to live without
Your revelations

I am haunted when I am sleeping
Try to give without receiving
It's in the apple bite
It's in the days and nights
In the afterlife we'll reap

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in
I don't want to live without
Your revelations

Such a shame, such a shame
That I wouldn't know by now
Cut me in
I don't want to live without
Your revelations, revelations
