One two, one, two, three, four

You know how to hurt me baby
Oh yes you do
You know how to hurt baby
Oh yes you do
I've got to get out of this house
Before I hurt you
I got my guitar in my hand
And I'm walking out that door
I got my guitar in my hand
And I'm walking out that door
Well I don't know where I'm going
I just know I have to go

I don't need no company

I want to be alone
I don't need no company
I want to be on my own
You know I feel just like a child
Who doesn't have a home
You how to hurt me baby
Oh yes you do
You know how to hurt me
On yes you do
I've got to get out of this house
Before I hurt you
Slide solo

You how to hurt me baby
Oh yes you do
You know how to hurt
On yes you do
