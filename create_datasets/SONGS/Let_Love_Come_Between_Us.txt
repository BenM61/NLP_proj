Baby, I found a way
To stop all this fussin', yeah
It's just not right, baby
The way that we fight

And girl, if you would only listen
To what we have to say
We can stop all this fussin', baby
We could do it this way

Let love come between us
Let love bring us together
Let love be born today
Let love, let love live forever
Let love

I don't believe
That you realize
How much I need you, baby
And the way my heart cry

It's so hard for us
Just to get along
So come on and listen, baby
To the words of my song

Let love come between us
Let love bring us together
Let love be born today
Let love, let love live forever
Let love

Let love come between us
Let love bring us together
Let love be born today
Let love, let love live forever

Let love come between us
Let love bring us together
Let love be born today
Let love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love
