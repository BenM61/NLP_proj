I won't laugh at you when you boo-hoo-hoo coz I luv you
I can turn my back on the things you lack coz I luv you
I just like the things you do mmm,
Don't you change the things you do mmm
You get me in a spot and smile the smile you got and I luv you
You make me out a clown then you put me down I still luv you
I just like the things you do mmm,
Don't you change the things you do mmmm

When you bite your lip you're gonna flip your flip but I luv you
When we're miles apart you still reach my heart how I love you
I just like the things you do mmm,
Don't you change the things you do mmm,
Only time can tell if we get on well coz I luv you
All that's passed us by we can only sigh hihi coz I luv you
I just like the things you do mmm,
Don't you change the things you do mmm.

La la laa la la..
