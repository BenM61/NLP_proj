Thought I was ready, ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady
But that I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself

Guess I went ahead and jumped the gun again
Some shitty situation that I put you in
And I know we poured champagne
Maybe we was just too quick to celebrate

I thought I was ready, ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady, that I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of my

I get ahead of myself, yeah babe
I get ahead of myself, yeah babe

Know that I was first to say, "I love you, babe"
Moved my things to your apartment down on 2nd Street
I thought I'd cleaned the slate
But I guess I didn't clean it all away

I thought I was ready, ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady
That I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of my

Get ahead of myself, yeah babe
Get ahead of myself, yeah baby
Get ahead of myself, yeah babe
Get ahead of myself, yeah babe, yeah babe
Get ahead of myself
I get ahead of myself

I thought I was ready, ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady
That I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself
Every time I get ahead of my

Get ahead of myself, yeah babe
Get ahead of myself, yeah baby
Get ahead of myself, yeah babe
Get ahead of myself, yeah babe, yeah babe
