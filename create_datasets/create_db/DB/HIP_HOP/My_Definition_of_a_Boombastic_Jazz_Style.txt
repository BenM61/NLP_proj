here we go are you ready for one other
Dream Warriors' noise is new discover-al
once again with a new blend so telephone a friend
(yo dude I just got this new song It's dope man)
compact disc to the prime is optimist
fans and friends I'm universally cosmic
concrete jungles abound
you stand by the speakers 
you're smothered and covered up in the sound
you stand strong as you pump your fist
I'm talkin' all that jazz
now what's my definition

Chorus:
my definition
my definition
my definition is this
my definition
my definition
my definition is this
my definition 
my definition is this
my definition

when I kick rhymes there's something said to do damage
hits so strong even superman needs a hand
so bob your head dread as I kick the funk flow
this rhyme is subliminal yet you don't think so
I walk with a gold cane a gold brain and no gold chain
behind the truth lies there lies a parafix
in the mix is where Dream Warriors go
define if you will but I know so
there is no definition

Chorus

rhyme thou I know it to flow it just like a poet
your definition of me is definitely wrong
why must I try to lie and build an alibi
when all you ask is just for me to be me
replace a replacable replacement with this
relax relax relaxtion boombastic
my name is King Lu
(mine is Capital Q)
bags of mostly water search to find my definition

Chorus

I sought beauty through the dust of strife
I sought meaning to my music addicition
arise awaken we have need to reverse
a plauge has befallen us no time to reherse
this rhyme speaks it speak and has spoken
this rhyme will not change things
it needs to be changed in a hurse
you find caskets in my rhyme baskets of rhyme
your definition can define
so what's my definition

Chorus

(yo, where'd everybody go?)
