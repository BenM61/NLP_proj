Yeah, D-F-B, bitch and Korn in this motherfucker
The collaboration, yeah, yeah
Wait, I'm coming undone
(That's right)

I let my shoulders lean
I snap my neck back
I let my wrists pop
I make my fingers snap, first

I let my shoulders lean
Then, I snap my neck back, wait
(Then I let my wrists pop)
I'm coming undone
(Then I make my fingers snap)

Lean wit it

I bounce in the club, so the hoes call me Rocky
Posted in the cut and I'm lookin' for a blockhead
Yup, in my white tee, I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank, oh, I think they like that
(Wait)

Before I leave the house, I'm slizzard on a goose
And I'm higher then a plane, so a nigga really loose
And I can lean wit it and I can rock wit it
And if you gotta friend, she gotta suck a cock wit it

Wait
(Rock wit it)
I'm coming undone
(Rock wit it)
Unlaced
(Rock wit it)
I'm coming undone
(Rock wit it)

Too late

I'm too clean to wanna pop, lock from left to right a nigga lean
Bobbin' to da beat, check my feet, he ain't got these
I rock then bend my knees every time the beat drop
Lean wit it, rock wit it, freeze before yo fingers pop

Pimpin' in the club, see them hoes tryin' a act up
'Cause they see my chain and a nigga throwin' them stacks up
I keep a full clip and my pistol in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo', they screamin', "Nigga, do ya dance?"

That's right, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it
Trigger between my eyes
(Lean wit it)
Please strike middle of the flo'
Rhey screamin', "Nigga, make it quick now"

Wait
(Rock wit it)
I'm coming undone
(Rock wit it)
Irate
(Rock wit it)
I'm coming undone
(Rock wit it)

Hey, what's happenin'? Lean wit me, rock wit me
Gotta pill pop wit me, gonna take a shot wit me
Call me Teddy, I got grams don't hate, nigga shop wit me DF
(I'm)

(Do it how you want slow it up do the)
Trying to hold it together
(Matrix play with it straight hit it get all they face with it)
Head is lighter than a feather
(The killers the dealers the cutthroats)

Korn and the motherfucking Franchize Boyz

Wait
