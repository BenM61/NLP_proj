Paint a lie with something true
Decorate the walls you've pissed on
All of this is nothing new
You burn the foundation you've built on
But if I give myself to you
Will you take my love for granted
If I give myself to you
Can I get through to the real you

I've been analyzing you
And I think I know your reasons
I'm as uncertain as you
I burn the foundation I've built on
But if I give myself to you
Will you take my love for granted
If I give myself to you
Will you raise a fence around you

Words flow through me
Disbelief
The world walks through me
Disbelief
