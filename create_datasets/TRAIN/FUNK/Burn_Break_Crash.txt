Just for a moment
I went along, lost my focus
You already know this
'Cause in a blink of an eye I was flyin'
Yeah, did I mention
I was not payin' attention
When you looked my direction
And in a blink of an eye I was fallin'

Mama said to look both ways
Watch out where you're goin'
But I still made the same mistake
Without even knowin'

Now all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you

Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
All I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you

So let's go faster
A beautiful mad disaster
Wait, baby, I have to
I gotta pinch, gotta check I'm not dreamin'
I can't escape you
I try but I can't hate you
No, it's part of my nature
I gotta pinch, gotta check I'm still breathin'

Mama said to look both ways
Watch out where you're goin'
But I still made the same mistake
Without even knowin'

Now all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do (yeah, all I wanna do)
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you

Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
All I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do (yeah, all I wanna do)
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you

Now I got you by my side
Now I got you in my life
I'll never be the same
Never be the same
I can't stay and I can't go
Oh, it's out of my control
We're goin' up in flames
Goin' up in flames

Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
Now all I wanna do (all I, all I wanna do)
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do (all I wanna do)
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you
