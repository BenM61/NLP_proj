Signal
Wave across the water for me
Let me know
That you'll be waiting ever for me
Oh, I've been travelling
Waiting for a moment of peace
These stormy weathers
Got me thinking of how I want it to be

(Be, be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to be)

Signal
Light a thousand fires under me
Give me no doubt
That I'm the one who never has to leave
Oh, I've been divided
Time and time again you keep the peace
Give me shelter
Let me be the man I wanted to be

(Be, be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to be)
(Be, be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be)
