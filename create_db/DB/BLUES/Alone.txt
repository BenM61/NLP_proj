This empty room it fills my mind
Freedom it leaves me confined
Every single bone has cracked
But in this life, you can't turn back

I don't want to live
I don't want to live here alone 
Alone, alone, alone

As these words part with my tongue
I question why they even sung
I promise but I lie
I don't even know myself inside

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be here alone
Alone, alone, alone

Today and tomorrow have become one
Every single thing has become undone
Human nature is a beast
What I've done the most, to show I have the least

Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave me here
Don't you leave me alone 
Alone, alone, alone
