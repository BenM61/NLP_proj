I know where you went but I don't know how you got
I know where you went but I don't know how you got
Silver tongue hill where you talk up what I' d play down
I would speak up but I wouldn't know what to say
To say
To say

Lucidity, come back to me,
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh it's hard to tell, it breaks down,
There is a will, there is a way

Wondering around like spare time never knew it, 
I might suck fizzle or I might just float away

And we'll go running off tonight
High above, where we won't even need to recah the sky, my love
Oh there will be a change in the air, nobody will be anybody else

Lucidity, come back to me,
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh where we'll go, tip toe, tread boldly right down
To the lair, ah ah ah
