40 days and 40 nights since I last got in a fight 
What have we done? 
Money's on the lookout for number 1
40 nights and 40 days that's how long I'm going to stay 
What have become of the children that this culture spawned? 

Another word for lack of precision 
Another word that fits for me and you 
We are up for sale everything that we know is up for sale 

40 days and 40 nights since I last saw some light 
What have we done sacrificed our kids and loved ones 
40 nights and 40 days is this the price we are going to pay? 
What have we become, marked up and price-tagged everyone 

Another word for the lack of precision 
Another word that fits for em and you 
We are up for sale everything that we know is up for sale
We are up for sale everything that we know is up for sale
