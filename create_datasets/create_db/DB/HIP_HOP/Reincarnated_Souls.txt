We are reincarnated souls from that time
Living on earth, heat air and water in this time (rep.)

In the beginning was the word
And the word manifested itself in the flesh

Which ever become man
All because of the devine plan
Man being lower than the angels,
Over all earth was as he given dominion
He devised his own destruction
But the word lives on and on

He who is weary let him come hither
He who has eves to see
Let him look yonder
He who is thirsty let him drink clear water
Drink water children
Drink my water children
For it's the age of aquarius
Can't you see its dawning, dawning
It's the age of aquarius
Can't you see its dawning, dawning
It's the age of aquarius
So keep your love lights burning. burning
