The moon is a drop in a black hole
The sun is a hell of a light
But nobody's blue is brighter
Than the blue in my baby tonight

A man is a snake in the autumn
Maybe dew (Baby-do) is making him wretch
Oh man was it dark in the jungle
His heart is an empty fretch 

A man is a duck in the jungle
Who's lost in the big bamboo
Snake jumps out of the fire
And it's cryin' (goin') for baby-do

The moon is a drop in a black hole
The sun was a hell of a light
Oh man I'm gonna have my ice cold
Baby-do is out of sight

I'm in danger
In your jungle
I'm a stranger
Land of Mambo

'Cause what you do
Must be voodoo
I'm in danger
Oh baby-do

(repeat all and chorus)
(repeat all and chorus)
