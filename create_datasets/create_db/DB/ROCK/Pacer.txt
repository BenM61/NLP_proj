Now I like to get loud
I like to go to the other side
Just to think, you were just passin' by

Ridin' around
You spat in my eye
Just to think, you were just passin' by

We were hike to hike
Breezing by
You broke the pace
Just a twisted kid, never learned to ride

Now I like to get loud
I like to go to the other side
Just to think, you were just passin' by

We were hike to hike
Breezing by
You broke the pace
Just a twisted kid, never learned to ride

Now my wheels are off the ground
They keep spinnin' 'round
Just to think, you were just passin' by

Now I like to get loud
Go to the other side
Just to think, you were just passin' by
