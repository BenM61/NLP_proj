Baby, we can make love,
KOMACHI-ANGEL
Maybe we are alright, say,
Yeah! Yeah!
Tonight we've got to make it,
you're so wicked ANGEL
I'm gonna love ya till the end,
I've got a life, Yeah! Yeah!
Red dress;
an excess of wicked sting
Can you see now
I feel so strange
I guess I can mess around
with you someday
The night sky's saying
it's true
Everytime I wanna fall in love
with someone
Illusions can be seen
in hot summer night
But not a casual romance
I'm gonna get serious
So don't twist my words
and make up your mind
Baby, we can make love,
KOMACHI-ANGEL
Maybe we are alright, say,
Yeah! Yeah!
Tonight we've got to make it,
you're so wicked ANGEL
I'm gonna love ya till the end,
I've got a life, Yeah! Yeah!

Hot clump hold some trump,
evil eyes catch me
You got Latin roots I like it
Gonna stump, get the jump
on the other guys around
Everybody, the die is cast
Oh, I can tell my heart
is beating so loud
Baby, I'm sure you will
make my dreams come true
I know you love me and
you know I love you
C'mon take my hands and
let's get out of here
Baby we can make love,
KOMACHI-ANGEL
Maybe we are alright, say,
Yeah! Yeah!
Tonight we've got to make it,
you're my wicked ANGEL
Child of the sunlight,
you mystify, Yeah! Yeah!
Baby we can make love,
KOMACHI-ANGEL
Lady, pay attention, say,
Yeah! Yeah!
Tonight we've got to make it,
you're my wicked ANGEL
Everybody push push,
we can say, Yeah! Yeah!
