I have often walked down the street before
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before

All at once am I
Several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?

Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare
They don't bother me
For there's no where else on earth
That I would rather be

Let the time go by
I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live

People stop and stare
They don't bother me
For there's no where else on earth
That I would rather be

Let the time go by
I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live
Let me be on the street where you live
