A change of heart couldn't hurt nobody
The way she goes around won't change your mind
A change of heart couldn't hurt nobody
The way she goes around won't make you smile

I live in style, but life gets me down
And when a little high she climbed inside and said:
"Don't go changing, no don't change me
Because it feels like coming down"

A change of luck couldn't hurt nobody
The way she goes around won't change your mind
A change of luck couldn't hurt nobody
And when she goes down, it's gonna change your mind

Well I live in style, but life gets me down
And when a little high she climbs inside my head
Don't change me, no don't go changing me
Because it feels like I'm coming down
Oh yes it feels like I'm coming down

A change of heart couldn't hurt nobody
The way we go around won't change your mind

It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind
It won't change your mind

So change your mind
Change your mind
... go on change your mind
