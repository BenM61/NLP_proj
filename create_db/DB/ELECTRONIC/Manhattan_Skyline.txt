We sit and watch umbrellas fly
I'm trying to keep my newspaper dry
I hear myself say,
"My boat's leaving now"

so we shake hands and cry
Now I must wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
You know
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to cry again
Don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to run away
Don't want to race this pain
I'll never see your face again
Oh but how 
How can you say
That I didn't try
You see things in the depths of my eyes
That may love's run dry
No

We leave to their goodbyes
I've come to depend on the look in their eyes
My blood's sweet for pain
The wind and the rain bring back words of a song 
And they say: wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
But you know

I don't want to fall again
Don't want to look this pain
Don't want another friend
Don't want to try again
Don't want to see you hurt
Don't let me see you hurt
I don't want to cry again
I'll never see your face again
How can you say 
That I didn't try
You know I did
You see things in the depths of my eyes
That my love's run dry

So I read to myself:
A chance of a lifetime to see new horizons
