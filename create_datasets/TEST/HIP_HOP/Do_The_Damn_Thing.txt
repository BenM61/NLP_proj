(Verse 1)
Outside inside
De place it ram
Dance floor tight
But we don't give a damn
Man hold yuh gal
And gal hold yuh man
And do the damn thing
Do the damn thing

Pop dat kris
No work tomorrow and you know i ain't driving
Excuse me miss
Tell me what's your name and tell me what your drinking
No sleep tonight
Party's going on till six in the morning
The dance floor's tight
Just the way we like it everybody's jumpin

Get yo freak on
Do what you want
Gal move yuh waist
Give man a taste

Get yo freak on
Do what you want
Mash up de place
Give me a taste

Verse 2
Outside inside
De place it ram
Dance floor tight
But we don't give a damn
Man hold yuh gal
And gal hold yuh man
And do the damn thing
Do the damn thing

Outside inside
De place it ram
Dance floor tight
But we don't give a damn
Man hold yuh gal
And gal hold yuh man
And do the damn thing
Do the damn thing

The sun is up
After the show it is the after party
It don't stop
Everyting nice and we feelin irie
We don't care
Nobody wants this session to end
People everywhere
Tomorrow night you know we'll do the same thing again

Get yo freak on
Do what you want
Gal move yuh waist
Give man a taste

(Bridge)
Gal move your waist
Wine all around and mash up de place
Deal wid de case
When i see you gal you put a smile upon my face
Inside de club
Sippin on hip, carib, banks & bub
Bass like a sub
Hip hip, soca sweet rub a dub

Get yo freak on
Do what you want
Gal move yuh waist
Give man a taste

Get yo freak on
Do what you want
Gal move yuh waist
Give man a taste

Get yo freak on
Do what you want
Gal move yuh waist
Give man a taste
