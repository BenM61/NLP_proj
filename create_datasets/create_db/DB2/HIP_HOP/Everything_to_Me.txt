Boy if you ever left my,
My side,
It'd be like taking the sun from
The sky
I'd probably die without
You in
My life
Cause I need you to
Shine, shine
Your light
Oooohhhhhhh

You're everything to me, yeah
The air that I breathe, oohhh
My sight so I see, oh Lord
You're everything to me

I can't repay you for all that you've done
Always come first and second to none
The love you give me is equal to ten
My peace, my joy
You are my
My strength, ooohhhh

You're everything to me, whoa
The air that I breathe, ooooohhh
I sigh so I see, ohhh that
You're everything to me

(Boy I never thought) Never thought I'd feel a love like this
Better than our first date
Sweeter than our first kiss (and you)
Ain't no other person for me
You're my best friend
My lover
(Baby you're) My everything

You're everything to me, whoa
The air that I breathe, ooooohhh
I sigh so I see, ohhh
You're everything to me oooohhh

I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
