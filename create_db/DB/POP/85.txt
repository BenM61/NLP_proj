It's all so logical, you were so physical
You still don't believe the beau, it's so familiar
It's so easy for him this time, he's crossing on the line
With just one answer I'd blow him away
So how's the weather boy
You look so cold there
They walk right through you now
You need some fresh air
Some try the energist
They got some macho
Don't cut on me this time
'Cause I don't wanna nutso

[Chorus]
Where will you be in '85
What will you be if you're still alive
What will you be,
(Who will you be)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)
Where will you be, in '85

Star lights and satiations dry, new complications fly
So real to be with you, don't need your number
I was expected to, you were directed to
Let's just imagine it's time-out
I always said that you could be some fashion
I always wanted you to take some action
For when I think of it and what you do there
I wish that I could change the time
And let you change some

[Chorus]

Where will you be in '85
What will you be if you're still alive
Who will you be,
(What will you be)
And you won't see me
(you won't see me)
Where will you be, in '85
Come on tell now
What will you be in '85
Yes what I can tell you now
Who will you see if you're still alive
