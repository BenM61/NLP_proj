Life, I wonder
Will it take me under, I don't know

Imagine smokin' weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruisin' blue behind my waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters

Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got not evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually

Troopin' out of state for a plate knowledge
Of coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your click up with diamond vogues

Your people holdin' dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind, I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read 'The World Is Mine'

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

The way to be, paradise like relaxin' black
Latino an' Anglo-Saxon, Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes an' Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in

Open they eyes to the lies history's told, foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Trickin' six digits on kicks an' still holdin'

Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work, release purple M3's an' jet skis

Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
An' reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

An' then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from jake, gettin' chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state

Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back an' forth scrambler

'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world an' everythin' in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 infinite

It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or be Felonies
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the f*ck?

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

If I ruled the world
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
