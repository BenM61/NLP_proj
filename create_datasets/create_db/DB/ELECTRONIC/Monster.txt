I'll give you anything you'll ever need and I'll find a way to turn you into a monster
Me and you we can rule the world 'cause no one's gonna mess with me I'm a monster

Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde saw a chick walking with a big behind
Now I'm stalking my victim,
I'm unrecognisable 'cause I'm in disguise
Into eyes and hers were green,
Crept up behind but she turned and screamed
Everybody turned to see,
I tried to run, tripped up and hurt my knee
I can't believe that she got away
Think of all the love that we could of made?
Jade, I really did mess it up I ruined my only chance with a sugababe
Now I'm a bit ticked off, back to the flat
Hat and kick's off, to relax with a glass of milk
Apparently Pixie drinks Lotts?

No so so shit not from me, not Pro, no me?
My flows so piff, Quasimodo with a dick bigger than both my legs
It looks like a pogo stick
Admitted I am a fruit loop
Frankenstein with a screw loose
In search of a new neck bolt
How long will this neck hold?
I'll be fine with a needle and thread
A lid of Jack an I'm evil again, scheming again
Introduce me to anyone decent and I'll find evil in them
Everybody's P.C., I don't feel them, if I could I would kill them
Before I go I'd like to say thanks to Peter Andre for looking after my children

There ain't a line I ain't took too far
To find me you ain't even gotta look hard
Don't get it confused I'm a crook star
Pubert, I was born with a moustache
