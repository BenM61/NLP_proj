Hush now! Let's not end before we start
Hush now! Lay your whisper on my heart

Time flies- when you're lying next to me
Your eyes- are the only thing I see
Let's make this moment last
Try not to move too fast
Just bring your lips to my ear...

Don't say you love me! Don't say you love me, yeah!
Don't say you need me, some things are better left unsaid!
But If you feel the same, just whisper, whisper my name
If you feel the same just whisper my name

Time flies- when your body's close to mine
Your eyes- sending shivers down my spine
Let's make this moment last
Try not to move too fast
Just bring your lips to my ear...

Hush now! Let's not end before we start
Hush now! Lay your whisper on my heart

Don't say you love me! Don't say you love me, yeah!
Don't say you need me, some things are better left unsaid!
But If you feel the same, just whisper, whisper my name!
If you feel the same just whisper my name!
But If you feel the same, just whisper, whisper my name!
If you feel the same just whisper my name!
