Give me the moonlight
Give me the girl
And leave the rest to me
Give me a shady nook
By a babbling brook
Where no one can see
Give me a bench for two
Where we can bill and coo
And mine she's gonna be
If there's anyone in doubt
And they'd like to try me out
Give me the moonlight
Well - give me the girl
And leave the rest to me

And leave the rest to me

The rest to me.
