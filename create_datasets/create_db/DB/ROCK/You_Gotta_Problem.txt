Pity you
You're telling me you got a problem

A nasty kind of reaction
A dangerous sort of destruction

That makes it difficult, makes hard to reach
Takes all away from what you had in mind

Yeah yeah yeah

Cause there's a big bad point
That you seem to missing.
And it's driving you to distraction.

But it doesn't seem, to stop you in least
Or halt this obsession that got you going back

Week after week (week after week)
Day after day (day after day)
Hour after hour (hour after hour)

From where you came (from where you came)
For more of the same, yeah yeah
