Let him go cause he is rocking
He is sorry that he never changed
Let him go, he is sorry
He's been talking in the tongues again
And he will worry yeah
But please don't ever let him go
Don't you ever, ever let him go at all
At all, at all all all, at all

Let him go, let him go cause he is sorry
Let him never be the same again
Let him swing and let him worry
Wah it's asylums in Jerusalem
Because they are worried yeah
Then please don't ever let him go
Don't you ever, ever let him go at all
At all, at all all all, at all

Let him shake a little let him rock a little
Let him worry
He's in awe but he hates himself
Let him hip hop hippety hop now hurry
It's asylums in Jerusalem
Don't let him worry no
Then please don't ever let him go
Don't you ever, ever let him go at all
Don't let that boy go

Well I know that it rocks
And I know that it shakes
And I know it's got to fall because
It's made it's last mistake

(Now) he's a saint oh but there's so many
They built asylums in Jerusalem
Let him shake a little let him rock a little
Let him worry
Let him never be the same again
Oh he will worry yeah
An' he wants to be above the law
But he doesn't know what he's fightin' for at all
At all, at all all all, at all

Let him pop a little let him swing
And he is sorry
Cause there's something that he couldn't say at all
Let him shake a little let him step a little
Let him worry
Cause it's asylums in Jerusalem
Don't let him worry no
With his hammer and his popsicle
They put him in h-hospital for good
Don't let that boy go
Don't let him go at, at, at all
Oh at all
