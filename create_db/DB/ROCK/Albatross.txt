Well I'm feelin' left behind, Lord what a waste of time
They're coming to get you, run on
How can I respect your crime
When all you criminals whine
They bought and sold you, run on, run on

You can call me crazy
You can call me wrong
Cause I was born a liar
Albatross fly on, fly on

My home is kind, man it pays to be blind
I promise to forget you run on
No swallowed pride, no conspiracy lined
Broken promise of the virtue, run on, Lord run on

You can call me lazy
But I know where I belong
Cause I was born a liar
Albatross, fly on, fly on
With your trust in love from your God above

I believe the Albatross is me

You can call me lazy
You can call me wrong
Cause I was born a liar
Albatross, fly on, fly on

I should have seen the signs
Now the memories far behind
It was no big loss,
Fly on, Albatross yeah
