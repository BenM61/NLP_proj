I'm trying to pretend it isn't true
But even when I run
It's like I can't get over you, over you,
Over you, Over you

And every time I try and tell you why
I turn my face and tears run down my eyes it's over now
Over now
Baby it's over now, over now

So give me all the magic
And give me all the magic that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater then the heartbreak
So give me back the moments
Just give me back the moments that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater then the heartbreak, yeah

What's the point of going through
All the pain I'm in with you
What am I supposed to do
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose you

I'm lying to myself that I'm OK
But when I see your photograph
I'm still not over you, over you
Over you, over you
And every time I will your love away
It comes back in a rush reminding me
It's over now, over now
Over now, Over now

So give me all the magic
Just give me all the magic that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater then the heartbreak
So give me back the moments
Just give me back the moments that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater then the heartbreak, oh oh

What's the point of going through
All the pain I'm in with you
What am I supposed to do
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose you

I tried my best and I'll confess I'll love with less
I gave the most and took the loss from what I chose
I fought for you you lead me to a painful truth
And now I wait without a heart to save

My Love, my Love, my Love, my Love
My Love, my Love, my Love, my Love
My Love, my Love, my Love, my Love
My Love, my Love, my Love, my Love
There's no escaping you

What's the point of going through
All the pain I'm in with you
What am I supposed to do
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose you
