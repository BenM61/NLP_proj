Our house is burning and i'm strapped into your bed
I'm under water and your foot is on my head

I can't take what you're putting me through
I pull away but I keep coming back to you

How can I feel like I'm living?
You make me feel so dead
How can I want to keep on living?
You make me feel so dead

How can I live with your noose tied around my neck?
How can I breathe with your bag of bricks on my chest?

I can't stop how I feel anymore
like your drug
And I'm a junkie at your door

How can I feel like I'm living?
You make me feel so dead
How can I want to keep on living?
You make me feel so dead

I can't take what you're putting me through
I pull away but I keep coming back to you

How can I feel like I'm living?
You make me feel so dead
How can I want to keep on living?
You make me feel so dead
