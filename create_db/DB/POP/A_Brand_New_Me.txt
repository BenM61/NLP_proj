This is my same old coat 
These are my same old shoes 
It was the same old me
With a same old blues
Oh, then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
And when I look in the mirror
I see a brand new girl, oh me
Just because of you (just because of you)
Just because of you, woah
Just becasue of you (just because of you)
Just because of you

I've got the same old friends
And they've got the same old shins
I tell the same old jokes
And I get the same old grins
But now the joke is on you
It happened somehow with you
Everyday of my life
I'm as fresh as morning dew

Just because of you (just because of you)
Just because of you, woah
Just becasue of you, oh (just because of you)
Just because of you

I go to the same old places (same old)
I see the same old faces
I look at the same old sky (same old)
See it all with a brand new light
I got brand new boy (brand new)
And I got me a brand new smile
Since I found you baby
I got me a brand new star

Just because of you (just because of you)
Just because of you, woah
I feel good
Just becasue of you, oh (just because of you)
Just because of you
Oh I feel good
Just because of you, hey (just because of you)
Just because of you, yes I do
Just because of you, just because of you
Oh, just because of you boy, yeah
Just because of you, hey
Just because of you, boy, just because, because, because of you
(Just because of you, boy, ooh boy)
(Just because of you, boy, ooh boy)
