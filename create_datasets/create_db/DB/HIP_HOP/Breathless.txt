oooh, tonight i want to turn the lights down low 
turn the slow jams on the radio 
i want to feel your body next to mine 
so let's slow down and baby take you time 
'cause when i look into your eyes 
always makes my nature rise-oh baby 
want to get you in the mood 
'cause tonight we're gonna groove-oh baby 
makin' love until we're breathless 

come over here i want to make you hot 
kiss you up and down until you say stop 
touch all the little places that you like 
girl you know i want to take you higher 
i want to fill you up 
till you say you've had enough- oh baby 
i want to hear you moan 
call my name out all night long-oh baby 
makin' love until we're breathless 
makin' love until we're breathless 

you know there's not a sound around 
so come on we can break it down 
baby don't say stop 
girl you know we're hot 
lady won't you leave me breathless 
tonight we're just gonna kick it and just flow 
break it down and let our passion go 
tonight i want to make sweet love to you 
girl that's all i want to do 
makin' love until we're breathless 
makin' love until we're breathless 

i know there's not a soul around 
so come on can we break it down 
baby don't say stop 
girl you know we're hot 
baby won't you leave me breathless 
tonight we're gonna kick it and just stroll 
break it down and let our passion show 
tonight i want to make sweet love to you 
girl that's all i want to do 
makin' love until we're breathless 
makin' love until we're breathless
