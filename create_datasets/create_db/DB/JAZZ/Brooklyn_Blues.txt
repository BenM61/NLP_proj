See I flew in from the West Coast
Just the other day
Yes, I flew in from the West Coast
And we circled J.F.K.

The movie ended and I pulled up the shade
Looked out the window while the Muzak played

But in my head I'm singin'
Singin' the Brooklyn Blues, oh, yeah

When you're growin' up in Brooklyn
The Bridge is like a friend
Said when you're growin' up in Brooklyn
That Bridge is sure your friend

Because that river looks a hundred miles wide
When all your dreams are on the other side

And that can start you singin'
Singin' the Brooklyn Blues, oh, yeah

Now I've got myself some money
A mansion in Bel-aire
Yes, I've spent a lot of money
And I've been most everywhere

But still there's somethin' missin' I've got to find
A part of me I must have left behind

That makes a guy start feelin'
Feelin' those Brooklyn Blues, my my

I've sung love songs to a princess
More than once or twice
I've sung rock 'n' roll in Paris
Jazz in paradise

But there's a song of mine I couldn't have sung
A tune I started back when I was young

Now I've come home to finish
Finish my Brooklyn Blues, my Brooklyn Blues
