I guess its, not fair
For me to, not care
But I don't, and that's why
You think am, a great guy

But I want you, and you want me too
And you need this, while I give it to you
And I thought this time I'd say somethin' new

Ohh right, yeah!!
I'll call you, I swear
So next time, be there
Can't keep up, no more 
She'll quit but, want more

'Cause I want you, and you want me too
And you need this, while I give it to you
And I thought this time I'd do somethin' new

Its not cool, I do like you
And want you to feel, that I doo-doo doo-doo 
Bah-da-bah bah-da-bah bah-da-bah ahhhhh owwww!

Yeah yeah!!
But I want you, and you want me too
And you need this, while I give it to you
And I thought this time I'd meet someone true

And I want you, and you want me too
And you need this, while I give it to you
And I thought this time I'd say somethin' new!
