Love sensation (repeat)
Love sensation (repeat)
Got me burning up with your love sensation

Love sensation oh it's a spell
It's such a good vibration
A feeling that I know so well
And when you hold me close
It's so so nice
And you got me burning up with your love sensation
Love sensation (repeat)
Love sensation (repeat)
Got me burning up with your love sensation
Love sensation (repeat)
Love sensation (repeat)

Sweet sensation I can't find the words to explain
Such a hot temptation
You just walk right in and take me away

...when I'm feeling mine
And all I wanna say is thank you baby
Cause you're right on time
Can't you see that I love nobody else
Can't you see that I love nobody else
And time won't take my love away
Let me tell you
Let me tell you
Let me tell you

You get down
You get down
You get down to the nitty gritty
You're the only one that could fill me
Fill me with my love...
You make me feel so good so good
I wanna say yes to love sensation
I wanna say yes to your love sensation baby
I wanna say I wanna say baby
Tell me now

Can't you see that I love nobody else
Can't you see that I love nobody else
And time won't take my love away
Time won't take it
Time won't take it
Time don't take it away
