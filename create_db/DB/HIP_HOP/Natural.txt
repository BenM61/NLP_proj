I'm checking you out, you're all alone
No one is clocking you, but I'm scoping you
Staring right through you, staring into you
Your beauty is endless and I'm hoping to explore
Brothers may say you're ugly but I disagree
But in a way that's fine with me
'Cause I want to travel with you
Travel in your mind 'cause you seem like a virgin
Free as the wind blows, tall as a tree grows
Wild like nature, yet calm as a field
Hair is natural, lips are natural
Face wins first place, you appeal to me, girl
Let me ask you for some time
For you to unwind together et cetera
I have nothing but pure intentions
Everything we'll be will be natural

Natural 

I'd like to hold your waist as we chase
The wind down the shores of a southern ocean
Rub my fingers through your hair
Slowly rub and caress your forehead and bare
Our problems, as we lay on the bed called Earth
Holding hands 'till we touch each and every finger
As the ocean water wets us both
In the center of the crossroads
Spiritual bonds are connected 
What an erection
Well Let's drive to the city
And walk among the lights of the city streets
You're making me weak and it's scary
'Cause you've played no games
All you've been is very natural
That's why I'm scared to fall in love with you

Natural 

I want to be natural
I want to be sleeping in you
I want to be inside you

I want to be sleeping deep in you 
I want to be in you

Natural
