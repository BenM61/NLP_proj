I'm not waiting for an answer
I've had enough of this
I've been channeling my anger
And I'm scared I'm going to miss
Your excuses are ten to the pound
Your perfume makes me sick
Took forever but I figured out
You're a fucking lunatic

When you're lonely, then you phone me
Have a bad time, all of the time
I slam the phone down, you're on your own now
Give it a rest, you're out of your mind

Goodbye ex girlfriend
And don't come back again
I can't pretend, I'm going to have to end it now
Get out you cow
Don't turn around, I need a holiday
I never loved you anyway

My friends told me to be careful
Who I hang around
I'm not sorry or ungrateful, not to put you down
Now you've stolen all of my CD's 
But baby that's okay
Cause I got them all on mp3's
And I didn't have to pay

When you're lonely, then you phone me
Have a bad time, all of the time
I slam the phone down, you're on your own now
Give it a rest, you're out of your mind

Goodbye ex girlfriend
And don't come back again
I can't pretend, I'm going to have to end it now
Get out you cow
Don't turn around, I need a holiday
I never loved you anyway

Been patient with you, so listen when I say
Just face it we're through, time to walk away
I don't want to, I don't want to
Waste another day

When you're lonely, then you phone me
Have a bad time, all of the time
I slam the phone down, you're on your own now
Give it a rest, you're out of your mind

Goodbye ex girlfriend
And don't come back again
I can't pretend, I'm going to have to end it now
Get out you cow
Don't turn around, I need a holiday
I never loved you anyway
