Love can be so cold
And loneliness gets old
More than words or broken promises
I want to show you what true love is

I'm always there for you
I'll always stand by you
When the world has closed the door
And you can't go on anymore
I'm always there for you

You've been hurt before
And you don't want anymore
There's a better way for you
Believe in me, I'll see you through

I'm always there for you
I'll always stand by you
When the world has closed the door
And you can't go on anymore
I'm always there for you
