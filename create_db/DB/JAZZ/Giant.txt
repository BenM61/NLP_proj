Skies hang heavy and they gather in the field of view
Lift them higher so they're never hanging over you
Carry the load, with all your might
It's sinking though you'll be alright
Coming down
Reach a plateau, but you're feeling like you just begun
In the shadow of the heaven that you're holding on
Nervous or something, birds are bright
Cut all the lights, lit up the night
What a sight
Looking over on the city that you once belonged
Shrug your shoulders at the people who have done you wrong
Walking about the crowded street
The ones you love ten thousand feet below
Take the throne back, now we're singing the same old song
Hold the throne now, 'cause you never loved to move along
Never give up all through the years
It's plain to see, straight through the tears your mistakes

Holding the sky and the earth
Looking down to the worms
Way below, standing tall giant

We'll be closer when you turn the world upon its head
Hand it over and I'll carry it along instead
Show me your hands so I can see
I'll understand more easily all the time
Break the silence if we think it's turning into sound
Close the circle, when you're finished, tell me what you found
Carry the load, with all your might
It's sinking though you'll be alright, coming down

Holding the sky and the earth
Looking down to the worms
Way below, standing tall giant

Hand me the weight from above
Feel it falling away
Letting go of it all giant

Take it back now, do you really wanna take it to the start
Looking back now, did you ever really wanna play a part?
Take it back now, do you really wanna take it to the start
Looking back now, did you ever really wanna play a part?
Take it back now, do you really wanna take it to the start
Looking back now, did you ever really wanna play a part?
Take it back now, do you really wanna take it to the start
Looking back now, did you ever really wanna play a part?
