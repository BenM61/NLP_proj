Your blazing sun turned into long cold sweats
After all you've done, I'm not over you yet
I know your heart is out the door
Let me grab my feelings from the floor
With everything said
And I'll get over you yet
I'm just playing

Oh baby
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just please come back
I'm begging baby boy
It don't have to be like that
We don't have to be like that
You don't have to be like that, whoa oh

I can't believe we're through, packed bags
A lot of broken glass - what a drag
Used to love the sight of you
Now I can't stand the sight of you, whoa oh

I can't believe you're gone, I'm so hurt
All the love we had, blank stare like you forgot
I used to love the sight of you
Now I can't stand the sight of you

Can't believe we're through

That amazing smile has been lost for a while
Now everything's a mess, still not one regret
And that heart of gold
When I ask where it's gone, you say "I don't know"
Hey I'm not finished yet
You are my biggest regret
Stop playing

Oh baby
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just please come back
I'm begging baby boy
It don't have to be like that
We don't have to be like that
You don't have to be like that, whoa

I can't believe you're gone, I'm so hurt
All the love we had, blank stare like you forgot
I used to love the sight of you
Now I can't stand the sight of you

Can't believe we're through

I can't believe it's over baby
The journey in my heart is killing me
Breaking me unfaithfully
The sight is burning my eyes
I thought you would be forever babe
But forever has turned to never babe
How did something good go so bad, so quick, so fast to end just like that?
The end
