You saw this coming like a freight train
You other fuckers saw the writing on the wall
We were the bottom of the food chain
We never said we loved each other after all

Lethal injections and electric chairs
A thousand ways to die
We don't care
We're just here for our crucifixion

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

Even the angels wanna cry
'Cause all bad things must die

So here we are, beat up and bloodied
We fought each other for the good up to the top
And I said, "oh man, a little Lee's way
Let's pull the plug on this before he starts to rot"

Execution by a hangman's noose
A thousand ways to die, but you can choose
We're just here for our crucifixion

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

It's been one hell of a ride, it's been one hell of a night
It's been a dam good life, this ain't farewell, it's goodbye
It's been one hell of a ride

(All bad things
We don't care
All bad things)

All bad things must end, all bad things must die
Even the devil's gotta pay for his crime
All bad things must end, all bad things must die

It's been one hell of a ride, it's been one hell of a night
It's been a damn good life, this ain't farewell, it's goodbye
It's been one hell of a ride, it's been one hell of a night
It's been a damn good life, this ain't farewell, it's goodbye
It's been a hell of a ride

All bad things must die
