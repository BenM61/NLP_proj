Come on baby and be my guest
Come join the party and meet the rest
Everything is gonna be all right
So be my guest tonight

We're gonna dance to the rock 'n' roll
We're gonna even do the stroll
We're gonna Lindy Hop and Suzy Q
It's a special party just for you

My, my-oh-mine, gee you're so fine
Don't let me down
I'm the king but you can wear my crown
I'm gonna sing, my band gonna play
I'm gonna make you queen for a day
Everything is gonna be all right
So be my guest tonight
