You'll pray and you'll save
With one foot in the grave
You'll sink or you'll swim
But the bank will always win
'Cause
This world spins but not for you
And all of their lies have become true
And I see a light, but behind there
is the night
This world spins but not for you
You'll beg and you'll crawl
With your back to the wall
You'll hope and you'll obey
But it will always end this way
