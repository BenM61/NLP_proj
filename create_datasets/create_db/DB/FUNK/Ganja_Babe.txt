I want to make it slow
Sensemille
I want to make it slow
Make me feel ya

Heavy medicine
ya see my eyes are feeling red again
I'm bringin' light
like Thomas funky Edison
been in the desert for forty seven days
Purple Haze
the poison that I tasted never changed
turn up the woofers so I can feel the beat
vibrate my belly like a bomb in harmony
summer heat
my back is sticking to me to the seat
bare feet
tank top and shorts is all ya need
summer breeze
I'm feelin' kinda fine
I'm rollin with my shorty all the time
wind and grind lovely shake your behind
cinnamon skin be bringing sin to my mind
but whether or not the weather's hot
or the weather's cold
I'm wrapping her like a blanket with my whole soul
so that she can feel me
like Coca Cola I'm the woo-o-oh oh the sweet thing
my girl lollipop she growing mad crops
she rollin' herbs everyday
at about 4 o' clock
tick tock
strike the hammer while the Iron's hot
ooh girl watcha got cooking in the pot
see Mary Mary quite contrary
how does your garden grow?
Hydrophonic ultra supersonic
or does it grow naturally slow?

(Chorus)
Ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
I love tha way ya love me and the way ya misbehavin'
ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
come wake body-ody take my mind away

Everybody get down and do the boogaloo
just like the cover of I want you
yoo hooo look watcha gonna do
watcha gonna do when the rent comes due
round up the posse and call up the crew
5 bucks at the door and ya bring ya own booze
call ya neighbor 'cause they can come too
be sure and bring ya records 'cause I only got a few
so baa baa black sheep have you any wool
yes sir, yes sir a nickle bagful
one for my partner one for my crew
some for my ganja baby she needs 2
'cause just like me they want to be... cool

(Chorus)
