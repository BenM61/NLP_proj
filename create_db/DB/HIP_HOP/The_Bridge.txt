Ladies and Gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour and they want to tell you a little story
about where they come from

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

You love to hear the story again and again 
of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in

Dimples be the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me 
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn 
Out
By any place any part of the world
And while i'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
When she's in

The Bridge(scratched) (8X)
Queensbridge

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine
And i'm from

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)

Keep on rockin 
The bridge
Will keep rockin
If the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep rockin
If the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the bridge stop rockin
The kids will keep-a rockin
When the bridge stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
If the kids stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep rockin
