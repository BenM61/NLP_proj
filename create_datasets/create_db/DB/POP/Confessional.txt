Listening fort he sweetness
Buried in your silent treatment
How many walls did I face
You're allergic to change
And I wanna say something
Then I'll leave you
To take your way
Of loving to the grave

Sometimes, when you're hurting
The hurt is blinding
Who decides when something's
Not worth saving

We've always had a place to hide
So being here, just you and I
Feels like a confessional
I'm bound to say
How I feel and I can't lie
Cause it was so beautiful
It used to feel so natural
If I'm telling the truth tonight
I'm looking for a way of saying goodbye

Took a wrong turning somewhere
Burned the bridges
That would take us back there

Pretending to be something
That we're not
Could never put my finger on it
But maybe if we're being honest
I want what we had
Not what we've got

Sometimes, when you're hurting
The hurt is blinding
But if you stop looking
How're you gonna find it again?

We've always had a place to hide
So being here, just you and I
Feels like a confessional
I'm bound to say
How I feel and I can't lie
Cause it was so beautiful
It used to feel so natural
If I'm telling the truth tonight
I'm looking for a way of saying goodbye

If I'm telling the truth tonight
I'm looking for a way of saying goodbye
