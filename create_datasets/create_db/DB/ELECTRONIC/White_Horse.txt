Let's fall into the night
Let us ride on this white horse
Until the light fades
I'll call up all the right dealers
Life wheedlers fright stealers
Play with the danger of romance

There's a place to go just know you will not return
No time to deny
There's a land to burn out everything that you've learned
Never land of lies

Let me see you dance
Let me see you move
Put me in a trance
Show me you can groove
I know I've lost my memory
Although I've lost my memory
Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance

Let's roll deeper tonight
Take a flight on the right course
I'll be your night shades
Yes my people you might
Fuel the fight for the hype lords
With a new range of emotions

There's a space you know
Where you let go of concerns
Throw them to the sea
There you make up for home
And other places you turn
Turn to for your needs

Let me see you dance
Let me see you move
Put me in a trance
Show me you can groove
I know I've lost my memory
Although I've lost my memory
Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
