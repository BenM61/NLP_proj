Wake me up when
The party's over
It seems I've had too much wine

Please remember
to remind me
If I had a good time

Was I friendly?
Or was I bragging?
And did I start to bore you?

Was I charming?
Or was I absent?
Did I even say goodnight?

Fill me up lets take a ride
From your mouth into my mind
'Cause I grow weary from this trip I'm on, Yeah
And the ride keeps getting longer

And in morning
I'll be hungover with my face into the phone
Please forgive here on after
By the way how'd I get home?

Was I laughing?
Was I choking?
And did I start to annoy you?

Was I sleazy?
Or was I dazzling?
Did I even say goodbye?

Fill me up lets take a ride
From your mouth into my mind
'Cause I grow weary from this trip I'm on, Yeah
And the ride keeps getting longer

Fill me up lets take a ride
From your mouth into my mind
'Cause I grow weary from this trip I'm on, Yeah
And the ride keeps getting longer

So wake me up when the party's over
I seems I've had too much wine
