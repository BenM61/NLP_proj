Frosty mug to washtub Robbie
Cold ones to Nancy and Winnie

Yo could I get a cold beverage
I need some leverage
It's sunny outside
Some lemonade would be nice
Or a sprite through the drive through
At b.k. yo I'll buy girl a drink
But girls got to pay
On the front porch I got
Some iced tea
If you like a taste of tea
Then come along with me
It's martini time
Yeah yeah feeling golden
Bring your own beverage
Just make sure it's cold

I like cold beverage
Give me frosty mug
Filled with a&w
If you got ice cream
Make it a double scoop
Milkshake at the fountain
Really good sounding
Chocolate egg cream

Yo, I'm champ cherry pounding
Caught a chill vibe
Orange juice in my ride
Wawa's to the right
They got a beverage inside
Dig me a hot coffee
Fill it up with ice
Watermelons like drink
Please fix me a large slice
Summertime is cool the heat is getting old
Yeah I'll get a beverage
Just make sure it's cold

I like cold beverage
When I'm fishing
Let's keep one thing clear
The baits over there
The brews right here
Two six packs and a big bag of ice
Didn't even catch a bite
But the brew tasted nice
Back to the bar
Strawberry daiquiris and a colada
I need a whole lotta them
Fruit drinks to catch me a buzz
I must tell you I'm the
Cool aid kid
Before you serve my drink
Please stick it in the fridge
