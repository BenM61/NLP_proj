Made his way out from the low lands
The son of a preacher man
Then he seemed to lose direction
On his way to the promised land, no no

It started with a woman
And it ended in a bottle fight
The jury would not forgive him
When he took a man within an inch of his life

When they took away his freedom
Buried his soul aside, no no

In the company of strangers
You find the enemy within, no
And the walls that capture evil
Keep the faith from getting in
In the company of strangers

So he sits behind these gray walls
Staring at the yellow moon
His dreams lie shattered all around him
Casting shadows into his room, baby

When they took away his freedom
They buried his soul aside, no no

In the company of strangers
You find the enemy within, no
And the walls that capture evil
Keep the faith from getting in
In the company of strangers

So the years passed by one day
Steps outside to the blinding sun
No money in his pockets, and his clothes out of damn
But under his shirt he wears a gun, no no

When they buried him the very next morning
For other that went wrong
In a graveyard full of outlaws
In a stranger's everyone

In the company of strangers
You find the enemy within, no, no
And the walls that capture evil
Keep the faith from getting in

In the company of strangers
You find the enemy within
And the walls that capture evil
Keep the faith from getting in

In the company, in the company of strangers
Listen, I've gotta get out of here, 
I've gotta get out of here
