They say a fool never learns, 
You agree, I'm not superstitious, 
You know unlucky as I've been I'm still around. 
And you can tell me to go, 
I've been reading your true confessions, 
But then you don't believe I'd let this chance go by. 
  
Show me inside, 
Sorry that I've been so far away, 
You know I'm only human, 
It's the call of the wild, 
It's the law of the jungle, 
Don't say no. 
  
Want to be with you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
Give a little bit to you, won't you stay with me, stay. 
Pulling me to you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
It'll be forever if you stay with me, stay with me, stay. 
  
As long as time will allow, you'll be losing your inhibitions. 
One night is not enough for all the love to grow. 
And, baby, you and I rule the world, 
Maybe I could be your magician, 
Just give me long enough 
My spell will hypnotize. 
  
Show me inside, 
Live in every corner of your heart. 
You know I'm only human, 
It's the call of the wild, 
It's the law of the jungle, 
Don't say no. 
  
Want to be with you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
Give a little bit to you, won't you stay with me, stay. 
Pulling me to you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
It'll be forever if you stay with me, stay with me, stay. 
Stay with me overnight, stay. 
  
Stay with me overnight, stay. 
Stay with me overnight, stay. 
Stay with me, stay. 
Stay with me, stay. 
Stay with me, stay. 
  
Want to be with you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
Give a little bit to you, won't you stay with me, stay. 
Pulling me to you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
It'll be forever if you stay with me, stay with me, stay. 
  
Want to be with you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
Give a little bit to you, won't you stay with me, stay. 
Pulling me to you, won't you stay with me overnight. 
It'll be forever if you stay with me, stay with me, stay.
