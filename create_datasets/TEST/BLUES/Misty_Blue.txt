Our guardian star lost all his glow 
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said, "no" 
And his silver turned to blue
Like him I am doubtful that our love is true
But if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mister Blue
I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call and I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister
I won't tell you 
While you paint the town 
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mister Blue
Call me Mister Blue
