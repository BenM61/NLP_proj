Yea I keep dreaming
But I have it all
Oh I'm still craving
To have you by my side

I know our love is fading
But soon it will shine

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong
And I will live today
And I will love tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if its going wrong

Even if its going wrong
Even if its going wrong
You're burning out my head

I keep searching
Forever in your eyes
I'll be careful
But soon we will shine

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong

Even if its going wrong 
Even if its going wrong
You're burning out my head

Even if its going wrong

(x3)
You're burning out my head
And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow

You're burning out my head

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong
