Uh huh
Baby
Uh huh, uh
Said it's goin' on tonight
Yo, see yo, uh huh, ya'll know what it is
We 'bout to do it real big, yo
So So Def
Off the heezy

[Chorus]
You off the heezy
The way you walk
I'm tryin' to sample that tonight
Off the heezy
We can do it real big, baby
Would that be alright
Off the heezy
If you was my boo 
You could do whatever you want to
I don't want to try to hold you down
I just want to get it started

Tyrese

[Tyrese]
All night long it's been hard for me to pay attention
To what me and my peoples are doing, eh
It's not often that I'm in this position
Though I've seen a lot, but not this hot
Girl, you've got me crazy

[Chorus]

Usually I don't pay no mind to girls this way
Me neither
But honey ain't your average little mommy
Oh

[Tyrese]
Just tryin' to find the right thing to say
Something tells me that if you and I got it poppin'
Girl, it won't be no stoppin'
It'll be one thing after the other

[JD]	
This is the part I like right here

[Tyrese]
Where've you been
What I gotta do to see you again
Are the first words that came into my mind
I never met nobody as bad as you (That's right)
Who ain't got no attitude
That's what makes the situation, for sure

[JD]
Uh-oh
It's that cat from the south
Everybody just can't stop talkin' about
Lips stay poked out cause I cannot lose
Every record I make, I got something to prove
It's a man's world, so don't even trip real big
Y'all know how I do this shit
And I'm the truth like a California bag of trees
From ATL to Watts nigga, off the heez'

[Chorus: x2]

I want to get it started oh
