She's like a dragonfly with no fire 
Laughing us with no intent to bound 
She's like a horse with no rider
All the space without the chase search within 
She's like a seat with no waste 
All the drift upon the shiver way 

Even the light of a silvery moon 
Laugh at the life that's inside of you 
Send in shadows under the trees 
Bout to the wind who's voice

She's in the wolf with no people 
All the scope without the whole holy up 
She's like a dragonfly with no fire 
Laughing us with no intent of bound
