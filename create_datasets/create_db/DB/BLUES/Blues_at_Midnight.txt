When that midnight hour went chiming,
I was in my room alone
Yes, when that midnight hour went chiming,
I was in my room alone
Yes, and when I came home this evening,
I found my baby gone

Oh, I laid my head on my pillow,
I gazed up at the stars up above
Yes, I laid my head on my pillow,
Yes, lookin' up at the stars above
I tell you it's a miserable feeling,
Oh, when you lose the one you love

Oh, I get the blues at midnight,
Oh there's one thing I can't describe
Oh, I get the blues at midnight,
Oh there's one thing I can't describe
Yes, and when you look at your baby's picture
Oh, the tears will come from your eyes
