You want the world to buy your happiness
Ain't it a shame you have to hurt the ones you love
Never giving yourself taking all that you can get
But you don't take nothing with you except your soul

I'm so tired of hearing that I'm wrong
Everyone laughs at me, why me?
I'm so tired of being pushed around
I feel like I've been betrayed

We take each other's love, forget to give back
Isn't it a pity, how we break each other's hearts
I know we're only human and not to blame
But who the hell are you to cause so much pain

I'm so tired of hearing that I'm wrong
Everyone laughs at me, why me?
I'm so tired of being pushed around
I feel like I've been betrayed

Why do you criticize me
What have I done to deserve such a fate
Why do you look at me that way
Because of all your tears your eyes can't hope to see
See that we are all the same
We are not perfect, just forgiven
Open your eyes and set yourself free
Before we are all victims of the insane
