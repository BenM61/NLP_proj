Uh,
Lets pull the two seater out baby
It's wherever you wanna go

Bobbin' to the music
This is how we do it, all night (all night)
Breezin' down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to the
Aston Martin music, music

Uh,
Would've came back for you
I just needed time,
To do what I had to do
Caught in the life,
I can't let it go
Whether that's right,
I won't ever know
Uh, but here goes nothing

When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the flo' but who can you call
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside, gettin' it in on the road
Lotta quiet time, pink bottles of Rose
Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold
Follwin' fundamentals, I'm followin' in a rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when you get it out of state
Need a new safe 'cause I'm runnin' out of space
Elroy Jetson, I'm somewhere outta space
In my two-seater, she the one that I will take

Bobbin' to the music
This is how we do it, all night (all night)
Breezin' down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to the
Aston Martin music, music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time,
To do what I had to do
Caught in the life,
I can't let it go
Whether that's right,
I won't ever know
Uh, but here goes nothing

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. K.F.C, V.V'S is in the watch
Livin' fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, ain't no coming back
Top down, right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we f*ck her soul take a hold of me
I dig her like pookie that pussy be contollin' me
That thang keep calling
F*ck maintain, boy I gotta keep ballin'!
Pink bottles keep comin'
James Bond coup pop-clutch, one hundred

Bobbin' to the music
This is how we do it, all night (all night)
Breezin' down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to the
Aston Martin music, music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time,
To do what I had to do
Caught in the life,
I can't let it go
Whether that's right,
I won't ever know
Uh, but here goes nothing

Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music (all night)
Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music
In our ride
Aston Martin music, music (all night)
Aston Martin music, music
In our ride
