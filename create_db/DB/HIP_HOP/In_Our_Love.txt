Fresh and real is the way you appeal to me
Please don't let it slip away
Cause I love you the way you are

In our love
In our love
Friendship first always
In our love
In our love
Spirit still remains everything

Love the things that you say
You make love in a special way
From the first until today
Can't let you escape
Cause I never wanna lose this feeling

In our love
In our love
Friendship first always
In our love
In our love
Spirit still remains everything

Rubbin' out waiting for a lover
Then you show and blow my cover
You're the one, you're the one

In our love
In our love
Friendship first always
In our love
In our love
Spirit still remains everything

I'm not afraid to commit to a brother
All I need is a sensitive lover
Strong is the pull like a magnet you come over
Seems to me we ought to stick together
You're the one, you're the one
