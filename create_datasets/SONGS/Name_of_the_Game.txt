Listen all you motherfuckers!
Listen all you motherfuckers!

That's the name of the game.
That's the name of the game.
That's the name of the game.
That's the name of the game.

Yo!
Top of the crown,
Rape the queen,
The fatal mistake in your cradle,
Can't shake the dreams of fire inside of your phonograph,
Battered with gas,
And give you room to breathe,
Through an adequate mask
Everybody in front,
Let me see ya pumpin' ya fists,
If you up in the back room,
When you rockin' with this.
Come on,
Keepin' ya speaker knockin',
Jumpin', bangin', bumpin', blazin',
Hot
Callin' all freaks,
Callin' all freaks now.
Yo, yo
Callin' all freaks,
Callin' all freaks now.

That's right
Callin' all freaks
Callin' all freaks
Callin' all freaks
Get em up in the back row
Get em up in the back row
I said get em up in the back room!

Motherfucker
Callin' all
Callin' all
Callin' all
Callin' all
Callin' all
