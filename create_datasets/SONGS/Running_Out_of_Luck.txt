Running out of luck, running out of speed
lucking for some loving, yes I got the need
Must have spent a fortune, but did I spend it well
If I wanted water, I got it from the well
Throwing out a whole life's low life's possessions
Throwing out a whole life's low life's possessions

Running out of heat, running out of gas
Running out of money, way too fast
Running out of liquor, there's nothing left to eat
Running out of luck, hungry for the meat
Running out of whole life's low life's possessions
Running out of luck, living with the loneliness
Running out of luck, heavy on the holiness
Take it easy with the emptiness
Running out of luck

Push it to the brink, you can take it to the edge
Fighting for survival, clinging to the ledge
You can strip me back to nothing, you never get me beat

Running out of luck, just running of heat
Running out of whole life's low life's possessions

Running out of whole life's low life's possessions
Running out of luck, living with the loneliness
Running out of luck, heavy on the holiness
Easy with the emptiness
Running out of luck
