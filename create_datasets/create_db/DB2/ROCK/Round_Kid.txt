Two lovers are havin' their fight again
They're tired of sayin' goodbye
Standin' on the beach side
Listenin' to the feet of the passers
On the sidewalk there

Don't make me part of your life again
'Cause I'm tired of sayin' goodbye
Ridin' on my skateboard
Knockin' all the pretty boys in my way

'Cause I'm just a round kid
Causing mass hysteria
And I know something nobody knows

Just a round kid
Causing mass hysteria
And I know something nobody knows

You ask me if I'm real or not
But what is real or not
Am I completely right
Or am I just lost and misguided?

There is somethin' you oughta know
What is real or not
That there is nothin' wrong
So don't tell me I need any counselin'

I'm just a round kid
Causing mass hysteria
And I know something nobody knows

I'm just a round kid
Causing mass hysteria
And I know something nobody knows
Nobody knows

Bring it on

Just a round kid, just a round kid
I'm just a round kid, just a round kid
Just a round kid, just a round kid

Two lovers are havin' their fight again
They're tired of saying goodbye
Standin' on the beach side
Listenin' to the feet of the passers
On the sidewalk there

Don't make me part of your life again
'Cause I'm tired of saying goodbye
I'll be ridin' on my skateboard
Knockin' all the pretty boys in my way

'Cause I'm just a round kid
Causing mass hysteria
And I know something nobody knows

'Cause I'm just a round fucking kid
Causing mass hysteria
And I know something nobody knows

Body knows, body knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody knows
