We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
"Life is around you and in you"
Answer for Timothy Leary, deary

The sun shine in
 
Let the sun shine
Let The sunshine in
The sun shine in
 
Let the sun shine
Let The sunshine in
