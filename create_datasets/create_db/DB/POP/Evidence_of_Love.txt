When I look for the love
In your eyes you turn away
And there's nothing as loud
As the words we never say

Look at us now, standing on the edge again
Look at us now, it's not too late to try again
I need some

Evidence of love, to keep me going
Show me some evidence of love
And I'll be here

I still believe we can see this through
There's just so much, that I can do
It doesn't make sense
Without some evidence of love

There's a cold, cold look on your face
Is it saying good-bye?
'Cause there's nothing as cold
As the ashes when the fire has died

Talk to me now, tell me what you're missing
Talk to me now, I'll try and find your heart again
I need some

Evidence of love, to keep me going on
Please show me some evidence of love
And I'll be here

I still believe we can see this through
But there's only so much, that I can do
It doesn't make sense
Without some evidence of love

Stand and fight
Try to say what's on your mind, baby
So much is on the line
Here's your chance to make it right

Look at us now, standing on the edge again
Look at us now, it's not too late to try again
I need some

Evidence of love, to keep me going on
Yeah, please show me some evidence of love
And I'll be here

I believe we can see this through
But there's only so much, that I can do
It doesn't make sense
Without some evidence of love

Evidence of love
No, it doesn't make sense
Without some evidence of love
Evidence of love
No, it doesn't make sense
Without some evidence of love

Evidence of love
No, doesn't make sense
Without some evidence of love
Evidence of love
It just doesn't make sense
Without some evidence of love

Evidence of love
Oh, no
Without some evidence of love
Evidence of love
