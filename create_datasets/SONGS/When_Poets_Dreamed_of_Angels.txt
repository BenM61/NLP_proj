She rises early from bed
Runs to the mirror
The bruises inflicted in moments of fury

He kneels beside her once more
Whispers a promise
"Next time I'll break every bone in your body"

And the well-wishers let the devil in
And if the river ran dry they'd deny it happening

As the card players deal their hands
From the bottom of te deck
Row upon row of feudal houses blown away
Medicine for the popular complaint

When the poets dreamed of angels
What did they see?
History lined up in a flash at their backs

When the poets dreamed of angels
What did they see?
The bishops and knights well placed to attack
