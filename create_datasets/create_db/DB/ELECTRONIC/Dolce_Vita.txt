We're walking like in a dolce vita
This time we got it right
We're living like in a dolce vita
Mmm, gonna dream tonight
We're dancing like in a dolce vita
With lights and music on
Our love is made in the dolce vita
Nobody else than you

It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me now

We made it down in the dolce vita
Wipe all your fears away
We'll live it like in a dolce vita
A game of yesterday
I'm so alone in a dolce vita
Oh baby, telephone
This magic's gone in a dolce vita
Nobody else than you

It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me

It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me now

We're walking like in a dolce vita
Mmm, gonna dream tonight
We're dancing like in a dolce vita
Nobody else than you

It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now
Say you're gonna love me

It's our last night together with our love again
Another light before we drown in darkness
