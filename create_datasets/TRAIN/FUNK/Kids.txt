Now we're getting nasty.

Everybody's talking about the kids
The kids got funky soul and groove emotion
But if you don't give the kids the chance to use it
They're always more than likely to abuse it
Everybody's talking about the kids
It's taking time for you to realize
Now hunger turns to anger in our eyes
I say the revolution will be televised
Yes it will, Gil
Everybody's talking about the kids
The kids needs space to get their heads in place
And every day this world we have to face
I just can't seem to find my proper place.

Kids get down
Stormy weather
Fifteen years of royal pleasure
Kids get down underground
Everybody dance to the funky sound.

Everybody's talking about the kids
It won't be long before we get our own
And every kid can truly feel at home
I told ya you should give the dog a bone
Everybody's talking about school
But I get more pleasure breakin' all the rules
Cos lesson one begins with "Life Is Cruel"
Well I guess I'm just an educated fool
Everybody's talking about the kids
Mom and Dad make efforts to excuse it
Government officials will confuse it
Members of the bench will try to prove it
You're going down sucker.

Everybody's talking about the kids now
Everybody's talking about the kids now
The kids got funky soul.

Kids get down
Stormy weather
Fifteen years of royal pleasure
Kids get down, celebrate
Now we're going to kick the thing we hate
Everybody's talking about high
But kids get high to satisfy
For reaching out to touch the sky
Is all I can identify, and you know why.

Kids get down
Stormy weather
Fifteen years of royal pleasure
Kids get down, celebrate
Now we're gonna kick the thing we hate
Kids get down, pressurized
To live the life that you devised
Kids get, celebrate
Life's too short to complicate
