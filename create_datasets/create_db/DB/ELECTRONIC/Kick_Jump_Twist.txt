Kick the shoes off fast now
They're going insane
All the kids on the block, yeah
They want that fame
Twisting like a cab now
They're loving their pain
Jumping burning high, yeah
Practiced alone for days

They want all the invisible eyes on them
They want all the invisible eyes

Now aren't you gonna do the dance for the camera
Dance for the shutterbug
Dance for your mama
Dance with a kick jump twist
Kick jump twist

Sway into the sequence
Oh but they look good, yeah
Mascara dripping slow down
Oh but they turning your way

Dance for the camera
Dance for the shutterbug
Dance for your mama
Dance with a kick jump twist
Kick jump twist

But what if they call you?
Then you'll go away
The highway, an airport
Everyday
You don't care, you're moving anyway
Everyday
Kick jump twist
Kick jump twist

Kick for your mama
Kick for the shutterbug
Kick for the camera
Kick, jump, twist

They want all the invisible eyes on them
They want all the invisible eyes

They want all the invisible eyes on them
They want all the invisible eyes

Now aren't you gonna do the dance for the camera
Dance for the shutterbug
Dance for your mama
Dance the kick jump twist

Kick jump twist
Kick jump twist
