One life, and you're on your own, and you don't ever find a way back home
One road and you travel alone, you keep on even when your hope is gone
Now somethin' touches you with a different rhythm
But all your life, you've been playin'a part
And nothin's gonna make you have a change of heart.

Change of heart. 
Change of heart.
Change of heart. 
Change of heart.

A worried mind, and a heart full of pain, you drag it around just like a ball and chain
It doesn't matter where you go, there's no runnin' away from everything you know
The writing's on the wall, but still you won't surrender
You won't give up, you won't make a start
And nothin's gonna make you have a change of heart.

Change of heart. 
Change of heart.
Change of heart. 
Change of heart.

Rain clouds blowin' away, taking you back again to yesterday
Bad moon on the rise, now you're runnin' out of alibis
But somethin' touches you, with a different rhythm
All your life, you've been playin'a part
And nothin's gonna make you have a change of heart.

Change of heart. 
Change of heart.
Don't let this cold world tear you apart.
