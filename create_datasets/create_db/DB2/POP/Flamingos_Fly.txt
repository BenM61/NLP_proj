You lay by my side in the still of the night 
Let morning bring forth, all that's wondrous, wondrous to light 
You could have made it, made it more plain 
When I hear that, hear that soft refrain 
And I hear you gently sigh 

I want to take you where flamingos fly 
(Flamingos fly) 
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky, 
That's where flamingos fly 

As we lie in the dark and hear the sweet song of the nightingale 
And we listen for the lark, and I want to tell you babe, tell you a 
tale 
With the soft wind blowin', blowin' outside 
Hey I want to take that moonlight ride 
And I hear you gently sigh, babe 

I want to take you where flamingos fly 
(Flamingos fly) 
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky, 
That's where flamingos fly 

And I'm silently waiting 
For that morning light to shine 
And I'm looking at you, lookin' at me, and I'm lookin' at you 
And I'm anticipating with each and every sign 
Yes, I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at me, 
Lookin' at you, lookin' at me, lookin' back at you 

And I'm findin' that road 
That road that will take me, take me back home to you baby 
And I'll carry the load where the deer and angels roam 
Where happiness touches, touches the now 
I don't where it came from, I don't how, and I, 
And I hear you gently sigh, babe 

I want to take you where flamingos fly 
(Flamingos fly) 
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky, 
That's where flamingos fly 

I want to take you where flamingos fly 
(Flamingos fly) 
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky, 
That's where flamingos fly
