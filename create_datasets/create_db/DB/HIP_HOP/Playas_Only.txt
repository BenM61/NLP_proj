"I hope y'all got y'all playa's card cause y'all ain't getting in unless ya do
Its Kell's y'all still got the world surrounded for the non-believers"

Bounce, it's the new 12 play
Bounce though the pussy like L-way
Bounce, I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce when you hear are Kelly say

[Chorus]
Playa's only where them chicks be checking their bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take um from here to the private parties where there ain't nothing but
Playa's only where the playa's be spinning a lot of dough
Honies got ass bouncing on the floor
This is how we behind the playa's door

(She on the floor) surrounded by them playa's and thugs
(She on the floor) the girls gone wild in the clubs
(In V.I.P.) Got dough with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shaking ass just throwing 'em up
I'd really like to get to know her the way she warms her
Body up now she heated got me heated up
I can find I really wanna beat it up
So her how I hit the bottle and spend it up
You don't gotta worry bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club bouncing our domes
Got that red coupe matching the chrome
Put that body in motion motion
And watch it wave like ocean ocean
Now break it down and worm it worm it
Now bring it up and shake it shake it

[Chorus]

I'm still fresh like uh impala uh
Dre's young guns still riding the base drums (Chi)
Four times platinum hate it or love it I'm still number one
Still in the hood one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches cum
I mean the one with the ring and the tongue
Compton uh Kelly found her in the slums
Shaking that rump both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me I'll have your girl yelling 
Kell's my bitch drunk but until girlfriend still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and are been around the world and we'll give it to you just how you like it girl

Girl you on a mission step in club shutting down competition
The way you walk it talk it switch it
And when the doors close handle your business
Now make your booty go
(boom boom boom boom) Break it down now
(boom boom boom boom) Bring it up now
(boom boom boom boom) Push it back girl
(boom boom boom boom) Now shake shake it shake it shake it
Out the club in the coupe to the mansion
We gone get bent up to the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl bump and grind it
We gone do it till we drop it until the part stop we gone keep it hot

[Chorus]

I like it when you flip that bump that roll that
Shake that drop that rope that make it go clap clap
I like it when you flip that bump that roll that
Shake that drop that rope that make it go clap clap

[Chorus]
