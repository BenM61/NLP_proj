I only knew you for a while
I never saw your smile
Till it was time to go
Time to go away (time to go away)

Sometimes its hard to recognise
But comes as a surprise
And its too late
It's just to late to stay (to late to stay)

We'll always be together
However far it seems (love never ends)
We'll always be together
Together in electric dreams

Because of the friendship that you gave
Has taught me to be brave
No matter where I go
I'll never find a better prize (find a better prize)

Though your miles and miles away
I see you everyday
I don't have to try
I just close my eyes
I close my eyes

We'll always be together
However far it seems (love never ends)
We'll always be together
Together in electric dreams
