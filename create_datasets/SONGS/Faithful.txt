You've been hanging out without your girlfriends
And they've been hanging out at all the clubs
And you've been making eyes at all their boyfriends
Have I complained? Not even once

So tell me how can you
Expect me to be cool
While you're playing silly games with my love
Darlin' I won't accept you
Putting blame on me
You know that I'm the innocent one

Now haven't I been faithful
Haven't I been true
But you're not even grateful
Hey, what's a guy to do

You've been talking to your ex-girlfriends
They're always calling you up on the phone
Yet you insist they really don't mean nothing
Then tell me why can't you just leave them alone

So tell me how can you
Expect me to be true
While you're playing silly games with my heart
Darlin' I won't accept you
Putting blame on me
You know that I'm the innocent one

Now haven't I been faithful
Haven't I been true
But you're not even grateful
Ooh, what's a girl to do

You've been talking to your ex-girlfriends
They're always calling you up on the phone
Yet you insist they really don't mean nothing
Then tell me why can't you just leave them alone

Girl, I'm giving all I have
Just to prove my love is cool

Boy, I'm giving all my love
So that you will know my love is true

Now haven't I been faithful
Haven't I been true
But you're not even grateful
Ooh, what's a girl to do (what's a guy to do)

Now haven't I been faithful
Haven't I been true
But you're not even grateful
Ooh, what's a girl to do (what's a guy gonna do)

Now haven't I been faithful
Haven't I been true
But you're not even grateful
Ooh, what's a girl to do (what is a guy to do)
