I'm so in love with you, please love me
Whatever else you do, just love me
Go your way and dance and play till dawn breaks though
If you'll just call up and say "I love you, just you"

You're all that I desire, love me
I'd die if you should tire, oh, of me, love me
I'll be kind and I won't mind if you're not near
If you'll only love me, dear

Love me
I'll be kind and I won't mind if you're not near
If you'll only love me, dear
