Feeling empty inside
Got a hole in my soul
That's ten feet wide
And I'm sinking deeper everyday

Seems like everybody I see
Is simply trying
To be redeemed
But the saviours
Are few and far between
People sing

Hey yeah what about us
A little salvation's what I'm thinking of
I need somebody to come and rescue me
A little salvation
A little salvation

Feeling lonely inside
Got a hole in my heart
That I can't hide
And it's getting deeper everyday

Feels like everybody and me
We're simply crying out
For some love
I need a little somebody
To come and set me free
People sing

Hey yeah what about us
A little salvation's what I'm thinking of
I need somebody to come and rescue me
A little salvation
A little salvation

Gimme gimme gimme
A quick fix
I need some now
I can't wait for the saints
To turn my fate around
You know hell and damnation's just
Salvation upside down

Would you help me
Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah

Hey yeah what about us
A little salvation's what I'm thinking of
I need somebody to come and rescue me
A little salvation

Hey yeah what about us
A little salvation's what I'm thinking of
I need somebody to come and rescue me
A little salvation
A little salvation
A little salvation
