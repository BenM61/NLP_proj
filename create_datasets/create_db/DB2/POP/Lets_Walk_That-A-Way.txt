Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home

Notice that we're coming to the crossroads
Should we turn to left or right?
Mother is a-rockin' and a-waitin'
But it's such a lovely night

Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home

Well, don't you think the valley road is shorter?
We could save about a mile
And now and then the short road can be longer
If you linger for a while

Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home

Can't you see the night is just beginning
And the moonlight weaves a spell
We can take the road among the daisies
You know daisies never tell

Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home

I got an awful lot of tender words to whisper
Little ol' words like 'I love you'
Everything you say is so convincing
Yes, that's what we ought to do

Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home
Leads to home
That-a-way only leads to home
