Across the morning sky, all the birds are leaving
How can they know that it's time to go
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I do not count the time

Who knows where time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
(Incomprehensible)

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Oh, but then you know that it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

Who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

But I am not alone as long as my love is near me
And I know it will be so until it's time to go
After the winter until the birds again return in spring
And I do not fear time

Who knows where time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
