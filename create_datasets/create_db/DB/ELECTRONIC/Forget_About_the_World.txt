You had to take the time
'Cause you had to make up your mind
You really didn't want to choose
But you had too much to lose
Time was passing by
Didn't have it on your side
Knew what you had to do
To win sometimes, you gotta lose

They tried to change your mind
Told you how to live your life
And they told stories
Stories that shouldn't be told

[Bridge]
It was you against the world
But you chose to hold on to your girl
You gotta believe that she's the one worth fighting for

[Chorus]
Forget about the world
And worry about the girl
Not what they say
Not what they say your future holds for you
Forget about the world
And worry about the girl
Not what they say
Not what they say the future holds for you

Had problems in the past
There's no use in looking back
The future holds so much for you
Go to the light, and pass on through

You had a stronger love
Outside forces weren't enough
Tried their best to tear apart
A love they hoped would never last

So they tried to change your mind
Told you how to live your life
And they told stories
Stories that shouldn't be told

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

You gotta hold on to what you want
What you've been fighting for
You gotta believe in it - hold on

Until you can fight no more
You gotta hold on
And you will see
See your destiny
Then you will know
Which way to go

[Chorus]
