Spoken:
This is all we need, to be free,
To understand, and find the answer
So let's do it now, let's do it right now

We've got to live together if we're gonna be free
We've got to find the answer right now
We've got to live together
We've got to see each other for whatever we are
We've got to solve the problem
Together
We've got to live together

Look at me, I'm the honest kind
When I say it, I mean it
I swear I need you all my life
All we need is sympathy, if we want to change our minds
This is no second thought, this is for all times
All my life

This has got to be forever
Whatever
Whatever's come, whatever's been,
It's livin' life for what we see
Promise not to lose our hope
We

We've got to live together if we're gonna be free
We've got to find the answer right now
We've got to live together
We've got to see each other for whatever we are
We've got to solve the problem, right now
We've got to live together
Live together

We're gonna give it all that we got
We'll believe it whether or not
Lovin' ourself and loving our hearts
Love is seein' all that we are
We're gonna do it, do it right now
Love is there, it's showin' us how
We can do it, we can live together

You don't need no reason to hold your head up high
A little pride so you can justify your whole life

This has got to be forever
Whatever
Whatever's come, whatever's been,
Livin' life for what we see
Promise not to lose our hope
We

We've got to live together if we're gonna be free
We've got to find the answer right now
We've got to live together
We've got to see each other for whatever we are
We've got to solve the problem
Together
We've got to live together

We've got to live together if we're gonna be free
We've got to find the answer right now
We've got to live together
We've got to see each other for whatever we are
We've got to solve the problem, right now
We've got to live together
Live together

We're gonna give it all that we got
We'll believe it whether or not
Lovin' ourself and loving our hearts
Love is seein' all that we are
We're gonna do it, do it right now
Love is there, it's showin' us how
We can do it, we can live together
