Ooh I remember those old love letters
Plagued with memories, I can't forget us
Trying to fight it, trying to hide it

Rekindled flames are not recommended
But it never went out boy, it never ended
Trying to fight it, trying to hide it
But your love it shines

In a cruel hard world
It's a miracle to find
Someone good, someone whose love it shines
Your love it shines

Here in this apartment with oh too many rooms
Pearls once meant something, they brought me only gloom
Trying to fight it, trying to hide it
Rekindled flames are not recommended
But it never went out boy, it never ended
Crime can fight it, lies can hide it
But your love it shines

In a cruel hard world
It's a miracle to find
Someone good, someone whose love it shines
Your love it shines

You'd better shine your love, shine your love, shine it up
You'd better shine your love, shine your love, shine it up

In a cruel hard world
It's a miracle to find
Someone good, someone whose love it shines
Your love it shines
