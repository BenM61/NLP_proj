Phos'phrous chimney burnin'
Modern-men's a-learnin'
Time and space a-turnin' 
Motor's engine churnin'
fac'trys no place for me boss man let me be 

Wind and wave all blowin'
Mountain 'n' sky showin'
Bee 'n;'' flower growin'
Boy 'n' girl are glowin'
Fac'trys no place for me boss man let me be 

Minds inside are goin'
Muscle 'n' bone are showin''
One thing sure are knowing (sure I'm) knowin'
Get a fire goin' 
Fac'trys no place for me boss man let me be boss man let me be boss man leave me be
