Now here I am
With this pain in my heart now
I got a sweet little woman
Took my heart and
She tore it apart

I tried not to show it
But it just ain't no use

It's just like holding on
To a hot rod now, baby
I can't turn it loose now

I just had a love attack
Lord, I just had a love attack

Now my love life was nothing
In fact, it was a blank
Until you came along, ooh wee
You put a little tiger in my tank

Can't you see you got me
Helpless right now, baby
Laid down on my back

You got me down, down, down
Down, down from a love attack

I've had the mumps and the measles
Lord, I had the whooping cough
I been down with double pneumonia
But I was able to shake it off

But you came along and
Knocked me flat on my back
Now you got me suffering
From a little love attack

I fell for you, baby
Baby, I fell for you
Just like a rock now

When you turned on your love
I was so weak, I just
Couldn't stand the shock now

You hit me just like lightning
Knocked me out of my chair
You got me down, baby
I'm down with a love attack

Can't you see you
Got me down right now
Down with a love attack

Got my mind messed up
I got a love attack now

I, I love you
I love you
