I see a shape in the crowd
I turn to know where you are
& all around me the stench of high density housing

The stereo's listening to me
I'm being watched by TV
And valium's all I have left since I ran out of coffee

Just because you don't remember
Doesn't mean that I'll forget you
Just because you don't remember
Doesn't mean that I'll forget you
Just because you don't remember
Doesn't mean that I'll forget you

I gave you all that I had
You kept your flag at half mast
I thought we were on the same train
But we're still at the station

I see a shape in the crowd
I need to know where you are
I'm lost & I'm found in the sweet stench
of high density housing

Just because you don't remember
Doesn't mean that I'll forget you
Just because you don't remember
Doesn't mean that I'll forget you
Just because you don't remember
Doesn't mean that I'll forget you

But I will tear it down to make you happy
Yeah I will tear it down to bring you back to me
And I will tear it down to make you happy, happy
Yeah I will tear it down, tear it down, tear it down
To bring you back to me

I see a shape in the crowd
I turn to know where you are

But I will tear it down to make you happy
Yeah I will tear it down to bring you back to me
And I will tear it down to make you happy, happy
Yeah I will tear it down, tear it down, tear it down
To bring you back to me

I see a shape in the crowd
