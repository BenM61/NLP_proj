There's a sink full of dishes
No juice in the fridge
I'm trying not to go out
I'm trying to stay in the house

And I think what am I doing
What am I doing?
I'm trying not to go out
On account of the drought

There's just a big drag going around
Last night I blew it
I played two games of pool and
I forgot my card, I left it at the bar

I dreamed that I went
To that Thai place with you
You know the one that we went to
Two nights before

Now there's just a big drag going around
And I don't know why
And I'm no good at pool
And you know it's true
That there's just a big drag going around
