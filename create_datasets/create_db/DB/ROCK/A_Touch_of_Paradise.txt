Flamingos walk, and sway in peace
Seeing this, it makes my troubles cease
The sun is hiding, leaving a pink scar
That stretches right across the sky
That's all we've seen so far
And all I do is look into your eyes

For that special touch of paradise
Just a touch, a touch of paradise
Just a special touch of paradise

You hold my hand, that's when we kiss
And it doesn't take long no, until I get the gist
Of this love that stretches out across the land
Where rainbows flash, as we're walking in the sand
And all I do is look into your eyes

A touch of spring, and autumn sweet
Well the trees vibrate when our eyes meet
And I think of all the love that we have been making
You touch my hand and I walk off shaking
And all I do is look into your eyes
