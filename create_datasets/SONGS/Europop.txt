Hello
What would you like to know?
What would you like to hear?
What if I just disappear inside myself?
Hello
What would you like to know?
Who would you like to see?
Who would you like me to be if not myself?

And the Europop (pop) makes me dizzy
And I just can't stop (stop) 'til it's finished
And I don't know what (what) you find funny
'Bout the Europop and the love of money

Hello
Where is it cool to go?
When is it cool to leave?
What is it cool to breathe inside myself?
Hello
Don't tell me what I already know
Don't show me what I've already seen
Don't take me where I've already been inside myself

Financial gain is a very pleasant thing
But the transitory pleasure that it brings
Counts for nothing
So
What is there left to know?
What is there left to say?
Nothing
And I thank God that you're aware
Oh thank God that you're aware
Of the earth and of the air
And of the girls making like they don't care
But they are blessed and you are cursed
With the conscience of a universe
Of the mind and of the soul
And reduction science digging itself a hole
And I thank God that you're aware
Oh thank your God that you're aware
It's taken time but I'll think you'll find
That everything is alright
