Need for correction
I stand with a gun in my hand
It's time for inspection
Wipe off the blood on ya hands

It's the new world
Time on my hands
It's the new world
Time to get out while you can

Need for attention
No room for the hate that I have
It's time for dissection
Cut open the chest
While it's planned
