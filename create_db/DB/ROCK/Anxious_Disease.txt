Lean my head outside my bedroom window
In solitude the dark recedes
I hear a scream outside my neighborhood
Could be mistaken for a dream
Tree's cover shadowed darkened ground
That cast a cover for these broken crowds
Its only Friday in my neighborhood
That gets you ready for the bitter truth

I cop a plea like an anxious disease
I'm not at home I'm at war on these streets
I cop a plea like an anxious disease
I'm not at home I'm at war on these streets

I became numb when I fractured my pride
Sweet Sally she became my one place to hide
Sedated party on my carousel
That gets you ready for your own private hell

I cop a plea like an anxious disease
I'm not at home I'm at war on these streets
I cop a plea like an anxious disease
I'm not at home I'm at war on these streets

I used to think I believed in myself
Everything fit into place
But the fortunes of your life rests on your mental health
And not the money - no, it's not the money
Not the money - no it's not the money

People package all kinds of love
It's a joke that ain't so funny
I made my hell with no help from above

And lots of money
Ya, just lots of money
Lots of money
Ya, just lots of money (alright)

It's hard to trust life when its packed full of lies
And everyone is a brand new surprise
They take, and take, and take, and take
And never give it back
Always keep me looking behind my back

I cop a plea like an anxious disease
I'm not at home I'm at war on these streets
I cop a plea like an anxious disease
I'm not at home I'm at war on these streets

Anxious disease - war on these streets
Anxious disease - war on these streets
