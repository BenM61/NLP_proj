I was lost
Lost on the bypass road
Could be worse
I could be turned to toad
Won't you take me back to my hometown?
Take me back before I break down

I say you please return me
Will you ever return me?
Will you ever return me?
Just like Frankie Fontaine
Just like Frankie Fontaine

I wonder what can I do?

I was found
Riding a unicorn
Could be worse
I could be backwards born
Won't you take me back to my hometown?
Take me back before I break down

Will you ever return me?
Will you ever return me?
Will you ever return me?
Just like Frankie Fontaine

I say you please return me
Will you ever return me?
Will you ever return me?
Just like Frankie Fontaine

I wonder what can I do?

Calm down and then leave me alone
Calm down and then leave me alone 
Calm down and then leave me alone 
Calm down and then leave me alone 

I say you please return me
Will you ever return me?
Will you ever return me?
Just like Frankie Fontaine
Just like Frankie Fontaine

I wonder what can I do?
