Tales from my head
Can't buy the book
No one's listening but I guess you could
Try whistling this
You say you're tired
Liquid as water

But you'll succumb now as I stroke your back
I'm the best that you know
And every time you think of me
I hope you think of true romance
And every time you want to leave
You give us both another chance

Warmest welcome
Violent stranger
He said come here as he pushed me down
Impossible to do
In high heels walking into walls
Ever wonder if you're here at all?
Try whistling this
And my words are ringing in you eyes

Drawing your attention to all the thing that you ignore
And if I can't be near you I would rather be adrift in space
And if the god deserts us now I'll turn this chapel into flames
And if someone tries to hurt you I would put myself in your place
