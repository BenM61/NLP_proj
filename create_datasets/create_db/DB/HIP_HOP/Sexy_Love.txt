(My sexy love)
(So sexy)

She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch and I erupt
Like a volcano and cover her with my love
Baby girl u make me say (oohoohooh)
And just can't think (of anything else I rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
Oh when we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
Mmmm baby girl u make me say (oohoohooh)

Sexy love
Girl the things u do (oh baby baby)
Keep me sprung
Keep me running back to u (ooh baby i)
Ooh I love
Making love to u
(Baby girl u know your my)

And just can't think (of anything else I rather do)
Than to hear u sing (sing my name the way you do)

Oh baby girl u make me say (oohoohooh)
