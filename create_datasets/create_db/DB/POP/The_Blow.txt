(Hey)! Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, 
Woah, oh-oh! 
(Hey)! Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.

Now our youth is over, 
That word it fills my bowl.
The pain has left me, 
Feeling alone, oh-oh, 
Alone, oh-oh.

Your love is like a gunshot, 
(Hey)! In a bloody show, 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.

I'll have another, 
(Hey)! I'm so addicted! 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.

(Blow, blow, blow, blow), 
(Blow, blow, blow).

Your words are bleeding, 
The ink is seeping through.
The stain has left me feeling, 
Alone, oh-oh, we are not alone.

Your love is like a gunshot, 
(Hey)! In a bloody show, 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.

I'll have another, 
(Hey)! I'm so addicted! 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.

Another echo, another ghost, 
Another day goes before you're home.
Another echo, another ghost, 
Another day goes before you're home.

Your love is like a gunshot, 
(Hey)! In a bloody show, 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.

I'll have another, 
(Hey)! I'm so addicted! 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.

Hey! We'll never know, 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.
Another day, (hey), another victim, 
Just keep on shooting, 
'Cause I can't feel the blow.

Just keep on shooting, (hey)! 
'Cause I can't feel the blow, (hey)! 
Just keep on shooting, (hey)! 
'Cause I can't feel the blow, (hey)! 

(Hey)!
