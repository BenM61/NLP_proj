You been gone for a long time
You told him to keep an eye on your girl
You said to take me out to a dinner
And a movie now and then
I get lonely when your gone from my world
I guess its about time I told you
Your going to hate me,
When you hear what we've done
He started out trying to do you a favour
And he ended up taking your woman

He was keeping me warm for you
Just like you asked him to do
But that fire in our souls,
Burned out of control
And we did what we never meant to do
He was keeping me warm for you

Now darling,
I loved him before I ever knew you
But somehow I just couldn't find the way
To tell you about our love story

I thought our love had died,
But one night it came alive
And all I can say is I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

He was keeping me warm for you
Just like you asked him to do
But that fire in our souls,
Burned out of control
And we did what we never meant to do
He was keeping me warm for you
