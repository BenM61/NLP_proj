I've been searching for the meaning
What makes you so full of grace
But I'm looking for sweet inspiration
In the eyes of a stranger's face

I walk hand in hand in hand in hand
I walk hand in hand in hand in hand

True visions of perfection
Beyond what is wrong and what is right
I will find my sweet inspiration
And summon the day from night

In hand in hand
In hand in hand
