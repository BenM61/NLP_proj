When your eyes met mine
I looked hard to find
What was hidden so far behind that smile
You were just the kind
You were oh so fine
You could have heart forever
Real love takes time
So let me into your mind
I can't hang all my dreams on a fine red line 

Don't come on fast
Or I'll break like glass
If you want my heart forever 

Cue me up, (Cue me up) for your love
Set me up, (Cue me up) for your love 

Let's call it a night
If your intentions aren't right
And ever so politely say our
Goodbyes 

There's more to be gained
If you stop playing games
I would give my heart forever
Do what you feel
But feel what you see
Take all the good things, you won't
Forget me 

Once you turn on
You can't ever move on
'Cause I need your love forever 

Cue me up, (Cue me up) for your love
Set me up, (Cue me up) for your love 

Real love takes time
So let me into your mind
I can't hang all my dreams on a fine red line
Don't come on fast
Or I'll break like glass
If you want my heart forever 

Cue me up, (Cue me up) for your love
Set me up, (Cue me up) for your love
