Put your arms around me, honey,
And hold me tight,
Huddle up and cuddle up
With all your might,
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
When they look at me,
My heart begins to float,
Then it starts a rockin' 
Like a motor boat,
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you.

Hold me tight
All your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
Begins to float
Motor boat
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you.

So put your arms around me, honey,
And hold me tight,
Huddle up and cuddle up
With all your might,
Oh! Oh! I never knew
Any girl like you
Any girl like you [Repeat to Fade]
