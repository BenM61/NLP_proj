What is it, I don't remember
Made my being so much better
If I can have just one pure thought

What is it, I don't remember
Made my being so much better
If I can have just one pure thought

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
(There is no other way out)
I won't be on my way
I'll help you on your way

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
(There is no other way out)
I won't be on my way
There's nothing more to say

So far, as you've seen
We've been the hardest team
To bear arms since Arnold Rogers was an island tree
And although the macarena has entirely been
I believe you will appreciate the rest of this dream

I got some lost damn feeling
Like I'm feeling in threat
I was the child in the forest
With the bones and the bread
I was a train at the point
Where the rail-road ends
Trying to roll across sound
On your steam in my hands

It was a trip that wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip that I thought would never end
It was a trip that wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip that I thought would never end

What is it, I don't remember
Made my being so much better
If I can have just one pure thought

What is it, I don't remember
Made my being so much better
If I can have just one pure thought

What is it, I don't remember
Made my feeling so much better
If I can have just one pure thought

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I'll help you on your way

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I'll help you on my way
There is nothing more to say
