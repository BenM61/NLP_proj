I watch your window for hours
Moon has set down without us
All by ourselves riding in the front seat
Watch the sun come up

All by ourselves we would run
Remember?
It was so long ago
It was a long time ago

Feel your hand close beside me
Hear the highway behind me
All by ourselves we made love 
Under the sleeping moonless night

All by ourselves we would run
Remember?
It was so long ago
It was a long time ago

I couldn't stop you crying
Or stop myself from fighting back
I tried but never hard enough
Don't you remember, love?

All by myself
I can see it like it's right before my eyes
By myself time goes by
Remember?
It was so long ago
It was a long time ago
