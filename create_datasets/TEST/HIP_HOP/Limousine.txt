She want it all night
She wanna get it with me
She want it all night
She wanna f*ck with me
She want it all night
Yeah!
She want it night
Yeah!

Here's goes a story about a bad chick
And she got a habit
Fast cars, and money, and she living lavish
I mean her really get a unique magic
And I ain't talking tricks, no thrills, no rabbit
Now usually I'm not the one to go chasing
But here's a really sticky situation
It's not that complicated
'Cause neither of us want a conversation
I just want the honey and she wants the invitation

She wants the red carpet, I'ma roll it out
She's the type of model that I dream about
Let me open up the door like you wear the crown
And we can fool around

Beauty Queen, jump on my limousine
And ride it all night long, all night long
It's so fantastic even when there's traffic
Driving all night long, all night long

She want it all night
She wanna get it with me
She want it all night
She wanna f*ck with me
She want it all night
Yeah!
She want it night
Yeah!

Now, let's fast forward just a little bit
Been about a month or two, and I'm really feeling it
I can't live without it, she's addicted to the d
Tell me she's in heaven when she's looking at me
But I don't really blame her 'cause I give it to her good
Give it to her strong like it's made out of wood
Got the girl craving
She even staring downtown when I'm shaving
Telling "It's amazing! He's like, so awesome!"

She wants the red carpet, I'ma roll it out
She's the type of model that I dream about
Let me open up the door like you'd wear a crown
And we can fool around

Beauty Queen, jump on my limousine
And ride it all night long, all night long
It's so fantastic even when there's traffic
Driving all night long, all night long

She want it all night
She wanna get it with me
She want it all night
She wanna f*ck with me
She want it all night
Yeah!
She want it night
Yeah!

Everything about her is tripled-up like the internet
I can see her freak though the chill it's kinda innocent
Shinning though she lowkey, worth the alimony
I can spot the heat like my vision's on the infrared
She like the sprinkle on a cake
She the cheese on a burger
The roll in my stake
She the bee to my nectar
I've been stung
'Cause you're the one I've dream about forever
I really would like to know you, baby
I really would like to please you!

Beauty Queen, jump on my limousine
And ride it all night long, all night long
It's so fantastic even when there's traffic
Driving all night long, all night long

Beauty Queen, jump on my limousine
And ride it all night long, all night long
It's so fantastic even when there's traffic
Driving all night long, all night long
