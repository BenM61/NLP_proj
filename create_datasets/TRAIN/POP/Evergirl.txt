Ever true
Ever cool
Ever you
Ever power
Ever proud

You can be whatever girl you want to be
Ever true, ever you, ever me
Every girl is me
Don't you ever let them get the best of you ever
Cause there ain't nothing you can't ever do
You can be whatever girl you want to be
Ever true, ever you, ever me
Every girl is me

Hey girls come and gather 'round
'Bout to tell ya how it's going down
We're the ever girls in the ever world
Take notes you're in ever school
Now you're playing by the ever rules
Giving you an ever view

Doesn't matter if you're short or tall
It's not about your color at all
Anyone can be an ever girl like me
Let's go on an ever ride
You'll never fail one as you try
That's the ever way
Just live it everday
