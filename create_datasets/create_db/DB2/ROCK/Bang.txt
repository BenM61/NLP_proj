Sitting in a SDT
Waiting for an underground train
To rumble underneath my feet

Bang goes another day
Where it went I could not say
Now I'll have to wait another week

When all is said and all is done
What was said was never done
Don't panic, it's not really worth your while

Bang goes another year
In and out of one ear
Everybody's doing it, so do it too

I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better

Sitting on the early bus
Passing through the morning rush
It makes no difference that I'm not with you

Bang goes another year
In and out of one ear
Everybody's doing it, I'll do it too

I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 

I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little of your love can make things better

I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little of your love can make things better
