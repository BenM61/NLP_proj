I tried getting past the bouncer, but I couldn't get through
He said 'hold it there mate, well this isn't you'
'It's not a fake ID, it's just not mine'
'Well, I'm taking this off you son identity theft, that's a crime'
So I'm standing on the street, got no one else to meet
I'm bored and I'm alone so I start to walk home
Regrettable decision and slightly blurred vision
Turned down this alley and this young man grabbed me

He said "hand over the money, this ain't funny
What's this, are you taking the piss?
Where's your iPhone 6 I ain't stealing this shit
Come here, bitch"

He said "hand over the money, this ain't funny
What's this, are you taking the piss?
Where's your iPhone 6 I ain't stealing this shit
Come here, bitch"

I start to reflect and think, my heart does sink
My eyes too swollen to blink, I need another drink
But now I can't afford because they just ran away with last week's pay
Today it weren't a good day, barking from the dogs
Now I'm thinking I just got robbed
How unfair, I don't care, it's a rare situation
This nation owes me a bit of compensation

He said "hand over the money, this ain't funny
What's this, are you taking the piss?
Where's your iPhone 6 I ain't stealing this shit
Come here, bitch"

He said "hand over the money, this ain't funny
What's this, are you taking the piss?
Where's your iPhone 6 I ain't stealing this shit
Come here, bitch"

Living out of JD bags, smoking broken fags
Badman slags, first time shags, tags on the wall
Tryna act cool, remember when I got kicked out of the classroom at school
Hated GCSES, was shit at PE
Us against them, just you and me
Now they've got pig fat injected to their six pack
What's up with that they look a right twat

What up, get up on your feet
Put your braces together and your boots on your feet
Give me some of that old booze 

He said "hand over the money, this ain't funny
What's this, are you taking the piss?
Where's your iPhone 6 I ain't stealing this shit
Come here, bitch"

He said "hand over the money, this ain't funny
What's this, are you taking the piss?
Where's your iPhone 6 I ain't stealing this shit
Come here, bitch"
