Its like a magic 
I've got to have it 
Whatever lies out of reach of me 
And to despise it 
Just magnifies it 
Can't obliterate the need 

You're bad news disguised 
Dressed and painted with lies 
But I just can't see 
When truth is concealed 
How the danger appeals 
But my conscience sees 

I heard it from the preacher man 
He said leave that boy alone 
He's no good for you 
I heard it from the preacher man 
He said heaven must have sent you 
But the devil's gonna get you 
He's gonna do it for you 

You're like a black cat 
Who always knows that 
It's life is a mystery 
You mesmerize me 
And then you hypnotize me 
Till obsession devours me 

You're silky words soothe me 
As they move me 
To ecstasy 
And just as I'm falling 
I hear a voice calling 
Don't believe 

I heard it from the preacher man 
He said leave that boy alone 
He's no good for you 
I heard it from the preacher man 
He said heaven must have sent you 
But the devil's gonna get you 
He's gonna do it for you 

You're bad news disguised 
Dressed and painted with lies 
But I just can't see 
When truth is concealed 
How the danger appeals 
But my conscience sees 

I heard it from the preacher man 
He said leave that boy alone 
He's no good for you 
I heard it from the preacher man 
He said heaven must have sent you 
But the devil's gonna get you 
He's gonna do it for you
