When I come alive, such a pretty light
I can be beautiful, I can be right
I can hold my own when I feel at home
I can be tender, I can be kind

When I'm on my feet, I can take the heat
But when I get low I prefer the cold
I can be a hard light to ignite
All my nightmares feel like real life

Wait for the explosion
Only to anticipate
Running in slow motion
I can never get away
Sweet paralysation
No one here to keep me safe
Hyperventilation
I'm about to go insane

Wake me up and keep me conscious

When I come alive, such a pretty light
I can be beautiful, I can be right
I can be the words, everything that hurts
All the things that keep you up in the night

Everything I fear, always meets me here
In the early hours dancing with my doubts
I can be a hard light to ignite
All my nightmares feel like real life

Wait for the explosion
Only to anticipate
Running in slow motion
I can never get away
Sweet paralysation
No one here to keep me safe
Hyperventilation
I'm about to go insane

Wake me up and keep me conscious
Wake me up and keep me conscious
Wake me up and keep me conscious
Wake me up and keep me conscious
Wake me up and keep me

Keep me conscious

Wake me up and keep me conscious
Wake me up and keep me conscious
Wake me up and keep me conscious
Wake me up and keep me conscious

Wake me up and keep me conscious
