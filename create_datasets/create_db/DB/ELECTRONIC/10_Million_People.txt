Take a leaf out of Peter Pan's manual
Keep our attitude can-do
When it's cold, light a candle
Imagine you, dance by the sand like Duran Duran do
Throw your arms like orangutans do
Feel brand new, thank you
This is the Flight of the Navigator
See you all next year, maybe later
12 rounds and we still got stamina
It's just us, no phones, no cameras
Something in the air just grabbing us
Same time next week, thanks for having us

10 million people, people

We're hanging on every word
Each and every word they say
We're banging on every door
Never thought we'd see this day

Look at our smile, it spreads for days
Happy we came, we'd lost our way again
Look at our smile, it spreads for days and days

10 million people, people
10 million people

Oh, we knew we'd found the answer
Oh, you said we're all just chancers
Oh, you said we would not last that long
10 million people can't be wrong (Come along, come along, come along)
10 million people can't be wrong (Come along, come along, come along)
10 million people can't be wrong

10 million people
Shut us down, shut us down, shut us down
And we'll move to another town, to another town
Shut us down, shut us down, shut us down
And we'll move to another town, to another town

Look at our smile, it spreads for days
Happy we came, we'd lost our way again
Look at our smile, it spreads for days and days

Oh, we knew we'd found the answer
Oh, you said we're all just chancers
Oh, you said we would not last that long
10 million people can't be wrong (Come along, come along, come along)
10 million people can't be wrong (Come along, come along, come along)
10 million people can't be wrong

10 million people, people

Shut us down, shut us down, shut us down
And we'll move to another town, to another town
Shut us down, shut us down, shut us down
And we'll move to another town, to another town

Oh, we knew we'd found the answer
Oh, you said we're all just chancers
Oh, you said we would not last that long
10 million people can't be wrong (Come along, come along, come along)
10 million people can't be wrong (Come along, come along, come along)
10 million people can't be wrong (Come along, come along, come along)
10 million people can't be wrong
10 million people, people
