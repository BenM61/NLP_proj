When I was only ten years old
My father said to me
"Son you're getting up in years,
What will you want to be?"
And as I pondered my reply
In front of my T.V.
That Sunday night Ed Sullivan
Made it all clear to me.

[Chorus]
I took a trip straight into Rock and Roll
A little bit, and I lost all control
And that was it, no more, no less, I guess it got the best of me.
A little trip and I was on my way
A little bit was more than I could take
And that was it, the night I saw it all
The Beatles on T.V.

"Please forgive me mother dear,
I know it must sound strange.
I need to let my golden hair
Grow longer every day."
I bought myself a used guitar
And I learned how to play,
But I never learned the passing chords
They just got in my way.

[Chorus]

I promise to send you a letter
When I am a big jetsetter
Just say you believe in me
And send me all your love. 

When I was only ten years old
That's when I lost all control
