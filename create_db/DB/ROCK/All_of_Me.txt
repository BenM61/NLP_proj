All my life searching for the one to share
The space within my heart
To stand right by my side

Then you came to me
Shining as the morning sun
You gave your love to me
And I knew you were the one

The one to share my life
To make all the wrong so right
We will live as one for all eternity
You and I

I'm giving you all of me
Cause you gave me all of you
I'll love you forever
For you my love's so strong
I'm giving you all of me
Cause you gave me all of you
We'll stand together
And our love will always carry on
