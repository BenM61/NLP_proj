Oh, your pretty smile banish any gloom

And when I frown I feel unsound, I drag you down to ground level
I interrupt your flyin' high and summer sky in your mind
But then you grab me by the scruff and we're up, up and over
Over the dirty men, the streets where I retreat from living

Your pretty smile, it could light up any room
I've seen it many times banish any gloom
Darlin', don't you ever stop with that smilin', yeah

Your pretty smile, it could light up any room
I've seen it many times banish any gloom
Darlin', don't you ever stop with that smilin', yeah

One time I've seen the low lands green, I was sixteen and spellbound
I think of you when I glance over these old reels
Greta Garbo, Brigitte Bardot, Marilyn Monroe, such photos
The smog descends around my silhouette of dreams

Your pretty smile, it could light up any room
I've seen it many times banish any gloom
Darlin', don't you ever stop with that smilin', yeah

Your pretty smile, it could light up any room
I've seen it many times banish any gloom
Darlin', don't you ever stop with that smilin', yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Your pretty smile, it could light up most any room
I said your pretty smile, it could light up most any room
I said your pretty smile, it could light up most any room

Your pretty smile, your pretty smile could light up most any room
Your pretty smile, your pretty smile could light up most any room
Your pretty smile, your pretty smile could light up most any room
