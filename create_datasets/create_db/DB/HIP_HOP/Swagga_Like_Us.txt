No one on the corner,
Mr. West is in the building
Swagger on a hundred thousand, trillion (No one on the corner)
Hey yo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving do we even gotta question
Hermes Pastille I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means it's permanent, so I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
Why he's so mad for, why he gotta have it
Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Na-na-na, how it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine'a-na-na-na-nal
Trying to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

(No one on the corner) Gotta bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans cause my knots don't fit (No one on the corner)
Gotta pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by
Jockin' my fresh, jockin' jockin' my fresh, jockin' jocking' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas know you thorough
And the girls say yes
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap, it's Hova!
Dipping different rovers whipping with the soda, Hova!
Could you even have any doubt after doubt it was over

No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch
But I'm too clean for the choir
I require, what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas!
Run up in your shit just me no mas
Running this shit like I got four thighs
None has swagger like this four guys!
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal
And my jewels, blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special, ha
What the f*ck you boys talking about?
I know its us cause we the only thing you talk about

Yea, ha! Ya think? that's right,
You know see Weezy for the wordplay,
Jeezy for the bird-play,
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,
All my verses picture perfect all is meant to serve a purpose,
You ain't living what you kicking then you worthless,
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical,
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do,
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off
Blast off and have outstanding quality,
Sell a lot of records I respect and salute that,
But spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag
