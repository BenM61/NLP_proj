Been there dreaming, helps to pass the time
Got to thinking 'bout this girl that could be mine
She's got everything, mm
But I don't think, she even knows
All the while inside my love for her still grows
I want everything, she's got everything

She could be Bardot & Monroe, Sophia Loren
She could be reincarnated as Hepburn again
She could be perfect to love, simply divine
Could she be mine, ooh

From my window, I can see her place
I know her silhouette so well that I could trace
Every curve & line
Seems a crazy way, to pass my time away
Listing clothes that she would wear to work that day
How she looks so fine, wishing she was mine

She could be Bardot & Monroe, Sophia Loren
She could be reincarnated as Hepburn again
She could be perfect to love, simply divine
Could she be mine

Could I be just what she needs, am I fooling myself
She would ever choose me instead of anyone else
Could it be that our fate, is inter twined
Could she be mine

I asked my best friend, if he thought she could be mine
He just laughed, I didn't take it as a positive sign
His advice was "man, she's way out of your league
She's the sun, and the moon, she is shining, for me"

She could be Bardot & Monroe, Sophia Loren
She could be reincarnated as Hepburn again
She could be perfect to love, simply divine
Could she be mine, ooh yeah yeah

I am just what she needs, am I fooling myself
She would ever choose me instead of anyone else
Could it be that our fate, is inter twined
Could she be mine, ooh, ooh mine, yeah
Could she be mine, mmm
All mine
