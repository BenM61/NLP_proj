Follow the simplest fact
Girl you cheated through the breakin' way
Fall through the love like I never loved
Soberer than I've ever been

Call me, hard to emerge yea
Sittin' on the fire and waitin'
All the things I have changed and Im afraid you
Crossed an inch away

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

Sorry, it touches a bad news
What you wanted I say come on and go
Louder, lookin' at all the fires
I say anyway the inch took off

Sorry, the angels had split sure
Of the verge and washed away
To fly is only one, all I ever said
In a simple way

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

'Cause for real it looks like youre in the dark
Bount to be upon a star
Imagine how youd feel
Here's we're feeling lost

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
