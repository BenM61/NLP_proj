Feel the ground it's slipping away
Like a sigh that greets the close of day
Feel the waters' welcoming arms
Embrace me in the quiet calm
 
I can't hear what you say anymore
Just the sound of trees on the ocean floor
irresistibly drawn from the shore

[Chorus]
I'm drowning in your eyes
I'm floating out to sea
Helpless on the restless tide
That flows between you and me
 
Moving slowly as if in a dream
The colours change from blue to green
All around me reflections of you
In forests deep I'm passing through
 
In the swell of the storm we're as one
We're dancing in the morning sun
Could it be that we've only just begun
 
[Chorus x2]

Lying here beside you
Try to reach you but you're so far....
 
[Chorus x2]

I'm drowning in your eyes
I'm drowning in your eyes
I'm drowning in your eyes
