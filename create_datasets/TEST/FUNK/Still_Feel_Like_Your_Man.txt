I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man
I still feel like

The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself someone somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Your man
(Ever since the day we met)
(Ever since the day we met)

Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, babe

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Oh, honey
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
And I don't know why
Still feel like your man

I still feel like
I still feel like 
I still feel like
I still 
I still
