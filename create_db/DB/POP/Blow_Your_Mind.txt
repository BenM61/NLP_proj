I know it’s hot
I know we've got
Something that money can’t buy
Fighting to fifths
Biting your lip
Loving too late in the night

Tell me I’m too crazy
You can’t tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I’m the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don’t like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don’t like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don’t f*ck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I’m alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I’m alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah (Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you’ve had
I guess you’re digging the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I’m too crazy
You can’t tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I’m the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

And tonight I’m alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I’m alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

(And tonight I’m alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!)
(And tonight I’m alive, ain't a dollar sign)
(Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!)
