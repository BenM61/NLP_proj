Who has the ginger?

I woke up one day and planned to get reckless
Felt myself and put on my best necklace
Posted in the group chat, who wants to faaji?
They were only down for the after party
Hmmn, my body is ready
And it's sweeting me like I have jedi jedi
Who else would be hype? Who has the ginger?
Only this guy that I know through my sister
So I hit him up and told him let's roll
And he told me he'll pioneer the parole
Now it's a movement
The night can't waste
So I got some Henny out the stash for a taste
Went out for pre-drinks, squad was chill
But as the time passed, shit got real
I mentioned the movement they said they'll come through
Now them too were ready to do the do

The whole squad turnt and the music is flames
And we don't even know anybody here's names
Can't even front, I have no ragrets
Low key one of my best nights yet
Ooh I'm on a big wave
Everyone around me probably feels same
Nothing can phase me now

Who has the ginger?
Who has the ginger?

Damn
What am I gonna do?
I only have a three man crew plus two
A crew regardless, oh ya let's move
We can find a spot in the city for the groove
Get to the zone and bredda it's lit
Never seen a crowd get wild like this
The babes don't care and the guys are fit
Reckless mission is now accomplished

The whole squad turnt and the music is flames
And we don't even know anybody here's names
Can't even front, I have no ragrets
Low key one of my best nights yet
Ooh I'm on a big wave
Everyone around me prolly feels same
Nothing can phase me now
