A beats on repeat beating on me
From every car in the street
It's constant repeat on repeat
Of you paranoid heartbreaking beats 
On repeat

it's a fine song on repeat beating on me
With your favorite bed that helps you sleep
And hear comes the news stylish creep
From ever car in the street
On repeat
On repeat
Uh huh
Uh oh
Oh yeah

on repeat
Don't care about any words
What's it really worth 
Because they can tell everybody else
What to really want
Then your fucked so 
Act like it's for yourself
For insides out
And they 
Go and tell everybody else
That we're really great
Just people

your friends eyes are entranced
Your friends eyes are entranced
They know that it's us
Well life is a compromise
But your beats are half-assed
Streak is beating on me
I love drinking
Weed is helping me sleep

I wish I could complain more
About the rich
But then 
All the children
Would learn the streets
Come to every show
Knowing what's there

I wish I could complain more
About the rich
But then 
All the children
Would fail at school
Come to every show
Drugged and ...

I wish I could complain more
About the rich
But then 
All the children
Would learn the streets

repeats of beats
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio

beats on repeat
Beating on me
Beats on repeat
Beating on me
