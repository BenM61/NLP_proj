They say the world's an eventful place
You give me news
I don't want to know
You say that I should care
That I should speak my mind
Oh, but how can I speak of the world
Pushing by 
With a lump in my throat
And tears in my eyes
Have we come to the point of no turning back
Or is it still time to get into 
The swing of things

Let us walk through this windless city
I'll go on til the winter gets me
"Sleep" you wrote "sleep, my dear"
In a letter somewhere
Oh, but how can I sleep with your voice in my head
And and ocean between us 
And room in my bed
Have I come to the point where I'm loosing the grip
Or is it still time to get into 
The swing of things

When she glows in the dark
And I'm weak by the sight
Of this breathtaking beauty 
In which I can hide
There is a worldful out there
Of people I fear
But given time I'll get into 
The swing of things
Yes, when she glows in the dark and I'm struck by the sight
I know that I'll need this for the rest of my life

What have I done
What lies I have told
I've played games with the ones that rescued my soul
Have I come to the point where I'm losing the grip 
Or is it still time to get into
The swing of things
