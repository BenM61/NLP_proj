9 am
In your bedroom
The radio alarm clock
Is set for soon
I know you friends
And you know mine too
You don?t tell on me I won?t tell on you
I get around

Seconds to your elevator
From the station
How can I resist
That kinda invitation
Second floor and I?m in trouble
Gotta get me back down to street level
I get around

Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no
Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no

Quietly slide away off the mattress
Find my clothing on the bed post
So I tip toe out of this mess
As I slip back into last nights dress
I get around

Put a little lipstick back on my face
Blow a little kiss to you from the doorway
Walk the hall right past the stair case
Take the elevator back down out of this place
I get around

Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no
Here I come when I better go
I say yes when I ought to say no
I say yes when I ought to say no
I say yes when I ought to say no
I say yes
I say yes
I say yes
I say yes
I say yes
Say yes
Say ya
