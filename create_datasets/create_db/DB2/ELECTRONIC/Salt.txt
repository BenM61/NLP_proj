Stuck inside of the wrong frame
I don't feel attached to this name
My body, I must reclaim
With different eyes and no shame

Try, try to just hear me out
Don't ask why, why
But I'm taking this route
It's alright, right?
That's what I tell myself, but I don't know know

So I ran 'til I couldn't and I screamed, 'til my voice was gone
I believed what I shouldn't have, I don't know why
These memories are nothing to me just salt

Look in the mirror and tell me
What it is like to be free
How do I grasp reality
When I don't have an identity!
Who, who can I look to 'cause I'm not like you, you
And I don't believe in the truth, truth
Because all of my life's built on lies

So I ran 'til I couldn't and I screamed, 'til my voice was gone
I believed what I shouldn't have, I don't know why

I know what you're implying
I'm trying to get my feet off the ground
I know, I know, I'm trying, I'm trying
These memories are nothing to me just salt!

Stuck inside of the wrong frame,
I don't feel attached to this name
How do I grasp reality
When I don't have an identity!
Who, who can I look to 'cause I'm not like you, you
And I don't believe in the truth, truth
'Cause all of my life's built on lies, uh!

So I ran 'til I couldn't and I screamed, 'til my voice was gone
I believed what I shouldn't have, I don't know why
Yeah, I ran 'til I couldn't and I screamed, 'til my voice was gone
I believed what I shouldn't have,
I'm trying to get my feet off the ground
These memories are nothing to me just salt in the wound
