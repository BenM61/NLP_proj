I got someone waiting at home for me, staring out the door
And I'll wanna stay in the zone till 3, all those calls ignored
Tomorrow she'll probably disown me, happy no more,
Keep falling into shadows,

I'm playing in the shadows all night long,
So good to play with bad girls I'm still young,
They keep on saying hello, I know what they want,
You'll find me in the shadows

She's always ringing my phone you see, laying down the law,
Keep trying to speak to her honestly, so she knows the score,
Maybe one day I'll be lonely, knocking down the door,
Keep falling into shadows,

I'm playing in the shadows all night long,
So good to play with bad girls I'm still young,
They keep on saying hello, I know what they want,
You'll find me in the shadows
You'll find me in the shadows

Playing in the shadows 
Playing in the shadows 
Playing in the shadows 
Playing in the shadows, people call it shallow
Tell me something I don't know

Tell me something I don't know 
Tell me something I don't know 
Playing in the shadows, people call it shallow
Tell me something I don't know

Maybe one day I'll be lonely, knocking down the door,
Keep falling into shadows,

I'm playing in the shadows all night long,
So good to play with bad girls I'm still young,
They keep on saying hello, I know what they want,
You'll find me in the shadows

You'll find me, find me, find me
You'll find me in the shadows
You'll find me, find me, find me
You'll find me in the shadows

You'll find me in the shadows
