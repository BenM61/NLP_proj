When pillow talks turn to pillow fights
Remember before you say goodnight
To make up before you go to sleep
So pillow fights turn to pillow dreams

I'll go to sleep
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
I'll go to sleep
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
I'll go to sleep tomorrow

(I'll go to sleep)

I'll go to sleep tomorrow
