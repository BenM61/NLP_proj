I know an angel on the east side of Heaven
Who lives in a first story room
We meet on a rooftop and dream in the dark
When the lights of New York are in bloom

All through the daytime it's the same old Manhattan
But evening again sets me free
Then I turn off Broadway to the east side of heaven
Where an angel waits for me

All through the daytime it's the same old Manhattan
But evening again sets me free
Then I turn off Broadway to the east side of Heaven
Where an angel waits for me
