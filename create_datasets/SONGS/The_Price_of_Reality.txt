Let them inject you, inject you freely
The sores of truth reprised
Truth mended with the razors, deny
I stand accused at the end of our lives

And did they want to find you?
And did they bury your life?
It's just a holiday for you
Human assembly line

It's just a holiday for you
In your human assembly line
Another holiday for you
Abortion candy machine
What is the price of reality?

Let them take you into tomorrow
Tomorrow never arrives
The proof is in our abscessed sex lives
Abandoned in static erratic fines
Erratic we embrace our demise

And did they want to buy you?
In your assembly line
It's just a holiday for you
In your human assembly line
Another holiday for you
Abortion candy machine
What is the price of reality?

Sign the welfare checks in your sickness
With your children's blood splatters on the
Back of revolt! Revolt!
Abortion holiday revolt
Price of reality revolt
Price of reality revolt revolt
