I'm sittin' with Nelly
In front of the telly
I'm fillin' my belly 
With a bottle of wine
Goin' with Kelly 
To the cross-country rally
Up to Chez Nelly
Straight down the line

Just say she ain't mine
And I'll beat you to gelly
It's a hit on the head
With a knock of the knuckles
It's a bucket full of tears
And it's a sea full of rain

Goin' down the valley
Tryin' to screw Grace Kelly
Go for her gelly
She's handlin' mine
Sittin' with Sally
Ridin' with Smelly
Fillin' my belly 
With a bottle of wine
