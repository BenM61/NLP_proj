Oh baby  it's cryin' time  
Oh baby  I got to fly

Got to try to find a way  
Got to try to get away  

'Cause you know I gotta get away from you babe 
Oh baby the river's red, ah baby in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on  
I don't think I can hold out long

And when the owls cry in the night  
Oh baby, baby when the pines begin to cry  
Baby, baby, baby  how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, mmm, baby, it's just a den 
For those who hide, who hide their love to depths of life 
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

And when the owls cry in the night  
And baby when the pines begin to cry  
Oh baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel? 

Baby how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
And they can't hold the wrath of those who walk
An' the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

Ooooh, yeah
Ooooh
Oooooh, yeah

Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh

Oooooh
Hooooh
Hooooh
Hooooh
Hahhhh
Hoooh hooh hoooh hah hahhh
