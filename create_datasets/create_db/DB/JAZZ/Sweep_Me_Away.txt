Never thought I would say these words
But this was beyond my control
My fingers were itching
But my hands too small
Once steady on my feet
Now sinking trough the mud
I'm looking at the stars
While awaiting the flood

Never thought I would say these words
But I might have got it wrong
There's a hole in my mind
No more answers to find
Once fighting that calm
Now cooling down my blood
I'm looking at the stars
While awaiting the flood

Sweep me away, sweep me away

Once steady on my feet
Now sinking trough the mud
I'm looking at the stars
While awaiting the flood
