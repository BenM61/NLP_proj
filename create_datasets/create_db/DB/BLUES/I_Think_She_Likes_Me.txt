Walked into a strange cafe
No one there's ever heard my name
Go to the bar, have a seat
Talk to that woman sittin' next to me

She asked me in a voice so low
She asked me if I come in here alone
She asked me nicely "Can I buy you a drink?"

You know I think she likes me that's what I think 
I think she likes me that's what I think 

She listens to every word I say
I look at her she don't look away
I tell her that I play for "Treat Her Right"
She asks me if I'm gonna play tonight - Yeah!

She cross her legs, will do no harm
She lets her finger run on down my arm
I asked her nicely "Can I buy you a drink?"

I think she likes me that's what I think 
I think she likes me that's what I think 

Oh yeah!
Some guy comes over, what does he think
Intruding on our private thing
The man is looking quite upset
Wavin' 'round with his gun like that

She'd told me things about her life
She'd never told me she was someone's wife
The man with the gun says "Why'd you buy her a drink?"
I said "I think she likes me that's what I think"

I think she likes me that's what I think 
I think she likes me that's what I think 
I think she likes me that's what I think 

I - I - I - I think she likes me
