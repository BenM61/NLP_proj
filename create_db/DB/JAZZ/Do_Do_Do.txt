Do do do what you've done done done before, baby
Do do do what I do do do adore, baby
Let's try again, sigh again, fly again to heaven
Baby see it's abc, I love you and you love me

I know know know what a beau beau beau should do, baby
So don't don't don't say it won't won't won't come true, baby
My heart begins to hum, dum-de-dum-de-dum dum dum
Oh do do do what you've done done done before

My heart begins to hum, dum-de-dum-de-dum dum dum
So do do do what you've done done done before
