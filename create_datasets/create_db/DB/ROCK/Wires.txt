Kid, don't lose your cool it's still too soon
to have to choose a brighter doom.
It's hard to believe but I can see how
there could be so little left to lose.

Momma's not okay, she lights a candle for every day
that you're away.
Today could be the one she burns the mother fucker down,
the final act of grace.
In a pointless endless race.

Kid, you're under fire, your life is coming down to the wire.
Baby, you'll take the captains hand, carry a ship through burning sands.
Cradle your rifle like a man.

Momma, she said to wait, she's lost it all,
slowly got the stay to make you pay.
She throws the fiend upon the floor to get those suckers full of stone.
Till the day he dies alone

So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold

So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold
