Oh, when I said I need you so much, I was dead
I was alive when you were right here by my side
We both could see that I needed you, you needed me
And now we both regret, regret what we said
When we said "Don't you ever come back, 
Don't you ever come.
Don't you ever come back, don't you"

Don't go out tonight
Baby, can't you see what is happening to you, what is happening?
Don't go out tonight
Baby, can't you see what is happening to you, what is happening?

So whose fault is it anyway?
Don't say you don't know
We both know that we made a mistake
It's hard to live together forever
Well, that's what they say
We still regret when we said what we said
So whose fault is it anyway?
Don't say you don't know

Don't you ever come.
Don't you ever come back, don't you"
