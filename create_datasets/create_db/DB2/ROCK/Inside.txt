It's been countless days,
Since I felt the same way I did
Last week or weeks before
I implur

If you could only see my heart exploding
The blood and gore as my soul lays on the floor
Inside you I could never breath again
Wearing my heart on my sleeve

The beacon faded just like our love
I wish I knew what happened so I could fix it
The damper on our relationship 
The pieces of the puzzle no longer fit 

I've become what I hate
Suddle little hints I'm on the other side of the fense for once
My thoughts of myself haunt me everyday
Inside you I could never breath again

Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love
I don't know my next move to make
Once again living in checkmate

I hate being this stupid kid and everything that you did
Was so perfect, it's my fault I know
It's my fault I know
It's my fault I know

Inside you I could never breath again
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love
Tied in these chains wishing the pain would go away

Never successful, never knew what real love was before
I mean it when I say I wish it was like it was
So much is going through my head
Regretting every word I said

I still love you, don't want anything to happen to you
Laying in my bed for hours and hours the pain won't...fucking...go away
How the hell am I suppose to be happy if your not?
Inside you I could never breath again

Wearing my heart on my sleeve
The beacon faded just like our love
I wish I could have it all back
It was so great before and yes it is all my fault

I ought to have known pain would happen again
If it means the same as it once did never hurt yourself again
I'm sorry.
