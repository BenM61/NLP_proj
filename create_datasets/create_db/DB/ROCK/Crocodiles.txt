I read it in a magazine
I don't wanna see it again
I threw away the magazine
And looked for someone to explain

I don't wanna look back
I can't look 'round
I don't wanna see it coming 'round

Listen to the ups and downs
Listen to the sound they make
Don't be scared when it gets loud
When your skin begins to shake

'Cause you don't wanna look back
You gotta look tall
Gotta see those creeps crawl

I know you know
I know you know

Well I can see you've got the blues
In your alligator shoes
Me I'm all smiles
I've got my crocodiles

I don't wanna look back
I can't turn 'round
I don't wanna see it coming down

Met someone just the other day
He said wait until tomorrow
I said hey, whatcha doing today?
He said I'm gonna do it tomorrow
