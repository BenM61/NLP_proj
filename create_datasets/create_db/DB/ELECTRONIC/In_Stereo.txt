When I listen to my stereo
All I hear is a funky flow
It really makes me lose control
Bomfunk MC's in stereo, in stereo, in stereo
All I hear is a funky flow
It really makes me lose control
Bomfunk MC's in stereo

But how right, but how right, but how right

Cannot hide it, can't deny it
It's so obvious you hope to hide it
Like a pilot, you get a mic
Boombox blasting like a siren
Roar you're a mighty lion
Roar when pumping the iron
Roar one million strong
Roar turn it up, come on

But how right, but how right, but how right, ow
But how right, but how right

When I listen to my stereo
All I hear is a funky flow
It really makes me lose control
Bomfunk MC's in stereo, in stereo, in stereo
All I hear is a funky flow
It really makes me lose control
Bomfunk MC's in stereo

But how right, but how right, but how right

Star supremo, with the ill flow
Got you yearning, turning reckless
You don't understand but you still want to check this
One to two to two to one techniques
Busting the funk, freaking the funk
Eating the funk, making it funk
Loving the funk, falling to funk
Yeah, so what's up punk

But how right, but how right, but how right
But how right, but how right

When I listen to my stereo
All I hear is a funky flow
It really makes me lose control
Bomfunk MC's in stereo, in stereo, in stereo
All I hear is a funky flow
It really makes me lose control
Bomfunk MC's in stereo

But how right, but how right, but how right
But how right, stereo, funky flow, lose control
Stereo, stereo, funky flow, lose control
Stereo
