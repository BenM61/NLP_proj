 Sometimes people play with love
falling in love is just a game.
Don't think I don't know love
you"ll never be alone again.

Let me (show you how I feel)
be the one 
that I need soo much.

Let me give you (warmth and thrill)
be the one 
that I long to touch.

Only you can make me feel this way 
I'll give you all, come on let's get away
it sometime never ever ever pays
I'll give you more and more so.

Let me 
be the one (to hold on to the dream)
let me 
be the one (you can trust me at anytime)
 
Let me 
be the one (to give you all the love)
let me 
be the one (to feel your tender touch)

First time that I saw you there 
thought I knew you from before
Promise me you will never leave
cause I will never let you go. 

Let me (hold you close to me)
be the one (because our love is strong)

Let me (feel the need in me)
be the one (together we belong)

Only you can make me feel brand new
I can feel it in my heart your love 
is true.
Together we are one instead of two
I want you more and more so.

Let me 
be the one (to hold on to the dream)

Let me
be the one (I want to give you all the love)

Only you can make me feel this way

It sometimes never ever pays
