When I lost my baby (baby)
I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby (baby)
I almost lost my mind
My head is in a spin since she's left me behind

I went to see the gypsy
And had my fortune read
I went to see the gypsy
And had my fortune read
I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said

Well, I can tell you, people (people)
The news was not so good
Well, I can tell you, people (people)
The news was not so good
She said "Your baby's left you"
"This time she's gone for good" (gone for good)

Bah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
