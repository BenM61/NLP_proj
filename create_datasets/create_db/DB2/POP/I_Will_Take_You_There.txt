If only I could find a place
Where smiling strangers knew our faces
I would take you there

A place with constant melody
Where you and I could wander free
I would take you there

Seems like such a waste of time
Just trying to unwind the facts of life
If I could find a place, I'd take you
Where the pain don't cut you like a knife

If only there were time enough
Or word enough or rhyme enough
I would take you there

Seems like such a waste of time
Just trying to unwind the facts of life
If I could find a place, I'd take you
Where the pain don't cut you like a knife

If only I could find a place
Where smiling strangers knew our faces
I would take you there

A place with constant melody
Where you and I could wander free
I would take you there

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
