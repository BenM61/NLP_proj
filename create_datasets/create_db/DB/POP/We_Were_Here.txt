Rooftops, dirty thoughts, all I got is twenty bucks
Nights so breezy make it look easy
Local cuts, pizza crust, leave a message on the bus
Full moon howling, let's go prowling

Spend some time burn the money
That we don't 'posed too, shit we got into
I'm no good, not tryna be
Yeah we got issues, take a flag with you

Dressed up, messed up put on a show
Show the whole damn world's gonna know

That we were here
Running round, blackin' out
Young bloods burning it down
That we were here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Setting flames, taking names, just cause we own the town
We gonna write it
Solid as gold
We're gonna make it
So they gonna know
That we were here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah we were here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We were here

Photobooth, kissing youth, midnight bulletproof
Night so hazy, lay back lazy
Slow burn, fighting words, show them how the fire works
Make an impression, teach 'em all a lesson

Dressed up, messed up, put on a show
Show the whole damn world's gonna know

That we were here
Running round, blackin' out
Young bloods burning it down
That we were here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Setting flames, taking names, just cause we own the town
We gonna write it
Solid as gold
We're gonna make it
So they gonna know
That we were here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah we were here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We were here
