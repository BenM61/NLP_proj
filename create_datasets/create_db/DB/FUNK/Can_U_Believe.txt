Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings
When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down
But, oh, I know
I know exactly how you feel

But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now?
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowin' down?
Can you believe?

See, the person I love the most
Is so far away tonight
And no other medicine or promise is
Gonna heal me up right
But I got to believe
That her and me
Will be together
'Cause that's all I got
And, oh, I know
When you're down at the bottom
Can you believe?

Can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now?
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowin' down?
Can you believe?

Can you believe when all hope seems gone
When your mother and father can't keep you safe from harm?
Can you forgive in your heart?
Can you ask for forgiveness?
When nobody else believes, can you believe?
Can you believe in yourself?

Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowin' down?
Can you believe?

If nobody's watchin'
You will never know
If somebody's watchin'
You will never know
If nobody's watchin'
You will never know
If somebody's watchin'
You will never know
If nobody's watchin'
You will never know
If somebody's watchin'
You will never know

Can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now?
When your heart is slowin' down?
Can you believe?
