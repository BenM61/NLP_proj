I'll tell you something you need to know
Nothing I can say phone to phone
I'll tell you something but you have to sit close
You're the one that I miss the most

I've heard that you're happy
And maybe it's selfish of me
To want you back this time
I know we decided it's better if we both were free
But it kills me now

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Perfect lie, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
Though we're over, we're so not over
Pull me closer, I need closure
This is our last goodbye
Stay the night, even just for a moment
Even just for a moment

When you're not hurting
It's hurting me (hurting me)
I'm blinded by the past
I'm lost at sea (mm)

I've heard that you're happy
And maybe it's selfish of me
To want you back this time
I know we decided it's better if we both were free
But it kills me now

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Perfect lie, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
Though we're over, we're so not over
Pull me closer, I need closure
This is our last goodbye
Stay the night, even just for a moment
Even just for a moment
Even just for a moment

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Perfect lie, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
Though we're over, we're so not over
Pull me closer, I need closure
This is our last goodbye
Stay the night, even just for a moment
(Moment, moment, moment, moment
Moment, moment, moment, moment)
Even just for a moment
(Moment, moment, moment, moment, moment, moment)
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Even just for a moment

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Perfect lie, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
