Take a look in the mirror
Look at yourself
But don't you look too close
'Cause you just might see
The person that you hate the most

Lord, what's happening to
This human race?
I can't even see
One friendly face

Brothers fight brothers
And sisters wink their eyes
While silver tongues
Bear fruits of poison lies

Just take a look at your children
Born innocent
Every boy and every girl
Denying themselves a real chance
To build a better world

Dear Lord, dear Lord
What's happening to your precious dream?
It's washing away
On a bloody, bloody stream

Take a look at your children
Before it's too late
And tell them nobody wins
When the prize is hate
