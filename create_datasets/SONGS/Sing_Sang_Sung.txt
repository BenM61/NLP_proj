You are such a workaholic boy
That you kill everybody's joy
Fill your head with some time to lose
With some time to lose

Sing sang sung sing me a song
Do did done don't be so down
Ring rang rung give me a ring
Please please please don't be so long

What are we doing here my friend ?
Take a breath push your pain away
Nothing lasts it's better that way
It's better that way

Sing sang sung sing me a song
Do did done don't be so down
Ring rang rung give me a ring
Please please please don't be so long

Sing sang sung sing me a song
Do did done don't be so down
Ring rang rung give me a ring
Please please please don't be so long
