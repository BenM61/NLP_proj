Have a clear mind
Be pure in your heart
Be sure in your actions
One day all the world's musicians will meet
Music has no frontiers
One day the Americans
Will find a new vision
And the Russians too
Will see life in a different way
For there are too many weapons
And war is terrible
I have a vision of all Africa
Being united one day
Give me your hand
Give me one chance to know
What do you think
For the future?
The young people are crying
Because the older ones are frightening them
That's what makes me sad
They are crying because
They have no hope
