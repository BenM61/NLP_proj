Oh Fyodor you are the most attractive man
Oh Fyodor you are the most attractive man I know,
Your Russian heart is strong and has been bleeding for too long

Oh my Lassie, it's like bad acid
It's getting nasty, she knows

Gymnastic-whores-down-on-all-fours-with-septic-pores-and-fucked-up
Bores-I-would-like-to-give-you-more-molasses

Oh Molasses, its like bad acid
It's getting nasty, she knows

She knows

Apologies to insect life
What I did was not very nice
A little piece of everyone
Is bad and can't be jettisoned

And round from her from me to you
Sometimes you know it goes right through
My love
