Times are tough, frustration
Need relief, medication
Gone to far, intoxication
Fight the urge, of temptation
Miles ago, no destination
Is a real, hallucination
Lose the dream, of stagnation
Feel so lost, desperation

It's much too close, contamination
Love and pain, and deviation
Just suck it all, ejaculation
It's much to late, for damnation

When I was young,
My mother told me,
She said "Son,
Someday everything's gonna be alright.
There's no escape,
There's no salvation,
It's much to dark, for revelation."
