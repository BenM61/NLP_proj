Hmm, hmm, mmm, mmm
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I, I hope you will, mmm, mmm

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child

You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm, mmm
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho, yeah, yeah

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
When you make me feel real, mmm, hmm
You make me feel real, real good
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I've got to thank your love
'Cause you make me feel good
