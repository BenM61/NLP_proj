Me, debunk an American myth?
And take my life in my hands?
Where the great plains begin
At the hundredth meridian
At the hundredth meridian
Where the great plains begin

Driving down a corduroy road
Weeds standing shoulder-high
Ferris wheel is rusting off in the distance
At the hundredth meridian
At the hundredth meridian
At the hundredth meridian
Where the great plains begin

Left alone to get gigantic
Hard, huge and haunted
A generation so much dumber than its parents
Came crashing through the window
A raven strains along the line of the road
Carrying a muddy, old skull
The wires whistle their approval
Off down the distance
At the hundredth meridian (hunredth meridian)
At the hundredth meridian (you're going to miss me)
At the hundredth meridian (truth me)
Where the great plains begin (at the hundredth meridian)
At the hundredth meridian (at the hundredth meridian)
At the hundredth meridian (really, you're going to miss me)
At the hundredth meridian (turst me)
Where the great plains begin

I remember, I remember Buffalo
And I remember Angelo
It would seem to me I remember every single fucking thing I know

If I die of vanity, promise me, promise me
They bury me some place I don't want to be
You'll dig me up and transport me, unceremoniously
Away from the swollen city-breeze, garbage bag trees
Whispers of disease and the acts of enormity
And lower me slowly, sadly and properly
Get Ry Cooder to sing my eulogy
At the hundredth meridian (hundredth meridian)
At the hundredth meridian (you're going to miss me)
At the hundredth meridian (trust me)
Where the great plains begin (at the hundredth meridian)

At the hundredth meridian (at the hundredth meridian)
At the hundredth meridian (baby, you're going to miss me)
At the hundredth meridian (trust me)
Where the great plains

Begin
