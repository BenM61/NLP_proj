If the sun goes behind a cloud
And you feel it's gonna rain
If the moon ain't shinin' bright
And the stars the stars won't shine for you tonight

If life gets hard to understand
Your love life is out of hand
Just come to mama
Come up to mama

If you need, a satisfier
Let me be, let me be, let me be
Your pacifier

If you feel like your heart's breakin' into bits
Call my number, five-six-eight-six-nine-six-nine, I'll give you a fix

'Cause I got your favorite toy
Guaranteed to bring you joy
Just come to mama
Come up to mama

If your soul is on fire
Let me take you to my only heart's desire
Just come to mama
Come up to mama
Just come to mama
Come up to mama
