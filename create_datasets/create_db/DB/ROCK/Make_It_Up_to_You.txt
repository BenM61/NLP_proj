You make me feels so right
When you're around
Maybe I've gone astray
But you're the best I've found

Now I see things the way I really should
The lesson's learned I've change my ways for good
I'll make it all up to you

Seemed like all was lost
Things were going wrong
In time I found
It's with you I'm in love

Please stay, don't go, be by my side
I know that our love has never died

Please stay, don't go, be by my side
I know that our love has never died

I'll make it all up to you
