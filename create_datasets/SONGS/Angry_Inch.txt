My sex-change operation got botched
My guardian ange fell asleep on the watch
Now all I've got is a barbie doll crotch
I've got an angry inch

Six inches forward, five inches back
I got a, I've got an angry inch
Six inches forward, five inches back
I got a, I've got an angry inch

I'm from the land where you still hear the cries
I had to get out had to sever all ties
I changed my name, assumed a disguise
I've got an angry inch

Six inches forward, five inches back
I got a, I've got an angry inch
Six inches forward, five inches back
I got a, I've got an angry inch
Six inches forward, five inches back
The train is coming and I'm tied to the track
I try to get up, I can't get no slack
I've got an angry inch, an angry inch

My mother made my tits out of clay
My boyfriend told me that he'd take me away
He dragged me to the doctor one day
I've got an angry inch

Six inches forward, five inches back
I got a, I've got an angry inch
Six inches forward, five inches back
I got a, I've got an angry inch
Long story short!

Yeah, long story short
When I woke up from the operation I was bleeding down there
I was bleeding from a hole between my legs
It's my first day as a woman; already it's that time of the month
But two days later the wound closed up
The hole sealed and I was left
With a one-inch mound of flesh
Where my penis used to be well my vagina never was
It was a one-inch mound of flesh
With a scar running down it like a sideways grimace on an eyeless face
It was just a little bulge
Faggot
It was an angry inch!

Six inches forward, five inches back
The train is coming and I'm tied to the track
I try to get up but I can't get no slack
I've got an angry inch, an angry inch

Six inches forward and five inches back
Stay undercover till the night turns to black
I got my inch, I'm set to attack
I've got an angry inch, and angry inch
