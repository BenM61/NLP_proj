There's a new star in my sky
Only known you for a while
But my heart seems to surrender to your love
I'm a victim of your smile

Forever in love
You and I
Forever in love we both know why
There's a taste unknown
There's just one thing I know
We have to give it a try

Cupid's arrow struck my heart
But I don't feel anything
In the end there's nothing to win or nothing to lose
In this foolish lover's game

Forever in love
You and I
Forever in love we both know why
There's a taste unknown
There's just one thing I know
We have to give it a try
