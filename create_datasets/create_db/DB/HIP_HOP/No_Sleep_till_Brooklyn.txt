No sleep till,
Brooklyn!

Foot on the pedal
Never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job ain't a job
It's a damn good time
City to city I'm running my rhymes.
On location
Touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger
But a stable turntable
I do what I do best
Because I'm willing and able.
Ain't no faking
Your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast to watch all the girlies shaking.
While you're at the job working nine to five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden
Cold kickin' it live.

No sleep till

Another plane
Another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl
Another fight
Another drive all night.
Our manager's crazy
He always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus.
Tour around the world
You rock around the clock
Plane to hotel
Girls on the jock.
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way
'Cause it's worth your while.
Four on the floor Ad-Rock's out the door
M.C.A.'s in the back because he's skeezin' with a whore.
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back.

No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn, no sleep till Brooklyn !

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
M.C.A. get on the mike, my man!
Born and bred Brooklyn
The U.S.A.
They call me Adam Yauch
But I'm M.C.A.
Like a lemon to a lime
A lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women.
Got limos, arena, TV-shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes
Step off Homes
Get out of my way
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up
Before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rockin' this party eight days a week!

No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!

No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!

No sleep till Brooklyn!
No sleep till Brooklyn!
