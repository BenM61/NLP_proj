Watching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
