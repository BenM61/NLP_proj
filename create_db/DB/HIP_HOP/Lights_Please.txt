Yeah, I had this little bad thing something like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, something like The Wiz
But you see the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world and about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like "baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down for
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feeling we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feeling
You feeling when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause she be healin' that shit
And naw that ain't your girl, dog, but you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights please

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceiling
She say she wanna blow Ls, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryin' to put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been living a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like "baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow, the more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game
And ain't it shameful, how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make, coward nigga you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family, dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recording tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world but for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights,
For now everything just seems so right,
And how you make the darkness seem so bright,
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
Lights please
