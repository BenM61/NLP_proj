Color and warmth came into your world
It makes me crazy
When you don't get what you want
You scream and you shout
You're still a baby

Don't give me a line
Keep the lid on the bottle this time
I'm still a lady
I won't do it tonight
I won't do it tonight
No way baby

I won't give in and I won't feel guilty
(I won't give in and I won't feel guilty)
Rant and rave to manipulate me
(Rant and rave to manipulate me)
From the nipple to the bottle never satisfied
(From the nipple to the bottle never satisfied)
From the nipple to the bottle now the cow must die
(From the nipple to the bottle now the cow must die)

Power and wealth surrendering myself
It ain't easy
Embarrassing my store by opening up my door
When it's breezy

You showed me your force
Exaggerated stamina and energy
No place for that
No place for that
It's not that easy

I won't give in and I won't feel guilty
(I won't give in and I won't feel guilty)
Rant and rave to manipulate me
(Rant and rave to manipulate me)
From the nipple to the bottle never satisfied
(From the nipple to the bottle never satisfied)
From the nipple to the bottle now the cow must die
(From the nipple to the bottle now the cow must die)

Ain't gon give it, you ain't gon get it
If I don't give it, you ain't gon get it

I won't give in and I won't feel guilty
(I won't give in and I won't feel guilty)
Rant and rave to manipulate me
(Rant and rave to manipulate me)
From the nipple to the bottle never satisfied
(From the nipple to the bottle never satisfied)
From the nipple to the bottle now the cow must die
(From the nipple to the bottle now the cow must die)

You scream and you shout
You're still a baby

Don't give me a line
Keep the lid on the bottle this time

I won't do it tonight
I won't do it tonight
No where baby

I won't give in and I won't feel guilty

You ain't gon get it, I ain't gon give it
