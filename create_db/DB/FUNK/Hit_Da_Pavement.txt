Niggas hit the pavement
When I come through slow
In a six-four hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement
When I fall through the club
Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavement
DF on the beat
If you don't work then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement
Real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me
Real niggas hit the pavement

I'm in a coke white BM, just clocked in at eleven PM
Uh, while I'm blowin' my millions
Most of y'all niggas probably going to bed
The molly red, coming back home with the bread
Handle my metal, Hansel & Gretel
Cheese, keys, breeze, it's settled
This shit hot like a pot

Niggas hit the pavement
When I come through slow
In a six-four hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement
When I fall through the club
Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavement
DF on the beat
If you don't work then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement
Real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me
Real niggas hit the pavement

Yea! Fuckin' Snoop lovable
Yea, I'm searchin' through time and space
To find the funk
And reconnect the middle ship
Yea, and now this is quite some journey
Seven days of funk, baby

Niggas hit the pavement
When I come through slow
In a six-four hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement
When I fall through the club
Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavement
DF on the beat
If you don't work then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement
Real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me
Real niggas hit the pavement

Droppin C's for the G's
Hopin' my peas, battin' my eyes while crossin' my T's
Me and Dane spittin' game, doin' shows overseas
Forty years old, have no fuckin' enemies
Check checker bo readear letter mo wetter
If you knew better then you'd probably do better
Act like you know
Know not, better know better

'Cause niggas hit the pavement
When I come through slow
In a six-four hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement
When I fall through the club
Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavement
DF on the beat
If you don't work then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement
Real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me
Real niggas hit the pavement

I live with a maid
I won't be happy 'til my whole team paid
From my mama to my daddy, to my kids, to my wife
And all my kinfolks in the afterlife
I'm chillin' on the moon like man tonight
Big Snoop Dogg got 'em actin like
Money is the key to end all your wrongs
Mo money, mo hoes

Niggas hit the pavement
When I come through slow
In a six-four hanging out the window
Niggas hit the pavement
When I fall through the club
Chuckin' up the dub on you scrubs
Niggas hit the pavement
DF on the beat
If you don't work then you don't eat
Niggas hit the pavement
Real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me
Real niggas hit the pavement
