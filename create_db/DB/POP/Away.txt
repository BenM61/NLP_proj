Away, away, oh, away, away

This feels like the coldest day in a hurricane
Looking through a glass window
And ya screaming to the top of yours lungs
And the bells done rung and the crowd can't hear you

And all that I can see is a building burning
I just gotta rescue my baby
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone
I just wanna be here to pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking, and the only one
Who can save me is you but you wanna throw me

Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me
Away, away, away, away, oh why?

I gotta know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away

You used to ask why was I so skeptic of love
Girls, 'cause it changes, and it ain't got to be no real season
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that open, and the moment you walk in it close

Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help
Oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love, just ain't what it used to be
I confronted my fears with open arms, although you said
You will never give up on us, but now you blow me

Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me
Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I gotta know

I gotta know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away, oh why?
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away

Perfect we said we'd never be
So why is this happening to me?
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way

No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way

Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me
Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I gotta know

I gotta know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away, away, oh why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
