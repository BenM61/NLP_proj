Stand down, beat it in, eyes closed tight 
It was cold last year when you blocked me out 
Our ships went down on that night 
These hearts were drowning but you bought me out 

This time I'm held up by a safety pin 
Safety pin oh a safety pin 
Stuck and sewn up like a mannequin 
A mannequin, mannequin, mannequin 
You can call the god damn fire department 
That's the last time I'll ever let you in 
You can call the god damn fire department 
That's the last time I'll ever let you in 

Carve out, belt up, I can see 
You see me drowning but you block me out 
Our ships were sunk on that night 
These hearts were drowning but you bought me out 

This time I'm held up by a safety pin 
Safety pin oh a safety pin 
Stuck and sewn up like a mannequin 
A mannequin, mannequin, mannequin 
Just don't, just don't even use you lungs 
Cause that's the last time I'll ever let you in 
Just don't, just don't even use you damn lungs 
Cause that's the last time I'll ever let you in 

Bloodshot eyes and I look up 
You take the water from my lungs to fill your cup 
This is no longer fair 
This is no longer fair 
This is no longer fair 
This is no longer fair! 

This time I'm held up by a safety pin 
Safety pin oh a safety pin 
Stuck and sewn up like a mannequin 
A mannequin, mannequin, mannequin 
You can call the god damn fire department 
That's the last time I'll ever let you in 
You can call the god damn fire department 
That's the last time I'll ever let you in 

This time I'm held up by a safety pin 
Safety pin oh a safety pin 
Stuck and sewn up like a mannequin 
A mannequin, mannequin, mannequin 
Just don't, just don't even use you lungs 
Cause that's that last time I'll ever let you in 
Just don't, just don't even use you damn lungs 
Cause that's that last time I'll ever let you in
