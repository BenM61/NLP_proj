Broken, bruised and burned
But the lesson's never learned
Twisted tight and turned
But I like the way it hurts

I don't know what to do with myself right now
I can't think about no body else right now

I give you loving, you give me nothing
'Til I'm black and blue inside
You keep me falling, but I'm going all in
'Cause I still want you tonight

Broken, bruised and bad
But I fight because I care
And though I'm scarred and scared
No one but you can get me there

I don't know what to do with myself right now
I can't think about no body else right now

I give you loving, you give me nothing
'Til I'm black and blue inside
You keep me falling, but I'm going all in
'Cause I still want you tonight

I give you loving, you give me nothing
'Til I'm black and blue inside
You keep me falling, but I'm going all in
'Cause I still want you tonight

I give you loving, you give me nothing
'Til I'm black and blue inside
You keep me falling, I'm going all in
'Cause I still want you tonight
