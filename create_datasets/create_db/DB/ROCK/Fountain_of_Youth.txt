I think we better listen to these kids
We can't keep pretending we know what we're doing
I can't keep pretending I'm afraid
If you'll sit and listen
I'll tell you a secret

We can do whatever we want
We can say whatever we mean

I have waited so long, Mrs. President
Matriarchs and Teddy Boys, play in houses on the lake
How can we quit drugs if you're gonna watch like that?
Give me five good reasons you trust us with our future

We can do whatever we want
We can say whatever we mean
And if we don't care
Then who cares?
We've been dreaming of you
Drinking from fountains of youth
And if we don't change
Then who will change?
We've been dreaming of you
Drinking from fountains of youth

I think we better listen to these kids
I can't keep pretending that I'm still asleep
I can't keep pretending I'm afraid
I was too stoned to call you but I thought that you'd say

We can do whatever we want
We can say whatever we mean
And if we don't care
Then who cares?
We've been dreaming of you
Drinking from fountains of youth
And if we don't change
Then who will change?
We've been dreaming of you
Drinking from fountains of youth

We can do whatever we want
We can say whatever we mean
We can do whatever we want
We can say whatever we mean
