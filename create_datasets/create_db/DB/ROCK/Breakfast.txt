She gave herself
They took her to their hearts
Clapped their hands till sore
Once more eyes smart
Taxidermist gave life to Hugh
It sits and begs
And stares at you
Since when did you cook breakfast for
Lieutenant Paul in ruined mirador
This lease on life can tie you down
So precious is the jagged crown

Talk to me I'll stay these vagabond nights
Walk with me someone is waiting in light

Exchanging worlds arranging days
To suit a lover
Who'll never stay
Breakfast skies
Bring curtains down
Upon a crumbling lacquered gown
A crumbling lacquered gown

Ooh talk to me I'll stay these vagabond nights
Walk with me someone is waiting in light
