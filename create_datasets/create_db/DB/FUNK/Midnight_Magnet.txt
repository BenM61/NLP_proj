Late night interaction on the telephone
You called me up to tell me that you were alone
Talkin' 'bout the powers that could set you free
I rushed right over with my newfound energy
The knock on the door seemed unfamiliar to you
Do I detect a surprise or two
You said something came up and I would have to go
I look over your shoulder it's a girl I know

No circumspect
I won't forget
No light as yet
I'm so upset midnight magnet
No circumspect
I won't forget
No light as yet
I'm so upset midnight magnet
(Midnight magnet) 
You gave me kisses so unreal
(Midnight magnet)
You blew my mind, so what's the deal
(Midnight magnet)
I'm talkin' 'bout the way I feel
(Midnight magnet)

River eyes, I crossed the state line nearing down
Thinkin' 'bout the times the magnet turned me on
I closed my eyes one instant right on junction east
I used to be the beauty, now I am the beast
The comedy of errors took me to the cliffs
The pedal to the medal, now my gears won't shift
The last thing I remember was my mama's call
I woke up three weeks later in the hospital

No circumspect
I won't forget
No light as yet
I'm so upset midnight magnet
No circumspect
I won't forget
No light as yet
I'm so upset midnight magnet
(Midnight magnet) 
You gave me kisses so unreal
(Midnight magnet) 
You blew my mind, so what's the deal
(Midnight magnet) 
I'm talkin' 'bout the way I feel
(Midnight magnet)

How can you run from a dream living inside me
I say I care, it isn't fair, what's gonna be
I wanted you to love me, love me, love me
Like I loved you, loved you, loved you, loved you, oh

I thought you said you loved me
Midnight magnet
I thought you said you loved me
No,
I thought you said you loved me
Midnight magnet
I thought you said you loved me
No,
I thought you said you loved me
Midnight magnet
I thought you said you loved me
Midnight
(Midnight magnet) 

You gave me kisses so unreal
You were the magnet and I was the steel
Call it what you want to, but you know it was the magnet
Call it what you want to, but you know that it was wrong
No, no, no, no
No, no,
Do do do do
Midnight magnet
Dumb do do
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Midnight magnet
Midnight, midnight magnet
