I know you're getting sick and tired of me baby, this that I can plainly see
But deep from the bottom of my heart, baby, I know, you're hurting me
But just as sure, sure as you are born to die
But, baby, I love you, and you know, that's no lie

I'd rather fight a bear, baby, jump down in a lions den
Than to hear you keep on telling me baby that this is the end
But just as sure, baby, sure as you are born to die
But, baby, I love you, and you know, that's no lie

(Alright! Have mercy baby! Yes, yes, yes)

Yes, just look how you're doing me, baby, since1 you got up on your feet
You're going away to leave me, baby, I got this ...2 without no meat
But just as sure, sure as you are born to die
But, baby, I love you, and you know, that's no lie

Oh yeah, baby
Somebody got to help me
