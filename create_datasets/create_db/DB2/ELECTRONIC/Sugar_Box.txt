Lips like sugar
Sugar box

Since the day you walked into my dream
I have felt an older side revealed
Taking me and standing way above
Making me dishonest with your love

Oo! 'Cause I was always far to lonely to believe
You could want me back now
Prey
Oh! And it was always second chances I received
Don't you want me back now
Prey

Learning sometimes takes a little time
Holding out and hoping that it's mine
Falling out and falling in between
Turn myself around myself I see

Oh! 'Cause I was always far to lonely to believe
You could want me back now
Prey
Oh! And it was always second chances I received
Don't you want me back now 
Ah sugar box

Lips like sugar
Sugar, sugar box
Aah lips like sugar
Sugar box

Burning with the hurting of a child
Crying out and hoping that it's mine
Sliding out and drifting on away
I've turn myself around once in this game

Oh! 'Cause I was always far to lonely to believe
You could want me back now
Prey, prey
Oh! and it was always second chances I received
Don't you want me back now 
Ah ah ah ah sugar box

Aah she had lips like sugar
Sugar box
She said

Lips like sugar
Sugar Box!
