Uh uh (oh oh)
Uh uh
Uh uh
Uh uh

I think the whole world's crazy
I don't want to leave my bedroom
There's a devil on my shoulder
And a monster in the television
Set me up for failure
All I wanted was some options
But my only choice is leaving
Like time is not a crocodile

But I don't mind
I don't mind

Everything is fine and nothing matters
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
If I don't care

Pull the curtains back
I think my neighborhood's on fire again
The kids are not alright it seems
At least they went outside this time
The gunshot has gone off
But I am swimming in a footrace
There's no finish line in sight
And they already gave the first place medal

I don't mind
I don't mind

Everything is fine and nothing matters
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
And it makes it all okay if I don't care
(If I don't care)

Everything's alright (I don't mind)
Everything is fine (I don't mind)
Everything's alright (I don't mind)

Everything is fine and nothing matters
(Nothing really matters at all)
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
I slept through another day
And it makes it all okay if I don't care
