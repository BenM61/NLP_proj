They don't play the song on the radio
They don't show the tits in the video
They don't know that we are the media
They don't know that we start the mania

Eyes don't want to see but I'm making you
Ass is off it's seat and I'm shaking you
Walking down the street I'm the lady, ja'
Showing off my map of Tasmania

Soft and sweet and shaped like a triangle
Some girls want no shape and they shave it all
That's so whacky, hurts with the stubble
Walking round, look like an eight year old

I say grow that shit like a jungle
Give 'em something strong to hold onto
Let it fly in the open wind
If it get too bushy you can trim

They don't play the song on the radio
They don't show the tits in the video
They don't know that we are the media
They don't know that we start the mania

Eyes don't want to see but I'm making you
Ass is off it's seat and I'm shaking you
Walking down the street I'm the lady, ja'
Showing off my map of Tasmania
