Well, I can't cross that bridge in my mind
Did we dance? One too many times
Can I still feel the love as I'm looking at you?
Do we hold on or say that we're through? What should we do?

Walk away when pride seems to get in our way
And we wish love was like yesterday
Through love and through tears, sacrificing those years in one day
Two people turn and walk away, ooh, they walk away

Just tell me, how did we come to this place? Where did love go?
Cause we once had a taste, all those magical nights
Lovers in dreams till we hated each other again
That's no way to end

Walk away when pride seems to get in our way
And we wish love was like yesterday
Through love and through tears watching all other years
End in a day when two people walk away, walk away

Oh baby, how can you say goodbye
When there's still some love deep inside
And together we can make it right
Afraid to be lovers and say
Hoping that they all move and stay
Don't you turn and walk away, walk away

Oh, can't you see I love you, don't you walk away
Oh, don't walk away
Oh baby, through love and through tears
Sacrificing those years in one day
You'll never walk, will walk away

When pride seems to get in our way
And we wish love was like yesterday
Through love and through tears, 
Sacrificing those years in one day
You never thought that we could walk away
When pride seems to get in our way
