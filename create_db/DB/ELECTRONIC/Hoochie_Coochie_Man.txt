Gypsy woman told my mother 'fore I was born,
You got a boy-child coming, gonna be a son of a gun
Gonna make pretty women's jump and shout,
And then the world want to know what this all about

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

I got the black cat bone and I got a mojo tooth
I got the John the Conqueror root, gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you girls lead me by my hand,
And then the world will know the hoochie coochie man

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

On the seventh hour, on the seventh day,
On the seventh month, seven doctors say,
"He was born for good luck, that you'll see"
I got seven hundred dollars; don't you mess with me!
