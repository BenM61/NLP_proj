A time to laugh, a time to cry
And beat the darkness into light
We'll write our names across the town
Up is up and so is down

Forgive your lovers, but don't forget their names
And let their spirit remain
Stay gold, gold
You shine the light for us to follow, gold
You shine the light for us to follow, gold
You shine the light for us to follow

The stings our fingers just won't go
Chrome letters, outlines, arrows fall
The words took off, we watched them fall
Desire of our mind is now written on the wall

Forgive your lovers, but don't forget their names
And let their spirit remain
Stay gold, gold
You shine the light for us to follow, gold
You shine the light for us to follow, gold
You shine the light for us to follow

How vast the darkness
We disappear into the light
Follow the torch we made
In the end, we're all made of gold
And now I know, I will not be saved
Unless I follow
And now I know, I will not be saved
Unless I follow

Stay gold, gold
You shine the light for us to follow, gold
You shine the light for us to follow, gold
You shine the light for us to follow

If you lead, I will follow
