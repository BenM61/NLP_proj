I've been wandering by your room
And nothing's coming out
Like a spirit through the wind I keep flying
In a dream you point a [knife]
In another dream you die
Its just a dream that we had won to make [down in the night]
I believe that I've been cursed
Been drowned and reimbursed
Got the feeling I can't move without sliding
I'm a thousand miles behind, with a million more to climb
So it's you I hope survives without fighting
Been a soldier from the start
Been released and torn apart
Then inside the only storm, that's been raging
Its a dream so hold a knife
In another dream we'll die
Its just a dream, you wont get lost
Just get down in the night
