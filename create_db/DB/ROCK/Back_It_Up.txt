We in the seven forty five just rollin'
I see some okay chicks over my shoulder
They wanna know, they wanna know
What's up girl? What we doin' and where we goin'?
Y'all keep questionin' but y'all not knowin'
We not feelin' ya so keep movin'
We don't want to roll nowhere with y'all

Girl, you need to be up on me
Don't leave me here standing lonely
I'm just tryna get my groove on
Ha, 'cause we ain't playin', and I ain't playin'
So baby girl, let's do the thang

Now we dancin', everybody movin'
All the chicks in here shakin' they booties
Throwin' it up the fellas are sayin', "Oh wee"
Do this girl know I'm losin' control
How she shakin' it got me trippin'?
And I know I got this one I'm never slippin'
The way she lookin', I know she with it
So grab your coat and baby, let's go

Girl, you need to be up on me
Don't leave me here standin' lonely
I'm just tryna get my groove on
'Cause we ain't playin', and I ain't playin'
So baby girl, let's do the thang

Shorty, what was the deal?
All up on me girl, you need to chill
Outta control like a car with three wheels
I can't be with you, I can't pay your bills
What you doin' now you need to do lesser?
I thought I told you three feet no pressure
You ain't getting nowhere with your hand gestures
You're not finding a dude like me, so God bless ya

Girl, you need to be up on me
Don't leave me here standing lonely
I'm just tryna get my groove on
'Cause we ain't playin', and I ain't playin'
So baby girl, let's do the thang

Girl, you need to be up on me
Don't leave me here standing lonely
I'm just tryna get my groove on
'Cause we ain't playin', and I ain't playin'
So baby girl, let's do the thang

Get up on me
Back it up
Don't lead me on, baby
We in the seven forty five just rollin'
