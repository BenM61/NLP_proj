Look through these eyes
And tell me if you see
What in the world it is that's wrong with me
Please take my hand and try
To pull me through
I know it's wrong to try
To cling to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

Someone take my heart away
I don't think I can stand the pain
Do it soon without delay
I never want to love again
Love again...

Please take these words and try to understand
I can't be more to you than what I am
I've given everything,
I had to give
My life is all that I have left to live
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

Someone take my heart away
I don't think I can stand the pain
Do it soon without delay
I never want to love again
Love again

Umm...
You can have my money
You can take my name
They'll never help me
In this long lost game
I gave emotion
But you took my soul
I gave too freely
Now I've lost control
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

Someone take my heart away
I don't think I can stand the pain
Do it soon without delay...
I never want to love again
To love again...

To love again...
