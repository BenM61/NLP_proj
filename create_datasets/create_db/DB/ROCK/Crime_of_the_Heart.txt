Dreams that have melted now frozen like statues
Under the surface here lies the unknown
Love has a way of disguising its purpose
Seeing your pain my hand goes out to you

You should have known better than to trust him
How the pain shines through your eyes

Nothing hits harder than a crime of the heart
It breaks you up and it tears you apart
You just want to die, you've been so abused
Now you know how it feels to be used
Nothing hurts harder than a crime of the heart
I'm such a fool, I should have known from the start
I saw it coming and I feel I'm to blame
But love don't give in

I watch your face as you stare into distance
Eyes filled with tears that look so far away
Deep in your heart can you feel a resistance?
Love it just happens there's no-one to blame

You should have known better than to sacrifice
The stained-glass soul you hide

Nothing hits harder than a crime of the heart
It's the kind of feeling that pulls you apart
There's no where to run, there's nothing to say
You never knew that you could feel this way
Nothing hurts harder than a crime of the heart
I could have told you he was wrong from the start
I'm not guilty, but I feel I'm to blame
My love won't give in

Crime of the heart
