Is it a bird, is it a plane?
But beyond is lover
Is it a bird, is it a plane?
It's the superman lover

I'm stronger than a locomotive, yeah
That old saying is true
But I can't understand sometimes, babe
Why I'm so weak for you

Listen
I can leap tall buildings in a single bound
When it come to getting over you, baby
Well, I can't get off the ground

But they call me the Superman lover, yeah
They'd call me the Superman lover, yeah
But something's wrong, something's wrong with me, it's you
Something's wrong, yeah, yes, it is

Faster than a speeding bullet
I've out flown a few, yes, I have
But I must be flying awful slow sometime, babe
I can't keep up with you

I got X-ray vision
And I can see, see through steel too babe
I know there's something wrong with me
'Cos I can't see through you

But they call me the Superman lover, yeah
They'd call me the Superman lover, yeah
But something's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
There's something wrong with me, yes, it is

Look, look up in the sky
Come on look, look, look
And you'll see me flying by
Why don't you just look, look
And if you do, come on and look, look
I'm flying straight to you

They call me the Superman lover, yeah
They'd call me the Superman lover, yeah
But something's wrong, something's wrong with me, it's you

Look, look up in the sky
Come on look, look, look
And you'll see me flying by
Why don't you just look, look
And if you do, come on and look, look
I'm flying straight to you

They call me the Superman lover, yeah
They'd call me the Superman lover, yeah
But something's wrong, something's wrong with me, it's you
Something wrong, oh, yes, it is

Is it a bird, is it a plane?
What did you discover?
It's the superman, madam
