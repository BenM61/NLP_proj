Once in a lifetime, love comes along
And I know it's you that I'm waiting on
And that sweet promise of our first kiss
Keeps me hanging on, through times like this

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

Can't say I know what you look like 
But you're in my heart, you're on my mind
And I feel your love deep down in my soul
When I finally find you, I'll just know

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are
