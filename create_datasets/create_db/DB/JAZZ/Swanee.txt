I've been away from you a long time 
I never thought I'd miss you so 
Somehow I feel your love is real
Near you I long to be

The birds are singing, it is song time 
The banjos strummin' soft and low 
I know that you 
Yearn for me too
Swanee, you're calling me

Swanee
How I love you, how I love you 
My dear old Swanee! 
I'd give the world to be among the folks in 
D-I-X-I
Even now my mammy's waiting for me 
Praying for me, down by the Swanee

The folks up north will see me no more 
When I go to the Swanee shore! 

Swanee! Swanee!
I'm coming back to Swanee 
Mammy, mammy
I love the old folks at home!

Swanee!
How I love you, how I love you 
My dear old Swanee! 
I'd give the world to be among the folks in 
D-I-X-I
Even now my mammy's waiting for me
Praying for me, down by the Swanee

The folks up north will see me no more 
When I go to the Swanee shore!
