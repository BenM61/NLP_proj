The sea's evaporating
Though it comes as no surprise
These clouds we're seeing
They're explosions in the sky
It seems it's written
But we can't read between the line

Hush
It's okay
Dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soul mate dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soul mate dry your eye
Cause soul mates never die

This one world vision
Turns us in to compromise
What good's religion
When it's each other we despise
Damn the government
Damn the killing
Damn the lies

Hush
It's okay
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Soul mate dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Soul mate dry your eyes
Cause soul mates never die

Soul mates never die, never die
Soul mates never die, never die

Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
