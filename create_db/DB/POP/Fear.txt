Your fear came from a place unknown
Sat down, made itself at home
It called your name the whole night through
Until it got the best of you
It's wide awake and never rests
Follows each one of your steps
And it hits you hard with ruthless fists
Can I kill it with a kiss?

I wish I could blow it off
Or find a way to shut its hungry mouth
Change the locks and chase it out
I'll shield you 'til it disappears
All my love against your fear
It won't let you get away

It teases you with whispered words
Holds you in a cold embrace
I set the table, cooked for two
But it walked through the door with you
It eats from your plate, it rules the room
It's pouring poison on your spoon

I wish I could blow it off
Or find a way to shut its hungry mouth
Change the locks and chase it out
I'll shield you 'til it disappears
All my love against your fear
We'll find a way to shut its hungry mouth
Change the locks and chase it out
I'll shield you 'til it disappears

It's wide awake
It's wide awake
I'll keep watch until you sleep
I'll stay up until it leaves
It laughed too soon
Thought it had won
But my love will roar
Your fear will run
We'll watch it run

We'll change the locks and chase it out
I'll shield you 'til it disappears
All my love against your fear
We'll find a way to shut its hungry mouth
Chase it down the street and out of town
I'll shield you 'til it disappears
All my love against your fear
