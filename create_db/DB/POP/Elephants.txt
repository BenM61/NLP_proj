If the elephants have past lives yet are destined to always remember
It's no wonder how they scream
Like you and I they must have some temper
And I am dreaming of them on the plains dirtying up their beds
Watching for some kind of rain to cool their hot heads
And how dare that you send me that card when I'm doing all that I can do
You are forcing me to remember when all I want is to just forget you
If the tiger shall protect her young then tell me how did you slip by
All my instincts have failed me for once I must have somehow slept the whole night

And I am dreaming of them with their kill tearing it all apart
Blood dripping from their lips and teeth sinking in too hearts
And how dare that you say you will call when you know I need some peace of mind
If you had to take sides with the animals won't you do it with one who is kind?

If the hawks in the trees need the dead if you're living you don't stand a chance
You can lie there and say you are fed but there are only two ends to this dance
You can flee with your wounds just in time or lie there as he feeds
Watching yourself ripped to shreds and laughing as you bleed

So for those of you falling in love keep it kind keep it good keep it right
Throw yourself in the midst of danger but keep one eye open at night
