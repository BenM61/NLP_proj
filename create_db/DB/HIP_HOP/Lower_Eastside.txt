In this little session of the promised land
Where I lounge wit' my homies and I'm freakin' my friend
I gots the 6-shoota' down by my side, sittin' in the ride
Pop it in drive, I'm rolling through the Eastside

Lower, slower, down for the dip
Now hold up, check the sound flip that bitch
There's a party goin' on swingin' all night long
They come from mile around to see me freak their

But if a sucka' wanna trip struttin' up beat
I got a gang of hounds to make 'em pop teeth
I now this crazy ass fool, bringin' old sasson
I got the brass for your ass, homeboy thought you knew that

I got homeys on the South side
I know some vat's on the East side
Some my homeys wanna G-ride
We're brining up the lower Eastside

Los Delinquent's, trippin' up the place I hang
Hey, it's the guera loco wit the way I swang
See I be rollin' through this and my right hand man is Keemo
Un delinquent con el gloc en mi hand es mi Vida loca

I'm waistin' my potential funky wit' the lower Eastside fundamentals
Lower rides, place between the 5 and the 91, north of Velandra
I was wit' my su-man, my former kung-fu man
My name, Mr. Ives Well, I'ma roll this Erica to let me fingers twitch
(Who the motha'f*ck are you man?)
'Cause the lower Eastside's up in this bitch and

I got homeys on the South side
I know some vat's on the East side
Some my homeys wanna G-ride
We're brining up the lower Eastside

Well, let me think now
What do I wanna play I got some homeys a hop skip a jump away
Where I can always go and catch me a slug fest
(What?)
Tango family all the way up in the Midwest
Well, let me come back around the grounds where I lounge

The 40-ounce booze and lounge wit my hounds
That's where the homeys will be kickin' it
(Hey yo that's the N-double guera-5, isn't?)
Right, shh, escucha, here comes the man
But I know these streets like the back of my hand

So while the swiney guy be lookin' around
I be flippin' a frown, as I pump my shi because, the cuffs won't click
The charges won't stick I wonder when these people gonna get
The f*ck up off my dick there's nowhere you could ever take a drag boy

Because I break puts of drive-bys
Just a twist of the cap from the 40 in my lap
Wanna scrap we scrap, wanna blast I'm strapped
Tell me

I got homeys on the South side
I know some vat's on the East side
Some my homeys wanna G-ride
We're brining up the lower Eastside
