I've been known to lay around all day
Waitin' on that sun to go away
Well that's when I'm up and slippin' on my boots
And heading out that door to have a few

And then they call me Cadillac
And when the blue eye holler back
Say good morning boys let's go
Or take a ride to the rodeo
Throw the card for all the cowgirls
I mean some really know how girls
In the saddle or bare back
But they call me Cadillac

Well I've been know to giggle on a joke
Mostly when I'm smoking on my smoke
And most folks know it's time for getting down
When I reach back and turn this hat around

And then they call me Cadillac
And when the blue eye holler back
Say good morning boys let's go
Or take a ride to the rodeo
Throw the card for all the cowgirls
I mean some really know how girls
In the saddle or bare back
But they call me Cadillac

Well these hot little country mommas they turn me on
And I can hang there on that saddle all night long

That's why they call me Cadillac
And when they do I hollar back
Say good morning boys let's go
Or take a ride to the rodeo
Throw the card for all the cowgirls
I mean some really know how girls
In the saddle or bare back
They call me Cadillac
One ride and they're coming back
They call me Cadillac

That's right
