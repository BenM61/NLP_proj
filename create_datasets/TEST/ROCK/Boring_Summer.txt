Sold up the river while you were asleep
A bored little watching MTV
Your days in the sun got no end in sight
It's all family fun?
Another family fight it's your

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive for the remote control
We don't care
It's a boring summer
Taking a dive we don't care
We 'll change this
People in the window watching people like you
Both looking for nothing
And you haven't got a clue
There's a world outside, join it sometime
Think you're stepping out
But you're standing in line

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive we don't care
You can't change this
Don't come to the door it's like you aren't around
Can't hear a knock over the TV sound get down
Stationary in an easy chair
Your summer is over and the trees are bare
Kiss it goodbye?your days in the sun
Comfort in the country
'Cause you're not the only one 

It's a boring summer
Taking a dive for the remote control
We don't care
It's a boring summer
It's a boring summer

Boring summer
Boring summer
Boring summer
Boring summer
