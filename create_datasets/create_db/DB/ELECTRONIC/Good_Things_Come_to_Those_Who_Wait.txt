Its been awhile that we've been together 
The love we shared has meant so much 
And we've been patient, waiting for the right time 
Knowing that it would be wrong to run 
But tonight I know the time for love has come 
That special moment has arrived 
And now I'm sure this love we have is real 
And I know that our love will survive, 'cause... 

Good things come to those who wait 
And we waited long enough for, the time for love is right 
Good things come to those who wait 
Now I'm ready for your lovin' so lets make love tonight 

Light up the night, I've dreamed about this moment 
That you and I would be as one 
But making love is something that we should always cherish 
Not something we only do for fun 
But tonight I know the time for love has come 
That special moment has arrived 
And now I'm sure this love we have is real 
And I know that our love will survive, 'cause... 

Good things come to those who wait 
And we waited long enough for, the time for love is right 
Good things come to those who wait 
Now I'm ready for your lovin' so lets make love tonight 
Good things come to those who wait 
Let me take you to a place where you have never been before 
Good things come to those who wait 
We have done our share of waiting, now there's nothing, love is gone 

Good things come to those who wait
