In a dark room we fight
Make up for our lost
I've been thinking, thinking 'bout you, 
'Bout us
And we're moving, slow
Our hearts beat, so fast
I've been dreaming, dreaming 'bout you
'Bout us

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey 

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, and oh, oh

We're speaking
Soft
See the pain in your eyes
I've been feelin', feelin' for you, my love

And our bodies, are tied
Our shadows will dance
I've been achin', achin' for you, my love

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head

My love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves and I'm
Complicated, you won't get me, I have trouble
Understanding myself, understanding myself and my
Love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves and I'm
Complicated, you won't get me I have trouble
Understanding myself, understanding myself

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head

My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh, oh, oh, oh
