I saw her on the fences
Through all the borders
She's been a lot of places
Sharks in the water
I only want her with me
Bring on the trouble
Some never see her beauty
Nor see the struggle

I'm a refugee
Come around here
Come around here
You're a refugee
From around there
From around there

So go and tell your people
Bring them to my town
We gon' love your people
Let's burn one down
So go and tell your mother
Bring your sisters 'round
'Cause we gon' love your people
Let's burn one down

Yeah, let's burn one down

He saw a war was raging
Had to escape it
She told the youths get ready
They're gonna make it
Run for your life
She tells them
The walls are breaking
Peace should be in your future
It's for your taking

I'm a refugee
Come around here
Come around here
You're a refugee
From around there
From around there

So go and tell your people
Bring them to my town
We gon' love your people
Let's burn one down
So go and tell your mother
Bring your sisters 'round
'Cause we gon' love your people
Let's burn one down

Let's burn one down

I'm a refugee
Come around here
Come around here
You're a refugee
From around there

So go and tell your people
Bring them to my town
We gon' love your people
Let's burn one down
So go and tell your mother
Bring your sisters 'round
'Cause we gon' love your people
Let's burn one down

Go and bring your people 'round
Maybe we can burn one down
Go and bring your sisters 'round
(Well, see, I'm a refugee, and you're a refugee)
We can burn one down
