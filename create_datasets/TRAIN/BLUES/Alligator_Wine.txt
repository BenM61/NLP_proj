Ah ah ah ah!

Take the blood out of an alligator
Take the left eye of a fish, yeah
Take the skin off of a frog, yeah
And mix it up in a dish
Add a cup of grease swamp water
And then countin' one to nine
Spit over your left shoulder
And you got alligator wine
Alligator wine
Your porcupine
Is gonna make you mine
Is gonna make you mine
It'll make your head bald, babe
I say it make your toes freeze
It'll turn your blood into steam shh
It'll make you cough and sneeze
You gotta scream like an eagle
You gonna roar like a mountain lion
When you finished drinking
Good old alligator wine
Alligator wine
Your porcupine
Is gonna make you mine
Is gonna make you mine
Ah yeah wouh
Meet me at the stroke of midnight
By the swamp down in the wood
I'm gonna make you love me babe
Like you never thought you could
You gonna drink my magic potion
And your blood shut eye is gonna shine
You'd be scared forever
Oh my alligator wine
Alligator wine
Gonna make you mine
Your porcupine
Is gonna make you mine
Is gonna make you mine
Waouh Uh uh uh
