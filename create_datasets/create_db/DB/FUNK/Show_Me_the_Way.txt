Show me the way now
Moving step by step to love
Show me, yeah, the way now
Touching where I've never been touched

Everybody's looking for a reason
Making time and calling it love
But you give me all I've ever needed
Don't ever stop filling me up

(Show me)
Yeah the way now
Moving step by step to love
Oh baby, won't you

(Show me)
Show me the way now
Touching where I've never been touched

I've been used and I've been good at using
Running from the pain deep inside
But you make me feel the joy of living
And all the tears I've never cried, so

(Show me)
Show me the way now
Moving step by step to love
Oh, baby, won't you

(Show me)
Show me the way now
Touching where I've never been touched no, no

(Show me)
Show me yeah, the way now
I've been stumbling in the dark, baby

(Show me)
Show me the way now
Let me slip inside your heart, yeah

Baby this time we're taking
The long road together, oh baby
And I know that the love within
Will lead me to surrender

(Show me)
The way now
(Show me)
Moving step by step to love

(Show me, show me the way)
Oh yeah, yeah
(Show me)
I've been used and I've been good at using, boy

(Show me the way)
Open up your love inside baby, yeah
(Show me, show me the way)
Don't let me walk alone no, no
(Show me)
Oh, show me

(Show me the way)
Yeah
(Show me)
The way baby
