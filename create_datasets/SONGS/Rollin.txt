Yo yo 
This is lil troy 
Niggas we rollin.

When I come to the dance 
Them hoes get on the floor, 
Cause they know that boy Troy
Dont play no more,
Them big youngs be off 
The rocks and 
Ya lynch be like 
Water the time 
For the hit 
And the roll time 
Be sellin quaters 
Loud beats and 
Phat rhymes 
Is the key to what im doin 
I'm in the mix 
Cause I'm rich 
No time for 
Niggas ruin

We be rollin, 
Every day and every nite 
So keep it tight
We be rollin, 
Big troy in the place 
To be yall dont wanna f*ck wit me
