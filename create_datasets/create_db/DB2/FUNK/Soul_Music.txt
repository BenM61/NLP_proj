Lyrically shape me
Melody embrace me
Soul music
Give me my Father's direction
Heavenly affection
Soul music
Music for my soul

My heart makes a beat
Then my soul sings along
A song that encourages me
Still tells me when I'm wrong
It exposes where I am
But it shows me how to grow
Helps me see the love that my Father shows
Teach me, reach me
Music for my soul


My soul longs to hear
Your word through a melody
So that my mouth can sing the words that will make me free
Now my life can only reflect
What my heart has received
Causing my once blinded eyes to see
Direct me, correct me
Music for my soul


Sing a new song to my soul
Sing all night long
Dance to a new song to my soul
Dance all night long
