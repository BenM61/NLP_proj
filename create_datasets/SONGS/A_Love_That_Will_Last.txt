I want a little something more
Don't want the middle or the one before
I don't desire a complicated past
I want a love that will last

Say that you love
Say I'm the one
Don't kiss and hug me and then try to run
I don't do drama 
My tears don't fall fast
I want a love that will last

I don't want a just a memory
Gives me forever
Don't even think about saying good-bye
'cause i want just one love to be enough
And remain in my heart till i die

So call me romantic 
Oh i guess that must be so
there's something more that you oughta know
I'll never leave you
So don't even ask
I want a love that will last

Forever
I want a love that will last
I want a love that will last

I don't want a just a memory
Gives me forever
Don't even think about saying good-bye
'cause i want just one love to be enough
And remain in my heart till i die
I don't want a just a memory
Gives me forever
Don't even think about saying good-bye
'cause i want just one love to be enough
And remain in my heart till i die

So there's little more that i need
I want to share all the air you breathe
I'm not the kinda girl to complicate the past
I want a love that will last

Forever
I want a love the love that last
Always 
I just want a love that will last
Want a love that will last
