Ain't no way for me to love you,
If you won't let me, no
I know that a woman's duty is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned

Oh, ain't no way (ain't no way)
It ain't no way (ain't no way)
Just ain't no way, baby (ain't no way)
Ain't no way baby (ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

You know what I said to him?
I said, stop trying to be someone you're not
And if you need me to love you, say, say you do
Oh, then baby, baby, baby don't you know that
I, whoa, whoa, I 

It ain't no way
I'll tell you that it ain't no way,
It ain't no way
It ain't no way, baby, no

It just ain't no way (ain't no way)
It sure ain't no way (ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
