From Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight, while the moon is bright

He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the girls and boys
So dig, Santa comes on big

He'll come a callin' when the snow's the most
When all you cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you gonna flip when Old Saint Nick
Lays a lick on the peppermint stick

He'll come a flyin' from a higher place
And fill the stocking by the fireplace
So you'll have a yule that's cool

Yeah, from Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight, while the moon is bright

He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the girls and boys
So dig, Santa comes on big

Come a callin' when the snow's the most
Cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you gonna flip when the Old Saint Nick
Lays a lick on the peppermint stick

He'll come a flyin' from the higher place
Fill the stockings by the fireplace
So you'll have a yule that's cool

Have a yule that's cool
Yeah, cool yule
