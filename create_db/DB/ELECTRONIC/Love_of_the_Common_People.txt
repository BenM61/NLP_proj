Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do, hmmm?

Tears from your little sister
Crying because she doesn't have 
A dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she'll get by

'Cause she's living in 
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can

It's a good thing
You don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole
In your pocket and you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
You got to walk into town
To find a job

Tryin' to keep your hands warm
When the hole in your shoe
Let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
Somehow you'd better go home
Where it's warm

Where you can live in 
The love of the common people
Smile from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
And she can

Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit
The tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
'Cause we take 'em in stride
For family pride

You know that faith
Is your foundation
With a whole lot of love
And a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
It's makin' it strong
Where you belong

And we're living in 
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can

Yes, we're living in
The love of the common people
Smile's from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can

Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can

Living in the love of the common people
Smile's really hard
On a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
