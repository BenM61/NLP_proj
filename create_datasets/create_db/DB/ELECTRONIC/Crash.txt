She heard it all before
She  has a grand design
Barely living on borrowed time
Turn a blind eye
To see the shadow come
Never even notice
Having so much fun
One thing on her mind
It's just fun and games
Scott free
Baby wants to point the blame
Listen up people
Gonna spread the word
Break it down
'Cause you got to be heard

Hey I know I hope she don't crash

Barely living on borrowed time
Never stop to think how or why
An aimless driver lives inside of her head
She only needs to have her ego fed

Hey I know I hope she don't crash

Burning up baby
Like a falling star
