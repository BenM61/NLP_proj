I see you walkin' down the street now every day
You're pushin' by the people as you make your way
And you're walkin' proud now baby, you got your head held high
Want you to know that this whole world sees your heart cry

Oh, yeah now see, how hard you try
To make yourself believe

It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love

Maybe love shouldn't have to be so hard to take
Shouldn't have to feel that love until your poor heart breaks
And so why you tell yourself, you know there's no one else
Then it just ain't worth the waitin' anymore

Oh baby, don't you wonder
If there's such a thing

It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love

Oh, you better look in there, believe it
Even if it's too hard to
Yeah, someone who's been waiting
Oh baby, just for you, and love

It's only love

If I could I'd take you, baby, in my arms
I'll take away all love's blame and all love's scars
Maybe we could ride away 'til we get so far away
Then I couldn't see us coming back again

Well, there's something what you think of it
Then show me what you need

It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love

It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
