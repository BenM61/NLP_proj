If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is so expensive, girl, yeah
And I'm not just a little little bitty baby boy, no no

Otis, if you are 
Don't play with my heart, it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Baby, you know I will, honey, you know I will

Tell it like it is, yeah
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
Tell it like it is
I want you to forget your foolish pride, oh yeah

Life is too short to have sorrow (oh, yes it is)
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, Carla honey, baby, go on and live

I'm just tell it like it is
Just you can threat me right, go and find yourself a little little baby boy
I'm just tell you like it is
Cause I'm to good to you forget, don't you mess over me
