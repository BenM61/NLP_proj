There's no way I could turn you down
When I know that there's a chance to show you
There's no one that I'm shy around
But if only I could let this out
I could let this out
There's no way I could turn you down
When I know that there's a chance to show you
There's no one that I'm shy around
But if only I could let this out
I could let this out

Oh, my darling, I'm falling
I'm sorry but I'm not shy around you
Save me, be my baby
Call me crazy, but I'm not shy around you!
'Round you
I'm not shy around you!
'Round you

There's no way I could turn you down
When I know that there's a chance to show you
There's no one that I'm shy around
But if only I could let this out
I could let this out
There's no way I could turn you down
When I know that there's a chance to show you
There's no one that I'm shy around
But if only I could let this out
I could let this out
I could let this out (I could let this out)

Oh, my darling, I'm falling
I'm sorry but I'm not shy around you
Save me, be my baby
Call me crazy, but I'm not shy around you!
'Round you
I'm not shy around you!
'Round you
