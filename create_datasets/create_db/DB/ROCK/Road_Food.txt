Jollywood, jollywood, chippa chippa chee chee

Bonafide, certified women in the washroom
Road food
Better have a whiskey so I'll feel all right.

Each night smacks of new wonder
Catch her if you can, kathy was a man
T.v. baby blue wires
Smile and nod your head, dead is live is dead.

I hear you walkin' down the hallway
I hear you sneakin' up the stairway
I hear you in the elevator
I know my name is in the paper
Hey, tell me what's this stuff you're sellin'
And all the stories that you're tellin'
I hear you walkin' down the hallway
I hear you sneakin' up the stairway.
Road food
Appletown, appletown, chippa chippa chee chee
Road food
Hurricane wonder boy scratchin' for the scunge now
Road food
Old mark mars is alive and well, sir
Road food
Better have a whiskey so I'll feel all right.
