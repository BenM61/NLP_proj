I don't love, I don't give, I don't care 'cause
I've already been there
I don't want, I don't need, I don't take 
'Cause I had it all
I don't guess, I just know, what this is
Is a place to die from.

I am not what you see, you are real but not for real
I'm scared, I'm not high. I'm a man
And I'm all right
We are here, we are gone, and the rest are
Left to wonder

What is life, in the hand of illusion, what is life
To a man in confusion
What is right, for a life that is losin', what is time,
What is, what is, what is?

Take a look, open up, look inside, what is there
In your heart, in your mind, in your soul
There's the answer
Why you want, why you need, the side effects of
What you see

What is life, in the hand of illusion
What is life, to a man in confusion
What is right for a life that is losin', what is time,
What is, what is, what is?

I don't pray, I just know what this is,
Is a place to die from
