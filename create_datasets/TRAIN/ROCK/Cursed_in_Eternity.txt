My name was written with
Fire in the place you only
Can see when your time has come
When you walk down in the
Land of shadows for eternity
The demon flies in the blackened
Starless skies and crawls in
The bottomless depths of hell
The name which will be a
Thousand times cursed in eternity
Condemned to wander, until it comes
To the cruelest snake that crawls
The demon flies in the blackened
Starless skies, and crawls in the
Bottomless depths of hell
