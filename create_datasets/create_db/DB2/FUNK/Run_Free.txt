I used to know a girl, who had a dream
Her head full of ambition, her heart filled with pain
Walking the same walk, seeing the same faces
Wishing she could, trade places

Maybe I could fly away, she'd say
Even though time's moved on,
I still feel the same

And I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

Every good thing comes at a price
Sometimes you just gotta melt the ice
It's not a question of when, just how
After all this time, I've found

That I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

It may take time to find my feet
You'll get there sometime, they say to me

But I wanna be happy
And I wanna find my way
And I wanna run free
And I wanna fly away

I'm gonna be happy
And I just wanna find my way
And I, I'm gonna run free,
And I, I'm gonna fly away

I'm gonna be happy
I'm gonna find my way
And I, I'm gonna run free,
I'm gonna fly away
