Love thine enemy
Love thine enemy
But hate their lack of sincerity
Love thine enemy

I found this quote in a book and I thought of you
So I walked me out like a moth in the morning dew
And a million cigarettes later the quote reappeared
Now nothing about my love could be called insincere

Love thine enemy
Love thine enemy
But hate their lack of sincerity
Love thine enemy

Every idiot thing you say speaks of pain and truth
Because of the beautiful way your tongue can seduce
What's behind the mountain is a mystery
That's why after the quote I added: sincerity

Love thine enemy
Love thine enemy
But hate their lack of sincerity
Love thine enemy

He tried to come between us like a purple ghoul
Hypocrites especially practice the golden rule
I love what you say though sometimes it's mean
Without earthworms how else would the soil keep clean?

[Repeat x2]
Love thine enemy
Love thine enemy
But hate their lack of sincerity

Love love love my enemy
Love my enemy
But I hate their lack of sincerity
Love thine enemy
