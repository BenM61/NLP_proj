On heavenly rain
You fell into my life
Unforgettable smile
Unforgettable lies

In the name of the cross
Or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend
Or under a blanket of trust

The angels sighed
A little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes
We're going to set fire

To the house in my heart
We're going to set fire
To the whole damn world
I don't understand

The wicked things we do
In the name of the good
In the name of the few
The angels sighed

The little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes
Don't look at me
With your innocent smile

When the bed is burning
Around my head
When a war breaks out
It'll be no surprise

Your unforgettable smile
Your unforgettable lies
And I've got to stop running
To make my start

We've got to get together
Before we fall apart
They're pulling down the old slums
To build the new

They're bringing back the old rules
To please the few
In the name of the cross
Or a banner of love

With the hand of a friend
Or under a blanket of trust
The angels sighed
A little girl cried

The tears run rings around my eyes
Pull down the old slums
To build the new
Pull down the love

I built with you
Promise of tomorrow
You never kept
And you try to burn the house down

When I slept
The nation's in disorder
There's chaos in my heart
We've got to get together
Before we fall apart
