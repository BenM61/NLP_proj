You're who I desire, you light my fire
With every kiss, you take me higher
Feeling like your lovin' I just cannot resist
There's something that's makin' me hold on
There's no one I'd rather share my good lovin' with
But I promised I'd wait till I'm ready for this

One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way

I love your touch; it makes me crumble
I'm in love so much; look what you've done
Please, don't whisper anything else in my ear
My body, my heart, and my soul is high
Let me find the strength to get on up outta here
'Cause, one day, the way we feel will be all right

One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way

I love you, no doubt about it
I won't change my mind
Love's so true
If I had my way
I will make love to you

One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way

One day, we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman if I have my way
We will see Heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever if I have my way
