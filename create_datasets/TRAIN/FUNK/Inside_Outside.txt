Inside, outside
Inside, outside
Inside and out

When I first met you, boy
I would not give you a play
Your reputation as a playboy scared me away

But you persisted and
You captured me with all your charms
And you insisted that
The place for me was in your arms

But now things have changed
But now things have changed
You're acting strange
Got me so confused
I just can't take it anymore

You got me inside, outside
Spinning all around
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere to be found

Inside, outside
Hung up over you
Filled up with emotions
And I don't know what to do

Inside, outside
Spinning all around
Feeling like a puppet
Oh, I feel it like a clown

Inside, outside
Hung up over you
Tell me if you want my love
Or tell me if we're through

When we first started out
My friends said it would not last
They told me all about the hearts
You broke in the past

But I refused to listen
To a word that they'd say
But ever since
We've been together every night and day

But now things have changed
But now things have changed
You're acting strange
Got me so confused
I just can't take it anymore

You got me inside, outside
Spinning all around
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere to be found

You got me inside, outside
Spinning all around
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere to be found

You got me inside, outside
Spinning all around
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere to be found

You got me inside, outside
Spinning all around
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere to be found
