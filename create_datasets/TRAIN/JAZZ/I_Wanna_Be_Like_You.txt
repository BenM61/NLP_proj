Now I'm the king of the swingers, boy, Jungle V.I.P. 
I've reached the top, and had to stop 
And that's what's bothering me 
I want to be a man, now man cub 
Stroll right into town 
And be just like the other men 
I'm tired of monkeying around 

So woowooooh, I want to be just like you 
I want to walk like you, talk like you do 
You see it's true, an ape like me 
Can learn to be human too, yeah 

Now, don't you mess with me man-cub 
I made a deal with you 
What I desire is man's red fire 
So I can be just like you 

An' don't you mess with me man-cub 
Show me what to do 
Give me the power of man's red flower 
So I can be just like you
