Well, I got a little dance to tell you about 
A dance to make you bark, not scream and shout 
You ask what kind of dance can it possibly be 
I'll show you with the kids and Barkley 

It's called the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
Yeah, get down on all fours and do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
Now scoot around on the floor and do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
Pretend your name is Rover 
And when you do the dog, you gotta roll over 

Now pretend that you're a dog and that you have fur 
But you're not a cat, so don't meow or purr 
Just sound like a doggie and you'll have fun 
You can bark, bark, bark 'till this song is done 

And do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
You can let out a growl and do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
Now let me hear you howl and do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
The dance that no one can match 
Now pretend that you have fleas and scratch 
Scratch, scratch 

If you're feeling tired and pooped is what 
You're getting 
And you're not in the mood for any playing or petting 
Just lay on down 
But before your eyes are shut 
Turn around three times 
Like that great big mutt 

And do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
Ruff ruff ruff ruff 
Do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
Ruff ruff ruff ruff 
Oh, do the dog 
(Ruff, ruff) 
Ruff ruff ruff ruff 
Ruff ruff ruff ruff 
Ruff ruff ruff ruff 
Ruff ruff ruff ruff 
Ruff ruff ruff ruff 
Ruff!
