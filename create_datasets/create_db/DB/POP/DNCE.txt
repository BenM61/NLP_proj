Sipping on a bottle, 'til the bottle's staring back at you
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Pick a case of water, 'til the poison makes my body move
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
If he can, and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can and she can, then we can't be weird forever
Sipping on a bottle, 'til the bottle's staring back at you
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh

This ain't fire but it burns my throat
This ain't water but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E (dance)

Woah, if you ain't leavin' (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
Don't fight the feelin' now (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
Dance, D-N-C-E 

Sipping and I'm slipping even further into make believe
Whiskey got me wishing that you'd come D-N-C-E with me
If he can, and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can and she can then we can be weird forever
Sipping, and I'm slipping even further into make believe

This ain't fire but it burns my throat
This ain't water but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E (dance)

Woah, if you ain't leavin' (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
Don't fight the feelin' now (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
Dance, D-N-C-E (dance)

Yeah
Alright, let's see if you can do this

(Dance) Dance, step left foot, then the other foot
(Dance) Shake, right hand, then the other hand
(Dance) Shake your head like you don't understand
How to dance, how to dance, how to D-N-C-E (D-N? Wait you said that wrong)

Woah, if you ain't leavin' (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
Don't fight the feelin' now (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
Woah, if you ain't leavin' (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
Don't fight the feelin' now (dance)
You better D-N-C-E (dance)
