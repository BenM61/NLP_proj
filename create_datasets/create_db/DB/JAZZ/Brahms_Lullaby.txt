Lullaby, and good night, with pink roses bedight,
With lilies o'er spread, is my baby's sweet head.
Lay thee down now, and rest, may thy slumber be blessed!
Lay thee down now, and rest, may thy slumber be blessed!
Lullaby, and good night, your mother's delight,
Shining angels beside my darling abide.

Soft and warm is your bed, close your eyes and rest your head.
Soft and warm is your bed, close your eyes and rest your head.
Sleepyhead, close your eyes. mother's right here beside you.

I'll protect you from harm, you will wake in my arms.
Guardian angels are near, so sleep on, with no fear.
