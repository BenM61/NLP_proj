Tropical summer - balmy day
Sit around
You haven't much to say
'Cause the heat is on
The heat is on.
You know you're in the hands of fate

Now you're gone and found me you appreciate
That the heat is on
The heat is on.
You're on the road to Mandalay

Never gonna make it
Try another day
'Cause the heat is on
The heat is on.
The temperature is rising to fever pitch

The sun is getting closer and we all get rich
'Cause the heat is on
The heat is on.
Hot pants
I'm free
Calculated madness sure feels sweet.
The heat is on
Heat is on.

Summer
Summer
Summer dress on
Summer
Summer
Summer dress on

When the world gonna rattle when the heat is on.
Tropical summer - balmy day
Don't say much
Ain't much to say
'Cause the heat is on
Heat is on

The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
Heat is on.
Hot pants
I'm free
Sure feels sweet.
The heat is on
Daddy
Yes
The heat is on.
Tropical summer - balmy day
On the road to Mandalay

Temperature is rising to fever pitch. The heat is on.
