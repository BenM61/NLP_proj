One, two, one two, three four
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, It Master-Slaves me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I

It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it wakes and bakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I

You know that it isn't real
You know that it isn't real (you'll disappear in a black hole)
You know that it isn't real (floating out of control, oh wow)

It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it Master-Slaves me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I

You know that it isn't real
You know that it isn't real 

It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it wakes and bakes me
It overtakes me, oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me
It overtakes me, it overtakes me
It overtakes me

And I'm there, looking up at the sky
And I'm scared, thinkin' 'bout the way that I
Don't understand anything at all
And how it overtakes me, and I am just so small
Do I stand a chance?
