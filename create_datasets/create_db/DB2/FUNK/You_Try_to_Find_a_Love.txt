Crazy hours, party nights
Lady power, hardly right
Oh! The showers cold and light
Hot! And lonely every night

You try to find a love
Holding on, wanting love
You try to find love
You keep holding on,
Just hanging out
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night
Out and easy every night
How you see me is hardly right
A one and only, would be nice
Hot! And lonely every night

You try to find a love
Holding on, wanting love
You try to find love
You keep holding on,
Just hanging out
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night
Searching for love in the night
Hot! Sometimes I fell like, sigin' the blues
