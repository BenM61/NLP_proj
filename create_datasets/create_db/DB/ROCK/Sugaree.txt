When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon around
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

Just one thing I ask of you
There's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darlin' Sugaree

Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
Had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

Just one thing I ask of you
There's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darlin' Sugaree

Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

Well, in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

Just one thing I ask of you
There's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darlin' Sugaree

Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

Well, shake it up now Sugaree
I'll meet you at the jubilee
And if that jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

Just one thing I ask of you
There's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darlin' Sugaree

Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
