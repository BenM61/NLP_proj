And if you give me no joy, you better hold your distance 
Me tell the ghetto youth the best thing is self-reliance 
Live for yourself, that is significant 
Well Babylon, me nuh fool fi make you run come conquer 
Yes you know, these ghetto youths them well you could not pamper 
Tell them the donkey haffi Christ a mule you fi hamper

Sey them a top class and a brand us as the nigga 
Sey them a high society and we a small settler 
Well thunder, lightning pon crevice and corner 
Well judgement
