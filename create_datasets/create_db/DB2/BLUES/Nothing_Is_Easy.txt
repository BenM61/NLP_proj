Nothing is easy, 
Though time gets you worrying, 
My friend, it's OK
Just take your life easy 
And stop all that hurrying, 
Be happy my way
When tension starts mounting 
And you've lost count of the pennies you've missed,
Just try hard 
And see why they're not worrying me, 
They're last on my list

Nothing's easy

Nothing is easy, 
You'll find that the squeeze 
Won't turn out so bad
Your fingers may freeze, 
Worse things happen at sea, 
There's good times to be had
So if you're alone 
And you're down to the bone, 
Just give us a play
You'll smile in a while 
And discover that I'll get you happy my way

Nothing's easy
