Downtown's been caught by the hysteria
People scream and shout
A generation's on the move
When disco spreads like a bacteria
Those lonely days are out
Welcome the passion of the groove

The golden years
The silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I want to get down
You spin me around
I stand on the borderline
Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque

I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque
I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque

Tonight's the night at the danceteria
The joining of the tribe
The speakers blasting clear and loud
The way you dance is our criteria
The DJ takes you high
Let tears of joy baptize the crowd

The golden years
The silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I want to get down
You spin me around
I stand on the borderline
Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque

I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque
I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque

The passion of the groove
Generation on the move
Joining of the disco tribe
Let the music take you high

The golden years
The silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I want to get down
You spin me around
I stand on the borderline
Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque

Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque

Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque

Crying at the discoteque
