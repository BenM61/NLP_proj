Insight, foresight, more sight
The clock on the wall is a quarter past midnight

I don't love you
Heading to garden of love, ah
Life come seeking of love, of love

Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight

Now, now, now, now, now, now
Ah ooh
12 o'clock
Ah ooh
Rock rock rock rock the midnight rush
Ah ooh
Ah ooh

Now, now, now, now, now, now

Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight

I don't love you
The midnight rush
Heading to garden of love, ah
Life come seeking of love , of love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
