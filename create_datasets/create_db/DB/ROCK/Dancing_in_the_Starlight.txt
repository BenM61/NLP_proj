I was tossing and a turning
Like as ship out in the storm
And I could not feel the spirit
There was nothing there at all
And I could not dial the number
And I could not make the call

Dancing in the starlight
Dancing in the strangest forms
And I could not feel the spirit
Was a thousand miles off course

Stumbling in the twilight
There was no one there at all
I was groping in the darkness
Seeing dangers in the port
Tortured into silence
My back against the wall

Dancing in the starlight
Swirling in the walls
Just like Venus on the ocean
The figures on the wall

If you don't take risks
If you don't take a chance
You're bound to fall
Oh yeah sugar
You will surely fall

Crying for salvation
There was nothing there at all
I could not dial the number
And I could not make the call

Dancing in the starlight
The figures on the wall
You will surely fall
Dancing in the starlight
You will surely fall
You will surely fall
