All that I'm saying 
Is that I'm staying true
Why don't you see it?
Why don't you see it too?

I'm running, from this mental cage I'm put in
I'm running, to leave this state of mind
I'm running, I feel my body is chasing for something
My dreams can wake up too

Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something

Don't want to hurt them
But this is who I am
Chasing ambitions
Making my own mistakes

I'm running, from this mental cage I'm put in
I'm running, to leave this state of mind
I'm running, I feel my body is chasing for something
My dreams can wake up too

Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something

(Just a girl) Show them what I love, oh
(Just a girl) Never feeling worried, no
(Just a girl) I'm so sure what's up
(Just a girl) I know how my story goes 'cause I am

Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
Just a girl that's up to something, up to something
