Jingle bell
Jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell swing
And jingle bell ring
Snowin' and blowing
And bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell chime in
Jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing
On jingle bell square
In the frosty air

What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time
Is a swell time
To go gliding in a
One horse sleigh

Giddy-up, jingle horse
Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle
In a jinglig' beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
Rock!
