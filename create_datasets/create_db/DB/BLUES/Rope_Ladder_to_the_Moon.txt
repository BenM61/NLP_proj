You asked me to a party
To a house just by the moon
You gave me silver loving
The end was all too soon

You asked me to the theater
In a place quite near the sun
You gave me golden sunbeams
Your act was all in fun

Rope ladder, rope ladder
Rope ladder to the moon!

You asked me to a meeting
In a cottage in the snow
You gave me central heating
I can't forget the glow

You asked me to a weekend
Down by the stormy sea
You took me to a ceremony
And the sacrifice was me!

You asked me to a storm cloud
Up near the rainbow's end
Then you threw away the ladder
And gave me to your friend

You took me to a prison
And you said its chief was me
Then you locked me deep inside you
And thew away the key

Rope ladder, rope ladder
Rope ladder to the moon!
