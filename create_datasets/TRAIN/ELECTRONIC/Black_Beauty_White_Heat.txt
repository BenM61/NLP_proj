Laughing in the eye of needful decisions
Creating bad blood teaching segregation
Kills the revelation of truth overall
Breeding conflict in minds that are small
Marching to the tune of separate divisions
Leading to a path of complete collision
But if joined they'd rise to the call
Together they would not fall
The crossing of minds - a challenge in time
Great is the feat - the message of the deep
A step must be taken - for one to awaken
Great is the feat - as equals to meet
No lies without truth - no hate without love
Divided one is not complete - black beauty white heat
No death without life - no black without white
Divided one is not complete - black beauty white heat
Co-existence of black and white
Evidenced in the depth of night
Realize the power of the sky
Black and white together lie
Caleidoscope of many colors
Mixing without harming others
Crossing paths one and all
In equality they stand tall
The crossing of minds - a challenge in time
Great is the feat - the message of the deep
A step must be taken - for one to awaken
Great is the feat - as equals to meet
