Well honey can you take it
Can you really, really shake it
Can you move it to the left
Can you move it to the right
Now we're gonna shake, 
Shake all night
Get ready baby, do the town up right
Now everybody shake
Everybody rockin' to the Alabama shake!

Now we gonna start about half past eight
Get ready baby now don't be late
We'll get tired but baby
We're not stoppin'
We're gonna shake it 'till
We feel like droppin'
Now everybody shake
Everybody rockin' to the Alabama shake!
