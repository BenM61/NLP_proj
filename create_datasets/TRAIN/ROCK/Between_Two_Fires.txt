The sky doesn't know whether to rain or shine 
Doesn't know whether to laugh or cry 
We stand in the middle looking both ways 
We don't know whether we live or we die, caught between two fires 
And while the fires burn brightly both sides of the sea 
The man in the middle says that he's been had 
Yet they sing "We're safe! We're safe!" to a sweet melody 
And here we are in a world gone bad 
Caught between two fires 
Our history calls us and tells us beware 
There's a lesson to learn in what we did before 
Do we blindly walk on as if we don't care? 
Do we sit here and ask for more? 
Caught between two fires
