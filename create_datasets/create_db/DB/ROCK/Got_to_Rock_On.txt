It's no funny hanging around winter seems so numbing
Getting fat where I sit down do you suppose it's old age coming
I get this feeling I'm no good for nothing life has led me wrong

And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

Can't think straight can't think at all staring out the window
Hear the band I hear them call everything will disappear and

That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

The sun beats down upon me and it looks as tough that spring
Has waited long enough to get here she knows that I must
Sing about her future oh sing about her past I love to play my music
And I try to make it last but sometimes summer comes too fast

I got to rock on I can't be this way (cont.)
