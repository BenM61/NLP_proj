You see that's where you were wrong
My life is still going on
I'm broke and suffocated, with your actions baby
You thought that I would take it all

I'm breakable, I'm breakable, I'm breakable
But I'm not that breakable
I was not the way you thought, impossible
I was not the kind to stay around
I like to stand on solid ground

I'm breakable, I'm breakable, I'm breakable
But I'm not that breakable
I was not the way you thought, impossible
I was not the kind to stay around
I like to stand on solid ground

I know what I want
Not that breakable, baby

So you see that's where you were wrong
Baby I'm still going strong
Blamed and broken hearted, I was left half minded
I'm gonna make it on my own

I'm breakable, I'm breakable, I'm breakable
But I'm not that breakable
I was not the way you thought, impossible
I was not the kind to stay around
I like to stand on solid ground

I'm breakable, I'm breakable, I'm breakable
But I'm not that breakable
I was not the way you thought, impossible
I was not the kind to stay around
I like to stand on solid ground

I know what I want

I needed something more than you gave me
If only you have seen
I'm breakable, I'm breakable, I'm breakable
I wanted to dance, everlasting romance
You offered no chance

This is how it feels, I'm not that breakable

Not that breakable
I'm breakable, I'm breakable, I'm breakable
But I'm not that breakable
I was not the way you thought, impossible
I was not the kind to stay around
I like to stand on solid ground
