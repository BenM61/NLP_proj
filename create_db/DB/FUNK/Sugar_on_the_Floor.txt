You're a stranger to me
Still you give me your life
I toss it to one side
Still you're sweeter to me
When will I be sure

It's warm where you are
But my lips just don't burn
I feel so insecure
When you try to be kind
Could I, could I ask for more?
Feel like sugar on the floor
Sugar on the floor
Sugar on the floor

Looking at you now I know you only want to find me
Still I need a reason to leave the past behind me
There is no easy way
There is no easy way
To learn how to fly
I hope that I could care
When I turn around you're there
Should I, should I ask for more?
I feel like sugar on the floor
I feel like sugar on the floor
Sugar on the floor

Oh, oh, ooh

Ooh, It's warm where you are
But ooh I wish we could be closer
'Cause I'm living in a dream
And I can't show you
Still you're sweeter to me
When would I, when would I be sure?
I feel like I'm sugar on the floor
Feel like sugar on the floor

All I need,
All I need is somebody to love
All I need,
All I need is somebody to care about me
So I won't be wasted
Oh, wasted on the floor
Oh I, oh I
I feel like I'm sugar on the floor
