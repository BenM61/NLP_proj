Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
Nah, you better bottle it in

Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
'Cause you never know
'Cause you never know when
Your heart's gonna break
And that's a chance we just can't take

(Ooh)
You bottled it in
You bottled it in

You never got back at me when
When I most needed it
I would say I didn't mind
But you done it over and over
All the time
All the time
You better bottle it in

Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
'Cause you never know when
Your heart's gonna break
And that's a chance you can't take
Don't, don't, don't, don't (dammit)

When nobody calls you on the phone
Don't break your bones over it (bones over it)
You'll only leave yourself lonesome to show for it
And that's somethin', damn

I wanted everything but I think that I got only most of it 
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)
But I think that I, I wanted everything
Aw yeah, black tongue
[Booger?] with a black in the whites of my eyes
Black tear runnin' down the sides
And black blood in the chest of my soul
And it was daytime but it was black, black outside
(So you) so you bottled it in (bottled it in)

Don't tell them
That you love them (that you love me)
For your own sake (for your own sake)
'Cause you never know when
Your heart's a-gonna break
And that's a chance you just can't take 
(Can't take, hello hello)
You bottled it in
(Bottled it in) you never got back

Whoo
Alright
When I most needed it
Alright
Yeah
All the time, all the
All, all the time

But I think that I only got most of it (most of it)
But I think that I only got most of it
Yeah I think that I only got most of it
And I think that I
So I bottled it in
And I went to bed
And in the morning
I woke up with a black in the whites of my eyes
And a black tongue
Draggin' down the sides
