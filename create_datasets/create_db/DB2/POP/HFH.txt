I don't feel like smilin'
No there's nothing you could do for me
Today I just feel like dyin'
Funny now you seem to care if I bleed

It's too late for a fix
I'm a wreck over this
Done with shit that you say
Don't pretend like I'm overreacting again
Well excuse me for feeling this way

Yeah my heart fucking hurts
Yeah my heart fucking hurts

I'm not a superhuman
I could still break from all the pain
I'm not immune to losin'
All the games you make me play

Don't you think if I could that I would
Pull this knife from my back and move on
Tell my why would I want to just lay here and cry
All I want is your ghost to be gone

Yeah my heart fucking hurts oh oh oh
Yeah my heart fucking hurts

Go on, go on
Take away everything I own
What do you want
Why can't you leave me the hell alone
Too tired to speak
Why won't you just let me be
Let me be, let me be
Why won't you just let me be

Yeah my heart fucking hurts (My heart is breaking now baby)
(Now I'm saying that I got to let you go)
Yeah my heart fucking hurts (My heart is breaking now baby
(Now I'm saying that I got to let you go)

My heart is breaking now baby
Now I'm saying that I got to let you go
My heart is breaking now baby
Now I'm saying that I got to let you go

Now my heart (My heart is breaking now baby)
Fucking hurts (Now I'm saying that I got to let you go)
Yeah my heart fucking hurts (My heart is breaking now baby)
Oh my heart, my heart (Now I'm saying that I got to let you go)

I don't feel like smilin'
No there's nothing you could do for me
