Hold on, hold on
 
I'm trying to transfer affection,
Trying to feel factor four.
Trying to change my direction,
To go where I was once before. 
Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own;

And there's no way to carry on.
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide;
Nothing inside.

I'm trying to break all connections,
Burning a hole in my heart.
Trying to transfer affection
Is starting to tear me apart.
 
Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own;
And there's no way to carry on.
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide;
Nothing inside.
Don't try to tell me now that I'm out here on my own;
And there's no way to carry on.
Don't try to tell me that there's nothing left to hide;
Nothing inside.
 
I'm tired, but then on reflection,
It's so hard to open my eyes;
To try reaching out for affection,
It's so hard to break the disguise.
 
Hold on, hold on
