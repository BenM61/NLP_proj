Air pollution, revolution, you know I've had my fill.
Advertisin', computerizin', don't understand it and I never will.

Got to get back to some good time livin'
Got to get out where the air is sweet.
Got to, got to get back livin'
Work with our hands, live off the land,
Feel good clean earth under your feet.

Isolation, segregation, government controls
Call it a cop out gotta drop out.
You and me we gotta save out souls.

Got to get back to some good time livin'
Got to get out where the air is sweet.
Got to, got to get back livin'
Work with our hands, live off the land,
Feel good clean earth under your feet.

You're gonna take to planting flowers everywhere.
We'll find a world of simple pleasures we can share.

Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.

Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
Gotta, gotta, got, got, to get back living.
