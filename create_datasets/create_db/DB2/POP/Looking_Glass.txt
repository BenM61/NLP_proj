Looking glass, time has passed for my lady
And though the years have gone, the years have done no wrong
And your beauty remains the same inside my looking glass

Arise and your eyes, looking down on me
Reflecting the pleasure
All the joy, you and I

Love keeps you near
Love is the mirror

Looking glass, time has passed for my lady
And as the days go by, we're younger, you and I
And your beauty remains the same inside my looking glass

Life in the past verses crooked lies
Remembering the good times
Lazy days, just you and I

Love is clear
Love keeps you near
Love is the mirror

Looking glass, time has passed for my lady
And though the years have gone, the years have done no wrong
And your beauty remains the same inside my looking glass
And your beauty remains the same inside my looking glass
Yes, your beauty remains the same inside my looking glass
