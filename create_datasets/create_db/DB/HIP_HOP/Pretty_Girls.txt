Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke?
Ask 'em what do they know?
Ask 'em can we go? Pretty girls
Sunshine in the air, perfume everywhere
Girls are everywhere

Thanks to the flow right now what up
A lime to a lemon remind you of the sky when I'm fuckin'
And we on cloud nine for that minute
Admire your style and your physique
And I ain't trying to critique but you deserve a good drink, so whats up?
What you sippin' on? It's no problem
Black and gold models like i'm pro-New Orleans
But shawty I'm far from a saint but I got two A-mex's that look the same way
Wale, D.C. that's me huh, my Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fela
I ain't gotta tell ya they know about me huh
Come to D.C. and I can make you a believer
See baby I'm a leader they always from a Libra
And I ain't trying to lead you wrong sugar I need ya
So would you please listen to what I'm a need from you
Not for tonight, but for tomorrow's amnesia

Pretty girls

Hey girl, say girl, ain't no time to play girl
Now i hum to touch her and tell her i want that girl
Yeah they call me Gucci but I'm a buy you Louis
Yellow stones on my watch remind of a slushi (brr)
Girl so fine wanna ride me like a Huffy
Ugly girls quiet, pretty girls ride
Country girl, city girl, love to floss diamonds
Got her in the bed with the kid straight wildin'
Took her to the club bought her three long islands
She from Rhode Island, Atlanta i reside in
Big black diamond bigger than a black razor
Asian, black, Caucasian, i'm blazing
Persuading, so amazing, its amazing
how they stand there cuffed up patient
Wasted to the perfect time for conversation
My observation, tells me that shes Gucci's baby
