Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare

An inner feeling comes around
Let it sparkle and let it shine
Let it lift you off the ground
Make it last baby make it mine
You are the sun that rises
You are the moon that lights the night
You are what paralyses me

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will, say you care

Write my name into the sky
Keep the memories in your heart
Let the hours pass us by
I guess that this is the way we start
You are the love suprises
You are a fire burning bright
You are what mesmerizes me

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will, say you care

Say you care
Say you care
Say you care
No, no, no, no

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
(Dare, dare, dare)
Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
A love beyond compare
Say you will, say you care
