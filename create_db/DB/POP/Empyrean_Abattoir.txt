Winter isn't much here, just a flinching centigrade
Though the grass is olive jaundiced and the poplar branches flayed
Oh-oh, the poplar branches flayed

Before your hysterical silence, you came rapping at my door
With your body as a sacrament, your mind a killing floor
Oh-oh, your mind a killing floor

I've been trying to quell my anger
And not feel bitter about all the darkness you gave
But there's always those that

Just as [?], you tried to kill what you couldn't reign
And now you're back in Knoxville masturbating your father's pain
Oh-oh, masturbating your father's pain

Stealing from his aureation of filth
I repeat the wickedness to force reactions out of you
But it never hurts as deeply as I want it to

I think I'll mix my medicine and explore it 'til I'm dull
You made my sky a graveyard and my moon a funeral
Oh-ooh-oh, my moon a funeral
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh

Now it's just a system of subtraction, oh yeah!
I won't even turn around to notice your reaction
Now it's just a system of subtraction, oh yeah!
I won't even feel the hateful vibing of your faction
Now it's just a system of subtraction
Whatever happened to your style?
Now no one cares who you are
Now, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

You were once beloved by my people
Now it's bad luck to even say your name
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
When I see you, it feels so awkward
I try to be cool, but it's such a drag
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

I waited for you on our feral streets, smelling other people's piss
I bet you think you see me backwards, babe
You ain't even seen the Blikk Fang, babe
It's not acrimonious, now it's only systems of subtraction, oh yeah!
I won't even turn around to look at your reaction
Now it's just a system of subtraction
Whatever happened to your style?
Now no one cares who you are
You used to share my broken throne
Now you sing flat alone
Now, oh oh oh oh
