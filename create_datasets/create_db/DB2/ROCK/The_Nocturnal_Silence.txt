Gaze at the twilight in the blood red sky
The evil gods are rising
Shadows revealed by the darkened moon
Behold the diabolical signs

Nocturnal souls gathered through time
Preparing the unholy right
Seeds of blasphemies on the hallowed ground
Awaiting for the masters arrival

A freezing silence descends in the night
Cold winds whisper damnation
Deathlike shadows rising on the ground
The call of the lord of creation

Evil waits in the realm beyond the sky
As tears of blood fall down
Lords of lords, in a time before time
Are rising from the nocturnal silence

Ancient lords of dreadful evil
Enter through the seven gates
Legions of scornful daemons
Rising cross the bleeding sky

Fear the nocturnal silence
The return of the forces of evil
The masters unholy arrival
The circle shall be sealed
