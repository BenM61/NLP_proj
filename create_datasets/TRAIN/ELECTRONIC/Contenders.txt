We're going to stop this world from turning
We build it up, you knock it down
If you go high then we'll go higher
Beyond the sky without a sound all around

We've won, we've lost, we've counted up the cost
And we've evened out the scores we are contenders

I'm telling you so pay attention
These words of truth come from above
In God we trust and he has told me
I need you now and I'm talking love

We want a piece of what you're selling
Put up your hands and face the wall
How much it costs there is no telling
How much it costs to walk so small, and we're so tall

In truth we dare, we people just don't care
We've got you running scared we are contenders
You're black, or white, Arab, Christian, Israelite
We are hiding in plain sight we are contenders

Don't bother asking for a favor
I always get all that I want
Though some are foolish we are braver
Than those who do not have a bomb

Forget the turning of the seasons
Let's escalate and never stop
And yes we've talked but for no reason
Let's start again right from the top, countdown

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Got the world on a string but it ain't got that swing
You speed it up we slow it down
A frontier wilder than the West ever was
No sheriff round this outlaw town

So Superman if you're listening
Help us out you're on the team
For truth and justice, the American way
The fight for right's not what it seems with laser beams

With gun and sword there is no reward
But we're fighting on we are contenders
We've won, we've lost and we've counted up the cost
And we've evened out the scores we are contenders

You're Black, or White, Arab, Christian, Israelite
We are hiding in plain sight we are contenders
No virgin birth is going to claim the earth
We know what you're worth we are contenders
