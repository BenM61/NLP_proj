Everything I say is wrong
Everything I do goes wrong
My honey's tellin' me, "so long"
What am I gonna do?

'Cause there's just no more dreams you dream
No more tears to cry
Nothin' left to say, but
Baby baby, bye-bye
I once was your sweetheart
Now you found a new sweetheart
Hate to see ya break my heart
But if you must go, then go

'Cause there's just no more dreams to dream
No more tears to cry
Nothin' left to say but
Baby baby, bye-bye
('Cause there's just no more dreams to dream)
(No more tears to cry)
(Nothin' left to say but)
(Baby baby, bye-bye)

I'll do my best to get by
I'll do my best to get by
I'll love you 'til I die
Here all left alone

'Cause just no more dreams to dream
No more tears to cry
Nothin' left to say but
Baby baby, bye-bye
Baby baby, bye-bye
