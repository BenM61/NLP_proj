Love has got me caught up
Drives me to a door
Every little piece inside is knocking at your door
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Can't you see the signs?
Written by a maniac, his love has made me blind
Can't deny the poison gets me high
Just a little taste
Shook my life, it hit me like a drum

Hey, hey, hey
I feel the mambo, aiya
A mambo, aiya
You make my heart move
Hey, hey, hey
Just like a mambo, aiya
I let it out
A mambo, a-heya

You were my obsession
Stuck into my heart
Never let you hit or run
Never set apart
Do it, do it, do it
Come and stay tonight
Wake up a little fantasy
Take a little bite
Can't you see? your love addicted me
Just a little taste, shook my life, it hit me like a drum

Play the game, and get me hypnotized
Wanna feel the vibe
So hey now Mr. whiz
Get the magic done
Let me sway up high
Baby, here I am
