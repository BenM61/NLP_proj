If you should walk away
Take this broken heart
And if you walk away
You'll never know what's left behind
Go on and get away
Don't you leave a trace
And as you walk away
You can take most every...

Everything but my pride
Everything but the rings on my finger 
Everything but my pride

I like the room this way
I like this bed unmade
We never laughed enough
But you laugh alone today
So don't you ever say
You feel that you've had all you can take
You've already taken...

Everything but my pride
Everything but the rings on my finger 
Everything but my pride
Everything but the rings on my finger 

I never thought it'd come to this
(Keep walkin')
Never known a night like this
(Keep walkin')
Never thought you'd walk away
(Keep walkin')
But you did
When we'd almost made it

Everything (but my pride)
Everything (but the rings on my finger)
Everything but my pride
You can take everything but you'll leave me
Leave me with my pride
Everything,
Everything but my pride
Everything but the rings on my finger
