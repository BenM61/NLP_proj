There's a father in your sweetest dreams
Who's always there to meet your needs
He never ever let you down

There's a mother in your heart of hearts
Who always plays the perfect part
She never lets you hit the ground

This is the need of children
These are their tender dreams
And oh, how it hurts when they don't come true

That's why I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

Father, little children must grow up
And to grow we've got to learn to trust
And to trust we've got to cling to You

And when You tell me You will hold me close
It's the very thing I need the most
But it's the very hardest thing to do

I've got this pain inside me
It speaks to me loud and clear
When there's so much to gain there's always so much to lose

That's why I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

Keep calling me, drawing me closer
Don't let me hold back
Whatever it takes I must break through

The heart of a child is broken
But his time has come
Whatever he lost, I'll find in You

That's why I'm learning to trust in you
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

Hard to do, learning to trust in You
So hard to do, learning to trust, it's so hard to do
