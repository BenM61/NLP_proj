I'm a happy man
I made my choice in life
I chose to settle down
I chose to take a wife

And I take pleasure in my quiet
Hearth and happy home
I never gave my heart
Its chance to roam

I could have been a sailor
And sailed the seven seas
The wind in my face all day
Can you taste the salty breeze?

I could have been a lover
Watchin' waves before me part
But I settled for safer harbors of my heart

I'm a lucky man
I'm the envy of my peers
I never ask for favors
Oh, and I never show my fears

Surrounded by too many friends
I am a one-man band
With all the trappings of a life
Lived second-hand

I could have been a sailor
Rollin' through the night
My sails before the wind
Where the star's my only light

I could have been a dreamer
Yeah, but dreams just fall apart
So, I settled for safer harbors of my heart

And I take pleasure in my quiet
Hearth and happy home
I never gave my heart
Its chance to roam

I could have been a sailor
And sailed the seven seas
Is the wind in your face all day
And can you taste the salty breeze?

I could have been a dreamer
And watch the waves before me part
But I settled for safer harbors

Oh, sailor, sailed the seven seas
Is the wind in your face all day?
I can taste the salty breeze

Oh lover, I can see the waves before you part
Well, I settled for safer harbors of my heart, of my heart
