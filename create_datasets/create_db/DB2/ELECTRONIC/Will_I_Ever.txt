Nanana

I don't care to let it show, 
Therefore you will never know. 
What I really feel inside, 
And how I lay awake at night. 

Will I ever fall in love, 
And if I do will it be with you? 
Will I ever fall in love, 
And will you be the one for me? 

Will I ever fall in love, 
And if I do will it be with you? 
Will I ever fall in love, 
And will you be the one for me?

I guess it's all in my head, 
And I will be alone instead. 
Dreaming of a night with you, 
And all the things that we would do. 

Will I ever fall in love, 
And if I do will it be with you? 
Will I ever fall in love, 
And will you be the one for me? 
And will you be the one for me? 
And will you be the one for me?
