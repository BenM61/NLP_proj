Deep in the heart 
Love has many ways 
Of touching your emotions 
Taking control of you 
And even in thought 
Love can make you change 
There's no way of taking control 
When it's part of you 

Well you could be a married man 
With two kids and a good woman 
And you could give your heart and soul 
I swear it don't mean nothin' 
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Boy makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm telling you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
When ever true love takes hold of you 

There's never a time 
Cause love will let you know 
Love appears at the worst and even the best of times 
Takes over your mind 
Your heart is not your own 
There's no way of controlling love 
It controls your life 

Well you could be a faithful girl 
With a good heart and good intentions 
And you could never leave your home 
I swear there ain't no preventions 
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Boy makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm telling you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
When ever true love takes hold of you 

There's nothin love can't make you do 
When love takes hold of you 
You can have the purest heart 
And the finest attitude 
But I swear that don't mean nothin 
When your heart's under a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Love makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm tellin' you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
Whenever true love takes over you (Oh Baby) 

You never know

You're never gonna know it baby 
Who you're gonna love
