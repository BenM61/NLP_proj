Well, what do you know, he smiled at me in my dreams last night
My dreams are getting better all the time
And, what do you know, he smiled at me in a different light
My dreams are getting better all the time

To think that we were strangers a couple of nights ago
And though it's a dream, I never dreamed he'd ever say hello
Oh, maybe tonight I'll hold him tight when the moonbeams shine
My dreams are getting better all the time
