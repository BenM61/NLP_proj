Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
It's a mean old ball they call moonshine
Red red wine so mellow and fine
Come home at night with a-swimmin' in the head
Reach for the pillow Mr. whole darn bed
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Gin is a drink so mellow and slow
Get a little taste and you want some more
Start out walking and you just can't go
Reach for the knob Mr. whole darn door
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
It's a low down dog's life spending on the bar
Dusk till dawn then that's were you are
Out on a party get groovin' tight
Come home and forget to kiss your baby good night
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I keeps on drinking, takes all my goals
Every monday morning my head is sore
Whiskey gin and fine so doggone fine 
I'm gonna try you just one more time
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
