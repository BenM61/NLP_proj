I'm Downtown Venus
And I'm trying to be by myself myself
Habitual dreamers
And no one dreams enough to get me home
I'm Downtown Venus
And they're trying to divine myself
My self ( and they keep saying)
You could be into you but
You don't know what you're like
Yeah you would be into you
But you don't know what you're like
I'm Downtown Venus
And it's alright to kiss my life
My life
I got misdemeanors
Mounting up for sleeping on the "nows"
I'm Downtown Venus
And I can't get behind my worth
My worth
(but they keep saying)
You could be into you but
You don't know what you're like
Yeah you would be into you
But you don't know what you're like
I'm Downtown Venus
Where simplicity is always hurt
Always hurt
I can't stop screaming
'Cause I'm failing to entertain all
Of my selves
I'm Downtown Venus
And I'm constantly remind myself
Myself
(by saying)
I could be into me but
I don't know what I'm like
Yeah
I could be into me but
I don't know what I'm like
