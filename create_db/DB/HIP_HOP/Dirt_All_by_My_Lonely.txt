"Hey!"	"Can't nobody hold me.."

[Treach]
So niggaz wan' take it there, huh?
Heh..
See y'all don't know what the f*ck goin on
I know what time it is yo

It's time to erase a face in force in fact an inferno
Rise in my eyes, these twin 9'sll make em learn though
You poppin, plottin, plannin, half-steppin, threatenin
The streets clap loud like like thunderCLOUDS with the weapon
I'm steppin, to clarify, lookin with the hawk
in the arrow eye, turn the biggest part of your ass
into the narrow side, I'm that case you place, nigga
Tie yo' bitch, to the shitter nigga, throw yo' stinkin ass
by the liver nigga, need beef, I rag fags
Scream peace, get dragged dad
Gettin busy like Rashid street, in Baghdad
Havin your kids askin why did they have to drag dad, past
cause you'll be the last ass to blast fast
Way, above the rim
Word to Birdie I'm from Jersey leavin niggaz actin nerdy
Back sturdy, my dirt, by my lonely, F*CK with dis
Doin hits with more clutch, than the stick, so COME ON

Chorus: Treach

I do my dirt all by my lonely "Hey!" Find the phony
Past the mass, one deep, yeah the only
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin patrollin in a stolen black Cougar
I do my dirt all by my lonely "Hey!"  "Hey!"
	"Can't nobody hold me.. I do my dirt all by lonely"
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin patrollin in a stolen black Cougar

[Vinnie]
See I'm a one man dynasty; motherfucker
every artist on your label don't equal HALF of me
Rippin lyrics like they supposed to be, most'll be
plottin dreamin and scheamin to get CLOSE to me
Cause I spit shit, rip shit quick, and I'm sick wit
lyrics to MASH that ass is what I'm equipped wit
So fine-tune that bullshit, bring your best competitor
I'll be on that ass as if I was a fuckin Predator
Niggaz want to battle at a show, yeah I'll set it up
I go toe to toe, blow for blow and leave it wetted up
My time to hypnotize you, OK?
Never disrespectin the laws of Nature -- Obey Yo' Thirst
Vin Rock'll serve as the quenchin
Here's the last thing I'd like to mention
That when it's time to set it off, trust me son
I ain't the motherfuckin click, I'm the motherfuckin one
I do my dirt all by my lonely..

[Treach]
I roll with hundreds, sometime thousands, maybe a little more
But don't need NAR' a motherfucker when it's time for the war!
Some of these niggaz on the streets be actin so sweet
Talkin bout stalkin black like it ain't gon' get back to me WHAT?
What about them MC's after me (hahahaha)
Come see the first rappers laid flat on Banned From TV
Part 3 in 3-D, shot right in Jersey
On the corner with the goners lookin straight up at me (whoo!)
So f*ck prolongin, I'm way PAST the strongarmin
Played hisself tonight, so he'll be GONE  BY  THE  MORNING
Sneak up, creep up, you out of pocket, the rule's no second chance
Lift a bitch out his shoes, watch the news

Chorus 2X
