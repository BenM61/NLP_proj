If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by

Make me believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve, in private
'Cause each time that I see you, I break down and cry
Walk on by, walk on by (don't stop), just walk on by (don't stop)

Oh 'cause I just can't get over losing you
And if I seem, broken and blue
Walk on by (just walk on by), walk on by (just walk on by)

Foolish pride, is all I have left
So let me hide the tears and all the sadness
That you gave me when you said goodbye
When you walked on by (don't stop), when you walked on by (don't stop)
Just walk on by, just walk on by

Walk on by (just walk on by), walk on by (just walk on by)
Foolish pride is all that I have left
So let me hide these tears and all the sadness
That you gave me when you said goodbye
Just walk on by (don't stop), just walk on by (don't stop)
That you really gotta go so walk on by (don't stop)
Said you really gotta go so walk on by (don't stop)
Baby leave me never see the tears I cry (don't stop)
Baby leave me never see the tears I cry (don't stop)
Don't stop
Just walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)
