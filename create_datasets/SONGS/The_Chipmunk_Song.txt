All right you Chipmunks
Ready to sing your song
I'll say we are, yeah
Let's sing it now
Okay, Simon?
Okay
Okay, Theodore?
Okay
Okay, Alvin? Alvin? Alvin
Okay

Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good but we can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
Me, I want a hula hoop
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late

Okay fellas, get ready
That was very good, Simon
Naturally
Very good Theodore
Ah, Alvin, you were a little flat, watch it
Ah, Alvin, Alvin, Alvin
Okay

Want a plane that loops the loop
I still want a hula hoop
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late

Very good, boys
Let's sing it again, yeah, lets sing it again
No, That's enough, lets not overdo it
What do you mean overdo it?
We want to sing it again
Now wait a minute, boys
Why can't we sing it again?
Alvin, cut that out Theodore, just a minute
Simon will you cut that out, boys
