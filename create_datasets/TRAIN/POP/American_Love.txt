I'm lying wide awake in bed
My eyes are closed just like I'm dead
My friends all think that I'm a bore
But I don't need them anymore
I don't get up I don't go out
I have no life to speak about
It feels so good to leave the blame with you
That's what I do
I'm going down
Come around
Watch me when I hit the ground
Give me just one fix of your
Your sweet American love
I go blind
Lose my mind
Leave the world I know behind
Just to feel it one last time
Sweet american love
My telephone is off the hook
My eyes are closed I'm scared to look
I bet you're happy now you're free
But what about poor little me
I draw your picture on the wall
My phone is dead and still your call
My mama asked I told her I get by
That's such a lie
I'm going down
Come around
Watch me when I hit the ground
Give me just one fix of your
Your sweet American love
I go blind
Lose my mind
Leave the world I know behind
Just to feel it one last time
My sweet American love
I've kept the things you gave to me
The air is clear but I can't see
And a cheerful radio boasts that " Love is in the air"
But it's so full of shit
A Sony is it?
So what D'ya you have to leave me for
Was it my hair, was I such a bore
Well you know baby
That you were always my only choice
(goin' down, come around, watch me when I hit the ground)
Gimme just one fix of your, your American love, american love
(I go blind, lose my mind, leave the world I know behind)
Just to feel it one last time
Oh Damn You
