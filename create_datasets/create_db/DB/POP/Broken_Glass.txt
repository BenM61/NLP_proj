I'm on a highway full of red lights
I've lost so many long nights
Felt words that cut like knives
I know, I know they're gonna
Say what they wanna
I know they're gonna
Say what they want (want want)

But I feel it changing
I can taste it, I'm on the wave and
I won't waste it
I have been patient
But I'm not waiting anymore
Not anymore, no

I'm gonna dance on broken glass
Ey, on broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash (uh)
That ceiling crash

So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks
I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go

(Ooh, ooh, ooh) yeah here I go, here I go
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) and here I go, here I go

So I bet on me and my own heartbeat
When all the odds are piling
Like bricks around my feet
You know you know it's more than
More than just for me
You know it's worth it
I still believe, yeah yeah

I'm gonna dance on broken glass
Ey, on broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash (uh)
That ceiling crash

So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks
I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go

(Ooh, ooh, ooh) yeah here I go, here I go
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) and here I go, here I go

Through to the other side, baby I'll survive
'Cause you know I am a fighter
Through to the other side, baby I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm a survivor

Through to the other side, baby I'll survive
'Cause you know I am a fighter
Through to the other side, baby I'm on fire (on fire, fire) oh!

I'm gonna dance on broken glass
Ey, on broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash (uh)
That ceiling crash

So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks
I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go

(Oh, oh, oh) yea here I go, here I go
(Oh, oh, oh) and here I go, here I go
