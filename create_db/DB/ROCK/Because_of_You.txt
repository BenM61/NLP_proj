Because of you
The tears dead in my eyes
They freeze until I'm blind
The eyes a gift from you

Because of you
The scratches on my face
Will never be erased
By someone else's warmth

Because of you
The boys will always say
The bitch is back again
So none of you are save

Because of you
The winter feeds my heart
While summer blows and burns
My disappearing youth

My love is gone
Never feel again
Because of love
I feeeeel nothing

Because of you
I'll never feel again
The agony of pain
Will never bruise or start

Because of you
Our passion tends to lead
With all my lovers fate
With pieces from my heart

My love is done
Never feeeeel again
Because of love
I feel nothing

Because of love
I feel nothing

Because of you
Because of you
Because of love
I feeeeeel nothing
Because of love
I feel nothing
