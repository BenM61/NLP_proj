Never been so inside
When I give into you
Never been so existent
You can't know unless you feel it, 
Come back bodies aching from the want and the waiting
I kept this pain when you're leaving
Never felt this before
Never felt this before

Is it written on my back, take it back and then let it go (let it go)
Is it written on my back, take it back and then let it go

Every day is the day that you saved me
Light into darkness cut on the sharpness of you
Never been so inside and falling into you
Never been so resistant
You can't fall unless you feel it, 
Come back bodies aching from the want and the waiting

Coming down with a sickness
Stay under control
Steady under control

Is it written on my back, take it back and then let it go (let it go)
Is it written on my back, take it back and then let it go
Every day is the day that you saved me
Light into darkness cut on the sharpness of you
(I want to love you babe)
Come back bodies aching from the want and the waiting
I kept this pain when you're leaving
Never felt this before
Never felt this before
Is it written on my back, take it back and then let it go (let it go)
Is it written on my back, take it back and then let it go
