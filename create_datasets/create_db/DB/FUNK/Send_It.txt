Send it
Send it

Send it, send it
Up, up and away
You had it for a day
Send it, send it
Like a puff of smoke
Spread a little hope

Never think at all that You possess
'Cause it will never bring You happiness
Love has its own will
Take what You need to make each day sweet
But then just like grains of wheat
When it's over
You've got to blow it to the fans of the windmill

Send it, send it
Just like it came to Me
I'm gonna set it free
Send it, send it
You've got to let it go
Open up a window

Don't you think it's best when You feel joy
To let it all out before it spoils
Let it run into everything
I know You really doubt that it gets far
But that's the reason He made the star
When propels it, it travels faster than a laser beam

Send it, send it
Just like it came to Me
I'm gonna set it free
Send it, send it
You've got to let it go
Open up a window

Send a little love; send a little care
It reaches everywhere; send it
