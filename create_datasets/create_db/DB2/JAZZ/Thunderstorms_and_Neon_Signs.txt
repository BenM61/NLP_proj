There's some big black clouds blowing in from the west
I've been driving all day and I sure could use some rest
There's a motel up ahead where I can unwind
Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs

I grew up on the road from town to town
My daddy's line of work, kept us moving around
I've got fond memories of the way things were back then
The warmth of the neon when a bad storm was moving in

We listened to the opry in small cafes
When we stopped to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time

I've got a  real nice room with a radio and TV
This here motel living is the only life for me
It looks like it'll be raining for quite some time
Mixed with the lightning is the glow from a neon sign

We listened to the opry in small cafes
When we stopped to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time

There's some big black clouds blowing in from the west
I've been driving all  day and I sure could use some rest
There's a motel up ahead where I can unwind
Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs
