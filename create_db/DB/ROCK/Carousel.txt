The world's like a big carousel
Turning in space with the whole human race hanging on
But the sounds that are played on that penny arcade
Turn me on

Then I need a little romance
If you play me that song
Then you'll get me to dance
I can dance
Sing me a slow song and maybe then I'll take a chance

For there's something in the air
And it's turning spinning
Seems like I float everywhere

For there's something in the air
And it's turning spinning
Seems like I float everywhere

Oh I need some loving tonight
Someone to hold me and make me feel alright tonight
And I can't explain why the whole human race
Wants to fight

For the world is a beautiful place 
So small but it's all that we have to stand on
You and I
So won't you join me on my carousel in the sky

For there's something in the air
And it's turning spinning
Seems like I float everywhere
