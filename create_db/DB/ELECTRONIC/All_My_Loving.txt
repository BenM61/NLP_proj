Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 
Tomorrow I'll miss you 
Remember I'll always be true 
And then while I'm away 
I'll write home everyday 
And I'll send all my loving to you 

I'll pretend that I'm kissing 
The lips I am missing 
And hope that my dreams 
Will come true 

And then while I'm away 
I'll write home everyday 
And I'll send all my loving to you 

All my loving 
I will send to you 
All my loving 
Darling I'll be true 

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 
Tomorrow I'll miss you 
Remember I'll always be true 
And then while I'm away 
I'll write home everyday 
And I'll send all my loving to you 

All my loving 
All my loving 
Oh, my loving 
I will send to you
