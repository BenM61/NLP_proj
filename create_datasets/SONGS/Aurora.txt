Aurora comes from Rio De Janeiro
she dances in a little street cafe.
And when you're down in Rio De Janeiro
Here's what you'll hear each Latin lover say.

You're a sweet heart in a million
Oh oh oh oooh (be mine oh oh) Aurora
With your manner so Brazilian
Oh oh oh oooh (be mine oh oh) Aurora (be mine)

When you smile and call me honey
Oh oh oh oooh (be mine oh oh ) Aurora
Is it me or just my money?
Oh oh oh oooh Aurora (be mine)

I'll buy you this and buy you that
If you'll be true to me.
I'll even rent a cottage
And present you with the key.
So if you'll marry me
And be my sweet senora.

Oh oh oh oh Aurora, Aurora
Be mine, be mine, be mine

You're a sweet heart in a million
Ha ha ha ha Aurora
With your manner so Brazilian
Ha ha ha ha Aurora
 
When you smile and call me honey
Ha ha ha ha Aurora
Is it me or just my money?
Ha ha ha ha Aurora

You're a sweet heart in a million
Oh oh oh oooh (be mine oh oh) Aurora
With your manner so Brazilian
Oh oh oh oooh (be mine oh oh) Aurora (be mine)

Oh oh oh oooh Aurora , Aurora
Be mine.
