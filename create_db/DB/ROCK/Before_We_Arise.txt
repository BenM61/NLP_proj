Blackness all around
Can you wake me
Truth less little town
Can you wake me
I'm flying on your streets
Can you wake me
I'm drowning in your sleep
Can you wake me

From another dreamless night
Long before we arise

I'm howling in the fields
Can you wake me
Unconquered and unreal
Can you wake me
I'm crawling deep inside
Can you wake me
I'm drifting with the tide
Can you wake me

From another dreamless night
Long before we arise

Long before we arise
