Days were lonely and so were the nights
She could not tell wrong from right.
Body broken, worn to the bone,
The final days of Mary Lee Jones, Mary Lee Jones.

She could not get him out of her mind.
Too much passion drove her blind.
Nothing she could call her own,
The final days of Mary Lee Jones, Mary Lee Jones.

Days were lonely and so were the nights.
She could not tell wrong from right.
Nothing she could call her own,
The final days of Mary Lee Jones, Mary Lee Jones.
