Hot gingerbread and dynamite, 
that's all there is at night, 
Back in Nagasaki where the fellows chew tobaccky 
And the women wicky-wacky-woo! 

they got a way that they entertain, 
they wouldn't hurry a hurricane. 
Back in Nagasaki where the fellows chew tobaccky 
And the women wicky-wacky-woo! 

Fujiama, get a mama, 
Then your troubles increase, boy! 
It's south dakota you want a soda 
first shake me then ten cents please

They hug and kiss each night, 
By jingo, boys, it's worth that price! 
Back in Nagasaki where the fellows chew tobaccky 
And the women wicky-wacky-woo! 

Back in Nagasaki where the fellows chew tobaccky 
And the women wicky-wacky-woo!
