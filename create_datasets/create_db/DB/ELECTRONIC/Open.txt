I'm a fool for that shake in your thighs
I'm a fool for that sound in your sighs
I'm a fool for your belly
I'm a fool for you love

I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know your faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know your faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes

Caught in this pool held in your eyes
Caught like a fool without a line
We're in a natural spring
With this gentle sting between us

I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know your faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know your faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes

Ooh, stay open
Ooh, stay open

Stay open
Stay open

I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know your faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know your faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes

Stay open
Stay open
Stay open

Mm, stay open
