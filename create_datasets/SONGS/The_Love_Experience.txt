Yo peace and love, 
I wanna tell y'all about the beautiful love experience 
(hope you have time, hope you don't mind)

To my cousin I'm hoping you can hear this rhyme
When I ride through the bricks yeah
I think about you all the time
That cold day I got that phone call
It plays back in my mind
I can still hear your mother cry

Well at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

And to my first girlfriend
I know you probably married now
Reminiscing on our prom date
The way I did you yo was kind of foul
But I guess I had to wise up
So now I know better now (but at least I can say)

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

Like how it feels
When it comes
What its like
When it leaves

So to the woman that betrayed me
I think its unfair how
How you chose to deceive me
I thought that was my child
Now he's forced inside for now

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

To the faith I've lost (faith I've lost)
For the friends I've gain (the friends I've gain)
I'm thinking while I'm questioning change is a good thing
'Cause with dead weight you can't travel light (can't travel light)
Besides I was born to fight so I'm gon' be alright (born to fight)

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you
Like how it feels
When it comes
What its like when it leaves

To my momma,
To grandma
To my sister (to my sister)
And say good-bye (to my family)
After departure day and my friends told me what happened oh

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you
(I've experienced love)

I've experienced
The Love experience
You should experience
The love experience
We are all, all experiments
Of the love experience
So just experience

We all should experience 
(la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)
Experience
Experience

I've experienced
The Love experience
You should experience
The love experience
We are all, all experiments
Of the love experience
So just experience
