If the world revolved around you
We would try to escape to Mars
If you take away our rocket fuel
We're gonna escape in cars
You try to steal our girlfriends
We're gonna cut you downtown
You come around our neighborhood
Gonna run you out of town
Gonna run you out of town

Don't you know you're a bad indication
Try to come around, we're gonna cut you down
Don't you know you're a sad invitation
Try to hang around the other side of town

If the world revolved around you
We would try to fill you in
We'd attack with all artillery
Till your shelter walls cave in
You try to pinch our girlfriends
With your selfish shellfish claw
You try to crash our party, boy
We'll crush you in our jaw
Gonna crush you in our jaw

Don't you know you're a bad indication
Try to come around, we're gonna cut you down
Don't you know you're a sad invitation
Try to hang around the other side of town

Don't you know you're a bad indication
Try to come around, we're gonna cut you down
Don't you know you're a sad invitation
Try to hang around the other side of town

Let the world revolve around you
Let the world revolve around you
Let the world revolve around you
