Move a little closer (Shake it)
It's on your mind
It's written on your face
It's no surprise
To find you in this place
Your wish is mine
So you don't have to lie
You want it bad
So give my love a try

Your timing's right
You're first in line
You've made the right decision

Tonights the night
Lets slip and slide
Get ready to get crazy

Just move a little closer, ya ya ya
Dance until your feet catch on fire
Just move a little closer, ya ya ya
I can feel you watching with desire

Shake it
Shake it
Your gentle touch
Puts me in the mood
I can't deny
It never felt this good
My natural hight
A perfect fantasy
Don't hesitate
Give me what I need

Your timing's right
You're first in line
You've made the right decision

Tonights the night
Lets slip and slide
Get ready to get crazy.

Just move a little closer, ya ya ya
Dance until your feet catch on fire
Just move a little closer, ya ya ya
I can feel you watching with desire

When you put your arms around me
I feel the ground is shaking
When you put your arms around me
I feel the ground is shaking
When you put your arms around me
I feel the ground is shaking
When you put your arms around me
I feel the ground is shai-ai-king
Shai-ai-king, shai-ai-king, shai-ai-king

Shake it!
