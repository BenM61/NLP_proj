Suddenly Monday appears again
Where was the weekend? 
I lost it again
Ran to the bus stop
It's never on time
I couldn't care less
'Cause you make me feel fine 

Whenever I'm down 
You're always around
Maybe this time true love I've found
What would I do
If I didn't have you
The things that you say
The things that you do 

You make me high
I wish that you knew, I wish I could tell you
Together we'd fly
Open your eyes, start reading my mind 

Same conversation every day
So much to ask you but can't find a way
Wherever you're going, can I come along?
Whatever your star sign, wherever you're from 
The end of the day
And you're still around
My head's in the clouds, feet on the ground
Maybe I should, and maybe you would
Maybe tonight, if only we could 

You make me high
I wish that you knew, I wish I could tell you
Together we'd fly
Open your eyes, start reading my mind
