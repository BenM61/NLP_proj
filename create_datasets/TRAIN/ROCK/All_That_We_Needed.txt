If you'd see all the possibilities, we might not still be standing where we started.

Oh no, don't let me go for this, don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, you might be one too.
Maybe we're all that we needed.
Two wrongs don't make a right, but I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed.

I think it's worth making, worth repeating.

Oh no, don't let me go for this, don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, you might be one too.
Maybe we're all that we needed.
Two wrongs don't make a right, but I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed.

Maybe were more than the light ever seen.
Maybe were not meant to not disagree.
Maybe were crazy baby.

Two wrongs don't make a right but I don't care tonight. (Maybe were all that we needed.)
