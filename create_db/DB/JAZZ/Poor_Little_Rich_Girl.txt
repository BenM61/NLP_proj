Poor little rich girl, you're a bewitched girl
Better be aware
Laughing at danger, virtual stranger
Better take care

The life you lead sets all your nerves a-jangle
Your love affairs are in a hopeless tangle
Though you're a child, dear
Your life's a wild typhoon

In lives of leisure the craze for pleasure
Steadily grows
Cocktails and laughter's but what comes after
Nobody knows

You're weaving love into a magic pattern
?
Poor little rich girl
Don't drop a stitch too soon
