Shine on, shine the lights on me
In all of my life so that much more I see

In the light of his love
In the light of reflection
What a world this world
Sometimes oh so it seems
Eyes to the sky in the silver gift friendship
Glittering prize
Is the price of lost love
They can remember quiet side of midnight
They can remember attraction of fame
Like a glittering prize
I saw you up on a clear day
First taking heart
Then our last breath away

Always came a time
Time was by your side
We were spending time
We were starting out
Catch me in a dream
Captured all in heart
We were spending time
We were starting out
Could there ever be
Ever more than one
Called an act of love
Can you never stop?

Shine on, shine the light on me
In all of my life
So that much more I see
Like a glittering prize
I saw you up on a clear day
First taking hearts
Then our last breath away

Only on a clear day
Coming in on our lives
Only on a clear day
Coming in on our life

We can remember quiet side of midnight
We can remember attraction of fame
Like a glittering prize
I saw you up on a clear day
First taking hearts
Then our last breath away

See it in the eyes
Satellite sky
We were spending time
We were starting out
Take in, take in more
Endless breath away
We were starting out
Now we're staring in
Could there ever be
Ever more than one
Called an act of love
Can you never stop?

Shine on, shine the lights on me
In all of my life, so that much more I see
Like a glittering prize
I saw you up on a clear day
First taking hearts
Then our last breath away

Only on a clear day
Coming in on our life
Always on a clear day
This is the price of love 
Like a glittering prize
Only on a clear day
Rushing into our life
Is like the price of love
Like a glittering prize
Only on a clear day
Rushing into our life
Like a glittering prize
