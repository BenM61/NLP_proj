Well you should be an actress 
You play your part so well 
Your act is so believable 
That no one else can tell 

You say the lines, but I see 
That you don't really love me 

You keep me around to be your faithful clown 
Till someone you can love comes along 
You'll keep on pretending 
Because the show must go on 

Yes, you should be an actress 
As lovely as you are 
The way you play on emotion 
You'd shame the brightest star 

You're acting all the time 
No, you're not really mine 

I'm just another scene in your play acting scheme 
No, you don't love me at all 
But when you walk away 
That's when the curtain will fall 

But I'll go all the way to the end of the play 
I'll be a part of your masquerade 
Although I know it may be the saddest show 
In the life of a fool on parade
