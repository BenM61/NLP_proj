Well I need some woman
To stand by, to stand by
For me
Well I need some woman
To stand by, to stand by
For me
And I'm so, so tired of
Sleeping by, sleeping by myself

I've been alone so long,
Got to change, got to change
My ways
I've been alone so long,
Got to change, got to change
My ways
I will love some woman
Better than I love, better than I love
Myself

I went down to the ocean
Set down by, set down by
The sea
I went down to the ocean
Set down by, set down by
The sea
But the waves and the water
Would not give, would not give
Me peace
