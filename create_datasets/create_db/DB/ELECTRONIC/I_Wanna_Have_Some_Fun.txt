Hello, it's me again
Don't you know it's hard to keep a good woman down
But then again, maybe that could be fun

Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox!

Ain't it funny how, when I say let's go out
You're always saying someone else will get me
What's a girl to do - I like to have fun too
But you're so jealous - you never let me

So how come you can leave - but when it comes to me
Always something I must prove  (To you)
You know I love you - always thinking of you
But tonight - I've got to make that move

I want to have some fun
Move my body all night long
I want to have some fun
Move my body all night long

What your momma used to say - All work - No play
I know what to do - I think I'll call my crew
Of course, I love you - but naughty girls need fun too

Could it be that I make you feel guilty why
Is there something I can't see - (NO)
I just don't buy it - so don't even try it
I've got to go in the place to be

I want to have some fun
Move my body all night long
Working hard every day
So I ain't staying home no way

I need it  (I need it)
I want it  (I want it)
Got to   (Got to)
Flaunt it  (Flaunt it)

I'm not a prisoner - can't you see
Unlock the door so I can breathe
Whenever it comes to you my dear
I say stay with me but you still go
So now I learn
It's my turn

I want you to stay here with me
You can have fun with me
With you?
Yeah, with me!
Come on - I can have loads of fun without you
Without me?
Yeah!
