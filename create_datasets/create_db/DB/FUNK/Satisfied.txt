I won't be satisfied
I won't be satisfied
Going round in circles baby
Trying to think how I'm gonna get with you
I think about you all of the time and you know
That you're blowing my mind
I'm goin' crazy baby
Tell me just what I'm supposed to do
You got me going crazy I don't know what to do girl
You're rocking my world
[BRIDGE:]
If you held me tonight, it would make things alright
Could you love me
If I held you tonight, I would make things alright
Could you trust me
'cause I'm telling you baby
I won't be satisfied until you're here with me tonight
I won't be satisfied until I hold you in my arms
You know you mesmerize when I look into your eyes
I won't be satisfied till you're here with me tonight
I'm not the kind of guy to fall in love
But baby I've fallen for you
I've fallen like an angel for real
Its the way that you're making me feel
Walking the streets all alone
Thinking how much I'm gonna be true to you
[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
(I can't wait) oh I can't wait
(till tonight) till I hold you in my arms oh no
(and baby tonight) and baby tonight
(I can't wait) I can't wait until I look into your eyes
I know that your loving's the best
Tell me baby that its for real
I want to hold you close in my arms
You know you're everything that I need
[CHORUS]
