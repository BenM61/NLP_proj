Hey music man, just play something cool
We love the sunshine to dance by the pool
Down with the crew known to pump up the bass
We rock the joint at a cool steady pace

Love sweet love
Just a little understanding
Up above
Way down deep inside

Love sweet love
Just a little understanding
Up above
Way down deep inside

Rock and roll music's a thing of the past
We blow up the spot and get caught in the blast

Love sweet love
Just a little understanding
Up above
Way down deep inside

Love sweet love
Just a little understanding
Up above
Way down deep inside

Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh
Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh
Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh
Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh

Huh huh Morcheeba
Huh, yes, yes you're like that
As a matter of fact, twist to kiss like this
Huh, it's fat like a Christmas list

And I suck your stockin', keep on rockin'
It's not too shockin', I got your pop rockin'
Huh huh, the party got your body jammin', love sweet love
In a movin' understanding

Love sweet love
Just a little understanding
Up above
Way down deep inside

Love sweet love
Just a little understanding
Up above
Way down deep inside

Love sweet love
You know it doesn't get demanding
Up above
Get down deep inside

Love sweet love
Just a little understanding
Up above
Way down deep inside

Jack back that ya, complex what!
Morcheeba, cross fader, ahh check me up now

Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh
Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh
Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh
Woh hoh, woh hoh, yeh heh
