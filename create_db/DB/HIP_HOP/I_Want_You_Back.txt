I'm the M to the E-L-B you know me
I'm the M-I-S-S-Y to the E
And I got many flows from over seas
Well how can you beep beep with no keys
I got spice, I'm tight with my flows
And all my flows been known to through blows
Well let me hit this one before I go
Well I'm a let you go if you say so

Boy I'm sick of you
Who me, yes me, yeah you know I'm a fool, fool
I'm a fool for you
'Cause I be taking you back 'cause I'm stupid like that
Yeah, yeah you know I do, 
But I can't say no, and I never say no
I can't say no to you
Because you treat me right, in fact I want you back

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn, I think I want you back (want you)

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know if might sound whack
But damn, I think I want you, want you back

Boy I'm tired of you
Running over me, telling me what to do
Now what have I done to you
To make you sex a lot
I thought I made you hot
Now don't make me act a fool
I know I talk my joke but what I truly want is you
And even though you're a man
True that I want you back

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack,
But damn, I think I want you back (want you)

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know if might sound whack
But damn, I think I want you, want you back

You've got me losing my mind, my mind
You can't keep breaking my heart
You've got me drinking liquor in the morning
Sittin' all night at the bar

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn, I think I want you back (want you)

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know if might sound whack
But damn, I think I want you, want you back

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know it might sound whack
But damn, I think I want you back (want you)

I think I want you back
Your love has made a deep impact
I know if might sound whack
But damn, I think I want you, want you back
