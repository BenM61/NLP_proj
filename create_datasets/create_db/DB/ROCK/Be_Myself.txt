Saw my shrink today, he said girl I can't help you
I've been seeing you so long, but nothing has changed
You tried Adderall and alcohol, sadly the fact remains
You're terminally normal, I'm sorry to say
So I shaved my head, I changed my name, I gave my pills away

'Cause if I can't be someone else
If I can't be someone else
Oh if I can't be someone else
I might as well be myself, myself
Be myself

Hanging with the hipsters is a lot of hard work
How many selfies can you take before you look like a jerk?
I took an Uber to a juice bar to hear a new indie band play
They got 99 million followers in only one day
Well, I snapped thst pic and I made the slip
I got into a stranger's car
Well, the heels don't fit, I finally quit
And headed back to my favorite bar

'Cause if I can't be someone else
If I can't be someone else
Oh if I can't be someone else
I might as well be myself, myself

Don't you wanna be your own girl?
Don't you wanna be your own girl?
Don't you wanna be your own girl?
Oh oh

If I can't be someone else
If I can't be someone else
Oh if I can't be someone else

If I can't be someone else
If I can't be someone else
Oh if I can't be someone else
I might as well, might as well be myself
Be myself
Oh if I can't be someone else
I might as well be myself, myself
Be myself
Gonna be myself
