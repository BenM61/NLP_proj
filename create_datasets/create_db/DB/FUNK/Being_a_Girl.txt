Every once in awhile
You meet a child that drives you wild
With unmistakable
Down-town, style

Her winter coat and sexy tokes
On camel smokes
Don't prepare you
For a laugh that explodes

A princess and a mistress
Dressed in Sunday best
To impress a fresh love, interest

To set the stage
Receive her praise
And leave a sour taste
That only gets sweeter as it fades

She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help herself
Full of spectacle and charm like nothing else
Being a girl

At the initial glance
She's making plans to build her a man
Like a T-4 or an airplane
The girl wants a model romance

Fell in love
While taming her new adventurer
'Cause every rebel
Needs a woman's touch
(Woman's touch)

The fact is she's an actress
Using the bedroom for practice
Making him think
His kiss is all she ever imagines

With a pocketful of rocket fuel
Dragging strings that pull
On a heart, that's uncertain
But beautiful

She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help herself
Full of spectacle and charm like nothing else
Being a girl
