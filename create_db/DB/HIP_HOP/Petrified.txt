Ya'll are n-n-not ready (yo)
Not are-ready (yo)
We about to drop it steady (so)
Do it (like that [x10])

Now why's everybody so petrified? [What!?]
Petrified! [What!?] Stepped aside!
And just drop that... [come on!]
Drop that! [come on!] Drop that! [come on!]
Drop... that! [come on!]
Now why's everybody so petrified? [What!?]
Petrified! [what!?] Stepped aside!
And just drop that... [come on!]
Drop that! [come on!] Drop that! [come on!]
Drop... that! [come on!]

Yeah
How you doin, ya'll?
My name is Mike.
I'm fooling with the new shit
I'm doing it all night
I like what I do
I do what I like
I could quit and get it back like I'm riding a bike
Like stop, bring it back, bring it back
We got that balance keeping us on track
That you get when you move and quit, With no slow
You stare like you don't care
But you do, though...
I know, you really must be so lonely
Puffed up, like you're tough, but so phony
You and your boys, you don't know me
You really wanna hold me? Show me. Homie.
Lets get it over with for good
I got a friction addiction I wish you would
Machine Shop rockin' when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why's everybody so petrified? [What!?]
Petrified! [What!?] Stepped aside!
And just drop that... [come on!]
Drop that! [come on!] Drop that! [come on!]
Drop... that! [come on!]

Listen. You are not ready
Like children in a building you can't stand steady
It must be the beat so heavy
Causing panic attacks like a crack in the levvy
Give me that Robert Plant
Dancing days are back
Feeling all in the track and in fact
For those knowing the name
I'm back with some brand new crack
We can do it like, that
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up, like you're tough, but so phony
You and your boys, you don't know me
You really wanna hold me? Show me. Homie.
Tough talk doesn't mean a thing
Get over yourself, you know when we're up in the scene
Its Machine Shop rockin when we stepped inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why's everybody so petrified? [What!?]
Petrified! [What!?] Stepped aside!
And just drop that... [come on!]
Drop that! [come on!] Drop that! [come on!]
Drop... that! [come on!]
Now why's everybody so petrified? [What!?]
Petrified! [what!?] Stepped aside!
And just drop that... [come on!]
Drop that! [come on!] Drop that! [come on!]
Drop... that! [come on!]

Ya'll are n-n-not ready (yo)
Not are-ready (yo)
We about to drop it steady (so)
Do it (like that [x10])
Ya'll are n-n-not ready (yo)
Not are-ready (yo)
We about to drop it steady (so)
Do it (like that [x10])

Get up.

Why's everybody so petrified? [What!?]
Petrified! [What!?] Stepped aside!
And just drop that... [come on!]
Drop that! [come on!] Drop that! [come on!]
Drop... that! [come on!]
Now why's everybody so petrified? [What!?]
Petrified! [what!?] Stepped aside!

Like stop, (stop) bring it back, (bring it back)
We got that balance keeping us on track
Like stop, (stop) bring it back, (bring it back)
We got that balance keeping us on track
Like stop, (stop) bring it back, (bring it back)
