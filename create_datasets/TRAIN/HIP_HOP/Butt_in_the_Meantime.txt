Verse One

It's times like this that I've gotta crack a smile
If about anything, than it's gotta be style
What happens now? A better man can hold the mike and do the proving,
Dres, of the Black Sheep Yo, let's get the Sheep moving
I'd like to pay a tribute, to what, to knocking boots
I'm single and I mingle if ya jingle I play roots
But there's another, the other
The brother on the cover
I brought along, I brought along
I brought along, Lawnge
I do a not a trio move your bootie cause I say so
Be outlasting or not busting Black Sheep not your average Joe
Now I hold a microphone, but this is what I wanted
A pocket full of panonie, better me than those that front it
Dropping bombs, lovely, make 'em jet without their Jetta
Keep fronting if you're wanting but I bet ya the Beretta
Punctuates and exclamates, the lingo I let go
Not that it's my style 'cause I let go my ego
Be it just us, just you or just me or just who
Never am I full, gotta to get residuals
Pronto, Tonto
Was engine number nine
I'm out to get the nickels, quarters, pennies and the dimes


Butt in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one, in the meantime
Now in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one in the meantime

Verse Two

At last, Black Sheep on wax
And finally, it's for himself that Mista Lawnge is laying tracks
Now I won't dally your fiddle
Give ya more than bits and kibble
Or is it kibbles and bits that became hits, now there's a riddle
Believe me, 'cause you see, I do understand
Heard a jam that was flam
Bought the album, Van Damme, it's weak
But for the moment, I won't speak
Upon this, I mean that, I mean those, I mean them
I mean there, I mean here, damn
Yo, whatcha trying say Dres?
Yo let me try this again
Ya see, this is rather funky, the style that I'm displaying
Somewhat bona fide, on the side of okay and
Finally, your hunger for dopeness is full
Hmmm, please excuse me, Yo, turn it up a decibel
For I am about to rip a style
That will make heads bop awhile
So please step to the right, if ya suck
Should I do 'em Violators  "Ahh, what the f*ck?"
Moving, yes I'm moving, am I moving?  "Goony gu-gu"
Say la say la what, say la say la say la "pu-pu"
Say it in a second, after Dres is finished wrecking
As I'm wrecking, gotcha checking
Step to this and Dres will deck


Verse Three

Surprising you, I'm rising,
Dresmerizing and subliminalizing
Black Sheep are here, we're breaking all ties
And making songs that are prolific
Specific as terrific
Move a body in the city to both sides of the Pacific
I'm Dres and you are not
You're cold, I'm hot which means I'm soon to boil bootie
Your bootie, your bootie, the butt, but still you think your royal
Are you mad, are you jealous
Overjoyed or over zealous?
Hold your glass and sip
For when you held the mike you couldn't rip
Before your mike went hush
Keep sipping stupid lush
I know I'll be all right tonight
I took my time, I didn't rush
I didn't blush, I didn't frown
Got up to get down
Henceforth, I'm getting down and dirty, G
You thought that I would not be
Stupid, Cupid, or elupid
I sting ya like a bumble
Where's the bee, here I be
Can'tcha see, can'tcha peep?
If you're sleeping then wake up
If you're stinking then wash up
If you're creeping, then catch up
You're rolling with the Black Sheep
