I made an American squirm
And it feel so right
On the screen was the musical war
Deep deep into the night
Yes i was spreading
In the wonderful world
Everything was fine
Tried to mete in hot of the state
Deep deep into the night
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
But I think you for the time
Yes I thank you for the time
l killed the time
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It's goes on and on and on
But the funky for the time
Yes I thank you for the time
I killed the time
I made an American squirm
And it feel so right
On the screen was the comical time
Deep deep into the night
Deep deep into the night
Deep deep into the night
It goes on and on and on
