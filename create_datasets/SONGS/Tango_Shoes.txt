When we're together
I am alone
I doddle down the street 
Shuffle my feet
Don't want to go home

There's an antique store
I go inside
All I got on me is only 20 bucks
And my pride
That's when I see them

My new tango shoes
There are my treasure
They are so cool
My new tango shoes
They are my ticket
My tools
My new tango shoes
There gonna help me dance away from you
My new tango shoes

Like Cinderella
I am transformed
Suddenly I'm taller your smaller
I am reborn
With new courage
I go downtown
To find you sitting at our table
Girls all around
And they see my

My new tango shoes
They are my treasure
They are so cool
My new tango shoes
They are my ticket
My tools
My new tango shoes
There gonna help me dance away from you
My new tango shoes

See my sexy man in my process
Right before your angry eyes
I stick around close in between my lips
I turn on my heel
And dance out of your life

You told me you love me
That was untrue
Now that were over
This dance is for you
Tango

My new tango shoes
They are my treasure
They are so cool
My new tango shoes 
They are my ticket 
My tools
My new tango shoes
There gonna help me dance away from you
My new tango shoes
They are my treasure
They are so cool
My new tango shoes 
They are my ticket
My tools
My new tango shoes 
There gonna help me dance away from you
My new tango shoes
