First day of August
Last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day

The rainmaker said to the people
"Tell me what you are prepared to pay"
And the rainmaker said to the people
"Now I'll conjure up a rain today."

Ninety degrees 'neath the trees where it's shady
A hundred and ten in the hot sun
Heat from the street burned the feet of the ladies
See how they run.

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Called down the lightnin'
By a mystical name
And the rainmaker called on the thunder
And then it suddenly began to rain.

Then the rainmaker passed his hat to the people
But the people all turned away
And the rainmaker's eyes and the Kansas skies
Well they both became a darker gray.

First day in August
Last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day.

The rainmaker smiled as he hitched up his wagon
And without a word he rode away
And the people of the town heard the sound of his laughter
And they knew the rain had come to stay.

Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day.
