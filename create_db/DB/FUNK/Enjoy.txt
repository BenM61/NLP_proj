Wake up silly head 
'Bout time we do it again 
Sushine today 
I'm glad I made plans 
'Cause it rained yesterday 
But that was okay 
Can't complain 
I love it either way 

Living everyday like it's my last 
I refuse to be stuck in the past 
People actin' like machines 
Cause they're scared to live their dreams 
No not me 

[Chorus] 
I just enjoy and celebrate 
Enjoy the love we make 
Enjoy, appreciate 
Enjoy 
Just keep on doing it 
Til my hearts content 
And enjoy when someone smiles 
Enjoy 
So just enjoy the simple things 
Enjoy what the world brings 
Enjoy the summer seas 
Enjoy 
Just keep on doing it 
'Til my hearts content 
And enjoy the gift of life 
Enjoy 

If you wanna find the paradise 
Do it now never too late to try 
Lose your inhibitions 
Let your inspiration set you free 

[Chorus] 

And the people say 
Enjoy la la la la la [Repeat: x 8] 

[Chorus] 

Enjoy la la la la la [Repeat: x 8]
