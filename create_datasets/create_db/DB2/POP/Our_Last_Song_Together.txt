Days of devils, kings and clowns
Angel songs and birthday tunes
Valentines and wishing wells
Magic stairways, moods, and Junes
Silly rhymes and monkeyshines
Pictures on a stage
Round and round the records go
Time to turn the page

This will be our last song together
Words will only make us cry
This will be our last song together
There's no other way to say good-bye

Misty faces, far off places
Came and danced across the stage
Sha na na's and doo be down's
The sounds that chased away the blues 
Yesterday is yesterday
The past is dead and gone
Nostalgia just gets in the way
Let's stop hanging on

This will be our last song together
Words will only make us cry
This will be our last song together
There's no other way to say good-bye

Now we go our separate ways 
And the world we used to know
Scratchy worn out 45's
An echo on the radio
Tra la days are over now
Those days of you and me
Now we know that breaking up is
Really hard to do

This will be our last song together
Words will only make us cry
This will be our last song together
There's no other way to say good-bye
