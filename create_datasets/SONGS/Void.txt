I miss those lights around town
Where have they all been gone
When I had you deep within my sight
I didn't have enough to throw in
Is these writings on the wall that I can follow
I see the signs of the times leaving me divide and hollow

Under a void sky, I'm laying myself down
Under a void sky, I'm coming around
Under a void sky, I try to get by
Under a void sky, I'm going to fly

Don't let me go down this road
Stop me from leaving
So I can save your life tonight and
And we could call it even
I keep on marching if I can
Keep on crawling if I have to
But I keep on dancing out of the dark
Into the blue

Under a void sky, I'm laying myself down
Under a void sky, I'm coming around
Under a void sky, I try to get by
Under a void sky, I'm going to fly

Under a void sky, I'm laying myself down
Under a void sky, I'm coming around
Under a void sky, I try to get by
Under a void sky, I'm going to fly
