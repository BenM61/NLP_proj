Straight out of mothballs we took the jet
And flew across
Gotham in retroglide
The closest thing to heaven that I found yet
In a city full of dreamers it's as good as it gets

Go tell the spider to text the X
This comic book caper is nine to five
A seven or eleven and it's a bet
In a city full of schemers it's as good as it gets

Me, I'm an eight ball shoot me and win
There's not a lot love in this city of sin
Do you ever get the feeling this sun has set
In a city full of screamers it's as good as it gets

Calling all the great and the beautiful
How about a little empathy
What you gonna do when duty calls
Send in all the clowns to keep us happy

Repeat
Repeat

Moby or Gobi a deserted dream
You hear a lot of ghosts in this old town
Gotta let the fuse blow you right out the net
In a city full of stealers it's as good as it gets

Saigon ain't bygones for viet vets
You don't know what hits you til they call in the debt
The apocalypse is now and it's still Jack Schitt
In a city full of dealers it's as good as it gets

Calling all the great and the beautiful
How about a little empathy
What you gonna do when duty calls
Send in all the clowns to keep us happy
Calling all the great and the beautiful
How about a little empathy
What you gonna do when duty calls
Send in all the clowns to keep us happy
