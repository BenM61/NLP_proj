She's going downtown, but she comes from uptown
Where the brokers and the dealers - socialise
She's going downtown
Cos she's a poet
And the Chinese bakery's open all night

Toulouse Lautrec called up today
Said it's all Rock n' Roll anyway
Excuse me while I'm tearing off your head
Epiphany just went to ground
The three wise men just can't be found
The underground just shook it's weary head

She said she's gonna show me around
The Chinese bakery that's open 
Twenty hours

She's going downtown...

Got a roller coaster in my head
You press the button - I'll eject
Your present is just somebodys past
Don't blink, pinch me twice
Just seen Bob Dylan on a motorbike
I don't think this relationship will last

She said she's gonna show me around
The Chinese bakery that's open
Twenty hours
She's going downtown...
And the Chinese bakery's open all night
