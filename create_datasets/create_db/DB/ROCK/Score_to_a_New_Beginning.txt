A new age dawns before my eyes, I can feel the ars divine
With the sun above we'll build our holy land
What a sight to see a future yet to come
Now we become as one with the feeling of heaven

A better age will surely rise, forget the pain, embrace the light
"The sacred gift of innocence"
Darkness is down, alive we stand, Gods' children come redeem your holy land

What a sight to see a future yet to come
Now we become as one with the feeling of heaven

A better age will surely rise, forget the pain, embrace the light
"The sacred gift of innocence"
Darkness is down, alive we stand, Gods' children come redeem your holy land

Now we are close to a new world coming, blessed be the light in our souls
No more we'll follow the blind "And His lies won't be heard"
We'll be the masters of our lives

Now we are close to a new world coming, blessed be the light in our souls
No more we'll follow the blind "And His lies won't be heard"
We'll be the masters of our lives

Beyond the crystal gates under the sun will rise. Enlighten our time
Usher a better time. The future is thine

A better age will surely rise, forget the pain, embrace the light
"The sacred gift of innocence"
Darkness is down, alive we stand, Gods' children come redeem your holy land

Now we are close to a new world coming, blessed be the light in our souls
No more we'll follow the blind "And His lies won't be heard"
We'll be the masters of our lives

On this day, we will fly away like an eagle soars to another shore
We are flying high on the events tide. Blessed be the one who guides us
Higher, take me higher
The dreams sent by the gods live forever now forever more
