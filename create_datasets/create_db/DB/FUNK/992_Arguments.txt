992 arguments
992, quit just a-fighting
992, I'm sick of you

I can't even go down to the corner
To get myself a cold, cold beer
Cause when I come back to the house
Your mouth is the only thing I'm gonna hear

It's a shame
All this fussing and fighting we're doing
Don't you know that it's got to stop
Don't make sense to go on this way
Our love affair is a total flop

I don't want to leave you
But I gotta tell you just how it is
Life is too short to live in this arena
There's so much that has to give

Maybe we just weren't meant for each other
You know, we might have made a big mistake
But two people understand one another
Tell me, how long does it take
