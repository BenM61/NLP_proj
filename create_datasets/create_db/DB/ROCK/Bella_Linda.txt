Bella Linda, try and understand
Bella Linda, I'm doin' all I can
Bella Linda, I'm only what I am

It's so hard for me to say
The things I really feel
If I could I'd chase away
The pain your eyes reveal
The pain your eyes reveal
From foolish things I've done
The times that I let you down
And I'll never change, believe me I try
If you go away, you know that I'll die
Oh I love you, please don't say goodbye

Bella Linda, try and understand 
Bella Linda, I'm doin' all I can
Bella Linda, I'm only what I am

We've had bad times
Through the years
And though I've made you cry
Think of me through tender tears
And try to close your eyes
And try to close your eyes
To thoughtless things I do
The dreams that don't come true
'Cause I'll never change, believe me I try
If you go away, you know that I'll die
Oh I need you, please don't say goodbye

Bella Linda, try and understand
Bella Linda, I'm doin' all I can
Bella Linda, I'm only what I am

Bella Linda, try and understand
Bella Linda, I'm doin' all I can
Bella Linda, I'm only what I am
