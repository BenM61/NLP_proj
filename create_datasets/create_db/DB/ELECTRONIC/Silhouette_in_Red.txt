Oh I know you're a dreamer
There's a child in your eyes
You save up all your memories
You're tired of all the lies

I hear you cry for someone
Please someone heal the pain
A hand to hold and guide her
Through the fire and through the rain

Oh babe it's not too late now
Don't say it has to end
Been through so much together, babe
I will always be your friend

You are just like an angel
You 're just like an angel
So lucky to have met
My silhouette in red

You are just like an angel
You're just like an angel
I never will forget
My silhouette in red

Oh maybe you are lonely
I'm afraid to ask you why
You'll turn to hide in silence
It hurts so much inside

You'll lead me through your darkness
The colors of your dreams
Dreams so full of questions
The reasons plain to see

You don't have all the answers
And no one ever will
You'll search the whole world all over, babe
Learn so much more, yet still

You are just like an angel
You 're just like an angel
So lucky to have met
My silhouette in red

When you see her, she'll be searching
For truth and destiny
The answer that she looks
I hope one day she'll see

You are just like an angel
You 're just like an angel
So lucky to have met
My silhouette in red
