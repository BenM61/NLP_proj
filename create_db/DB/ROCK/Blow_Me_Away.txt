They fall in line
One at a time
Ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)
No time to lose
We've got to move
Steady your hand
(I am losing sight again)

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay, unless I may)
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven, when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

There's nothing left
So save your breath
Lying in wait
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown
No where to go
Holding your fate
(Lonely I will walk alone)

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay, unless I may)
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven, when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

Wanted it back
(Don't fight me now)

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven, when we die
I am a shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all
