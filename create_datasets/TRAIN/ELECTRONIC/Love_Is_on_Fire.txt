I can see us in your eyes
No need to think it twice
Like it was always meant to be
You and me

And every time whenever it things are messed
But nothing's to confessed
Like when two stars collide

Love is on fire!
A burning heart
Because we have no need from the start
It was love at first time
No matter of time
That I will make you mine

Yeah tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
Then I will make you mine
Love is on fire!

I got nothing more to miss
Never needed more than this
Just like America
Sensation aw.
And days will come when anything is wrong
But the keeps is going on
So come whatever may

Love is on fire
Tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
It was love at first time
No matter of time
That I will make you mine.

Love is on fire
A burning heart
Because we have no need from the start
It was love at first time
No matter of time
That I will make you mine.

Yeah, tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
Then I will make you mine
Love is on fire

Love is on fire
A burning heart
Because we have no need from the start
It was love at first time
No matter of time
That I will make you mine

Yeah, tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
Then I will make you mine
Love is on fire!
Tap tadi daw
Yeah, tap tadi daw
It was love at first time
No matter of time
That I will make you mine

Love is on fire!
