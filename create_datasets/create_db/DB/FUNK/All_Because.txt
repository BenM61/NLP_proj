Ooow
Yeah
Huh
Right on
Huh huh huh huh
In the morning
Yeah yeah yeah
When I rise
Lord have mercy
Sweet teardrops and I can't understand it y'all
Dropped from from my eyes
About the things
That go down
And this is a peculiar thing but look
When a guy
Lord have mercy
Is not around lookie here

About the girl I left behind
Couldn't find no peace of mind
Back and forth is a waste of time
And I'm broke and I ain't got a dime
Good god good god huh huh

Byu the time 
I get where I'm going
And I wanna tell you one thing look
My whole life my whole life my whole life is gonna be
All the things that I've done
Look I can't understand it but look  
All because all because all because I'm a foolish one

About the girl I left behind
Couldn't find no peace of mind
Back and forth is a waste of time
And I'm broke and I ain't got a dime
Good god good god huh huh
