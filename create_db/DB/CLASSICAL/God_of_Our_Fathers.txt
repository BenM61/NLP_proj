God of our fathers
Whose almighty hand
Leads forth in beauty 
In all the starry band 
Of shining worlds
In splendor through the skies
Our grateful songs
Before thy throne arise

Thy love divine 
Hath led us in the past
In this free land 
By thee our lot is cast
Be thou our Ruler
Guardian, Guide, and Stay
Thy word our law
Thy paths our chosen way 

From war's alarms
From deadly pestilence
Be thy strong arm
Our ever sure defense
Thy true religion
In our heart increase
Thy bounteous goodness
Nourish us in peace
