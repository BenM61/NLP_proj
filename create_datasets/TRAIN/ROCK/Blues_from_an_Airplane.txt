Do you know how sad it is to be a man alone
I feel so solitary being in my home without you
I don't know what to do 
And I don't know where you are

I can see my life is meant to fall apart some day
Just to be a simple man who sadly lost his way 
Got no girl so I got no world 
And I got no words left to say

Hey hey hey hey hey 
Come, make me happy like I've never known before
Say say say say say
Have you ever known no heart who need anymore?
Oh you
What's that sound around my heart I feel
Something new
I'm sure your love you've given must be real 
I know now
And I'm sure of how I can be the man I feel
I can be the man I feel
