There's no living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
No living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
It means the world to me if you stay with me,
but I know what goes around comes around.
Even though I want us to be, you have changed lately,
There goes your pager, an hour later it's time to go, but you don't tell me so.
You say you're coming back, and I believe you're coming back.
I want you for me.
 
 
There's no living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
No living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
Oh, I tell myself you are mine and no one else can have you.
Even though with jealousy, I'm running in the lead,
but you don't know how much you meant to me, yeah.
There goes your pager, an hour later it's time to go, but you don't tell me so.
You say you're coming back, and I believe you're coming back.
It's just not the same without you.
 
There's no living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
No living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
There's no living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
No living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
 
I don't want the rest.
Girl, you are the best, and you know.
What am I to do if I ever lose you?
I'd rather be by myself.
There's no living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
No living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
There's no living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
No living without you, got me hooked on ev'rything you do.
