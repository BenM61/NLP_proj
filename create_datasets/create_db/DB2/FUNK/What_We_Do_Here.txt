I've never been down for the kiss and tell
But I realized that you don't know me well
I'm talking about grown things
Don't let the words get in the way

I know that you heard all about my past
And all the relationships that didn't last
For we do what we're gonna do
There something I must get straight, baby

See what we do here stays here
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
Its only cause I want you to have no fear
That baby what we do here stays here
And nobody has to know
What's good is if you meet me right after the show
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
That baby what we do here stays here

If you have any questions girl go on and ask
Right now our reputation is still in tact
Ten minutes till curtain call
Everything will be okay
I swear this has never happened once before
Chances are you won't get back once you're out that door
Your body is telling me yes, you can believe me when I say

See what we do here stays here
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
Its only cause I want you to have no fear
That baby what we do here stays here
And nobody has to know
What's good is if you meet me right after the show
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
That baby what we do here stays here

Its almost time to start the show
I don't want you to go
I want you stay, I'll say it again
Cause I need you so

See what we do here stays here
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
Its only cause I want you to have no fear
That baby what we do here stays here
And nobody has to know
What's good is if you meet me right after the show
I'm telling you cause I want to make it clear
That baby what we do here stays here
