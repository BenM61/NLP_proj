I tried to get away from your burning lips
I didn't want to play with your burning lips
I tried to get away from the flame but the flame tossed my heart
And I'm captured yes I'm captured
I'm enraptured by your charms
I can't hold out I've been sold out
By the thrills I found locked in your arms

The moment that our eyes met I realized
Another moment more and I'd be hypnotized
I tried to turn away from your eyes but your eyes held me fast
And I'm captured yes I'm captured
There is nothing I can do
I can't back track there's no track back
I am yours heaven open it's doors
And as I wandered through
(Captured by you)
Captured by you
(I couldn't get away get away from you)
