Just, just, just, just, let me make love to you, baby
I won't hurt, I won't hurt, I'll treat you ever so gentle
I'll make every little thing alright
Honey, you'll never forget this night

Just let me make love to you, baby
I'll be good, I'll be better than better
Neater than neater, sweeter than sweeter
I promise I'll do anythin' you want me to
Everything a man in love would do

When the mornin' comes puts the night on the mind
Let's not stop this moan
'Cause we've only, we've only
Begun to love, begun to love, baby, baby

Just let me make love to you, baby
I won't stop, I won't stop
'Til you ask me to, tell me to, beg me to

Oh baby, I'm countin' on you
Darlin', to make this wish come true
Girl, I tell you, "I countin' on you, I'm countin' on you"
To make all my dreams and wishes

Just let me make love to you, baby
I won't stop, I won't stop
'Til you ask me to, tell me to, beg me to

Oh baby, I'm countin' on you to make this wish come true
If you just let me make love to you, baby, love to you
I won't hurt, I won't hurt, baby, no
I'll treat you ever so gentle
I'll make every little thing alright
