Nights in white satin,
Never reaching the end,
Letters I've written,
Never meaning to send

Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before,
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

'Cause I love you,
Yes, I love you,
Oh, how, I love you

Gazing at people,
Some hand in hand,
Just what I'm going thru'
They can understand

Some try to tell me
Thoughts they cannot defend,
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end,

And I love you,
Yes, I love you,
Oh, how, I love you
Oh, how, I love you

Nights in white satin,
Never reaching the end,
Letters I've written,
Never meaning to send

Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before,
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

'Cause I love you,
Yes, I love you,
Oh, how, I love you
Oh, how, I love you

'Cause I love you,
Yes, I love you,
Oh, how, I love you
Oh, how, I love you
