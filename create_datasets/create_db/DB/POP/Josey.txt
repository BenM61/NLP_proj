Take my head out of my hands
We'll never go through this again
I couldn't do it without my friends
Get it out of me

And I won't
I won't
Swear it
And I won't
I won't
Swear it

"Jack flo and Josey 19"
Come on in, I hope you're clean
Do you know how to use this thing
I know, I know

And I won't
I won't
Swear it
And I won't
I won't
Swear it

And what you do and where you go
And wherever you go I will go
We will never let it come to this
Discovered mean 'cause I know
That we can do most anything
To decide toast and go home
Don't ever let them throw me out
'Cause I know
I am not alone

So you think you can change my world
And I thought o' my little girl
All these things are in my hair and she says
She says that, "I won't"
I won't
Swear it

And I won't
I won't
Swear it

And what you do and where you go
And wherever you go well I'll go
We will never let it come to this
Discovered mean 'cause I know
That we can do most anything
To decide toast and go home
Don't ever let them throw me out
'Cause I know
I am not alone
