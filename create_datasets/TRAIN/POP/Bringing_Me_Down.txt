You're bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around love
Staying out all night

Get outta sight
Don't hang around
Your bringing me down
Well the things your doing
Or playing your games
Well you better get wise now
Or things gonna change
'cause your bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around Love
Staying out all night

Get outta sight
Don't hang around
Your bringing me down
Well you used to tell me
My love was your flame
But I had you last evening
No it wasn't the same
'cause your bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around love
Staying out all night

Get outta sight
Don't hang around
Your bringing me down
(Break)
Your bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around love
Staying out all night

Get outta sight
Don't hang around
Your bringing me down
Well your love used to echo
From my feet to my brain
Ah but now it just whispers
Well I think your to blame
'cause your bringing me down
And you know it ain't right
You've been running around love
Staying out all night

Get outta sight
Don't hang around
Your bringing me down
Yeah your bringing me down 
(Down Down Down)
Yeah your bringing me down 
(Down Down Down)
Ah your bringing me down 
(Down Down Down)
Yeah your bringing me down
