Drift along
Drift along
Gonna find them
Drift along
Gonna find them
Drift along (repeated)

Need to make is special
Need to make it new
Looking for the action
Something more to do
Underneath the pavement
Towers in the clouds
Gotta find the action
Need it soon
Right now

Drift along (repeated)

[Chorus (x2):]
Cause I've been searching for all the people
I used to turn to and
All the people who knew the answers
Let's get the feeling again

Back in sweet suburbia
Middle of the road
Looking for the action
Everywhere I go
Need to make it special
Need to make it knew
Looking for the action
Something more to do 

Drift along (repeated)

[Chorus (x4):]
Cause I've been searching for all the people
I used to turn to and
All the people who knew the answers
Let's get the feeling again
