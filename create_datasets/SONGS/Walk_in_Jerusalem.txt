Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up
High up in Jerusalem
When I die

Way up, way up
Way up, way up
High up in Jerusalem
When I die

God knows I'm gonna
Walk in Jerusalem
Talk in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Be in Jerusalem
High up in Jerusalem when I die

Oh, be in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Shout in Jerusalem
Pray in Jerusalem
High up in Jerusalem when I die

Hmm, when I get down to the river
I'm gonna stick my sword in the sand
For I spy the old ship of Zion
She took a-many to the Promised Land

Way over in Buelah
Where there ain't no dying there
Where the saints shoutin' victory
Oh, they singin', Lord, everywhere

Way over in Buelah
I hear the voice of friends I've known
They been gone on, gone on to Glory
Well, well, a long time ago

They been waitin'
They been watchin'
They been waitin' at the beautiful gates
And one day I'm gonna meet them
Oh, I'm gonna sing forever more

Way over in Buelah
I see the Captain beckoned to me
Well, he's callin' all God's children
Oh, to meet him on the Promised Land

God knows I'm gonna
Walk in Jerusalem
Talk in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Be in Jerusalem
High up, oh, in Jerusalem
When I die, oh yeah

In Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Shout in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
High up, oh, in Jerusalem
When I die
