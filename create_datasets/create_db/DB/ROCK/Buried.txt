Bury me with my guitar
Bury me with my records
Where I am going, I'm gonna need something to do
Bury me with my guitar

Bury me with my best t-shirt
Bury me with my Chucks
Where I am going, I'm gonna need something to wear
Bury me with my black t-shirt

Nothing ever changes, I'll be
Happier than hell in Hell
Waiting for my friends and family

Yeah all right I said it, I think
You're a bunch of crazies, love you
I'm taking you all down with me

Bury me with my Blue Spirits
Bury me in Echo Park
Where I am going, I'm gonna need somewhere to hang
Bury me with my Blue Spirits

Of course I hope we live forever
Get happy and can grow together
Never ever have to say goodbye

But just in case I made this list and
If you lose it I'll be pissed, but
At least I know you'll give it your best try

We're gonna give it our best try
We're gonna help put everything back inside
Where I am going, I'm gonna need somebody there
Bury me with my mama

Bury me next to my mama
Bury me next to my pops pop!
Where I am going, I'm gonna need someone who cares
Bury me with my guitar
