I'm living in my life
I'm living in my life
I saved a nation and I broke no law
I'm living in my life
I know who put me here
I saved a nation and I
Broke no law
So tell me something new
Yeah tell me something new
Tell me what you got to look so pleased about
Yeah tell me something new
Just tell me something new
Tell me what you got to look so pleased
About

Now listen to this
Now listen to this
If you eat junk you become junk
I never broke no law no
Now listen to this, now listen to this
If you eat junk
You become junk
I never broke no law no
I saved a nation
I saved a nation. State of the nation

I'm living in you
I'm living near you
A shut mouth 
Never makes no moan
I'm living in you
I'm living near you
This country's dirty and
Depressing me
Nobody can beat me, nobody can beat me
I need replacing by a better man
Nobody can beat me
Nobody can beat me
A better lover with a fool plan
