Spirituality is a henna tattoo
That you wash off when you find something new to get into
Standing in the field with your flashlight blinking
'Cuz somebody told you the aliens were thinking they'd want you
In the end it doesn't really matter what you say or what you wear
So you think Big G gives a - how you get there
Buddhism, Communism, Hinduism,
Health Foodism, Lennonism, Sexism
What about your own ism
Just get real
Don't be a cosmic woo woo
Be who you are let everybody deal
Speak with your own voice just get real
Just get real like this

When I was fifteen I made my mother rant
'Cuz I joined a cult gave me words to chant to reach Heaven
So I used them for the lotto and won big money
They shouted you're in don't worry honey
This ain't 7-11 get in and out
Pop psychology words don't mean anything
When you throw them around to be cool
What goes around comes around
That's what they say
Catholicism, Footballism, Judaism, Racism, Manism, Womanism
What about Humanism

Just get real
Don't be a cosmic woo woo
Be who you are let everybody deal
Speak with your own voice just get real
Just get real don't be a cosmic woo woo
Be who you really are let everybody deal
Speak with your own voice just get real
Cosmic Woo Woo
Just get real
