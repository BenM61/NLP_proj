I see nothing in your eyes anymore
When you're staring at me
So I'm sitting here watching your sleep
Cause then it seems like it is to be

We can't go on like that
It doesn't make sense
And I got a feeling
That this is the last chance

To reanimate
Hey, hey baby emergency
It's not too late
Reanimate, there is no other way
And no day but today

We used to have our dinner on the kitchen floor
Left the world outside
Now everything became so different somehow
And I got tired of all those sleepless nights

We can't go on like that
It doesn't make sense
And I got a feeling
That this is the last chance

To reanimate
Hey, hey baby emergency
It's not too late
Reanimate, there is no other way
And no day but today

To reanimate
Hey, hey baby emergency
It's not too late
Reanimate, there is no other way
And no day but today

If I could have your attention tonight
Bring the light right back in your eyes
I swear that we could turn back time
Just give it a try
To turn back the time

To reanimate
Hey, hey baby emergency
It's not too late

To reanimate
Hey, hey baby emergency
It's not too late
Reanimate, there is no other way.

If I could have your attention tonight
Bring the light right back in your eyes
I swear that we could turn back time
This is the last chance 
No day but today
I feel it 
To reanimate
Believe me
No day but today
We got to reanimate our love tonight

We used to have our dinner on the kitchen floor
Left the world outside.
