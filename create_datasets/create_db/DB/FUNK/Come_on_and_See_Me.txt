If you need a lover
Truer than any other
Come on and see me
If you need a heart
That will never tear apart
Better come on and see me
'Cause I've got a true love just for you, love
And it can be yours baby eternally
If you want it, you better come and get it
If you want it, better come and get it

If you need a lover
That'll stick right by you, brother
Come on and see me
I'll stand by your side
Wipe your weepin' eyes
Come on and see me
I've got joy, love, for some boy, love
And it can be yours eternally
If you want it, you better come and get it
I say if you want it, better come and get it

Ba-a-by (come on darling)
Su-yu-gar (come on honey)
Ho-yo-ney (come on baby)
Ba-a-by (come on)
I've got joy, love, for some boy, love
And I've got a true love, just for you, love
It can be yours, baby, it can be yours baby, eternally

If you want it, better come and get it
Ba-a-by, baby (come on)
Su-yu-gar, sugar (come on)
Ho-yo-ney, honey
Ba-a-by, baby (come on, come on)
