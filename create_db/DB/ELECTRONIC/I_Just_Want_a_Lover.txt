I just want a lover
Nothing that is complicated
I don't want to know you
We don't have to talk about it
Let us both discover
There is nothing better than just
Lying here together
Staring out the bedroom window

I just want a lover
Could you be the person for me
Nothing sentimental
I want you to satisfy me

I just want a lover
To take away the pain
I just want a lover
To fool around again
Friday seems so easy
Saturday is hard
I just want a lover
To ease my broken heart
Ease my broken heart

I just want a lover
Let me hear your body talking
Don't have to imagine
All the things we'd do together
Caught under the cover
Bodies ?
You don't want to know me
Staring out the bedroom window

I just want a lover
I just want a lover
I just want a lover

(I don't want to leave)

I just want a lover
To take away the pain
I just want a lover
To fool around again
Friday seems so easy
Saturday is hard
I just want a lover
To ease my broken heart
Ease my broken heart

I just want a lover
(I desire you, your back's against the wall
You don't have to lose)

(I don't want to leave)

I just want a lover
Nothing that is complicated
I don't want to know you
We don't have to talk about it
Let us both discover
There is nothing better than just
Lying here together
Staring out the bedroom window
