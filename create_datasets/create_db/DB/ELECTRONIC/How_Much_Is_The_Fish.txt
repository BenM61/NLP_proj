The chase is better the the catch

Transforming the tunes
We need your support
If you've got the breath back
It's the first page of the second chapter

I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Coming down on the floor like a maniac
I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Get down in full effect

I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Coming down on the floor like a maniac
I want you back so clean up the dish
By the way, how much is the fish?

How much is the fish?
Here we go, here we go
Here we go again, yeah
Sunshine in the air

We're breaking the rules
Ignore the machine
You won't ever stop this
The chase is better than the catch

I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Coming down on the floor like a maniac
I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Get down in full effect

I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Coming down on the floor like a maniac
I want you back so clean up the dish
By the way, how much is the fish?

How much is the fish?
Yeah
Sunshine in the air

Come
Na na na
Everybody
Na na na
Come on
Na na na
Together

Na na na
(Yeah)

How much is the fish?
How much is the fish?
Yeah

Come on, come on
Resurrection
