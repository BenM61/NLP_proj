I saw you, you saw me
Tell me are we sharing the same fantasy?
I'll kiss you, kiss me too
I just got the message, yes, it's me and you

Your smile gave me the go ahead
It's good to know that love is calling
Knocking, knocking, knocking at the door

When love comes calling
Won't you open up for more?
Your love is calling
Calling, calling, calling on you

To my surprise, you hypnotized a little girl
But made a woman come alive
It's no mystery, baby, can't you see
You are everything I ever promised me?
