I'm over you
Oh you can be sure
What you do, what you say
Who you see, who you are
Don't matter anymore
You'll fade away
I'm already clear
What you do, what you say
What you think, what you are
Don't belong here

I'm over you
Soon I'll be rid of you and your ways
And I'll forget all those wasted days
And I wonder what took me so long
to finally let you know that I've begun

I'm over you
Oh you can be sure
What you do, what you say
who you see, who you are
don't matter anymore
You'll fade away, I'm already clear
What you do, what you say
what you think, what you are
don't belong here

I'm over you, over you
I'm over you, over you
I'm over you
Over you
I'm over you
Over you
