Take me every morning
Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay

Up all night
Before you slip into the white
There's something I want you to know
In all your stretch of consciousness

You've still got a long way to go
Some make you spin,
Some make you sweat,
It's only here for you to choose

Some like it hot,
But I like it wet, so tell me...
What have we got to lose now?
Take me every morning

Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay
Up all night

(A hit, a hit)
A hit to fit reality
It's just a state of mind
And you, and it, it's more than just

And that's what you've got to find
We'll make you spin,
We'll make you sweat
All you have to do is choose me

And if you would try
And alternative high
Then tell me, what have we got to lose now?
Take me every morning

Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay
Up all night

Take me every morning
Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay
Up all night
