Oh, you've got life right in the pocket
Oh, don't you know what I mean?
Oh, you've got life right in the pocket
Oh, it's been out of our sea

It's been some time since I have seen your face
Seems we both gained some weight
Our eyes dream small now than our mouths these days
Yeah, we be showing our age

But oh, we've got life right in the pocket
Oh, don't you know what I mean?

We had to know the simple things would change
We knew they'd complicate
You got a place right, never fold on a crooked game
You got a plan anyway

When the end's coming, we probably won't be around to see it
Better just to follow me, keep on a best behavior 

But oh, we've got life right in the pocket
Oh, you know what I say
Oh, you don't know what just to say here
Oh, it's not what you say
Oh, it's not enough just to say it
Oh, it's in how we be
