Are teenage dreams so hard to beat?
Everytime she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

I want to hold you, want to hold you tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
come on

I'm gonna call her on the telephone
and have her over 'cause I'm all alone
I need excitement and I need it bad
cause it's the best I've ever had

I want to hold you, want to hold you tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
come on

Get those teenage kicks right through the night yeh
