You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low

Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone

Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm comin' off this

Long and winding road
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

Tonight tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

You know that I've seen
Too many romantic dreams
Up in lights, fallin' off
The silver screen

My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing keeps me together
At the seams

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight tonight

I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeah yeah

I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
