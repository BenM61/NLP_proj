I lift you off the earth mundane and glum
Out of solar system where you passed the sun
'Til all the fear in your hart is gone and so on

Walking trough the world with no pressure
Inner peace beyond measure
I was leaving where it came in
When a man said stop
I want to have what you have
And get what you got

I got it sleeping rough on the streets in the rain
I got it learning to share my peoples pain
I got it making flowers grow in hearts of stone
I got it 'cause I always take thee long way home

I've been walking trough the world with no pressure
As fresher full of vigour life becomes my mirror
The further I go the more I know
Oh yeah, wherever the wind blow I'll be there

Turned up in places that I never intended to go
And so ended my youth I once deepended on proof
Now I'm in the flow, there I things I know beyond knowing
I've seen a seed growing, I was going back home
When a man said stop, I want to have what you have
And get what you got

I got it sleeping rough on the streets in the rain
I got it learning to share my peoples pain
I got it making flowers grow in hearts of stone
I got it 'cause I always take thee long way home
