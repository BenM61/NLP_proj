Put your money where your mouth is
Get your finger on the buzzer
Paint it on
Show the bumps
'Cause you're really gonna jump tonight

Can you fell you're getting ready?
Don't you see it in the mirror?
Show it all
Show too much
Hey, you're really gonna jump tonight 

Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough 

Put your image in your pocket
Hang your collar in the closet
Cause a crash
Make a splash

'Cause you're really gonna wipe 'em out
Getting rid of inhibitions
Makes a little exhibition
Turn it on
Lossen up
'Cause you're really gonna wipe 'em out 

Dressed to kill, she want to play with you
Watch your step, she's gonna run you through
Dressed to kill, she's got amazing grace
Watch the Devil, with an angel's face
Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough 

So you're lookin' like a million
And you're getting the attention
Play 'em up
Turn 'em on

Boy they're really gonna work tonight
Hey he's sittin' in the corner
Like a little Jack Horner
Make him break

Take his cake
Oh he's gonna be your fool tonight
Catch him with that funky stuff
Take him till you've had enough
