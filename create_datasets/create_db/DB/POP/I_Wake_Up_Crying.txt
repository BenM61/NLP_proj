I wake up crying
After tossing and turning
And yearning the whole night long

Pretty baby
Since you went away
Haven't spent a happy day

I wake up crying
After sobbing and sighing
And wondering just what went wrong

Pretty baby
I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue

I need your arms
To hold me tight
I need your lips
To kiss me goodnight

I'm so unhappy on my own
Don't, don't leave me
Sad and lonely

I wake up crying
After tossing and turning
And yearning the whole night long

Pretty baby
Please come back to me
Save me from this misery

Oh, baby, won't you
Save me from this misery
Oh, baby, won't you
Save me from this misery
