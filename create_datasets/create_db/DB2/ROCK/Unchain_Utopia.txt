We're in a time where all enterprises fall
We should beware of the wolves that haunt us
They are not all the same, cannot take the blame
Await the time to unchain utopia

Am I the only one who sees the troubled lines?
Reading illusive writings on the mirror
Is there a way that we can all erase mistakes and start anew?
Don't mislead us and stop stabbing with blunt knives

Liberty unchained

We're in a time where all enterprises fall
We should beware of the wolves that haunt us
They are not all the same, cannot take the blame
Await the time to unchain utopia

What is a reason to wreck hopes and all our dreams?
You're leaving endless riddles for the masses
Does it make sense to mend the cracks that you hide behind our backs?
It's afflicted by a virus of the brain

Liberty unchained
Recite the insane

We're in a time where all enterprises fall
We should beware of the wolves that haunt us
They are not all the same, cannot take the blame
We should beware of the lives that are at stake
Before it's all too late

Can we believe it all?
Should we all take the fall?
Our backs against the wall
United we stand tall

Why should we all believe you?
Carry your own burden
We won't succumb to
Your delusion now

We're in a time where all enterprises fall
We should beware of the wolves that haunt us
They are not all the same, cannot take the blame
Await the time to unchain utopia

Why should we all believe you?
Carry your own burden
We won't succumb to
Your deceiving games
Conquer the insane
United we stand tall
Time to free ourselves once more from the ball and chain
