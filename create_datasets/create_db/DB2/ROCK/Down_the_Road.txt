I gave you high steppin' slippers 
But you still can't move your feat 
And it's cold in the morning 
So I turn away at the heat 
You say faster so I speed up 
But still I'm much too slow 
I feel your innuendo 
You got all the answers, least they say you do 
But when I start to strut my stuff 
You say "hey it ain't time to go" 
That ain't what I've been told 
Guess I better meet you down the road 
Down the road 

You know sometimes I want to steal away and stare 
Until my face it touch the ground 
My dinner in Chicago, oh my breakfast down the line 
If you don't hear from me girl, I hope you're feelin' fine 
'Cause I've been doin' time, hope you're feelin' fine 

Call me up, catch a plane 
But don't think of taking another game 
'Cause my regular lady she gets my pocket change 

Do you want my every thought 
Well come over here and try to get me off 
Won't you please me 

Shake your dignity 
Put a little on me 
On me, on me, on me
