The sun is shining, although it's raining in my heart,
The sun is shining, although it's raining in my heart,
You know I love you baby, ah,
But the best of friend must part.

My baby left me this morning, ah,
And didn't even, ah, say goodbye,
My baby left me this morning,
No, she didn't even, ah, she didn't even say goodbye, ah
She said she wasn't gonna leave me, ah,
But she told poor me a lie.

I had a dream, I had a dream one rainy night, ah,
Ah, I had a dream, I had a dream one rainy night, ah,
Went out, when I found my baby, ah,
She told me, "Daddy everything was alright."
