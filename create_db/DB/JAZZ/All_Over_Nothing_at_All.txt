Ooo, all over nothing at all
You built me up to a waterfall
We made up and then
Quarreled again
All over nothing at all

You pinned a note to the wall
I thought at least you would call
But I never heard
Not even a word
All over nothing at all

If you ever come back
Well, I'd be so nice to you
If you never come back
I'll be with the crazies
Pushing up the daisies

I watch the clock on the wall
Wait for your step in the hall
It's hard to conceive
Hard to believe
It's all over nothing at all

Ooo, all l over nothing at all
You built me up to a waterfall
We made up and then
All over again
All over nothing at all

You pinned a note to the wall
I thought at least you would call
But I never heard
Not even a word
All over nothing at all

If you ever come back
I'd be so nice to you
If you never come back
I'd be with the crazies
Pushing up the daisies

I watch the clock on the wall
Wait for your step in the hall
Say, it's hard to conceive
Hard to believe
It's over and we're all through

It's hard to conceive
Hard to believe
It's all over nothing at all
All over nothing at all
