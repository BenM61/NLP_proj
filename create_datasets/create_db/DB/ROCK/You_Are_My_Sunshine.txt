You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When sky's are gray
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night, dear
As I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear
I was mistaken
And I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When sky's are gray
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

Please don't take my sunshine away
