Oogum oogum boogum boogum
Boogum now baby
You're castin' your spell on me
I say, oogum oogum boogum boogum
Boogum now baby
You're castin' you're spell on me
You got me doin' funny things like a clown
Just look at me

When you wear your high heeled boots
With your hip hugger suit
It's all right, you're outta sight
And you wear that cute mini skirt
With your brother's sloppy shirt
I admit it, girl that I can dig it
Well then I says

Oogum oogum boogum boogum
Boogum now baby
You're castin' your spell on me
I say, oogum oogum boogum boogum
Boogum now baby
You're castin' your spell on me
You got me doin' funny things like a clown
Just look at me

When you wear your bell bottom pants
I just stand there in a trance
I can't move, you're in the groove
Would you believe little girl
That I am crazy 'bout you
Now go on with your bad self

Oh my my my baby's got that spell on me
Oh now mercy, mercy on me

When you wear those big earrings
Long hair, and things
You got style, girl, that sure is wild
And you wear that cute trench coat
And you're standin' and posin'
You got soul, you got too much soul

I just say who got the blues
Say who got the blues
Say who got the blues now
Castin' your spell on me
Well I say, "Who got the blues
Say who got the blues
