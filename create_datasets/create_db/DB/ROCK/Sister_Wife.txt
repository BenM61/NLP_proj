So, one thing led to another
You're calling her our lover
My brother's her brother
And if you want me to do it, I
guess that I'll do it, but
I'm telling you
One wrong move and yeah we're through

Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do

Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my life
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do

Yeah, man, kick out the logic
With you as the prophet
I don't think you got this
And holy as our father
I'd rather not bother, I
and I'm telling you
One wrong move and we're through

Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do

Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do

I'm stuck with two
I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with two
I'm stuck with

Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do

Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do
