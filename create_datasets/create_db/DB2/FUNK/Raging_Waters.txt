Lovers cross the raging waters
Lovers walk the burnin' sand
Lovers stop the time in order
To take the moment in their hands
Lovers toss away a kingdom
Lovers abdicate the crown
Lovers fight for love and freedom
Breakin' the chains that hold'em down

You gotta keep on
Lovin' lovers
You gotta keep on
Didn't I say

Everyone is frantic the antics
Become bizarre
Every last romantic's been
Banished to some cold star
Never again expire, be tired
And given in
I'm gonna take my lover discover
The promised land
I'll say that

Lovers cross the raging waters
Lovers walk the burnin' sand
Lovers stop the time in order
To take the moment in their hands
Lovers toss away a kingdom
Lovers abdicate the crown
Lovers fight for love and freedom
Breakin' the chains that hold'em down

You gotta keep on
Lovin' lovers
You gotta keep on
Touchin' others
You gotta keep on
Lovin' lovers
You gotta keep on
Didn't I say

Lovers cross the raging waters
Lovers walk the burnin' sand
Lovers stop the time in order
To take the moment in their hands
Lovers toss away a kingdom
Lovers abdicate the crown
Lovers fight for love and freedom
Breakin' the chains that hold'em down
