What does it take to win your love for me?
How can I make this dream come true for me?
Oh, I just got to know,
Oh, baby, 'cause I love you so,
Gonna blow for you
 
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried, 
I've tried in every way 
I could to make you see how much I love you
Oh, I thought you understood
So you gotta make me see,
What does it take to win your love for me?
