She grew up watching hockey
With her daddy on Saturday nights 
He taught her how to tie her skates
Her brothers taught her how to fight 
She can wear high heels and flannel 
She can look sexy in a toque
She likes snow storms and Gordon Lightfoot
And if you're lucky she'll love you

Canadian girls, Canadian girls
Irresistible, lovable trouble though sometimes girls 
We can travel the world 
From New York to Paris, France
But we're always gonna come back 
Canadian girls 

Baby she likes to snowboard
Spends her summers out on a boat
Thinks a perfect night out is a cabin 
Smell of coffee on a old wood stove
She won't admit she watched Degrassi
She's proud and sometimes quiet 
True north national treasure
She'd give her life for the red and white

Canadian girls, Canadian girls
Irresistible, lovable trouble though sometimes girls 
We can travel the world 
From New York to Paris, France
But we're always gonna come back 
Canadian girls 

Well us boys we like our fishing
Hockey and Ron McLean 
We like Moosehead Beer and white tail deer
Stomping Tom and the UFC 
And we like our foreign ladies 
Their accents are really nice
But their nothing like our northern girls
To keep us warm at night

Canadian girls, Canadian girls
Irresistible, lovable trouble though sometimes girls
We can travel the world 
From New York to Paris, France
But we're always gonna come back 
Canadian girls
