Public Warning, who's in town?
Public Warning, all bow down

I'm riding here on this beat
'Cause I don't give a monkeys what you think about me
It's on, no long ting, it's on
Ding dong, who's that, peekaboo it's Sov

Yo, ladies and gentlemen this ain't no experiment
It's the uneducated example of intelligence
By irrelevance, means more than your irrelevance
Its evident, there's evidence that I am bloody excellent

Yo, first I got a gig bigger and better
And flow on the mic I'm a level which
And I?ll get you back wife a dirty backhander
If I discover you are a hater

See I told you that I'm better
Maybe when betty bought I bit of butter
Well, I'm bringin' a bit a better, a bitta gutter
A bitta of an uh, uh, a bitta haha
A bit of every little damn thing

Public Warning, who's in town?
Public Warning, all bow down
Public Warning, who's in town?
Public Warning, Sov?s in town

Crown me the pint size clown of the town
Said I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down
Or I'll be the boogie woogie woman, in her boogie woman gown
And I'll boogie woogie you with my boogie woogie sound

See I told you that I'm better
Maybe when Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Well, I'm pickin' a bitter better, a bit of gutter
A bitta ha, ha, a bit of every little damn thing, ching

Public Warning, Sov?s in town

I'm that walkin' dictionary
I'm that talking thesaurus
I'm that old school, prehistoric sovasouras
I got a habit of absolutely damaging any track when I attack it

See I told you that I'm raw
Maybe when she sold them seashells on the seashore
Well, I'm sellin' a little more, a little raw
A little encore please while I drop it hardcore, now ha, ha

Public Warning, who's in town?
Public Warning, all bow down

Public Warning, Sov?s in town
