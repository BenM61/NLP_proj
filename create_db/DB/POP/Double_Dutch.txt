I tried to jump in, and I realized I was good at it

Let me say I seen, let me play
Though I'm going out of time
You ever affected by the words that you sing?
See her jump over the line

She jumps the ropes
(Skipping, good grief, flowers) it's all they do
She jumps the ropes
(Jumping rope for hours) it's all they do

Going double dutch, it's just
I'm always a curious little girl, always want to try new things
I tried to jump in and I realized I was good at it (with my friends)

Jumping on the pavement with my friends
Jumping to the end
See 'em on the corner every day
At sundown by the streetlight
Sipping sugar out of straws, making braids
Making sure their shoes are tied

She jumps the ropes
(Skipping, good grief, flowers) it's all they do
She jumps the ropes
(Jumping rope for hours) it's all they do

My name is Katherine Wilchuck and I'm nineteen years old
I'm part of this fan club and I've been double-jumping since I was ten years old
I learned how to jump by the street game of double dutch

(She's a good grief flower)
(You should get along)

With my friends
Jumping on the pavement with my friends
Jumping to the end, with my friends
Jumping on the pavement with my friends
Jumping to the end, with my friends
Jumping on the pavement with my friends
Jumping to the end
