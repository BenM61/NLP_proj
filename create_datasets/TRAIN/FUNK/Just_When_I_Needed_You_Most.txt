Woke up this morning and I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing door
I didn't stand in your way

I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most

Most every morning I stare out the window
And I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me

I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most

Woke up this morning and I stared out the window
And I struggled for somethin to say
You left in the rain without sayin a word
I didn't stand in your way

Now I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most
