When a prince of a fella meets a Cinderella
On a night as bright as this
Does he slip her a slipper, no sir,
Not if he can slip her a kiss
When the moonlight is yeller
Does the Cinderella
Tell the fella to be gone
Does she leave him at midnight, no sir,
Not if she can linger till dawn
Arm in arm, they dream while they're dancing
To the sound of a trumpet wail
Though it's not the place for romancing
It's a modern fairytale
When a prince of a fella meets a Cinderella
And he whispers "Wouldst thou woo, woo, woo"
Does she cuddle up closer, yes sir,
Baby hows about it with you.

Here's a modern fairytale
It never will fail, da-da-da-da,
When boy meets girl
And their hearts beat as one
When all's said and done
Well, can't you see
That love was meant to be
Follow the boy and the girl

When a prince of a fella meets a Cinderella
On a night as bright as this
That's if the moon is bright
And it will light the way to love

Oh, arm in arm they always dream
While dancing under the stars
They're romancing

Oh love is grand
While hand in hand
A modern fairytale
Love, love, and it is grand
