I hear a new girl moved into town yeah
Now your baby ain't nowhere around
And now you think you're in despair
You feel that still the cold light's clinging in the air

Love's a game you're in it
And you were so proud of it
Someone you can't depend on
Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say
He won't come
Running back to your arms
It's all over baby
Whoa oh oh it won't do no good to cry yeah yeah yeah

How you think I felt when you
You left me then you never said a word except that we're through
And you didn't fight it all the way
I don't care you just don't mean that much to me this way yeah

Love's a game you're in it
And you were so proud of it
Someone you can't depend on
Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say
He won't come
Running back to your arms
It's all over baby
Well it won't do no good to cry yeah yeah yeah
Woo ooh ooh ooh yeah

Love's a game you're in it
Ha you were so proud of it
Someone you can't depend on
Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say
He won't come
Running back to your arms
All over baby
Whoa it's no good no good to cry yeah
