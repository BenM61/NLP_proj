He got lucky one time
Hitting with the girl in room 509
She turned her back on him facing the frame
Said, "Listen Joe, don't you come here again"

White sun scattered all over the sea
He could think of nothing but her name "Elise"
God is the sweat running down his back
The water soaked her blonde hair black

Its a perfect day Elise

He got burned by the sun
His face so pale and his hands so worn
Let himself in room 509
Said a prayer, and cried

It's a perfect day, Elise
