Amurkriki, amukiriki, amukiriki
The Lord willing I'll be with you
A distant journey, a safe tomorrow
Amukiriki
Then you'll hold me as I always want you to
In Mexico, amukiriki is as old as Mexico
and it means the Lord be willing
If the Lord shall will it so
Only then will there be harvest
Only then will rivers flow
No ore adios to you
I'll be close to you
If the Lord shall will it so
So I say "amukiriki" with you
Deep inside my heart
Knowing that the Lord be willing
We won't always be apart
After many purple twilight's
We still see a morning glow
and I will run to you
Bring the sun to you
If the Lord shall will it so
