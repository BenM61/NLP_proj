You don't have to be the lonely one
You don't have to be the lonely one
You don't have to be the lonely one

Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher
Higher and higher

You don't have to be the lonely one
You don't have to be the lonely one
You don't have to be the lonely one
