It's getting darker and I'm still swimming
It hits me again
I'm getting deeper and I'm still swimming
It hits me again
And I am never frightened, no I am never afraid
And you will never understand the lengths I go to light your way
See, left behind on my own
I have the ghosts of autumn murders walk me home
See the girl on the shore
My ideal, nothing more

It's getting darker and I'm still swimming
It hits me again
The sun is sinking pale, blue, saltwater breathing
It hits me again
And I am never frightened no I am never afraid
And you will never understand the depths I sink to light your way

See, left behind on my own
I have the ghosts of autumn murders walk me home
See the girl on the shore
It's my ideal
