Cold nites and harder days
Bed to lie down, lay away
Have a heart facing foreign places
Tired of seeing love, tired of waiting

But I keep on doing it
Ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
But I keep on doing it
Ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

I wish I could see your face
Taking on the rest of me
What was out of love
Take you cos the rest of me
Made you want to dance with me
Facing by the wall

No one ever told me I was wasting all of my time, all of my time
Every time that I see you baby,
Every time that I've seen you lately
Want to keep on saving for us

But I keep on doing it
Ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
But I keep on doing it
Ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

Now what would I change to get you back to my arms again
Instead that my life made you in love with a different man
If in my time you would pass my life
Could I still take you as my love
Tell me what I wanna do, tell what I gotta do better

I can't see from how hard I'll be in where I'll stay
I pray for myself again
