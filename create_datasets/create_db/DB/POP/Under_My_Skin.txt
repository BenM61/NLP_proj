Saturday night I was looking for trouble
Could find no one who would put up a fight
Went to a club and saw you dirty dancing
Despite myself I fell in love at first sight

come on come on
Come on get under my skin
Come on come on inject my desire
Come on come on
Come on get under my skin
Come on come on my inside's on fire
For you

I'm begging you baby please
You see I'm down on my knees
Don't be cruel stop your big tease
Big tease big tease
Yeah

Sunday morning and I feel like a football
Kicked around and bent right out of shape
I won't give up no I won't give in easy
I've got to get you - yeah 
Make no mistake
No more
