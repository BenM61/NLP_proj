I gave you all of my love
But you treated me like a fool
I even gave up right for wrong
Trying, trying to get along with you

When I wanted to hold you close
You were always too tired or you had some place to go
Listen daddy

Walking out that door, telling you goodbye
I can't take it no more
It's your time to cry
Oh, it's your time to cry

Oh, I tried staying with you because of our kids
But you still wouldn't do right
You leave, oh, early in the morning
I wouldn't see you no more till late, late, late at night

Although I still love you I'm afraid this is the end
And I just can't afford to make that same mistake again
Listen daddy

Walking out that door, telling you goodbye
I can't take it no more, I can't take it no more
It's your time to cry
Oh, it's your time to cry

It's over, it's over, it's over
