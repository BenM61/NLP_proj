Let me come down, let it all come down
Get up get in get out, I know you got something to say
Only you don't get to talk, not to me that way

Let it come down, let it all come down
Come on come on come on
Is anybody feeling the same
I will still be standing here, when you walk away

I don't know anymore
What I need and what for
All I know, is there must be something more

Let it come down let it all come down
You know you know you know
It don't matter what those people say
You don't want to live your life someone else's way

I don't know anymore
What I need and what for
All I know, is there must be something more

La di di, la di da
How did we ever get this far
Well I know, that there must be something more

Let me come down, let it all come down
Get up get up get up, I know you got something to say
Only you don't get to talk, not to me that way

I don't know anymore
What I need and what for
All I know, is there must be something more

La di di, la di da
How did we ever get this far
Well I know, that there must be something more
