Aye
Shawty I know you be hearing this and that
From here and there but,
Please trust and believe lil' momma
I see you gon' ride for me
So I'm a die for you
Is you wit' me?
I got your back boy
Well lets get it

We were high (til when its all good)
We were low ((til when its all bad)
But I promise I will never let you go
(now what you call that)
Said I got I got I got I got your back boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(as long I know you got my back right)
Keep my swagger
Keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya
And shawty if you don't know
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(you got my back right?)

Hey it's whatever shawty
You ain't gotta ask
Yes, Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check!
You can get it you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louie purses,
My mission's to purchase Earth for her
Present the gifts without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose
Pleasure to be at your service
We front row at fashion shows
As well as Sunday morning service
But better days or for worse
If I'm paid or I'm hurting in my pocket
She still got a nigga back, know that's for sure
No matter what may occur in life
Everyday with her is like a plus
I'm a love her til she be like that's enough
Pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill 'em up and lift 'em up
Let us toast to the future here's to us
No, here's to her

They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsche's me and you
Stuck to your side li, li, like glue
Be by your side boy, whatever your goin' through

We were high (til when its all good)
We were low ((til when its all bad)
But I promise I will never let you go
(now what you call that)
Said I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(as long I know you got my back right)
Keep my swagger
Keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya
And shawty if you don't know
I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)

This is for the women who man caught a sentence
Who gonna be there for a minute but they didn't keep their distance
They stayed home waiting on the phone
And on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face
Just wanna let you know we appreciate
Everything you do for us on a day to day
And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
We do all that's in our power just to please you
See boo, f*ck them girls I would leave the world 'fore I leave you
May God say even Eve and Adam ain't have shit on these two

They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsche's me and you
Stuck to your side li, li, like glue
Be by your side boy, whatever your goin' through

We were high (til when its all good)
We were low ((til when its all bad)
But I promise I will never let you go
(now what you call that)
Said I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(as long I know you got my back right)
Keep my swagger
Keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya
And shawty if you don't know
I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)

Sure 'nough
Even though them chicks be hatin' on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon' ride
Make all my fantasies come alive
That's no lie now
I'll be alright just as long as you beside me
Ten million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon' be in there with me at night
The pieces to my puzzle's in my life
With all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man and you know you got my back
Worth every car every bag with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home
I ain't never gon' leave that
Them bitches best believe that

We were high (til when its all good)
We were low ((til when its all bad)
But I promise I will never let you go
(now what you call that)
Said I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(as long I know you got my back right)
Keep my swagger
Keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya
And shawty if you don't know
I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right?)
I got I got I got I got your back, boy
(you got my back right, back right, back right)
