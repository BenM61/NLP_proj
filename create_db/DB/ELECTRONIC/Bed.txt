J. Holiday, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, 
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, 
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
Alright, okay 
Tonight your having me your way
Perfume, spray it there
Put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you
Fittin' to raise the temp in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh-uh, right there 
Uh you touch me like you care
Now stop and let me repay you for the week that you've been through
Working that 9-5 and staying cute, like you do oh, oh, oh

I love it, I love it, you love it, you love it
Every time, every time, we touchin', we touchin'
I want it, I want it, you want it, you want it
I'll see you, see you, in the morning, in the morning

[Chorus]
I wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryin' to put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'ma rock your body
Turn you over, love is war, I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'm a put you to bed, bed, bed
I'm a put you to bed, bed, bed

I'm staring at you while you sleep
You replaced it for beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe, aw breathe
Take you into my senses
Wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, It's round two
Matter of fact it's closer to three

She like, "how long I been sleep?"
Shorty, kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me
My angel this is wonderful
Thanks, for letting me bless you
Come down, fly, right, drift back into heaven oh, oh, oh, oh

I love it, I love it, you love it, you love it
Every time, every time, we touchin', we touchin'
I want it, I want it, you want it, you want it
I'll see you, see you, in the morning, in the morning

[Chorus]

Watch the sunlight peak over the horizons
Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou
The sun ain't the only thing that's shining
Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou
Now, I'ma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody, aye everybody aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, 
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, 
Aye, aye, aye,

[Chorus]

Watch the sunlight peak over the horizons
