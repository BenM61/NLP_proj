When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems
What'd you see on a night so clear
In the sky so very dear

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be (what you could truly be)

Shining star come in to view
Shine its watchful light on you
Give you strength to carry on
Make your body big and strong
Born a man child of the sun
Saw my work had just begun

Found I had to stand alone
Bless it now I've got my own
So, if you find yourself in need
Why don't you listen to these words of heed
Be a giant grain of sand
Words of wisdom, yes I can

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

Shinning star for you to see
What your life can truly be
Shinning star for you to see
What your life can truly be
Shinning star for you to see
What your life can truly be
