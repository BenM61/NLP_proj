My sky is red like blood
Kissed by a native sun
Who smiles and fades away
It seems a perfect shade
Able to read your scent
Winding your sight with glow
I'm losing these clothes of stones

Cherrywood eyes always with me
Watching the lights over the hill
Cherrywood eyes let me just be

My sky is blue like ice
Kissed by a winter star
Who smiles and fades away
It seems a perfect shade
Able to read your scent
Winding your sight with glow
I'm losing these clothes of stone

Cherrywood eyes always with me
Watching the lights over the hill
Cherrywood eyes let me just be
It's a dream, or maybe another way to live

Do I always make it right?
Oh, maybe not
