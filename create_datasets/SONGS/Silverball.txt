With a lousy moon
A sullen face I saw a silverball
It led me to a concert hall I followed it inside
As I sat down a smile began to come upon my face
And I saw that the singer held a silverball
Smiling wide and standing tall
Her music sounds so sweet
She smiled at me

I had a dream of one silverball
Guiding me to felicity
I had a dream
Happy I seemed
But it was just a dream
Happy I seemed

A rainy day, a walk outside
Where oh where is my sun
Why must it hide
A silver ball passed beside my eye
It seemed as if to fly to the sun
Where a woman with a funny face
Juggled two big silverballs
Of sadness there's no trace
She smiled at me

I had a dream of two silverballs

Guiding me to felicity
I had a dream
Happy I seemed
But it was just a dream
Happy I seemed

Floating towards a stairway I
See all people holding my
Silver fortune balls
Throwing them at me to catch
I jump high can't reach them yet
My fortune passes by
They smiled at me

I woke up late but stayed in bed
Another silverball rolled past my head
Please let me catch just once this ball
I know I'll be alright if I hold it tight

I had a dream of three silverballs
guiding me to felicity
I had a dream
Happy I seemed
But it was just a dream
Happy I seemed

Happy I seemed
With three silverballs
Happy I seemed
