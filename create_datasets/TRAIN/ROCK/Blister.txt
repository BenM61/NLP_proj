Take advantage of these times, you said
You let me down
It hasn't been the first time

As I'm falling in the pit of fire
My mind's made up
I'm never coming back here

And how long would it take me
To walk across the United States
All alone?
The west coast has been traumatized
And I think I'm the only one
Still alive

Is it just a coincidence
To see you by 
Yourself with no direction?

Now it's time to move on and
Don't you know
That things aren't getting better

And how long would it take me
To walk across the United States
All alone?
The west coast has been traumatized
And I think I'm the only one
Still alive

When the world caves in
What'cha gonna do?
When the world caves in
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?

(Don't try and stop me
Because I'm falling fast
Into this pit of fire
Which surrounds us all

In a blanket of fear
That I've been wrapped in for years?
Don't try and stop me
You can't stop me)

And how long would it take me
To walk across the United States
All alone?
The west coast has been traumatized
And I think I'm the only one
Still alive
