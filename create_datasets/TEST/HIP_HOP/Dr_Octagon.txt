The plane managed to land  the skeleton at the controls 
A place called the Twilight Zone 
Are extraterrestrials able to accomplish this? 
I will explain but you'd become more puzzled at the possibilities 
Earth ending trilogies, wacky stuff 
Like gas passing dinosaurs 
While I stroll in circles blindfolded 
Gave a lady some wrinkle cream out of rat poop 
You might just laugh so hard your skull cracks 
Brain spills thick blood shooting out like a champagne cork 
Females so horny and mean, sucking scales off of live rattlesnakes 
My boy gave his girl money for groceries, she got a new hairdo 
Women like this could even make the devil commit suicide 
hung from a tree on Johannesburg with no parachute 
Big-Bigfoot captured by UFO's 
Haloes were found, at the landing sites, vanishing 
Vanishing victims, kept alive on metal examining tables 
Ex-Experts baffled they could survive the caustic exposure 
to laser scalpels, green berets 
Flowing cold heads in mechanical wombs 
Radioactive constant temperature circular appendages 
Cripples start shaking sending distress signals 
We're not alone in the Twilight Zone 
"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed" 

Keep it simple 

"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed" 

Keep it simple 

Back in spiral, I roast humans like a gyro 
New York, Atlanta, Africa to Cairo 
Diplomat King Presidential offspring 
Two miles from Westinghouse, with lights down South 
Government chemical voodoo man miracle 
Super disease your brain is more hysterical 
My urine see paralyze your ability with space codes 
electrodes you're ready for a pap smear 
Wax in your inner ear, doodoo in your outer ear 
Two cows a zebra will jump through your atmosphere 
Giraffe-Funk will raise beamin through your trunk 
Steam of Legion, to burn up in your anal region 
Power contracting with bombs in his rectum factor 
Utilized phonic like water in your Panasonic 
Trip or slip or fall 
Right into the earth pit, gamma ray toilet 
Microbes on your earth shit 
Dr. Ludicrous, I turn into a octapus 
Grab eight species, isolate like an incubus 
Convert with probes, green shit is on your earlobes 
Attack what stomach with juice they call gastric 
Alien bugs with sickle cell, get they ass kicked 
Dermatologist examine more black cysts 
Radiation butter pouring down your sinus, it's Dr. Octagon 

"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed" 

Keep it simple 

"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed" 

Keep it simple 

Utilize to abuse minds 
Slice head halves, let's probe the subconcious lobe 
Mathematical parabola, ACT test and just ex-plorating 
the creative arctic regions, or isolating cockpit 
A regular pitstop monitoring with enough fuel to fly a small dirigible 
To a place an oasis in a nebula, Earth 
Universal charting unseen atmosphere 
Requesting assistance, I speed through waves like a Concorde SST 
Then open aperature 
The shape of Octagon selects forward morphing it's the vertical 
Frankenstein 
Prototype of like Kervorkian 
Mind pedestrian controls 
Spend elevation gobble the ignorant supersonic cruise 
Hidin to think, focus psychosis with Von Blowford 
Black lotus releases when life is flailing external 
terminal update, thermal conducted power source supplied 
Man on the moon pumps amps, or souped up cable boxes 
getting up impossible 
The speaker needs another dose, concoct 
Concoct the scenario view, in a position of a coroner 
describing current events bent on human dismemberment 
To a point of no resemblance 
We're not alone in the Twilight Zone 

"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed" 

Keep it simple 

"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed" 

Keep it simple 

Like Enoch, I wear my cape, you can't destroy 
my impeccable caliber that makes your vision blur 
I drop particle X when having Rhythm sex 
Voodoo arrangers with the kids Power Rangers 
Make me see other men, gorillas masterbating with human strangers 
Legally through court, you're stung by a genital wart 
Chlamydia, through the city-a 
Los Angeles Texas has a serpent that's urgent 
for the mass appeal biomedical test your rectum 
squeezing in banana peels 
Outwards backwards towards Boston 
It's costing androids leaving humans with hemerrhoids 
Thinking more of what they can't explore, like 
the cartoon Donald Duck is giving fellatio on the floor 
with Reed Richards, looking at The Thing's naked pictures 
Taking Ex-Lax to relax with the needle and thread 
sewing up all the other buttcracks 
In the industry there's no one who can mess with 
Dr. Octagon, now serving coleslaw and pink pickles 
"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed" 

Keep it simple 

"They waved among the trees at breakneck speed... their bikes" 

Keep it simple 

"Detached his bike, and leaped to safety 
Just before they collided with a tree..."
