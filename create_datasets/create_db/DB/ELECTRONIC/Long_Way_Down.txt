I've been fucking around while you've been saving the world
I've been out of my mind
I've been dreaming things and scheming things
I've been smoking the poison
You've been slinging your anecdotes
I've been fucking around while you were saving the world
From nothing

The end, the end
Things will never go away
In the end, the end
Things will never go

So take it in, don't hold your breath
The bottom's all I found
We can't get higher than we get
On the long way down

On the long way down
On the long way down

Burning night in my eyes, blinding me from the truth
If there's a shadow in me
The dark is a tidal force inside of you
Taking shots at communion
Getting drunk on your antidote
I'll save you a seat next to me down below

The end, the end
Everyone will go away
In the end, the end
Everything will go

So take it in, don't hold your breath
The bottom's all I found
We can't get higher than we get
On the long way down

On the long way down
On the long way down

Oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh

On the long way down
On the long way down, down, down
So take it in, don't hold your breath
The bottom's all I found
We can't get higher than we get
On the long way down

On the long way down
On the long way down

So take it in, don't hold your breath
The bottom's all I found
We can't get higher than we get
On the long way down

On the long way down
On the long way down
