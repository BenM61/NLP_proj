Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin' perfect
Now you aren't so in step
In step
In step
In step

You had your photograph, in a magazine
Such a pretty boy, only nineteen
But now your twenty-three and it's all gone now
You ain't all that, you wanna be somehow

Maybe it was only a dream!
You just thought you could be anything that you wanted to be
Sadly, it all went wrong so

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin' perfect
Now you aren't so in step
In step
In step
In step

Still just go to the same old clubs
But the new kids have got one above
Music tastes change like the wind
You're doin' now what's already been

And you still think that you're so it
Cause you know so and so, and you made a hit
But you can't hear it being played
Cause you my friend have had your day

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin' perfect
Now you aren't so in step
In step
In step
In step
