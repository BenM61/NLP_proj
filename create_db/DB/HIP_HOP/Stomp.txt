Young Buck:
Uh Ohhhhh, Young Buck
Dirty South, Yeahhh

I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp
Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, I'm'a Make 'Em Stomp
We Ain't Playin' want to Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp
Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off

I'm Caddillac'n Through The Hood, Sittin' On 24's
T.V's Playin, Rim's Spinin, Blowin' Plenty Dro
Don't Have To Mention, When You Pimpin, You Get Plenty Hoes
It's All On You, If You Gon' Trick, Or You Gon' Get Yo' Dough
I Know I Got These Haters Mad, I Can Love That
When You Got Love For The Streets, They Give Ya' Love Back
Look In My Eyes, You Can Tell I Ain't Never Scared
Poppin' Them Thangs, I'm Rockin My Chain Anywhere
If You Gon' Represent Your Hood, What You Waitin On?
Security Better Back Up, When They Play This Song
And We 'Bout 50 Strong, Please Don't Make Us Do You Wrong
My Click Of Gorilla's, They Got They G-Unit's On
All Of That Mean Muggin' Really Don't Mean Nuthing
c'mon Take It Outside, Lemme See Sumthin
Wha-Wha-Wha-What Now?
Don't Get Bu-Bu-Bu-Buck'd Down
Stop All That Hatin' Or This Club Gon' Get Shu-Shut Down
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off

I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp
Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, I'm'a Make 'Em Stomp
We Ain't Playin' want to Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp
Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off

Ludacris:
Muthafucka, I'm A Monster In This Game, Similar To The Lachness
My Rhymes Is Nappy Rooted, Sum Verses Gotta Process
The Truth In This Booth, Ain't No Doubts When I'm Rappin'
If I Say It, I've Either Done It, Or It's 'Bout To Happen
When I Pull Up In The Louis Truck On 26's, People Dumb Out
If Lifes A Crap Game, I'm Rollin' 7's On The Come Out
These Rapper's Think I'm Ig-nent, Love Sayin' My Name
'cause Maintainin My Fish Tank, And They House, Cost The Same
Ask Me, I'd Say I Made It, And It Sure Wasn't Luck
Becuz Hustler's Relate To Me, And Some Are Younger Than Buck
You See I'm Married To My Music, But We Got A Prenupt
So If That Bitch Don't Act Right, I'm Still Gettin My Cut
My Deals Never Get Screwed, My Contracts Practice Abstinence
I'm Masterin This Program, Hazin' These Undergraduates
So, Pimpin' Be Easy, Quit Catchin' Feelings
'cause You Worth A Couple Hundred Grand, And I'm Worth Millions
Nobodys Thinkin' About You, Plus Your Beef Ain't Legit
So Please Stay Off The T.I.P. Of My Dick
