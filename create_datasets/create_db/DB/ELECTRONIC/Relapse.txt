I'm waiting for the end of days
I think I'm good but I just might stay
But I'm too wasted to care
And if I go well fair is fair

I'm headed for a relapse

I'm waiting for the apocalypse in 2012
But I'm so wasted
I'll see you all in hell

I relapse you laugh
I feel it coming
A total collapse

Well surgeons cut to heel you
Axe murders cut to kill you
Well I'm filthy rich and I'm horny
But you just fucking bore me

I relapse you laugh
I feel it coming
A total collapse

I just bitch and moan about all my groans

I'm headed for a relapse

Well I love life to death
But I also love crystal meth
But those two don't usually get along
And a lot of people think that's wrong

I relapse you laugh
I feel it coming
A total collapse
