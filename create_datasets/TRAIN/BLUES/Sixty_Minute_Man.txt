Sixty-minute man, sixty-minute man 
Look a here girls I'm telling you now 
They call me "Lovin' Dan" 
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long 
I'm a sixty-minute man 
If you don't believe I'm all that I say 
Come up and take my hand 
When I let you go you'll cry "Oh yes" 
"He's a sixty-minute man". 
There'll be 15 minutes of kissing 
Then you'll holler "Please don't stop" (Don't stop !) 
There'll be 15 minutes of teasing 
And 15 minutes of squeezing 
And 15 minutes of blowing my top...
