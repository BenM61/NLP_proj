[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me, do you really love me?
Baby, baby, baby
Will you always be there for me?
I can't live without your lovin'
Baby, can't you see?
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me, do you love me now?

I can't wait to see your face everyday
I can't explain the way I feel when I'm around you
There's a space in my heart that belongs to only you
And no one else in this world comes close to you
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you understand me?
Got a thing for you, and I'm not playing
It's something I need to know

[Chorus]

I can't imagine how my life would be without you
I don't know if I'd survive another day
No pressure, but I'd love to keep you safely
Promise me it's real
And that you would never fake it
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you understand me?
Got a thing for you, and I'm not playing
I'm not playing
I'm not playing

[Chorus]

Oh, oh
Love me, baby; love me, baby
Nothing else don't matter
Your love is all I'm after
Oh, I need to have ya
I don't need no other man
You're the one my heart demands
I'm your girl
You're my world
Please don't let me down
Don't let me down
Tell me, do you really love me?
Baby, baby, baby
Will you always be there for me?

Baby, baby, baby
I can't live without your loving
Baby, can't you see?
Baby, baby

Tell me, do you love me now?
Tell me, do you love me now?
Tell me, do you love me now?

Gotta let me know that you love me so
Gotta let me know that you love me so
