The way you smile that way
It sends me miles away
Daydreaming while I sit
And that think of how lucky I am

Your glowing aura shows
Glistening eyes aglow
Paints up the skies I know
That I think that I'm falling

In love again
Big love that's when
She's the very same woman I've known
Yes, for year after year we have grown
I believe in you more now I've known
Big love, big love

Our golden child at play
See her she's miles away
While deep inside I pray
That our love keeps her happy and warm

Her glowing aura shows
Glistening eyes aglow
Paints up the skies I know
That I'm sure that I'm falling

In love again
Big love that's when
She's the very same girl that I've known
Yes, for year after year we have grown
I believe in you more now I've known
Big love, big love

Love forever
Big love forever
Love forever
Big love forever

Big love again
Big love that's when
She's the very same woman I've known
And for year after year we have grown
I believe in you more now I've known
Big love, big love, big love
