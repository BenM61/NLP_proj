What's done in the dark comes to light, for sho'
So the thing you did with her, I was gonna know
You impressin' these girls, showin' off your flow
But I got my own bank, so I'm out the door (oh oh)
You callin' me sayin' baby please
don't believe those lies
Crawlin' on your knees
You're the only liar in the midst of me
You're a first bag, so just get away from me 

What you do will always come back to you
I'm tired of playin' games with you
I'm really not feelin' you and
What you say don't mean a damn thing to me
Tried to make a fool out of me
It's all just history

You make me want to shout
Make me want to scream
Make me loose my cool
But I'm gonna throw my hands up

You make me want to shout
Make me want to scream
Make me loose my cool
But I'm gonna throw my hands up

You make me want to shout
Make me want to scream
Make me loose my cool
But I'm gonna throw my hands up

Day after day you're telling me your story
Saying your girlfriend just lying on me
You say they just want what you got
Wanting your post, boy I think not
Man you think you're so hot
You're the victim or so you say
I guess they're throwing their drawers
and bras your way
I guess those condoms weren't yours
belong to your boys, call me deaf' cause
I'm not hearing that noise

What you do will always come back to you
I'm tired of playin' games with you
I'm really not feelin' you and
What you say don't mean a damn thing to me
Tried to make a fool out of me
It's all just history

You make me want to shout
Make me want to scream
Make me loose my cool
But I'm gonna throw my hands up

You make me want to shout
Make me want to scream
Make me loose my cool
But I'm gonna throw my hands up

You make me want to shout
Make me want to scream
Make me loose my cool
But I'm gonna throw my hands up
