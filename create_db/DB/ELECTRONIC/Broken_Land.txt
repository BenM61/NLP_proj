These rivers run too deep
With schemes of men for days that lay ahead
They sell their souls so cheap
They breed mistrust and fill my heart with dread

When did the boy become a man
And lose his life to learn
So much confusion to this plan
These times are not changing

Show me the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather
From where I stand,
I see a broken land

This boy has learned to fail
In times like these to cry seems so absurd
His own life's crisis pales
In the shadow of this truly dying world

These are the games we played at school
Our hands raised in despair
With no exception to the rule
These times are not changing

Show me the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather
From where I stand,
I see a broken land

Where is the love to keep us together
Open up your hearts don't turn me away
Comfort me through this stormy weather
From where I stand,
I see a broken land
