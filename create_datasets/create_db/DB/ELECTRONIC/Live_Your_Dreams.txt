Who do you follow when you're lost in your dreams
Who do you whisper your sweetest melodies
In the darkness and the moonlight
You're searching for the one
I will take away those memories
'Cause angels like the sun

When you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you
When there are crumbles
Disappears before your eyes,
The beyond, the emptiness
There's only you and I
I'm the energy and the thunder
That raises through your heart
I'm that everlasting love in you
No matter where you are

When you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you

You can live, you can love
You can live, you can love

When you
Live your dreams, live your life
Happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love you can fly
Don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you

You can live
You can love
