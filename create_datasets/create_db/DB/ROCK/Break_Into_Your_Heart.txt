I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I see where you begin

Times so tired, closing in
Four more hours to go
When the times to spin
I'm getting in
Gonna be in time [?]

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I see where you begin

[?] never gonna grow
Your heart is buried underneath
Mountains copped with soap

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I see where you begin

Break them all
Take them all
Fake them all
Steal them all
Fail them all
Touch them all
Break them all
Break them

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna break into your heart 
I'm gonna break into your heart 
I'm gonna break into your heart 
Till it all comes crashing down

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I get under your skin
And the walk is tumbling down
And you finally let me in
I break into your
