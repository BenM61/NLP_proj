Wrapped up. Spat out in your self doubt
Should I rip my heart out
Pack it up and send it to you
Things said in anger
Said for gain
Said to cut down
I'll never hear again
Well a part of me sees it all too clear
But another part still burns
For the safety, for the comfort
But our hate outgrew our love and ate it

I can see it started years ago
And I recognise your pain
But I can't forget the innocence
That you've taken from me
Now I see you
But I can't hear you

No, I can't hate you
No, and I don't want to break you down
There's just some things that I want to tell you
Now that you're not hear to drown me out
I've just got to break through

I collect the poison as it spills from your mouth
Savour the taste so that I may work you out
When affection becomes affliction
Let it go

Been watching for far too long
Far too long to get this wrong
I've got the scars to prove it
Snap straight back and I'm here to use it
Delay the memory of the facts and what's outside
Left with your mind, the only place to hide
'Cause you're so bitter inside
