I woke up this morning
To the intro of this song
My iPod on the night stand
Shuffling pop and rock

I had a hit for breakfast
And flipped the TV on
The videos were hideous
But they kick started the day

The day the day the day
I'm ready for the the day the day

Inside my head there's a radio station
I'm overcome with a sense of elation
Inside my head there's a radio station
Salvation on heavy rotation

Pop pop and I don't care
As long as I'm on the air
And music is everywhere

I fired up the engine
Heading for the highway
The stereo was way too loud
But that's what it's all about

I could have taken yoga
But I need more stamina
The beats of the body pump
Make me wanna play

The game the game the game
I'm ready for the the game the game the game

Inside my head there's a radio station
I'm overcome with a sense of elation
Inside my head there's a radio station
Salvation on heavy rotation

Pop pop and I don't care
As long as I'm on the air
And music is everywhere
Pop pop everywhere

I'm pop and I'm corny I'm on the air
I'm flat and I'm sharp and I'm everywhere
I'm in C I'm in D I'm in every key
I'm singing for you even when you're asleep

Inside my head there's a radio station
I'm overcome with a sense of elation
Inside my head there's a radio station
Salvation on heavy rotation

Pop pop and I don't care
As long as I'm on the air
And music is everywhere

(Medication for my frustration)

Inside my head there's a radio station
I'm overcome with a sense of elation
Inside my head there's a radio station
Salvation on heavy rotation

Pop pop and I don't care
As long as I'm on the air
And music is everywhere

The suits want to change me but I won't budge
My style is out there for the scribes to judge
They say I'm shallow I don't bear a grudge
I am who I am and that's more than enough
