Black ops 
Black ops
A holiday for secret cops 
Black ops 
Black ops 
Dropping presents from the helicopter

It's been a long year 
We've been so far from home 
Too many people here
Here come the drones 
We take the best of it 
And make a mess of it 
Ripping up some lawn 
And then we're gone

Black sites Black sites 
A thousand miles from day or night 
Black sites Black sites 
The story will remain unwritten

Before we make you gone 
You'd best be running on 
Stick to the music, child Don't get us riled 
Hey, there's a spot we missed I see a 
Communist 
And there's another one 
And his dumb son

Black ops 
Black ops 
Little vials filled with knock-out drops 
Black ops Black ops 
Maybe leave you in your old gym locker

A thousand miles from day or night  

A story told before rewriting 
There's a passport here 
But it could disappear 
Tarmac to landing pad 
Don't look so sad We fly to 
Amsterdam And in a little bit 
We'll sing our special song And this is it

He'll be standing when the music stops 

We're not worrying about the optics
