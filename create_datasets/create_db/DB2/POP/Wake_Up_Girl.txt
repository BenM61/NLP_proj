Dumb girl
Did you see the latest Vogue?
Has it ever occurred to you
That you don't fit the latest trend?

Dumb, dumb girl
Can't you see you're such a joke?
When was the last time your cellphone rang?
Baby girl, let's not pretend

Be smart, don't try to disco-dance
And sweetheart, don't even come at all

Wake up girl
All the beautiful ones are laughing
Wake up girl
All the beautiful boys are forever taken, girl

Dumb girl
You could always be like us
Do your boobs and a nose job too
And don't forget about the smile

But 'til then
Keep a distance on the bus
Take a look at my beeper now
That's a number not to dial

Be smart, don't try to disco-dance
And sweetheart, don't even come at all

Wake up girl
All the beautiful ones are laughing
Wake up girl
All the beautiful boys are forever taken
Wake up girl
All the beautiful boys are forever taken, girl

Dumb girl, dumb girl
Dumb, dumb girl

Wake up girl
All the beautiful ones are laughing
Wake up girl
All the beautiful boys are forever taken, girl

Wake up girl
All the beautiful ones are laughing
Wake up girl
All the beautiful boys are forever taken, girl
Wake up girl, wake up girl
All the beautiful boys are forever taken, girl
