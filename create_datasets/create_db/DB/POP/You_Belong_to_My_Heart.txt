You belong to my heart
Now and forever
And our love had its start
Not long ago

We were gathering stars while a million guitars played our love song
When I said, "I love you", every beat of my heart said it, too

'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember?
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine

Now, we own all the stars, and a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song, and you'll always belong to my heart

'Twas a moment like this

When they met mine

Now, we own all the stars, and a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song, and you'll always belong to my heart
