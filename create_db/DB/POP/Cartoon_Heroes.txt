We are what we're supposed to be
Illusions of your fantasy
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do

We are the cartoon symphony
We do the things you want to see
Frame by frame, to the extreme

Our friends are so unreasonable
They do the unpredictable
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do

It's all an orchestra of strings,
Doing unbelievable things
Frame by frame, to the extreme
One by one, we're making it fun

We are the cartoon heroes, oh,
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind, oh,
And walked out on a piece of paper

Here comes Spiderman, an arachnophobian
Welcome to the toon town party
Here comes superman from never-never land
Welcome to the toon town party

We learn to run at speed of light
And to fall down from many heights
It's true but just remember that
What we do is what you just can't do

I know the route of craziness
A bunch of dots that's chasin' us
Frame by frame, to the extreme
One by one, we're making it fun

We are the cartoon heroes, oh,
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind, oh,
And walked out on a piece of paper

Here comes Spiderman, an arachnophobian
Welcome to the toon town party
Here comes superman from never-never land
Welcome to the toon town party

You'll think we're so mysterious
Don't take us all too serious
Be original, and remember that
What we do is what you just can can't do

(What we do is what you just can't do)
(What we do is what you just can't do)
(What we do is what you just can't do)
(What we do is what you just can't do)

We are the cartoon heroes, oh,
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind, oh,
And walked out on a piece of paper

There's still more to come,
And everyone will be
Welcomed at the
Toon (toon)
Town (town)
Party!
