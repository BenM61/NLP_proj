You can barely harm yourself you
Very rarely temporarily climb
You overwhelm me
If you see the consequence you're
Blind you humble dog you're mine
You overwhelm me in time

In the sea completely real you
Can always swim from the fish
And hide yourself
You try every night
To arm yourself
Get high every night
Prepare yourself to fly

Take a walk on the astro turf its
Rolling foaling temporarily brown
You overwhelm me
You can put me
On a shelf for hours
A dreadful thirst and flowers
You overwhelm me in time

In the sea completely real you
Can always swim from the fish
And hide yourself
You try every night
To arm yourself
Get high every night
Prepare yourself to fly

In the sea completely real you
Can always swim from the fish
And hide yourself
You try every night
Pre-arm yourself
Get high every night
Prepare yourself to fly
