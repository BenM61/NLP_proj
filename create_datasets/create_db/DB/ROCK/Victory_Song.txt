The plan of invasion an evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches, to slave them all
To make them kneel for a new god
The guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We re outnumbered
But our destiny is to win!
Fight! With the rage of a bear!
Defend! Our homeland!
Crush! Every enemy!
And seal our victory!

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Ei urhot kaukaisen pohjolan
Uhan eessa taipuneet
Jalleen pauhaa kansi taivahan
Veri valuu maahan lumiseen
Moni nahda ei saa enaa huomista
Moni jaa heita kaipaamaan
Jalkipolville jaa maa rauhaisa
Voiton laulut soi ainiaan
