Dancing heart to heart
To your motion of a start
Oh babe I have cried
Silent tears are full of pride
I need your kisses 
(babe I need your kisses) 

In a world of stone
Crying tears on telephone
Oh my lost night with you
Oh I'd love a rendezvous
I need your kisses 
(babe I need your kisses) 

Close my eyes to ten 
On a point of no return
We are night birds in the streets 

House of mystic lights
Home is where my heart is 
Calling Dr. Hyde
I was looking for my name 
House of mystic lights
Nothing but a heartache
Lovers side by side
Come step inside my heart 

Lit me with your shot
Sudden lover you're so hot
Our tears babe never dry
Oh how do this fool survived
I need your kisses 
(babe I need your kisses) 

Take this change of love
'Cause I never get enough
Now I'm high and then I'm low
You're an angel, yes, I know
I need your kisses 
(babe I need you're kisses) 

Oh-yea

We're to the beats yo
And you don't stop

C'mon yo
Let's just make your finger rock 
Get up into the rhythm mother funky beat 
And get down yo
And you don't stop 

C'mon let just make your finger part 
So get up
And stop messing around
When C.C.Catch is in your town

To the beat
To the beat
To the finger that'll ever make your body heat 

Oh-yea

Party people in the place to be 
Rocking to the beat so viciously 
Party people in the place to be 
Rocking to the beat so viciously 
C.C.Catch is irresistible
