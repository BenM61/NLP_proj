Blackacidevil, all my own
I've got to feel your heart beat next to my 
Blackacidevil, all my own
Do you want to look inside my soul
Blackacidevil, all my own
I've got to feel your heart beat next to my 
Blackacidevil, all my own
Do you want to look inside my soul
Inside my soul
Inside my soul
Inside my soul

Blackacidevil, darkness bound
Do you want to play with me
Your blood runs cold 
You have no soul 
Your veins will burn 
Your hunger grows
Your brain shuts down, darkness crown
Do you want to look inside my 
Blackacidevil, all my own
I've got to feel your heartbeat start to 
Lose control 
You have no soul...

Blackacidevil, all my own
I've got to feel your heart beat next to my 
Blackacidevil, all my own
Do you want to look inside my soul
Blackacidevil, all my own
I've got to feel your heart beat next to my 
Blackacidevil, all my own
Do you want to look inside my soul
Inside my soul
Inside my soul
Inside my soul

Blackacidevil, venom rush
Do you want to rush inside 
Your heart stops dead 
You have no pulse
You burn like ice 
Your thoughts go cold 
The piercing starts 
Beast in heat
Do you want to look inside my
Blackacidevil, all my own
I've got to feel your heartbeat start to 
Lose control 
You have no soul...
