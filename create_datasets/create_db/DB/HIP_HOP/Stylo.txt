Overload, overload, overload,
Coming up to the,

Oh stylo, (juice)
Go forth,
Blossom in your soul,
When you know your heart is light,
Electric is the love.

When the mako flies, (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom,
In your eyes,
Then I know the twilight skies,
Are not so broken hearted. (from the end of the line)

It's its love of electric,
It'll be flowing on the streets,
Night after night,
Just to get through the week,
Sometimes it's hard.

Right now.

Single cell, (juice)
Out of depression,
Rise above,
Always searching,
If I know your heart,
Electric is the love.

There's only one way,
Let it pray a little while longer,
It's got a way of passing through man and woman,
In another world,
In another world in the universe.
Ooohhhhhh

Right now here's what we got to do,
It's its love of electric,
It'll be flowing on the streets,
Night after night,
Just to get through the week,
Sometimes it's hard.

That's what I'm talking about,
Love electricity,
Shockwave central,
Power on the motherboard,
Yes.

Push up,
Overload,
Legendary,
Heavy glow,
Sunshine,
Thunder roll,
Keep this on,
Yes the are and easy,
A raw cat though raw and easy,
Thunder roll,
Sunshine,
Work it out.

Right now.
