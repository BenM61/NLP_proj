(Come on baby let's twist all night)

Come on and twist all night
Come on and twist all night
And you can do it baby 'cause the time is right
Come on start to dance
And you will find romance
Twist all night

Come on and twist all night
Come on and twist all night
Yes, my little darling 'cause the time is right
Now when you hear the sound
You go round and round
Twist all night

Baby, you're doing fine
You made my list
I think you're so divine
When you do the twist

Come on and twist all night
Come on and twist all night
Yes, my little darling 'cause the time is right
Won't you hear my plea
And come and dance with me
Twist all night

Baby, you're doing fine
You made my list
I think you're so divine
When you do the twist

Come on and twist all night
Come on and twist all night
Yes, my little darling 'cause the time is right
Won't you hear my plea
And come and dance with me
Twist all night
Twist all night
Twist all night
Twist all night
Twist, twist, twist, twist all night
