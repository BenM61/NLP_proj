Gee, but it's hard to love someone 
When that someone don't love you; 
I'm so disgusted, heart-broken, too 
I've got those down-hearted blues. 

I was crazy 'bout a gal, 
She mistreated me all the time, 
Next gal I get, she's got to promise to 
Be mine, all mine. 

'Cause she mistreated me, 
And she drove me from her door; 
Yes, she mistreated me, 
She drove me from her door, 
But the Good Book says, 
She'll reap just what she'll sow. 

I ain't never loved but three women in all my life, 
I never loved but three women in all my life, 
That was my mother, my sister, and the gal that wrecked my life. 

[Heavily scatted] 
All the dirt you done to me 
Is bound to come back to you.
