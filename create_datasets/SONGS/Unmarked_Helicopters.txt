Whose song is that remembered?
At random, surpenting
Throught fatty coils, emerging
Some other thought it's thinking
This light
Stands above the
Houses
On the ground
This illumination
Visited upon the whole land

Unmarked helicopters
Hovering
The lord is coming soon

Here comes the super copter
Here comes the noise it makes
The demon was an idea
The demon is awake
Scratch mark traced across the
Surface of your mind
This hour, now upon us
The hour, now arrived

Unmarked helicopters
Hovering
The lord is coming soon
Unmarked helicopters
Hovering
They said it was a weather balloon

But I know the truth
I know the whole shebang
I know the names of men they had to hang
I let her out the trunk
Heard what she said at them
They've come to drag us through the double M

It goes black black black black and blacker
It goes black black black black and blacker
It goes black black black black and blacker
It goes black black black black and blacker

Unmarked helicopters
Hovering
The lord is coming soon
Unmarked helicopters
Hovering
They said it was a weather balloon
It was a weather balloon
It was a weather balloon
It was a weather balloon
It was a weather balloon
It was a weather balloon
