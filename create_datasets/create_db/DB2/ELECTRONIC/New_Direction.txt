New Direction:
A-a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah
A-a-a-a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction) 

It seems to me
I cannot breath
When you're around
You leave me there
In the cold
I'm lost and found 

I've been lookin' for a new direction
So baby know I've gotta say
I've been lookin' for a new connection
With someone who's gonna make me stay 

You shouldn't lie
You shouldn't play
Gotta kill to look the other way
You shouldn't cry
You shouldn't faint
Just got to tell you straight before I walk away 
It's too late 

A-a-a-a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction) 

Needing to
Rediscover my identity
I'm doing fine
Baby don't feel sad for me 

I've been looking for a new fixation
Someone who can stimulate my mind
I've been looking for a new sensation
Never let you know I'm gonna find 

You shouldn't lie
You shouldn't play
Gotta kill to look the other way 
You shouldn't cry
You shouldn't faint
Just gotta tell you straight before I walk away
It's too late 

A-a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah 
A-a-a-a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction) 

I've been looking for a new direction
Gotta kill to look the other way 

It's too late
It's too late 

A-a-a-a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction)
A-a-a-a-ah a-ah (I've been looking for a new direction) 

You shouldn't lie
You shouldn't play
Gotta kill to look the other way
You shouldn't cry
You shouldn't let
Trying to tell you straight before I walk away 
It's too late 

A-a-a-a-ah
