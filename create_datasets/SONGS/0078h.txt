I was someone else's girl
Every time you look in my eyes
All that I felt somehow dies

No, no, no, no
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
No, no, no, no

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead

When you say the things you do
It makes me want to be with you
And every time that he kisses me
You are always what I see

No, no, no, no
You make me forget about him
No, no, no, no

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead

No, no, no, no
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
No, no, no, no

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead
