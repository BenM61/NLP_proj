I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.

Tell me please,
Where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of.

It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe,
When he says "Hello!"

So I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love!
