Across the crowded disco-room
You're amazed of dancing people
She sets a fire there all alone
Wanna get you the disco-fever

And if she raised her head her eyes caught mine
And that was all that I needed
In her eyes I saw the need for love
The warm, soft feeling
'Cause we made

Eye to eye contact
Eye to eye contact (Oh, oh, oh yeah)
Eye to eye contact (We made)
Eye to eye contact
You and me

Across the crowded disco-room
Oh, your eyes told me the story
My heart was beating like the drum
As I walked my way over

I never took my eyes away from yours
Not even for a moment
What I saw in your eyes made me realize
(You I wanted) Yeah, yeah, yeah!
