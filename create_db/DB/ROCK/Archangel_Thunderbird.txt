When the everywhere-eye 
Asks you who is the emperor of the sky 
Take the archangel's thunderbird 

Go to Edgar Allen in the tower of sleep 
He'll tell you a story which makes you to creep 
The echo of your cries is falling so deep 

Rent a destroyer and sail to Cape Cod 
There lives a lion, they call him God 
There is no elevator to Eden, but a hole in the sky 

In shock-corridors 
People are standing 
With their eyes in their hands 

But they don't understand 
Don't get that your confessional 
Flare into the vaulting flight of stairs 

Baiting soldiers sleeping in melting house of wax 
Why is the audience not taking the insurrection-axe 
Thousands of windows burst open 
And alarm bells are broken
