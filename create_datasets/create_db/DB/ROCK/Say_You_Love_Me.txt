Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's getting torn from your mistakes

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you're mine
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
Want to feel burning flames when you say my name
Want to feel passion flow into my bones
Like blood through my veins

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you're mine
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

Won't you stay?!
Won't you stay?!
Slowly, slowly you run for me,
But do you know me at all
Some one told me love controls everything
But only if you know!

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No no no no)
If you don't wanna try,
'Cause all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you're mine
(You're mine)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you're mine
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away
Won't you stay
Won't you stay
