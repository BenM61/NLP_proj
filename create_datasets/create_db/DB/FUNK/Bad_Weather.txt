Why is it we can't be the way we used to be?
Problems, we would work it out, whenever there was any doubt
You use to trust in me but now you're leaving me to suffer
Oh, oh, oh yeah a-yeah, if you give love a chance
I'll do the best I can, we can work it out in time
And mend the pieces of our lives, please believe in me
Every day is looking darker

Think I'm gonna run into bad weather, skies are gray
'Cause our love just ain't together
Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
'Cause our love just ain't together

All the things we used to do, together me and you
Think of the fun we had and how our love's suppose to last
Mistakes were not all you, I know I made some too, sugar, baby, baby
Open up your eyes and see that you're the one for me
Let's fix it, there's still time, we can love, love sunshine
Baby, won't you please stop it, don't make me suffer

Think I'm gonna run into bad weather, look at the rain
'Cause our love just ain't together, no
Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
'Cause our stuff just ain't together

Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, yeah, yeah
Think I'm gonna run into bad weather
'Cause our love just ain't together, oh no

Think I'm gonna run into bad weather, look at the rain
'Cause our stuff just ain't together, hey, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Bad weather, bad weather, bad weather, our love just ain't together
(It ain't together, no, run into bad weather)
Gonna run, gonna run, I'm gonna run, I'm gonna run
You got me running, you got me running, hey yeah
