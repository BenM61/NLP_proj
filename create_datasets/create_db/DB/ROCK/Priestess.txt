I know you
I know you
I know you don't think about that so
Go take your chance
Put your money where your mouth is
I just wanna dance
And if it takes a little time
To go slow, go red, go wild
Yeah believe me I've been trying
Since I was a little child
Could you come to me?

Could you come to me so naturally
Like a fox into the night?
And where foxes go I too will roam
If that's alright
It must be hard, you're being so statuesque
People just wanna look
But you put all these things back to bed when
You kick off your shoes

Priestess, priestess
You dance, you dance, you dance
When, priestess, priestess
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance

You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance

Who made you
Who made you
Who made you so clear and strong
Cut from clay and stone?
Electricity flows through your spine and it shows
In the night when we're alone
It must be hard, you're being so statuesque
People just wanna look
But you put all these things back to bed when
You kick off your shoes

When, priestess, priestess
You dance, you dance, you dance
When, priestess, priestess
You dance, you dance, you dance

Yeah, priestess, priestess
You dance, you dance, you dance
When, priestess, priestess
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance

You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance

You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance
