The first thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
I couldn't 'ave been no more than one or two
And I remember there's a radio, coming from the room next door
My mother laughed away some ladies' due

Well it's late in the evening, and all the music sees me through

The next thing I remember, I am walking down a street
I'm feeling alright with my boys and with my troops, yeah
Down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella groups, yeah

Singin' late in the evening, and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I remember playin' some lead guitar, I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a J
When I come back to the room, everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up louder to get away

It was late in the evening, and I blew that room away

First thing I remember when you came into my life
I said I want to get that girl, no matter what I do
Well I guess I've been in love before and once or twice have been on the floor
But I've never loved no-one the way that I love you

And it was late in the evening, and all the music sees me through
