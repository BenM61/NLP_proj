Whenever we kiss
I worry and wonder
Your lips may be near
But where is your heart

It's always like this
I worry and wonder
You're close to me here
But where is your heart

It's a sad thing to realize
That you've a heart that never melts
When we kiss, do you close your eyes
Pretending that I'm someone else

You must break the spell
This cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell
Darling, where is your heart
