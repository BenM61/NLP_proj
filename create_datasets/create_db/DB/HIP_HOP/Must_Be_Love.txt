Ooh Heh Ooh Heh

Hey yo I know it's the Fya girls and Smujji 
The combination this must be love 
It's gonna hit you like an explosion 
Fya Smujji let it go.... 

Must be love 
This must be love..love 
Girl I don't know where I'm at 
Thinking about you so bad 
It must be love 
This must be love..love love 
Gonna be treating you right 
Every day (every day) 
Every night (every night) 

It's the things you do to me 
I dunno where to start 
You're in my body and it tingles my heart 
Showing me tings I never seen before 
Telling me tings I'm willing to explore 
I wasn't looking I didn't know what I was looking for 
You came along and put me under pressure 
And I don't think I can leave 
'Cause I'll be hungry for more 
This is love, keep it hot, feel the pressure 

I try to see and you feel my senses 
Try to fight but I have defences 
Crazy but I don't know why 
I'm not the kinda guy 

Must be love 
This must be love..love 
Girl I don't know where I'm at 
Thinking about you so bad 
It must be love 
This must be love..love love 
Gonna be treating you right 
Every day (every day) 
Every night (every night) 

Every day ay ay ay 

No-one's ever loved me in the special way you love me 
I can't stop the passion when you hold me tenderly 
These feelings are for real 
You know their bubbling up within me 
But boy I'm glad I'm holding back 
I want to give you all of me 

Must be love 
When I look into your eyes I get shivers 
Desire is to love and it feels unconditional 
Must be love when there's nothing left to hide 
Love to love you 'cause it feels so original 

Must be love 
This must be love..love 
Girl I don't know where I'm at 
Thinking about you so bad 
It must be love 
This must be love..love love 
Gonna be treating you right 
Every day (every day) 
Every night (every night) 

This must be love 
This must be love 
This must be love 
(This is one in a million) 
This must be love 
This must be love 
This must be
