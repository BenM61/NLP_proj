Don't know what you think you saw
You didn't know at all
Lost sight of who you are
Keen to make a connection
Forced myself into dimension
Lost sight of myself

If I could force my heart, my ears, my mind
And eyes to get in line
Maybe I'll find something real
Not a fantasy so divine
Let myself down each time
Let myself down each time

How could you be what I wanted to see?
How could you be what I wanted to see?
How could you be what I wanted to see?
When my reality
Could never live up, could never live up
To my fantasy

Revolution from dissolution, hypnotizing and demoralizing
Pressure of the future, too much for today
How many hours will I let slip away
Before I realize existing and living
Are not the same
Are not the same

How could you be what I wanted to see?
How could you be what I wanted to see?
How could you be what I wanted to see?
When my reality
Could never live up, could never live up
To the fantasy

How could you be what I wanted to see?
How could you be what I wanted to see?
How could you be what I wanted to see?
When my reality
Could never live up, could never live up
To the fantasy
