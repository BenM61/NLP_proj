Yeah it's been a long time coming
Never thought it'd take so long
I stood still but time kept running
Time has made me strong

Yeah it's been a long time waiting
Waiting for this day to come
Time don't wait so I keep singing

Yeah it's been a long time coming
Never thought it'd take so long
I stood still but time kept running
Time has made me strong
Made me strong, made me strong
Time has made me strong
