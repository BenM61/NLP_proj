He'll take the money and the food that's in your hand
But you have to understand that he's a dreamer
Living my life within a mile you could believe
This place turns honest men to thieves

And I could see it in his eyes
He was the type to sail off in the night

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer, didn't know he was a tropical chancer

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer, didn't know he was a tropical chancer

He'll trade your loving for the things he's never seen
The places he has never been
Oh but remember he is just a good pretender
And he doesn't give his love away for free

And I could see it in his eyes
He was the type to sail off in the night

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer, didn't know he was a tropical chancer

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer, didn't know he was a tropical chancer

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer, didn't know he was a tropical chancer

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer, didn't know he was a tropical chancer
