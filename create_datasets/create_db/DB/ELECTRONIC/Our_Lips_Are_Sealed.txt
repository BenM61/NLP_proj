Can you hear them 
They talk about us 
Telling lies 
Well that's no surprise 

Can you see them 
See right through them 
They have no shield 
No secrets to reveal 

It doesn't matter what they say 
In the jealous games people play 
Our lips are sealed  

Careless talk 
Through paper walls 
We can't stop them 
Only laugh at them 

Spreading rumors 
So far from true 
Dragged up from the underworld 
Just like some precious pearl 

It doesn't matter what they say 
In the jealous games people play 
Our lips are sealed 
Pay no mind to what they say 
It doesn't matter anyway 
Our lips are sealed 

There's a weapon 
We must use 
In our defense 
Silence 

When you look at them 
Look right through them 
That's when they'll disappear 
That's when you'll be feared 

Hush, my darling 
Don't you cry 
Quiet, angel 
Forget their lies
