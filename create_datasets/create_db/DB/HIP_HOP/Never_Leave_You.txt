Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya

I'm still lovin' you, like it was the first time
I'm still lovin' you, like it was the first time

(Like the very first time)
Yo I've been here right here in them bold streets
Late nights tryna write mums sayin' go sleep.
A king here music world at my own feet
Dealing with the mainstream thank the lord daily
I'm sincere and I've been from the start
Ask Dyl (Dizzee Rascal), ask Will (Wiley), man I've had it in my heart
So I drop tears cause everything's changed reminiscing them days tryna turn the page

Cause I've been around the world I've seen so many places,
Livin' the life I've worked so hard to make it,
Trading the world for money, stars, and power, living my life at 100 miles an hour.

I'm still loving you like it was the first time,
I'm still loving you like it was the first time

Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya

You must be joking, don't tell me that its over
I'm driving the scene forward I'm a chauffeur
Its open so come we all enter
Tired of being in the back now we're center
We're chosen but they're telling us we're selling out
All we wanna do is open doors man hear me out
Were frozen cause they left us in the cold
Only right I took my chance now I'm bringing it home

Cause I been around the world I seen so many places
Living the life iv worked so hard to make it trading the world
For money stars and power living my life at 100 miles an hour

I'm still loving you like it was the first time (Like the very first time)
I'm still loving you like it was the first time (Like the very first time)

Whoa whoa I will never leave ya (I will never leave)
Whoa whoa I will never leave ya (I will never leave)
Whoa whoa I will never leave ya (I will never leave)
Whoa whoa I will never leave ya

And yo I dived in and now I'm swimming in the deep end
And iv been gone since the weekend
So how's your week been without me how you keeping
Well this is come back season.

Well this is come back season I call it come back
I've seen the whole map and I'll be back by the evening

Cause I'm still loving you like it was the first time (Like the very first time)
I'm still loving you like it was the first time (Like the very first time)

Whoa whoa I will never leave ya
