Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God
Oh, eat me up for breakfast
You think you look good in whatever they sugar coat you in
And my body is a temple, you can worship at my feet
But I might kick you in the teeth so
So even when you're spitting blood
You would savor that for me

'Cause I got so down I held the world for ransom
Lonely, bored and bad, thank God I'm handsome, so handsome

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I should be pickin' up the pieces
But it doesn't really matter, it's what you thought it were
When you got nothin' to lose
Everybody else I know, it sucks to be in misery
As if it was contagious
So come to me and promise me you'll
Catch me if you can

'Cause I got so down I held the world for ransom
Lonely, bored and bad, thank God I'm handsome
I'm as awful as they come, oh, what a pity
So thank the Lord above that I am pretty, so pretty
So pretty
So pretty

Well, I got so down I held the world for ransom
Lonely, bored and bad, thank God I'm handsome
Arresting, repossessing and disarming
Oh, what a stroke of luck that I am charming
Well, I heard that I am wanted by committee
I just thank the Lord above that I am pretty, so pretty
