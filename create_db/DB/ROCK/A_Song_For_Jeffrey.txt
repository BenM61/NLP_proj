Gonna lose my way tomorrow
Gonna give away my car
I'd take you along with me
But you would not go so far
Don't see what I do not want to see
You don't hear what I don't say
Won't be what I don't want to be
I continue in my way

Don't see, see, see where I'm goin'
Don't see, see, see where I'm goin'
Don't see, see, see where I'm goin' to
I don't want to

Everyday I see the mornin' come on in the same old way
I tell myself tomorrow brings me things I would not dream today
