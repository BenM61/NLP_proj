All over with,
F*ck all the flags, the greed, the world
Leaders
Run for the fence
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing 
The faces

I'm killing,every fucking thing
Until somebody gets the fucking point, the
Point I'm trying to make
I lead, the mice on parade,
Down to the river of cool aid,and open up the
Flood gates
I need a barrel of cyanide a pile of strychnine
Until the whole damn world is dead start over
Again

All over with,
F*ck all the flags, the greed, the world
Leaders
Run for the fence
We're coming,we're killing,we're changing 
The faces

Stop talking,negotiating,
Your feeble attempts towards world peace,
Give me a fucking break
Need world-wide genocide,planetary suicide
And when the whole damn world is 
Dead, there's your fucking peace

All over with,
F*ck all the flags, the greed, the world
Leaders
Run for the fence,
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing
The faces

Oxygen wasters, come on
We've come, to save you,to save you from
Yourselves

Kill or be killed, 

All over with,
F*ck all the flags, the greed, the world
Leaders
Run for the fence 
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing 
The faces
Believe in yourself
Let go of ego strengthen within yourself
All over with
We're coming,we're killing, we're changing
The faces
