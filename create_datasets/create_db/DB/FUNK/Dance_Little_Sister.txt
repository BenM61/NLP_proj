Get up outta your rockin' chair grandma! or rather,
Would you care to dance grandmother?
(Do do do)

Hey you give up the ghost that's haunting you now
Shout it out don't let it stay inside and eat you alive
Make up your mind don't you understand this side of the line
I can assure you when you're my age you'll learn from all you've left behind

You've got to dance little sister don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow I don't wanna hear you're late
Dance little sister don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow don't give up your stay

Say say say now share the weight and lay your cross down
And let the long reaching arm of hope bring you around
It ain't easy but giving up is the easy thing to do
Time is on your side would you just watch the clock and let it tick for you

You've got to dance little sister don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow I don't wanna hear you're late
Dance little sister don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow don't give up your stay

You've got to dance little sister don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow I don't wanna hear you're late
Dance little sister don't give up today
