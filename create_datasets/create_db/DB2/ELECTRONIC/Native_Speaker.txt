Swirls around my open head for days
State a place for you to lay
The most beautiful of minds down
Softest cheeks that press so lightly
From this side I can see you
Out the corner of my eye

It doesn't really matter
How many times you say no
Cause I've seen bad hands
Continuously reflecting
My thoughts that so
And I know
That it's only about
Touching, loving you

But my mind
It feels good

Swirls around my open head for days
Made a place for you to lay
The most beautiful of minds down
Pinkest lips that kiss so nicely
Not as nice as maybe the thought of
Having you inside me
Of having you rest inside me
Of having you beside me
Of having you inside me
Oh you are my native speaker

It's fine, it's fine, it's fine
It's fine
