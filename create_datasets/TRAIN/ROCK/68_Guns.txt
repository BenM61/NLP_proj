Hey!

And now they are trying to take my life away
Forever young I cannot stay
Hey!
On every corner I can see them there
They don't know my name, they don't know my kind
They're after you with their promises
(Promises of love) they're after you to sign your life away
(Yeah, yeah)

Sixty-eight guns will never die
Sixty-eight guns, our battle cry
Sixty-eight guns will never die
Sixty-eight guns, our battle cry
Sixty-eight guns
Sixty-eight guns
The sixty-eight

Living in the backstreets
That's our home from home
The painted walls were all we've ever known
'The Guns Forever' that's our battle cry
It is the flag that we fly so high
For every day they'll try and drag us down (drag us down and down)
I cry with anger I have done no crime, no
(Yeah, yeah)

Sixty-eight guns will never die
Sixty-eight guns, our battle cry
Sixty-eight guns will never die
Sixty-eight guns, our battle cry
Sixty-eight guns
Sixty-eight guns
The sixty-eight guns

Sixty-eight guns will never die
Sixty-eight guns, our battle cry
Sixty-eight guns will never die
Sixty-eight guns, our battle cry
Sixty-eight guns
Sixty-eight guns
The sixty-eight guns
