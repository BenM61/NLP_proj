Years ago, you said to me,
"I think I'm losing the fight,
Or the fight's losing me, I'm not certain,"
And here we are-the closing scenes,
And all the house lights come up,
Oh, the falling of our final curtain...
I've played a role for so long that I've forgotten myself,
But I said I'd be there and I'm keeping my word,
You've played yourself so well,
And now I want to be you,
A great imitation of losing my nerve.

Oh, it's over,
And everything is wrong, everything has gone,
And I know that everything means nothing,
Oh, it's over,
But I don't want to fight, I don't want to be right,
I know that everything means nothing,
On the road to Damascus they fell.

I saw the light-I saw the light!
But hey, it never saw me,
Oh, conversation has just left me heathen,
And we could wait a thousand years,
Perhaps a million or more,
If it's worth waiting for, but I'm leaving,
So on to a mecca of earthly delights,
Depression is only desire deprived,
Once more unto the breach and f*ck my getting it right,
We've died for so long, let's just get out alive.

'Cause it's over,
And everything is wrong, everything has gone,
And I know that everything means nothing,
Oh, it's over,
But I don't want to fight, I don't want to be right,
I know that everything means nothing,
On the road to Damascus they fell,
Well I've been to Damascuc.

It's hell, hell is where I'm gonna be,
The devil my intimate friend,
And hell is other people's hearts,
And knowing that everything must end.

Oh, it's over...
And everything is wrong, everything has gone,
And I know that everything means nothing,
Oh, it's over,
But I don't want to fight, I don't want to be right,
I know that everything means nothing,
On the road to Damascus they fell,
Well, I've been to Damascus as well.
