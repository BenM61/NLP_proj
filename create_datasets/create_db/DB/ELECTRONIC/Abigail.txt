Beautiful Abigail's got demons in her pockets
And I, I, I, I
Have seen her chasing down the hall
Beautiful Abigail's got diamonds in her sockets
And I, I, I, I
Have seen her walking through the wall
Who do you call
What do you call it
Who do you call when something goes wrong
Abigail
Abigail
Abigail
Abigail
Beautiful Abigail she's done a lot of thinking
And I, I, I, I
Will always fear her kind of grin
Beautiful Abigail is very happy sinking
And I, I, I, I
Will crumble when I win
Who do you call
What do you call it
Who do you call when something goes wrong
Abigail
Abigail
