I hear the room fill with laughter
And then forget everything after
You stand there memorizing, I'm here barely breathing
There's something I should have said but I laughed along instead

You know what you want but you get what you said
That you know you've always said that you wanted instead
I know what I want and suddenly it's the sound
Of you off to the side saying I'm finally found

I hear your heart beating faster
But I'm unclear on what you're after
You give me no reason why I shouldn't say goodbye
I can't think what I could have said so I'll break your heart instead

You know what you want but you get what you said
That you know you've always said that you wanted instead
I know what I want and suddenly it's the sound
Of you off to the side saying I'm finally found

You know what you want but you get what you said
That you know you've always said that you wanted instead
I know what I want and suddenly it's the sound
Of you off to the side saying I'm finally found
