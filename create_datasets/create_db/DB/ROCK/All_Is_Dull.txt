My bad, what am I fighting for?
So good 'cause I still see the door
And I'm out when you don't have more
I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, all is dull
You're mad, I think I entertain
All that food
I left my tongue in the rain
It's so wrong
But nothing's safe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, all is dull, dull, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Go high
Something to look out for
Oh, sigh, been in every hole
I could die
But that's been done before
I'm like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, all is dull, dull, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Dull)
I survive
All my intention's span
You can't score with me
'Cause I'm a  goalless man, bore me more
You wanna be my friend
Entertain, entertain, entertain
