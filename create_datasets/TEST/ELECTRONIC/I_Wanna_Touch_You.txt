I'm sure you know 
I'll care for you 
This time we know 
I'll be waiting 
Just like a dream 
Of love, that's past 
We seem to be hesitating 

I wanna touch you 
I wanna be with you 
I wanna hold you in my arms 

I'll never regret you 
Never forget you 
Don't wanna ever fall apart 

I wanna touch you 
I wanna be with you 
I wanna hold you in my arms 

I'll never regret you 
Never forget you 
Don't wanna ever fall apart 

I wanna touch you 
I wanna be with you 
I wanna hold you in my arms 

I'll never regret you 
Never forget you 
Don't wanna ever fall apart
