Seaside never gonna rock the boat
Gonna roll it up fat superdope
Yeah pass it around or stick it on a pin
Boyie lover with the bunny skin ?
My plastic lady here's a glitter roll
Straight from my heart through thy soul
Yeah I don't care about dirty hair
All praise due queen and yogi bear
So get back in the boat yeah

Vicarious pleasure in my brain
Fantastic life never the same
Identity come set it free
Come set me out to mystery
Mistert mind yah

Silly rabbit kicks are for kids
Yr carrot souffle's got me on the skids
Don't care about dirty hair
Got a fuzzy finger miss bunny tail
Hip hop till you drop yeah
Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop
