Oh, when we lie awake, 
We feel alright
Give yourself away
To the rising tide
Find your home again
 
I'd light the way
Til the strait runs dry
Need to find a place
Where the? can run
Counting down the days
Baby, one by one
We can get away
When the work is done

Feel so calm in the way you are 
Feel so calm in the way you are 
Feel so calm in the way you are 
Feel so calm in the way you are 

Oh, such an easy way
With the draft outside
Brings the light of day
On the lantern's eye
Broken by the storm
When the door was wide
We'll repay the faith
When time is right

I'm not wasting time 
I'm not wasting time 
I'm not wasting time 
I'm not wasting time 
I'm not wasting time 
I'm not wasting time 
I'm not wasting time 

Feel so calm in the way you are
Feel so calm in the way you are
Feel so calm in the way you are
Feel so calm in the way you are

Feel so calm in the way you are
Feel so calm in the way you are
Feel so calm in the way you are
Feel so calm in the way you are
