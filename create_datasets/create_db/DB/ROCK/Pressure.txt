Tell me where our time went
And if it was time well spent
Just don't let me fall asleep
Feeling empty again

Cause I fear I might break
And I fear I can't take it
Tonight I'll lie awake
Feeling empty, I can

Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

Now that I'm losing hope
And there's nothing else to show
For all of the days that we spent
Carried away from home

Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty, I can...

Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

Some things I'll never know and I had to let them go

Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
But I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off without you

Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
You're better off without me
