Now that one got lazyitis
And that one go it alone
And this one go, wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah
All the way home

At my home (And I hope) I don't come top of the class
Got no brown tongue lickin' ass, can't do what he's asked
Won't do what he's asked

I think I did the right thing by slipping away, yeah
And the ache that's making me ache has gone for the day

Now I'm the man that shot the boss
I pinned him down and blew his face off
I'm doing time with weirdo kind
Hustlin' and rustlin' and watchin' from behind

Now that's the man that shot the boss
He pinned him down and blew his face off
He's doing time with weirdo kind
Hustlin' and rustlin' and watchin' from behind

Now that one got lazyitis
And that one go it alone
And that one go, wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah
All the way home
All the way home
