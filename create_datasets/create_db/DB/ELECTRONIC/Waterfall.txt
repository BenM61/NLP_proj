Don't know what I should do
Sometimes I wish we could go somewhere
I feel it all around, I know you're seeing it too

I wanna know if these words are enough
Sometimes you got to give it up
Sometimes you better not be rough
'Cause I need to know when I'm down and in trouble

Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall 
Jump in the waterfall

I wanna work this out
The words you say don't fit right now
I hear your name around
Sometimes it takes too long

And I wanna know if these words are enough
Sometimes you gotta give things up
Sometimes you better not let go
'Cause I need to know when I'm down and in trouble

Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall

Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall

Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the water
Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the water

Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall
Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall
