Here's a story about the rules of death and glory
To be learned by heart by all children of men
It's the hour of the morning on the day after the dawning
When the sun they said would never set finally set again
Was it Cromwell or Orwell who first led you to the stairwell
Which leads only forever to kingdom come
Rushed alone by guiding hands
Whispers of the promised land
They wished you luck and handed you a gun

Life could be so handsome
Life could be so gay
We're going nowhere
But nowhere, nowhere's on our way

In the pub that night racking out the lines of shite
Putting to right all of the world's great wrongs
Yes we thought that they were brothers
Then they half-murdered each other
Then they did a karaoke turn and murdered our best song
Told the governor's wife about the last night of his life
She turned away in tears called you a liar
Where are all the old dreams now?
The batallion, once so proud
Lost in some old song and hanging on the old barbedwire

Life could be so handsome
It's so good to be okay
We're going nowhere
But nowhere, nowhere's on our way

Nowhere in the institutions
Did they teach that revolution
Was something that could ever come to pass
Oh we tried one, once before
Was the king's head on the floor
And we got booted out the boozer
'Cause someone smashed the glass

Life could be so handsome
Life could be okay
We're going nowhere
But nowhere, nowhere's on our way

Life could be so handsome
It's all gonna be okay
We're going nowhere
'Cause nowhere, nowhere's on our way
Nowhere's on our way
