Give me a smile
Things aren't that bad, are they?
It'll take a while
But we can get this right some way

So dry your eyes and
Wipe those tears away
'Cause, baby, you are mine and
That's the way it's gonna stay

I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life

You're going up in the world
And, baby, I'm coming down
Looks like we're both out of luck, girl
And we're stuck in this town

We'll call it opportunity
Try and see it as fate
'Cause this is all new to me
So you'll have to pardon my mistakes

I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life

Now, I've been chasing that girl
Waiting for her to catch me
And now I got that girl
Right where she wants me

And you can try and get out of here
Until you've forgot
But, baby, I'll still be here
And whether you like it or not

I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life
I'm in your life
