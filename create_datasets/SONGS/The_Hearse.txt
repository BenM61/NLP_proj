Nobody saw, oh nobody saw what Johnny saw
Nobody thought, oh nobody thought 
What Johnny thought
Nobody knows, nobody knows
What Johnny knows
Only Johnny knows, what I've done

No one is talking bout anyone else but Johnny
Until the day Johnny had no clue
What I could do
If you were in my shoes, you'd do it, too
If you were in my shoes, you'd  do it, too

No theres no other start, my mind's ripped apart
My hearts gone dry, since the day you died
Theres something to be said
About articles of death, burning in the breeze
I didn't mean to do it, the devil made me do 
And as Johnny came through it, there was nothing to it
I got a bad stain, and I've got a bunch of pain 
There was no other way
