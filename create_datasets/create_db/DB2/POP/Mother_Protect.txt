I used to friend with trees, I have a call
I close my eyes and wait for the echo
And you came in a hurricane, 
I watched you in the dark
Never seen nothing like it,
Don't wanna smash the spark

I used to follow you, follow you for days
I slept beside you, just shadows away
I watched you by the fire, your hands was all aglow
Under the spell of a circle, I let my face show

Oh my heart is like an eagle, I love to fall from the sky
It's so beautiful, I see right through the water's edge
And I love your hands, I let them lead me into the cage
So tender but your body was warm, and so frail,
But your eyes like mine, the color of ice.

You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
Fear the lioness paint her face black and golden

You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
(you're my weakest part)
Fear the lioness paint her face black and golden
(you're my weakest part)

You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
(so strong)
Fear the lioness paint her face black and golden

You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
(I'm so strong, so strong)
