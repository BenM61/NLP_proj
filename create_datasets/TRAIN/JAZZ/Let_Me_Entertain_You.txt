Make me entertain you 
Make me see you smile 
I will do some kicks 
Oh! 
 
I will do some tricks 

Sing out, Louise! 

I'll tell you a story... 
Louise 
I'll dance when she's done 

Who said that? 
Who's out there, George? 

I don't know, I got all the mothers out of here! 
Just like you told me! 

Are you ready to smile? 

You're behind, Louise 
Get upon it! 

Well, I'll try that through 
Entertaining you 

Who's that? 

Sing out, Louise! 

You'll love our lullaby 

Get that mother out of here! 
 
Lady...
