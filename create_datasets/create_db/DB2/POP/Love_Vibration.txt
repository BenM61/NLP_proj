Step out into the sun
Step out into the world and love someone

Save yourself from hate
Save yourself from hate and all the hassle

And you people all know know what I'm talkin' about
(Yeah you people all know what he's talkin' about)
Yeah you people all know what I'm talkin' about
(Yeah you people all know what he's talkin' about)

Spread the love vibration
Uh-huh
Spread the love vibration
Uh-huh

Now everybody's scared
Scared of being lonely and abandoned

If you find someone who cares
If you find someone to love and understand you

Then you people all know know what I'm talkin' about
(Yeah you people all know what he's talkin' about)
Yeah you people all know what I'm talkin' about
(Yeah you people all know what he's talkin' about)

Spread the love vibration
Uh-huh
Spread the love vibration
Uh-huh

Yeah you people all know what I'm talkin' about
(Yeah you people all know what he's talkin' about)
Yeah you people all know what I'm talkin' about
(Yeah you people all know what he's talkin' about)

If you people all know what I'm talkin' about
