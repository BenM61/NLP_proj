There's a Guy in this old town
I'm tellin' you a fact
He measures five feet up and down
And five feet front and back
He's a Roly Poly Baby
Pleasin' as they come
He's a Roly Poly Baby
A Ton of Fun

They call him
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly
Ya Ya Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly

When I first laid eyes on him
I laughed just like the rest
The more I saw the more of him
The more I liked him best
Got a Roly Poly Baby
Point to him with pride
He's my Roly Poly Baby
I'm satisfied

I call him
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly
Ya Ya Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly

Just to put my arms around him
Takes about a week
But when I get my arms around
We cuddle cheek to cheek
Got a Roly Poly Baby
Sweet as Apple Pie
He is just a Roly Poly
But so am I

I call him
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly
Ya Ya Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
Ya Ya Roly Poly
