This isn't sometimes 
Yeah it's for always 
If I'm gonna love you with all of my heart 
And if there is no more time
This always remains 
Even as the world spins itself apart

'Cause I remember them days I waited so patiently 
For God to bring someone who's gonna be good to me 
And then He blessed my soul 

Well, I traveled a long way 
(Traveled a long way)
And it took a long time 
(Took a long time)
To find you
But I finally found you

I remember all them lonely days 
I traveled out on my own 
Then you brought me everything 
You made my house a home 
But if it's not the real deal then I don't know it 
'Cause it sure does feel, and I think it sure does show 

I remember all them days I waited so patiently 
And God brought someone who's gonna be good to me 
And He blessed my soul

But I traveled a long way
(Traveled a long way)
And it sure took a long time
(Took a long time)
To find you, yeah
But I sure did find you

And He blessed my soul
(Traveled a long way)
And He blessed my soul
(Took a long time)
Yes He did, yes He did
Oh yes He did, yes He did
