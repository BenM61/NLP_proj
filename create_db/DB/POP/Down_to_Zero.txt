Oh the feeling 
When you're reeling 
You step lightly thinking you're number one 
Down to zero with a word 
Leaving 
For another one

Now you walk with your feet back on the ground 
Down to the ground 
Down to the ground 
Down to the ground 
Down to the ground

Brand new dandy 
First class scene stealer 
Walks through the crowd and takes your man 
Sends you rushing to the mirror 
Brush your eyebrows and say 
There's more beauty in you than anyone

Oh remember who walked the warm sands beside you 
Moored to your heel let the waves come a rushing in 
She'll take the worry from your head 
But then again 
She put trouble in your heart instead 
Then you'll fall 
Down to the ground 
Down to the ground

You'll know heartache 
Still more crying 
When you're thinking of your mother's only son 
Take to your bed 
You say there's peace in sleep 
But you'll dream of love instead

Oh the heartache you'll find 
Can bring more pain than a blistering sun 
But oh when you fall 
Oh when you fall 
Fall at my door

Oh the feeling 
When you're reeling 
You step lightly thinking you're number one 
Down to zero with a word 
Leaving 
For another one

Now you walk with your feet back on the ground 
Down to the ground 
Down to the ground 
Down to the ground 
Down to the ground

You'll know heartache 
Still more crying 
When you're thinking of your mother's only son 
Take to your bed 
You say there's peace in sleep 
But you'll dream of love instead

But oh when you fall 
Oh when you fall 
Fall at my door
