Day by day and night by night
I feel you in my mind 
It happens all the time 
You know my daydreams stop
My heart beats on
I can't take it anymore,
It's you I live for 

You are in my system
You are in my system 
I just want you to know that
You are in my system
You are in my system, system
Don't you, don't you know that baby?

I will keep on pushing, pushing, pushing
Until I get through
But my main objective baby is to get to you 
To turn your mind around,
I know will take time
But you know I can't wait now 
You're on my mind
Oh babe,

You are in my system
You are in my system 
I just want you to know that
You are in my system
Got me burning I'm on fire 
You are in my system
You're everything I need oh
Don't you know, don't you know that baby?

It's a romantic vision of me and you
It happens all the time,
My dreams all filled with you
There's no doubt on my mind
That I'll be true baby
You know I'll take you out and I'll keep love new, oh baby

You are in my system
Got me right down to the wire
You are in my system
Help my equilibrium
You are in my system
