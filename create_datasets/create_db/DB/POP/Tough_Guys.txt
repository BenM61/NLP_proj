She doesn't like the tough guys
They think that they can do anything they please
But they're gonna get a surprise
When she brings them to their knees

'Cause she doesn't like the rough guys
They think they can have any girl they choose
They've got tricks but my baby got wise
So in case you haven't heard the news

She doesn't like the tough guys
She doesn't like the rough guys
So find some one you own size
'Cause she's not afraid of you

She doesn't like the tough guys
She says that they've got brains all where they sit
They think they're full of fire
She thinks they're full of shit

She doesn't like the tough guys
She doesn't like the rough guys
She's gonna call your bluff guys
And you better believe it's true

She don't like you
She doesn't like the tough guys
They think that they can do anything they please
But they're gonna get a surprise
When she brings them to their knees

'Cause she doesn't like the rough guys
They think they can have any girl they choose
They've got tricks but my baby got wise
So in case you haven't heard the news

She doesn't like the tough guys
She doesn't like the rough guys
So find some one you own size
'Cause she's not afraid of you

She doesn't like the rough guys
She said she heard enough lies
She's gonna call your bluff guys
And you better believe it's true

Tough guys tough guys
Ooh get along tough guys
You might has gone forget it
Tough guys
Oh you know you know she love me better
Tough guys tough guys
