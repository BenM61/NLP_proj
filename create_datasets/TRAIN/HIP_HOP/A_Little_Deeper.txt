Have u ever had a broken heart felt so much pain?
Lived in so much dark thought u'd never see the light again?
Have u ever yearned from deep within when u see
others laughin'
That just 4 one second, u could b them?
I lived life hiding behind the curtain
Never known 4 certain when I'd be free
I lived life as my shadow hopin' that the pain would go
But all the time I was hidin' from me

If u know what I mean
If u 2 are searchin' 2 b happy
All u gotta do is dig a little deeper within u

If u know what I mean
If u 2 are searchin' 2 b happy
All u gotta do is dig a little deeper within u

Have u ever fallen out of love
Ur feeling just disappeared
But it's urself u're think' of
And so still u kept them near
Have u ever been untrue
Even though u knew right from wrong
But the coward in u just kept them hanging on
I ain't claimin' 2 b no angel
I really never meant 2 it just weren't meant 2 b
I knew he thought I was the one
The least that I could of done was made him
hear it from me

If u ever been through broken heart then really
u need 2 remember how it felt b4 ur untrue
And think a little deeper bout what u do

If u ever been through broken heart then really
u need 2 remember how it felt b4 ur untrue
And think a little deeper bout what u do
