Well, I'm knocking on the door of your heart, my dear
Like the three little pigs you have it locked with fear
I'm a-huffin' and a-puffin' like the others do
I'm not a big wolf I'm just a-little boy blue.

Open up your heart and let me come in
I have no hair on my chiny, chin, chin
You know I love you and I want her too
I'm not the big bad wolf I'm just a-little boy blue.

Well, the first one you loved broke your heart I saw
I was sound asleep while you concealed it all
My hearts in my hand and I want to give it to you
But your heart like stone and I can't reach you.

Open up your heart and let me come in
I have no hair on my chiny, chin, chin
You know I love you and I want her too
I'm not the big bad wolf, I'm just a-little boy blue.

Well, you won't let me in so I'll sneak away
And if you ever need me I'll be asleep in the hay
I'm a-huffin' and a-puffin' like the others do
I'm not the big bad wolf, I'm a-little boy blue.

Open up your heart and let me come in
I have no hair on my chiny, chin, chin
You know I love you and I want her too
I'm not the big bad wolf, just a-little boy blue.

Open up your heart and let me come in
I have no hair on my chiny, chin, chin
You know I love you and I want her too
I'm not the big bad wolf, I'm just a-little boy blue.

I'm not the big bad wolf, I'm just a-little boy blue
