There are bluebirds in the moonlight 
Silly idea: bluebirds in the moonlight, 
But that's how I feel when I'm with you 
There are nightowls in the daylight 

Silly idea: nightowls in the daylight 
Or maybe my heart is saying, "who-who, who-who..." 
Who is the one for me? 
You, that's what you've done to me... 

There are bluebirds in the moonlight 
Silly idea: bluebirds in the moonlight, 
But that's how I feel when I'm with you!
