Born in darkness
But I fought my way up to the sun
I had a lot of battles
Some I've lost and some I've won

But let me tell you girl
You ain't seen nothing yet
Ain't nothing in this world
That I can't get

As long as I have you (as long as I have you)
As long as I have you (as long as I have you)
As long as I have you
Oh won't you give me a marriage to crumble

And I'll turn and just say 
You let me put this world
In the palm of your hands
A thousand tear drops

Should I sing my way out of the blues
I haven't learned to stand up (whoa)
Even when they scare me
Out of my shoes

But let I tell you girl
You ain't seen nothing yet
There's nothion' in this world
That I can't get

As long as I have you (as long as I have you)
As long as I have you (as long as I have you)
As long as I have you
Oh won't you give me a marriage to crumble

And I'll turn and just say you
You let me put this world
In the palm of your hands
Say you love me

And the Lord in heaven if there was one
Don't you worry 'bout nothing
In the end the best is yet to come
Oh, let me tell you girl

You ain't seen nothing yet
There's nothing in this world
That I can't get
So long as I have you (as long as I have you)

So long as I have you (as long as I have you)
There's nothing I can't do (as long as I have you)
As long as I have you (as long as I have you)
Mm mm mm mm (as long as I have you)

And the troubles will go (as long as I have you)
I'm gonna be ok (as long as I have you)
Alright, alright (as long as I have you)
Oh yeah, oh yeah (as long as I have you)

Oh yeah (as long as I have you)
So long as I have you (as long as I have you)
But let me tell you girl
You ain't seen nothing yet

There's nothin' in this world
That I can't get
As long as I have you (as long as I have you)
Oh yeah (as long as I have you)

Alright, alright (as long as I have you)
Ok, ok (as long as I have you)
All day, all day (as long as I have you)
