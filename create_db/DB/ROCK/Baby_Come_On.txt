She's a pretty girl. She's always falling down
And I think I just fell in love with her
But she won't ever remember, remember

And I can always find her at the bottom of a plastic cup
Drowning in drunk sincerity
A sad and lonely girl

Quit crying your eyes out
Quit crying your eyes out and, Baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on
Quit crying your eyes out, Baby

And she said,
I think we're running out of alcohol 
Tonight, I hate this fucking town
And all my best friends will be the death of me
But they won't ever remember, remember

So please take me far away, before I melt into the ground
And all my words get used against me
This sad and lonely girl

Quit crying your eyes out
Quit crying your eyes out and, Baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on
Quit crying your eyes out, Baby

Quit crying your eyes out
Quit crying your eyes out and, Baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on
Quit crying your eyes out, Baby

Isn't there something familiar about me?
Quit crying your eyes out
The past is only the future with the lights on
So quit crying your eyes out, Baby
