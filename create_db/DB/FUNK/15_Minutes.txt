[Chorus]
All I got is fifteen minutes 
And I want to get up in it 
Ain't got no time to talk 
Just come and break me off 
Ain't got no time for love
Just come and give me some
Ain't got no time to talk 
Just come and break me off

Its 7:45 on the dot 
I guess I'm late for work
But I'm feeling kinda hot
Standing downstairs pouring juice
Flipping my eggs 
But I want to flip you
Because your
Standing right there in your negligee (negligee)
I want to hit it but damn I'm late (damn I'm late)
Maybe a quickie would make my day 
It would make my day 
It would make my day oh oh yea

[Chorus]

I think I want to hit it again 
Call my boss and tell him 
I won't be in oh oh
I bet he's gonna want to know why
But I just can't tell him no lies
Because your
Laying right here in your negligee
Right now I don't care
Just cut my pay
You do the same 
If you were in my place
If you were in my place 
With that ass all up in your face

[Chorus]

First two minutes girl we gonna take our time
Break it down 
Hit you from behind
Next three minutes oh we gonna get on the floor
Say my name 
Make you want some more
Five, four, three, two, one turn it on the side
Hurry up 
Scream it out 
Let it go girl 
And when you arrive 
Our time is up 
So scream much louder
Oh

[Chorus]
