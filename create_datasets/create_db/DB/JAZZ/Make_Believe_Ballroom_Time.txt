It's Make-Believe Ballroom Time 
Put all your cares away 
All the bands are here to bring a cheer your way 
It's Make-Believe Ballroom Time 
And free to everyone 
It's no time to fret 
Your dial is set for fun 
Just close your eyes and visualize in your solitude 
Your favorite bands are on the stands 
And Mr. Miller puts you in the mood 
It's Make-Believe Ballroom Time 
The hour of sweet romance 
here's your make-believe ballroom 
Come on, children, let's dance, let's dance!
