Now a man ain't suppose to cry
But with all this pain inside
All my eyes can see is blue water

No the world ain't suppose to be
Just a drowning sea
There's more for you and me than blue water

Yeah, let's make our morning bright
And I know we're bound to see tomorrow clearly in our sight
Girl, take my hand, tell me you understand
'Cause we don't need to stand in blue water

Now life is a one time trip
And we've got to build our ship
So we won't ever slip into blue water

All you got to do is let yourself go
Just let it over flow
'Cause that river in your soul is just blue water

Yeah, let's make our morning fun
And I know we're bound to see tomorrow clearly in our sight
Girl, take my hand, tell me you understand
'Cause we don't need to stand in blue water

Go dry your tears and try to realize
There's more to what you see
If you open up your eyes

Yeah, it's gonna be alright
I know you're gonna see tomorrow clearly in our sight
Girl, take my hand, tell me that you understand
'Cause we don't need to stand in blue water

We don't need to stand in blue water
Girl, oh, tell me that you understand
We don't need to stand in blue water
Yeah, oh, tell me that you understand
We don't need to stand in blue water

Take my hand, oh, tell me that you understand
'Cause we don't need to stand in blue water
