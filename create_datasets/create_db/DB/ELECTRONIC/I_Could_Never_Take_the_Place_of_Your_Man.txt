Verse 1 
Only last June when her old man ran away 
She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay 
10:35 on a lonely Friday night 
She was standing by the fire and ooh she was looking alright 

be	 Section 
I asked her if she wanted to dance 
And she said that 
All she wanted was a good man 
And wanted to know 
If I thought I was qualified 

Chorus 
And I said baby don't waste your time 
I know what's on your mind 
I may be qualified for a one night stand 
But I could never take the place of your man 

Verse 2 
It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes 
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die 
He left her with a baby and another one on the way 
She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay 

be	-Section 
She asked me if we could be friends 
And I said oh honey baby that's a dead end 
You know and I know 
That we wouldn't be satisfied 

Chorus 
And I said baby don't waste your time 
I know what's on your mind baby 
Wouldn't be satisfied with a one night stand 
And I could never take the place of your man 

(Chorus out)
