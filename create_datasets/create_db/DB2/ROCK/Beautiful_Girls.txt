She was seaside sittin', just a smokin' and a drinkin' on ringside,
On top of the world, oh, yeah
She had her drink in her hand she had her toes in the sand and whoa,
What a beautiful girl, ah, yeah
What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit of money can turn your head around
Creatures from the sea with the look to me like she'd like to fool around
What a snappy little mammy gonna keep her pappy happy
And accompany me to the ends of the earth, ah, yeah that't what I said

Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah beautiful girls
Well, I'm a bum in the sun and I'm having fun
And I know you know I got no special plans (special plans)
All the bills are paid I got it made in the shade
And all I nee, nee, need is the woman
What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit of money can turn your head around
Creatures from the sea with the looks to me like she'd like to fool around
Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah beautiful girls (woo come this way)

Sit down right here
Oh, la la
Think I've got it now

Now, I'm a seaside sittin', just a smokin' and a drinkin'
I'm ringside, on top of the world (top of the world)
I got a drink in my hand I got my toes in the sand
All I need is a beautiful girl (beautiful girl)
Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah beautiful girls (I ain't lyin' to you nothin' else I need)
Ah, yeah beautiful girls sit yourself on down
