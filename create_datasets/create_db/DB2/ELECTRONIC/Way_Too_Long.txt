Nobody's been comin' round your way
Have you been hearing what they say?
They were your buddies yesterday
But you took too long to pay

Have you heard the latest news
About a cat that got slapped and bashed and bruised
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be in his shoes
Now the kid's got f*ck all to lose
Broken friendships too hard to mention
Ran round in venture
Only invention
As we step from old to new
Andy knows we always wanted to didgeridoo

All those kids who were your mates
You've let them sitting on their hate
When you're asleep or you're awake
You cannot hide from your mistake

Has he checked the fresh tickets?
Get my fuckin
 money or you get my fuckin' fist
Personality switchin' twitchin'
Like the girls in the springer show bitchin'
Boy's in major shit now
Hasn't even got a little bit now
Cuz he was out on the town
Knockin' boots down
Spendin' all his money
And throwin' it around

Have you seen where Stevie's been?
Well, I've seen him round the way,
If you know what I mean
Where?
Well, he was at the club last night
Drinkin' with a girl and she looked a bit alright
What the f*ck is he doin'?
Spending all my money on a girl now im screwin'
I only ticked him for a favor
And he pays me back with that kinda behaviour?

And that just seems to be the way things go down
Just enjoyance with a bird to an old motel
Lets get paid lets just get paid 

And that just seems to be the way things go down
Just enjoyance with a bird to an old motel
Lets get paid lets just get paid
