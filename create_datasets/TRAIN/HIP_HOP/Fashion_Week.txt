I know a thing
And she tell me f*ck her and call her a bad bitch
I can never cuff her, I'm stuck on this rap shit
Fuckin' up the budget but nothing but rap shit
I know a thing
Shea butter on Twitter be callin' shawty a queen
Head game silly, might give her the Don C
Hair game killin' I get her a new McQueen
In case you behind, let me remind you to wait till I make my move
Wale from the Maybach group
Heard about me, what they say about you?
Heard about me, what they say about you?

You wanna sit front row?
Ask me get anything that you want, though
She a fashion killer, me I'mma cutthroat
Goin' out tonight, she said that she wants coke
1 Oak or Webster, up and down
Paparazzi gonna think that I'm cuffing now
It's casual I'll call you up when I'm back in town
We fall out but she always come back around
Hit Barney's and f*ck up a check there
In the dressing room, f*ck have sex there
"What's taking so long?" "Oh, she trying the next pair"
People see us everywhere and they just stare
And she mixing off white with SL
I got my Vans on bitch, I dress well
I'm from the Bay, I see her once in a blue moon
Until Paris Fashion Week, how soon is too soon?
