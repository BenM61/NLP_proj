You called my name in the dark, called me back to the start
The condensation is building tension
Stubborn silence is formed, around our bodies it's warm
The cool wet grasses as summer passes
Frightened under attack, fallen flat on my back
Arms and legs, I'm too scared to beg
Harm me most when it's light, thought of you don't sit right
I need the darkness a desperate embrace

Razing cities to dust, faces dripping in lust
Fallen empires and raging bush fires
All your words unfounded, secret lives bound in bed
Living backwards and tangled back words
Ruined everything right, so good can't see the light
From my cave I can see the wave, fallen empires and raging bush fires

We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light
We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light
We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light,
We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light,
We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light,
We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light,
We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light,
We are the light, we are the light, 
We are the light, we are the light,

We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
We are the light, we are the light (run to the fire)
