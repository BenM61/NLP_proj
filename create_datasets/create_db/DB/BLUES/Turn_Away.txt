Tell me words, said too much again
You think I would learn by now
And when I heard you, it just tears me all to bits
You think I would learn by now

All my labor is in vain
But I'll beg just the same
If you turn away, if you turn away
If you turn away, oh, honey, please stay

Why am I the one to wear the pain?
I guess I do it with panache
To talk it over now it'll only be a strain
With our hearts lost in all this trash

Where there are fewer stars to burn
Who'll be here when you return?
If you leave me now, if you turn away
If you turn away, oh honey, please stay

Where there are fewer stars to burn
Who'll be here when you return?
If you leave me now, if you turn away
If you turn away, oh, honey please stay
