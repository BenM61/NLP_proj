For the first time in my life
Boy, I'm not afraid to say it
How I really feel inside
We don't have to go on waiting

Just think about it, together you and I
I could never try to write a better story
From the pages of my life
You must have written for me
'Cause every line, found a way into my heart

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we can lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

When you look back on the days
When you tried so hard to reach me
But I never saw the way
Till you took the time to teach me
And I found out, what it's all about

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we can lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

And again I must say
How lucky I feel to have found you
Oh and I pray everyday that this feeling goes on
Forever and ever

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we can lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

Oh and I pray everyday that this feeling goes on
Forever and ever

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we gonna lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

We can make it through love
Through the test of time
Through the test of time

Oh if I've got you and you've got me
Then we'll be happy and we can be
If I love you baby and you love me too
Well, there ain't nothing that we can't go for
Through the test of time
Through the test of time
Through the test of time
Through the test of time
Through the test of time
