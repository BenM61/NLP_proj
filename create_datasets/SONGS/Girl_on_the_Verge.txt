Observation
My situation
Ain't lookin' up
I'm having stupid suicidal thoughts

Complication
My hesitation
To cut you off
Has put me at a total loss

I'm a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown
I'm all messed up, baby, all cause of you
I can't sleep; I'm in too deep
I'm a girl on the verge of a major meltdown
I may be all freaked out and confused
But I still wouldn't wanna be you
I'm a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown

Devastation
My reputation
Is headed south
My medication's running out

I'm a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown
I'm all messed up, baby, all cause of you
I can't sleep; I'm in too deep
I'm a girl on the verge of a major meltdown
I may be all freaked out and confused
But I still wouldn't wanna be you
I'm a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown

Congratulations
I'm your creation
Well how 'bout that
You better lock your doors
Cause the bitch is back

I'm a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown
I'm all messed up, baby, all cause of you
I can't sleep; I'm in too deep
I'm a girl on the verge of a major meltdown
I may be all freaked out and confused
But I still wouldn't wanna be you
I'm a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown
I'm a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
