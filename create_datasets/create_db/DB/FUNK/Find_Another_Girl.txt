The very first time I fell in love got my heart broken then people would say when I passed their way
"Theres a hot young man going there going there" 
"An unhappy lad going there."
Well one day my mother called me to here side said son "why you so blue".
"Mother I lost the girl that I love why wont you tell me what to do"
Mother wont you tell me what to do?
Well she said find yourself another girl who will love you true true true find yourself another girl.
Save all her love and kisses just for you [x2]
I can imagine how you feel my son but throw it out of your mind Im gonna tell kinda truthfully
True love is hard to find sometimes its kinda hard to find.
