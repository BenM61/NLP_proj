I may look like a city slicker,
Shinin' up through his shoes. 
Underneath I'm just a cotton picker,
Pickin' out a mess of blues 
Show me where I start. 
Find a horse and cart. 
I'm just a country boy,
Country boy at heart. 
I may look like a bank teller,
Pushing facts in a file. 
But I'd rather be a haul collar,
Shooing foot home in style. 
Show me where I start. 
Find a horse and cart. 
I'm just a country boy,
Country boy at heart.
