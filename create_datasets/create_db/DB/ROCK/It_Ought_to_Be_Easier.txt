Tell your mama I love her
Tell your daddy I tried
Tell them I wish that I could explain
The way that I'm feeling

See the sun comes up on the pavement
The pavement it starts to sweat
The steam rises up from the water
And the hotter it is you know the harder it gets

And it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go

I know you don't believe me
And I know you don't understand
But honey the way that you treat me
I can't even tell who I am

And you tell me I'm the one you're not to blame
And you tell me I make you feel the same way
And we talk in circles but we never say
It's just out of weakness that both of us stay

And it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go

I look at you when you're sleeping
And I think about how it could be
If you would wake up and open your arms
And hold me

But you look at me when you wake up
With eyes that are angry and mean
And I turn away and walk into the kitchen
And I pray for the strength to leave

Because it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go
To leave when you know that you have to go

So tell your mama I love her
I hope she knows that I tried
Tell her I wish that I could explain
The way that I'm feeling

See the suns comes up on the pavement
The pavement it starts to sweat
The steam rises up from the water
And the hotter it is you know the harder it gets
The hotter it is you know the harder it gets
The hotter it is you know the harder it gets
