Children come running to the truth
But you got to peel the skin to get the food
And while one is living high, another is grieving
But what sweet by morning is bitter by the evening

I say the wicked man shall fall
When the moon chase away the sun
And force my day to run
I shall not fear the darkest night
For I know upon the other side is light

I say the wicked man shall fall
Every man is a common man
And every common has his plan
But while the hungry man seek any food, any food in sight
There's a greedy man who seek only appetite

I say the wicked man shall fall
