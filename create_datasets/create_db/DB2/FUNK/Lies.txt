Ah, ah, yeah
(Lies, lies ) ooh, baby (lies)
Well, well

We took a vow to be ever true
I lived up to mine, tell me, did you
Someone saw you with your old lover
Hand in hand, I don't understand

You said it ended so long ago
You had me believing while
You were deceiving me with lies (lies)
Wish I could have seen it in your eyes
(Lies) but I never did (no, I never did)

Baby, lies (lies) thought I read
The message in your eyes (lies)
But I was too caught up
In your web of lies

Someone calls at the strangest of times
And I swear I hear a man's voice
On the other side

You give me the same old story
It's just a friend
That's who it is, girl

I hate to say it but
My faith in you is shaking
Don't say you love me when
It's my heart you're breaking

With your lies (lies) wish I
Could have seen it in your eyes
(Lies) but I never did (no, I never did)

Ooh, lies (lies) it took so long


For me to realize (lies)
But I was too caught up
In your web of lies

Wish I could have seen it in your eyes
(Lies) but I never did, I never did
Lies (lies) it took so long for me
To realize (lies) but I was
Too caught up in your web of lies
Whoa, lies, girl

You had me believing while
You were deceiving me with lies

I hate to say it but
My faith in you is shaking
Don't say you love me when
It's my heart you're breaking

With your lies, wish I could
Have seen it in your eyes
But I never did

Baby, lies, it took
So long for me to realize
Oh, but I was too blind to see

Oh, baby, with a white lie
A wicked lie, oh, baby

You cheated on me, you cheated on me
With a white lie, with a wicked lie
When I loved you, loved you

You cheated on me, you cheated on me
With a white lie, oh, with a wicked lie
But I loved you, baby, loved you, baby

Lies

Oh, baby, with a white lie
A wicked lie, oh, baby

With a white lie
A wicked lie, oh, baby
