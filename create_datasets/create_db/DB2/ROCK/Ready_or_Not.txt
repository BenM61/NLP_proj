Here I come ready or not
Here I come ready to go
Here I come ready or not
Here I come ready to go

Something that you said
Goes 'round my head
You know I'm gonna ride tonight
You look at me
But all I want to see
Is you tonight
Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Just a question of time
Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Now that I've made up my mind

Here I come ready or not
Here I come ready to go
Here I come ready or not
Here I come ready to go

Girl you got the look
As if you wrote the book
But I don't understand
How one girl can be so sure
You've got me in the palm of your hand
Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Just a question of time
Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Now that I've made up my mind

Here I come ready or not
Here I come ready to go
Here I come ready or not
Here I come ready to go
