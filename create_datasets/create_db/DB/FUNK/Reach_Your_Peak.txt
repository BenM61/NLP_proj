I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me
I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me

I'd like to see you reach that sunny day
I hope you can achieve all of the things you say
But if you don't make it, don't give up just fake it
You're not with yet, come on and try to forget

I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me
I like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me

You occupy your time with such silly things
Do you have to go every time the phone rings
And when you don't get what you want, don't fret
You know it's comin' back, relax and stop your running

I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me
I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me

I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me
I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me

I like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me
I like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me

If you really wanna reach a peak
You better follow me
'Cause I'm reaching the peak
I feel the rhythm, babe, yes
I'm reaching my peak

I'd like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me
I'm reaching my peak, yeah
I like to see you reach your peak
And feel the beat that gets to me
