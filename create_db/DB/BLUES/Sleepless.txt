I'm still sleepless, I'm still wasted
And I'm so tired of all I've tasted
And I'm still willin', and I'm still able
Save a place there at your table

I still wake from dusk till dawn
Think of all that's come and gone
To hell with all those memories
And all those stories

If you wanna see my song and dance
You've gotta give me one more chance
And I'm hungry as I used to be
That's why I'm standin' here

I'm still sleepless, I'm still wasted
I'm so tired of all I've tasted
I'm still restless, and I'm still hungry
In the dark nights, oh, dreams still haunt me, yeah

I'm still hungry, will you feed me?
In these shadows, can you see me?
Oh, I'm sleepless, so wasted, oh, tired
I'm still sleepless
