Go

Wake up, stand up
For everything you want
Let's go, let's live
What are your dreams, what do you wish?

It's up to you
So open up your eyes
And see, what could be
The world is there for us, for us

Forever, we will be together
To love for life
Let all go, let me lead
To be free

Let me be
Your eyes forever mine
Let me be
Your guide through this life

What is real, what is fake?
You'll never know for sure
All the pain, all the lies
I'll take them away from you

It's up to you
So open up your eyes
And see, what could be
The world is there for us, there for us

Let me be
Your eyes forever mine
Let me be
Your guide through this life

I will never let you down
Let you down

Forever, we will be together
To love for life
Let all go, let me lead
To be free
