You cannot go against nature
     Because when you do
     Go against nature
     It's part of nature too

     Our little lives get complicated
     It's a simple thing
     Simple as a flower
     And that's a complicated thing

     No new tale to tell
     No new tale to tell
     No new tale to tell

     AHHHH

     My world is your world
     People like to hear their names
     I'm no exception
     Please call my name
     Call my name

     No new tale to tell
     No new tale to tell
     No new tale to tell

     AHHHH

     When you're down
     It's a long way up
     When you're up
     It's a long way down

     It's all the same thing
     No new tale to tell

     No new tale to tell
