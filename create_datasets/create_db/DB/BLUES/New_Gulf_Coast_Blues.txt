I done pack my belong
Gonna leave my woes
Goin' to a better place
With a smile upon my face

When that steam boat blows
And that Gulf stream flows
You'll hear me say goodbye
Because there's a reason why

The Gulf of Mexico
Flows in to the Mobile Bay
The Gulf of Mexico
Flows in to the Mobile Bay
I'm gonna let that cool stream of water
Flow over my head someday

Tell me mister mailman
What is on your mind?
Tell me mister mailman
What is on your mind?
If you pass my door
So glad you obliged

My eyes are brown
My teeth are pearly white
My eyes are brown
My teeth are pearly white
Because my skin is dark
Don't mean my heart ain't right
