Bring it on, bring it bring it on now 
Bring it on, bring it bring it on now 

Never stop givin good love 'cause that's what I call you for 
Never stop baby give it up 
'Cause I know where it came from you got more 
I like playing games, and if it's all the same 
You can bring it on with the ruff stuff 
Give me your love I don't want to be tammed 

I need a man to be a real man In order of what I got in store 
Always finish what you start baby 
And always having me beg for more 
You know I want to be a diggy down boy 
But I don't get around 
Jimmy has to ride in your pocket 
Or lock him in your wallet 
It's just a bootie Call 

Bring it on, bring it bring it on now(It's bootie call) 
Bring it on, bring it bring it on now(It's just a bootie call) 
Bring it on, bring it bring it on now(It's a bootie call) 
Bring it on, bring it bring it on now 

Gaining you what is baby Things are always good to have 
You never let me down 
I'm always happy, when you made me laugh 
But Don't try to find, this Heart of mine 
Emotions will come into my head, so don't be mislead 
My heart doesn't need to be fed 

Only tryin' to be smart baby, don't need the rollercoaster ride 
I've been and seen it all yeah yeah 
Don't want you messing with my mind 
So don't be a fool, keep this as your number one rule 
Good lovins not always from the heart, you gotta be smart 

Stay just the way you are (a bootie call) 
It's just a bootie call(It's a bootie call) 
It's just a bootie call 
Bring it on, bring it bring it on (It's bootie call) 
Bring it on, bring it bring it on (It's just a bootie call) 
Bring it on, bring it bring it on (It's a bootie call) 
It's just a bootie call 

Do you really love me baby 

It's a bootie call It's a bootie call It's a bootie 
It's a bootie call It's a bootie call It's a bootie call It's a bootie
