Here it is again yet it stings like the first time
Seems it never ends, double nickels on your dime
I thought we were friends, I guess it just depends who you ask
These feelings tend to leave me with a hole in my chest
A hole in my chest [Repeat: x3]

Now the time has come I just wish I could erase
All the damage done to your name and your keepsakes
It's only just begun, it's been fun, we were blind, deaf and dumb
There's a party in my closet calling all skeletons
All skeletons, calling all

[Chorus]
Where did you go as the lights went black?
Look whats become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more pretty please

Now the time has come I just wish I could erase
All the damage done, all this pain, all this heartache
It's only just begun, it's been fun, we were fucked up and numb
There's a killer on the corner and he's looking for love
He's, looking for love
Yeah he's looking for (you my love)

[Chorus]

And to tell you the truth I lost my faith on you
(You gotta stop sneaking up on me)
And these unspoken lies appear at the worst times
(You gotta stop sneaking up on me)
They're hiding just behind your eyes

[Chorus]

Where did you go as the lights went black?
Look out, watch your heart attack
I thought you might as well love to see
You gotta stop sneaking up on me
You gotta stop sneaking up on me
