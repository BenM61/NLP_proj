Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Just tell me, tell me, would we, would we?
Could we, could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
So many memories too painful to remember
The way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line (or has time rewritten)
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me would we, would we?
Ah could we, could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet (may be beautiful and yet)
Much too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter that we will remember (I know)
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were (I miss you baby)
The way we were (oh I miss you so much baby)
I miss the way we were
The way we were
