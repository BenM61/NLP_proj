Lift this veil of tears from your eyes
There's no more use in crying
A mighty cloud living in your skies
I shot it down last night

Stand up, make your dreams come true
Let me be the one for you
I'll break the chains that bind your hands
I'll take you to my dreamland

I can be your dreamland baby (your sunshine)
I can be your dreamland baby (your paradise)

Pull together with the other the mother sea
Bodies in harmony
Magic moon, electricity
When you put your arms around me

Nightingale songs linger on and on
Always calling out to me
Follow me, I know you need
And I ain't let our make our dreams

I can be your dreamland baby (your sunshine)
I can be your dreamland baby (your paradise)

Rivers flow with honey and gold
Drowning all out your misery
Anyway the white wind blows
You can come home to me

Shine on, may your dreams come true
Let me be the one for you
I'll be yours to the very end
I take you to my dreamland

I can be your dreamland baby (your sunshine)
I can be your dreamland baby (your paradise)

I can be your dreamland baby (your sunshine)
I can be your dreamland baby (your paradise)

I can be your dreamland baby (your sunshine)
I can be your dreamland baby (your paradise)
