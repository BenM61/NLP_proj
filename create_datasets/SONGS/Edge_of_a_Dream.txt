(m. riperton r. rudolph)

The ripples run into the sun
And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? what do I see?

I see the children playing in the sun
And there is love enough for each and everyone
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

Merry-go-round without a sound
I hear your song in the breeze that rock-a-byes me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? what do I see?

I see the lord inside of everyone
Can it be my dream will really come
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

And here comes the morning sun
I wonder if my dream will really come
As I site on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!
