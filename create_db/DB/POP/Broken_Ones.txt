Cross your heart and say you've never given up
That you carried on when every door was shut
That you live, you live with no regret!
We wear a smile to hide that we’ve been hurt before
Keep our disasters in a suitcase by the door,
'Cause you know, you know we’re only human!

So lay your hands on the left behind
We all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while.
In a crowded place trying not to feel alone,
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!
Let’s love the broken ones, yeah, yeah!
Love the broken ones!

Raise your glass to all the words we never say
We do our best, but still we look the other way,
'Cause sometimes it’s easier to run
'Cause after all, we’re only human!

So lay your hands on the left behind
We all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while.
In a crowded place trying not to feel alone,
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!
Let’s love the broken ones, yeah, yeah!
Love the broken ones!

Sometimes we’re left behind,
Feel like the only one,
But we were born to try
Yeah, we’re only human!

So lay your hand on the left behind
Yeah, we all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while
In a crowded place trying not to feel so alone,
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!
So let's love the broken ones, whoa-oh
Love the broken ones, no no
Let's love the broken ones, whoa oh whoa oh
Love the broken ones, yeah-yeah.
Let’s love the broken ones!
