Big black cloud 
Little white lie 
Never pay 
Sit and hear it fall 
La la la 
You were hardly pure 
Right there 

Big black cloud 
Little white lie 
Never pay 
Sit and hear it fall 
La la la 
You were hardly pure 
Right there 

Tears start over 
Tears start over 

Big black cloud 
Little white lie 
Never pay 
Sit and hear it fall 
La la la 
You were hardly pure 
Right there
