[Rap]
What the problem is
These Niggas wanna get in my dr-awls
Homey take a pa-ause
Women let's tell 'em our la-aws
Shoppin' sprees in malls dawg
Shop til I drop, til I push that drop
To the number one spot
Niggas wanna buy me shit on the rocks
Anything that's gonna make me get on top
Man just back up off me
You one hello from stalkin me
Tellin' me things that you think you mean
Like you love me when you saw me
Shut it up, give it up
Me and my girls we ain't sluts
No love fo' a scrub
Man we got our own dubs, what

[Hook:]
Oh baby don't get mad
That's how we roll
We come equipped
Like gettin Chevy 6-4's
Can't get in my thong
Can't kiss me low
I'll never be yo dyme
So baby hit the do'

y'all dudes is all the same
Always playin' games
Thinkin' you's a pimp
And comin' at me so lame
Can't get in my thong
Can't kiss me low
I'll never be yo dyme
So baby hit the do'
