Rrwoooaaaw!
Ahh, ahhh
Burning, now I bring you hell
Oh burning, now I bring you hell

Leave me tonight
Let the warning said, leave a shudder upon you
Running from all that you've feared in your life
Soul of the night
Will a son mislead, paint a horror upon you
Marking the moment, displaying in my
Ghost of a life
That I can't condone the way you left me
Out in the open, to leave me to die
So how can I
Forget the way you led me through the path into heaven,
To leave me behind

Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance upon you
Too chilling, more than I can tell
Burning, now I bring you hell

Oh burning, now I bring you hell

Free me tonight
Lest the animal, caged, be a terror upon you
Caught in the moment, engaging in my
Bloodlust tonight
Now I can't control my venom's flow
Get back from me demon, or be exorcised

Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance upon you
Too chilling, more than I can tell
Burning, now I bring you hell

All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you've taken from me
All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you've taken from me

Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance upon you
Too chiiling, more than I can tell
Soul of the night
I know
Now I can't stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance upon you
Too chilling, more than I can tell
Burning, now I bring you hell
Ah ah
Oh burning, now I bring you hell
Ah ah
Oh burning, now I bring you hell
