I've watched the stars fall silent 
From your eyes
All the sights that I have seen

I can't believe that
I believed I wished
That you could see

There's a new planet
In the solar system
There is nothing up my sleeve 

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing out punchlines
That were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground 

In all this talk of time
Talk is fine
But I don't want to stay around

Why can't we pantomime
Just close our eyes
And sleep sweet dreams
Me and you with wings on our feet 

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing out punchlines
That were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground 

I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers
From the great beyond 

I want the hummingbirds
The dancing bears
Sweetest dreams of you
I look into the stars
I look into the moon 

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
