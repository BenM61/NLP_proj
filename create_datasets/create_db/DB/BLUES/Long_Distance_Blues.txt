Hello long distance
Put my baby on the line.
Hello long distance
Put my baby on the line.
I've got to talk to my girl
And tell her what I have on my mind.

I've never been so lonesome,
And I've never been so blue.
I've never been so lonesome,
And I ain't never felt so blue.
Its been a long time baby, 
Since I had a letter from you.

Well send me some money baby.
Please don't talk no trash.
Send me some money baby.
Please don't talk no trash.
What I need from you baby
Less talk, and a lot of cash.
