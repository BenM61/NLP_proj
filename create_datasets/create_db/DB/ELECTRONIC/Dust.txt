My hands are veiled with mud
and confusion
I'm carrying bitterness
and oblivion

I was a sparkling dust
I was living
Now bare feet on the pavement
I am wanderin

I get back on the edge
And I'm running
And standing on the ledge
I am blowing

I was a sparkling dust
I was living
Now bare feet on the pavement
I am wanderin
