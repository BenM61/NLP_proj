Walk your street
And I'll walk mine
And should we meet
Would you spare me some time?

'Cause you should see my world, meet my kind
Before you judge our minds

Blue collar

Sleep your sleep
I'm awake and alive
I keep late hours
You're nine to five

So I would like you know I need the quiet hours
To create in this world of mine

Blue collar

I'd like you to know at four in the morning
Things are coming mine
All I've seen, all I've done
And those I hope to find

I'd like to remind you at four in the morning, my world is very still
The air is fresh under diamond skies
Makes me glad to be alive

You keep that beat
And I keep time
Your restless face
Is no longer mine

I rest my feet while the world's in heat
And I wish that you could do the same

Blue collar
Ah, blue collar
