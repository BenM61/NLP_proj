My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed alone
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall it reminds me
That it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again and even if I'm there
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking
Through and through then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you, and even if my house falls
Down now, I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
