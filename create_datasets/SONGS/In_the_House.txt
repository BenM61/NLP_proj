In the house
They sleep and watch TV
Making up some words to say
Nobody hears
Nobody came
They never do
Rocking chairs and walls of blue
In the house
They sleep and watch TV

Tick, tick, ticking days away
Waiting to move out and get away
Tick, tick, ticking days away
Waiting to move out and get away

In the house
Empty heads roll down the stairway
Cupboards clean for all to see
Nobody cares
Who remembers what day it is?
Who remembers the way it was?
In the house
They sleep and watch TV

Tick, tick, ticking days away
Waiting to move out and get away
Tick, tick, ticking days away
Waiting to move out and get away
