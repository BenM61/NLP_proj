Full of syrup, bitch I'm leaning
Smoking dope with the demon
Send my younging at your little nigga give me a reason

Don't like the fact that now I'm blowing up, nigga get on your shit

Bitch I bought my own car, started my own dealership
Cruising down Florida with my burner leaning faded
To tell the truth, I don't know why these niggas hating

And I know these niggas plotting, so I don't smile up in they faces

Go with his move, bitch I dare them
Go with his move, bitch I dare them

And I don't go nowhere without that iron on me
This shit so cut throat my own niggas talking down on me
These niggas envy for no reason, I ain't got time for them
I'm out that gang and what I rep bitch I stand on it
And I don't go nowhere without that iron on me
This shit so cut throat my own niggas talking down on me
These niggas envy for no reason, I ain't got time for them
I'm out that gang and what I rep bitch I stand on it

For so long I've been slept on, got to make them believe me
Just bought a Glock up out the north, so that's them shots off the 3's
Got the law up on my ass, demons up in my dreams
Andy Gaulden was my uncle, robbin' shit in my genes
Nigga I'll prove it while you assuming

Brand new rod for my younging for whoever wanna do me
With this beef shit, I don't stop like Q-Red bitch I'm producing
.33 let me hold the Glock, I'm just waiting for the Uzi, pussy

But that's how the game go, they gon' talk
You know I ain't do nothing but turn up, niggas gon' hate
Bitch ass nigga get your money up gang
