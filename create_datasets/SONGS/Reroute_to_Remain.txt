It started as a whisper
Now try to dodge this roar
Unified, the most forceful way to go

Waste this one
It's up to you
We need this revolution

Destroy the pattern
Anything that separates
Across the times 
Who dares to follow

For years we wandered these circles
Hold onto whatever lie gets us through

Design new latitudes
Find ways to channel bliss
Us defined, it's too fragile to neglect
Reroute to Remain
Reroute to Remain

Never want, to look back in greed
Can I please have your attention?

There are mountains to cross
For all that are willing
There a never ending treasures
That await you
