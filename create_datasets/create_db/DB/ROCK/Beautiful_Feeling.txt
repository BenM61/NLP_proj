Can you see, can you see?
The colors on your wall,
Reality's much different now,
The answers at your call.
Like a tiny infant,
Care with every step.

Moving through this fantasy,
Now gamble, place your bets.
Don't stop this trip,
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip,
'Cause I don't wanna grip.

Brain is frying hard now,
Hallucinations wild.
Curiosity's growing,
Like a feeble child.

You think you know about what I am,
You can say I'm just like them
My brain is burning, can't you see?

'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip.
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip.
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
Don't stop this trip.
'Cause I don't wanna grip.
