I've been looking for you
Searching for something new
You keep my feet on the ground
As you make my world turn around

Keep sending me signals
Don't let me fall by the way
And while the world
Is turning right

You show me the way
To your heart
'Cause when you call my name
It's like the worlkd
Is turning right...

Burrkuwurrkumi
Raywa raywa raywuyuwa
Wirrkul madayin
Gaywagaywa gaywagaywa
Ditjuman nyaku gayawak
Raliya dhambal ngayili

And while the world
Is turning right
You show me the way
To your heart

'Cause when you call my name
It's like the world
Is turning right...
Come on show me the way

There is no turning back
It's turning right
Well it's turning right...
I've been looking for you

Searching for something new
You keep my feet on the ground
As you make my world turn around
Keep sending me signals

Dopn't let me fall by the way
And while the world
Is turning right
You show me the way

To your heart
'Cause when you call my name
It's like the world
Is turning right...
