sends has a little photograph that she shot in the nude 
she doesn't wear a conciounse 
she doesn't play by rules 

so turn me on baby everynight 
and in the daytime too 
i feel like flyin'on an airplane(?) 
like some clueless fool 

there goes that melancholy feeln' again 
it looks like love is gonna find a way 
hey, hey, hey 
and when you start believn' in it 
it looks like love is gonna show it's face 
hey, hey, hey, heyy 

i got some things to show her 
i take her to my room 
she likes to eath that chocolate 
she likes to sit on it to? 

she turns me on baby everynight 
and in the daytime too 
i feel like flyin' on an airplane(?) 
like some clueless fool 

there goes that melancholy feeln' again 
it looks like love is gonna find a way 
hey, hey, hey 
when you start believn' in it 
it looks like love is gonna show it's face 
hey, hey, hey, heyy 

and when you start believn' in it 
it looks like love is gonna show it's face 
hey, hey, hey, heyy
