Everyday
Everyday I have the blues
Everyday
Everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' woman, honey, it's you I hate to lose

Nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Yes, nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Speaking of worries and trouble darling, you know I've had my share

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday
Everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' woman, honey, it's you I hate to lose

Every day, everyday I have the blues
Every day, everyday I have the blues 
When you see me worryin' woman, baby, it's you I hate to lose
