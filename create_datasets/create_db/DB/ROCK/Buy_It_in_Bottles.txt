Baby come on, come on down
And love please don't make a sound
Let nature strike a chord
'cause nature is the Lord that I depend

When you learn to cut it loose
All the things that've been drowning you
Let 'em slide from your hands
The foolish demands from the people round you

I know you can buy it in bottles and
I know you may find it with prayer
I know it all so very well

Until I get there then
I'll be looking for the sense
You can meet me where I am
And here I stand, and here I stay

I know you can buy it in bottles and
I know you may find it with pills
I know it all so very well

Stuck in this life where nothing changes
I'm born of man, I'm born of ages

I know you can buy it in bottles and
I know you may find it with prayer
I know it all so very well

I know you can buy it in bottles and
I know you may find it with pills
I know it all so very well

Until I get there then (4x)
