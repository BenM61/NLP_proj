High school parties are over
Things won't be the same
The day to grow up finally came
Graduation's here
Graduation

Our trips to the ocean
Were so much fun
Remember the games we almost won
Graduation's here

Our senior year and our one big sin
Was the "senior skip" when we were all turned in
The gaudy mischief had to come but now it's gotta go
'cause graduation's here and we'll soon be on our own

Bah-oodo-doo-dahm, doo-dahm, doo-dahm
Doo doddy doddy dahm
Graduation, graduation, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, graduation

Now we are walking down the aisle
I cry inside but I'm trying to smile 
Goodbye friends, alma mater too
Graduation's here
