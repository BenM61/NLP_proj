Yes I'm leavin' tomorrow
Yes I'm goin' back home
I'm tired of your cheatin'
I'm tired of you're doin' me wrong
I'm tired of you're doin' me wrong
I'm tired of you're doin' me wrong
That's why I'm leavin'
That's why I'm goin' back home
You promised me love
But all you gave me was pain
No one understand
But I'm a lonely man
Yes I'm a lonely man
Yes I'm a lonely man
That's why I'm leavin'
Ain't that a shame
Yes I'm leavin' tomorrow
Yes I'm goin' back home
I'm tired of your cheatin'
I'm tired of you're doin' me wrong
I'm tired of you're doin' me wrong
I'm tired of you're doin' me wrong
That's why I'm leavin'
That's why I'm goin' back home
