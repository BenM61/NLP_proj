She read me the note he left on her bed
Snuck in her room right after she left
And put petals on the ground
Her head on his shoulder, they walked down the hall
I'm left to wonder will I ever fall in love
Where is he now

Shes with him
I'm in the back seat
Know its not right but it hurts when they're laughing
I've never been
Where they are 

I wanna be blown away
I wanna be swept of my feet
I wanna meet the one that makes it hard for me to breathe
I wanna be lost in love
I wanna be a dream come true
Wanna be scared of how strong I feel for you
Just call me beautiful
Call me beautiful
Call me beautiful 
Call me b-e-a-utiful

Friday night she wore his jersey to the game
In the front row screaming out his name
As he turns to her and smiles
Everywhere I look people holdin' hands
When am I gonna get my chance at love
My chance at love 

Shes with him
I'm still hurting
Try to pretend but its not working
I just wanna be
Where they are

My heart is waiting for your love
My hand is waiting for your touch
My lips just wanna be kissed by you

I wanna be blown away
I wanna be swept of my feet
I wanna meet the one that makes it hard for me to breathe
I wanna be lost in love
I wanna be a dream come true
Wanna be scared of how strong I feel for you
Just call me beautiful
Call me beautiful
Call me beautiful 
Call me b-e-a-utiful
Beautiful
Call me beautiful
Call me beautiful 
Call me b-e-a-utiful 

Know it's not right but it hurts when there laughing
