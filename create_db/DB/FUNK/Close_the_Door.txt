Close the door
Let me give you what you've been waiting for 
Baby I got so much love to give
I want to give it all to you

Close the door
No need to worry no more
Let's bring this day to a pleasant end 
Girl it's me and you now
I've waited all day long just to hold you in my arms
And it's exactly like I thought it would be 
Me loving you and you loving me 

Close the door 
Let me rub your back where you say it's sore
Come on get closer 
So close to me
Let's get lost in each other
Come here baby

I've waited all day long just to hold you in my arms
And it's exactly like I thought it would be 
Me loving you and you loving me 

Close the door baby 
And let me know you're mine
Plenty good lovin' all through the night 
And then again and then again 
When the morning comes
