In a cold unforgiving world, alone with fear and weakness, 
Oppressed and dying slowly. 
Countless people have been
Betrayed by life. 

No one is exempt. 
No one is safe. 
So many lives will be taken. 
So many lives have been ruined. 
So 
Many live hang is balance. 
So many lives will be lost. 
Betrayed by life. 
Betrayed by life.

As survivors we are left to mend their wounds. 
We are left to dry their tears. 
We are left to pick up the pieces of those who have been betrayed by 
Life.
