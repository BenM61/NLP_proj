Woman you must be stone down crazy
Either you're going to lose your mind
Yes I said baby you must be stone crazy
Either you're going to lose your mind
Yes I wanna know how could you treat me so dirty baby
You must think my little heart is made of iron

Lord as I sit here in my dark room
Tears rolling down from my eyes
Yes I sit, I sit here in my dark room
Tears rolling all down from my eyes
Yes you know my little baby looked at me and said daddy
Ooh, God knows you're the hurted child

Oh yeah
Somebody come and get me

Yes I think I'm going back down south
People where the weather suits my clothes
Yes I said I'm going back down south
People where the weather suits my clothes
Yes you know playing around in this big city so long man
Ooh, 'til I'm almost just done froze
