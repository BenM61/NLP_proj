Makes my hair stand up on end,
Something alien happening,
Sychronize but don't comprehend,
'Cause where I stop that's where you begin!

Another moment I commit,
A pleasure as I'm gonna' take the hit,
And I'm addicted to the state you're in,
'Cause you're getting me out of it!

Wasted, there's nothing gonna ace this,
And were gonna go to space it,
'Cause I'm leaving with an astronaut!

Groovin' out to X-ray specs,
Something tells me your the alien sex,
I can't imagine now what comes next,
When this astronaut connects!

Coming on when I touch your skin,
A kinda' strange light you emit,
I hear you're gravity pull me in,
Now your getting me out of it!

Wasted, there's nothing gonna ace this,
And were gonna go to space it,
'Cause I'm leaving with an astronaut!

There, feat for quantum leap,
Because space is hot and deep,
And we follow giant footprints,
As we fall in, falling like the twins,
Through Saturn's holy rings,
And if they can't hold us, where it's gonna end up,
Anybody knows
