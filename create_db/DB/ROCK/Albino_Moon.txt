You look real good in your blue jeans
And a pink sweater
But in a cocktail dress I guess
You look even better
I got your photographs 
And the memories lined up on the table
But you're gone with the wind
And I wish I was dead
Just like Clark Gable

The sun goes down for a lonely fool
Like darkness in the temple of doom
I need a guiding light
Tell me What am I supposed to do...

Albino Moon
Where you been tonight?
Hidin' behind a cloud
Albino Moon...

Albino Moon
What's it all about?
Hidin' behind a cloud
Albino Moon...

Am I blind or am I right
Pour your light into my room
Make my baby find her way back home real soon
Albino Moon

Put your red lips on my daydream
Imagine we're together
In the back-seat of my car
On the shiny white leather..
I got your photographs
And the memories lined up on the table
But you're gone with the wind
And I wish I was dead
Just like Clark Gable

The sun goes down for a lonely fool
Like darkness in the temple of doom
I need a guiding light
Tell me...What am I supposed to do...

Albino Moon
Where you been tonight?
Hidin' behind a cloud
Albino Moon...

Albino Moon
What's it all about?
Hidin' behind a cloud
Albino Moon...
