T e (Tennessee) 
Double n e (Tennessee)
Double s now double e 
Now spell that out for me
No matter where I be
Everybody say it loud for me
Rock from state to state 
Still remain my home plate

Bonafides my name
To change the games my aim
Gone break the chain and steak my claim
While putting Nashville all on the brain
With a twist of the mid south twang
And a little bita bounce to bang
Gone feed the soul and crowd the floors
And take control and break the mold
Kick the doors and spit the flows
We in the pros what you ain't know
Cause round here they caddy roll
With gold grills and twenty wheels
On Jefferson at Mary ribs
Bounce to this from state to fisk
We keep it hot for every spot
Been round the world done seen a lot
To all the boys out on the block
Got love for y'all for real dog
You the reason I'm here at all
And took the call to break the fall
And show the way from where I stay
In Tennessee boy the dirty south bwoy

65 south ridin' dirty window down open mouth
Spirit stirred off the sermon I just heard that's my word
Dipped and doused
Awakened quickly mold me shape me but first strip,
Hold me take me to extremes in my reside 
Though it seems I'm so beside
Myself in this state I'm place in open the box my fate
Encased in break the seal and let me out
In Tennessee that's what I'm talkin' bout
Now I'm here not much can stop me you
A supporter if you got this copy now show dem
Pearlies boys and girlies buff and burlies straight
And curlies no surprises, where we at got all shapes 
And sizes put on the brakes remove all disguises 
Erupt like geysers, sound off one time (wooh)
Whether sadistic legalistic outcast, or misfit
Fortun
