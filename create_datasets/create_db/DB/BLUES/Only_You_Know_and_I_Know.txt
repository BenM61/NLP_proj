Only you know and I know
All the love we've got to show,
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings.

'Cause you know that I mean what I say,
So don't go and take me the wrong way.
You know you can't go on getting your own way,
'Cause if you do, it's going to get you someday.

I don't mean to mislead you,
It's just my craziness coming through.
But when it comes down to just two,
I ain't no crazier than you.

Only you know and I know
All the love we've got to show,
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings.

Yeah yeah yeah, you don't need to be pleasing.
No no no, not deceiving.
But it's hard to believe in
When you've been so mistreated.

Only you know and I know
All the love we've got to show,
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings.

Only you know and I know.
Only you know and I know.
