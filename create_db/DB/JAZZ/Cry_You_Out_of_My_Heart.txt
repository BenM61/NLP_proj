I don't know why
We're saying goodbye
But you say it's best we should part
I'm gonna hurrying you out of my mind
And cry you out of my heart

I thought that you would always be true
But I was mistaken it seems
I'm gonna worrying you out of my mind
And cry you out of my dreams

I try to pretend this isn't the end
But that's not so easy I find
I should gay and call it day
But you know me the sentimental kind

Somebody new means heaven to you
You're leaving to make a new start
I'm gonna hurrying you out of my mind
And cry you out of my heart

I try to pretend this isn't the end
But that's not so easy I find
I should gay and call it day
But you know me the sentimental kind

Somebody new means heaven to you
You're leaving to make a new start
I'm gonna hurrying you out of my mind
And cry you out of my heart
