Step aside.
Step aside.
The krewe's gonna take a ride.
Better stand behind the barricade.
Here comes, here comes, here comes
The big parade.

So make way.
So make way.
That's what the captain say.
Down St. Charles and Esplanade,
Here comes
The big parade.

"Throw me somethin', mister."
I want to dance with your sister.
Brass bands marchin by.
Throwing notes to the sky.

There goes...
There goes
Second-liners and flambeaus.
I'm feelin' even better
Than the day was made.
Here comes...
Here comes...
Here comes
The big parade.
