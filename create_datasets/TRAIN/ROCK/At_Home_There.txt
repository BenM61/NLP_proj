I'm slippin through the trees
Of amininaty
The voices in between
The wild will set me free
Sun is on the shine
Rain is on my mind
Everything's alright 
When I'm home there
I'm at home there
The feeling has begun
For the children of the sun
The river is my life
You may be turn the one
Sun is on the shine
Rain is on my mind
Everything's alright
When I'm home there
I'm at home there
An soy ve an vi lie
A hume va say lae rueva
Rueva
Na list an hist lae rueva
Pwonunindua ua
Mamo sof no sof rua
Bomo sof lua
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So nigh
