I been born and I been tired
All those cold songs
Can't let me cry
Like a of a song

I populated half the city, child
But I still can't find no love
Somebody pass the haling
From block to block

Ain't no way that I could stay here
There she goes, her arms toward home
To glory

My city 
What have you heard me been?
But there ain't no love in here
Better hide, understand?

Hack my pain in
I'm not passing up
I just can't get it good, heart
This ain't enough

Ain't no way that I could stay here
There she goes, her arms toward home
To glory

I know that it's time
For this city of mine
Troubled by let me hold the
Let me hold her, let me hold her

Let let let me hold her
