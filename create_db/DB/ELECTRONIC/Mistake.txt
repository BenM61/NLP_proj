[Repeat x2]
Don't speak to me this way 
Don't ever let me say 
Don't leave me again [Repeat x2]
I never felt this loss before 
And the world is closing doors 
I never wanted anything more 

[Repeat x2]
Don't hug me this way 
Don't touch me this way 
Don't hug me again [Repeat x2]
Don't hug me this way 
Don't touch me this way 
Don't hug me this again

I never felt this loss before 
And the world is closing doors 
I never wanted anything more 
Don't let me make the same mistake again 
Please, don't let me make the same mistake again 
Don't let me make the same mistake again 
I never felt this loss before 
And the world is closing doors 
I never wanted anything more 
Please, don't let me make the same mistake again [Repeat x2]
