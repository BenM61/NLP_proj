Two hands
I wanna play the piano with two hands
Shoulda learned
To ask of many its the way of the world
Boy who you wanna here to me
You gave me a piano with all 88 keys
But two hands
Whats it gonna do
With two hands
To make the money like the richest of man
Whats a guy to do
With two hands
I can make you be so good to me
Give me all the time with my sexuality

So clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
And the beats so hard, your workin workin

Two hands
What your supposed to do with two hands
To get the life of the richest of man
Where you supposed to go with two hands
I can not but something in between
When im breaking my back and im on my knees

So clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
And the beats so hard, your workin workin

And I cant escape from the work in LA
And I cant sleep in my bed and your gay (not sure on the word "gay" here)
And clap your hands if your workin to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard

You see life and its falling awayayay
Your slow down and the rest makes you payayay
I see you lookin up
You want to think about it

Clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
Clap your hands if your working to hard
And the beats so hard, your workin workin

And I cant escape from the work in LA
And I cant sleep in my bed and your gay
And clap your hands if your workin to hard
Clap your hands if your workin to hard
