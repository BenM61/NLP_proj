In a time where the sun descends alone,
I ran a long long way from home
to find a heart that's made out of stone.

I will try,
I just need a little time
to get your face right out of my mind,
to see the world through different eyes

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Tell me why?
When I scream there's no reply,
when I reach out there's nothing to find,
when I sleep I break down and cry

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Fading like a rose,
fading like a rose,
beaten by the storm,
talking to myself,
getting washed by the rain,
it's such a cold cold town.
