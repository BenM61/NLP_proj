You strike get pissed that is just the way it is use your
nose to the melancholy funk sound we are just a couple
of local bowlers hangin' out tonight leavin' all the girls
behind. 

So what's a girl compared to a perfect game I guess a lot
if you find the right one if I had to choose between a bowl
and you I'm not tellin' you you're taking it the wrong way 

I love the feeling that I get when I strike that's the only
time I feel alive don't need you babe just need to strike I
love the feeling that I get when I strike 

You are in trance when you slick into the area you pass
the sa when you're taking off your pumas the way we
bowl is cleaner then the other styles it's pro but they say
we're doin' it the wrong way. 

So I guess you must be crazy to be bowlin' like we do it's
cool we're doin' it our own way no fools no girls just the
rude boys from the south kickin' it slickin' it trickin' it
again. 

Yes that's right bowlin' is allright the only time I feel alive
is when I'm hangin' at the A-house that's right pass me
those shoes I'm ready for the perfect game so watch me
shoot. 

If you get upset and you don't understand it's quite
allright just follow your instincts physical activity is the
way to free your mind so get on your feet and bowl to the
funky beat.
