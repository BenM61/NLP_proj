Could it be forever or is my mind just rambling on
Well I touched you once and I kissed you once 
And I feel like you're mine
Well I feel like you're mine and I see in your face 
I'm not wrong to have these feelings
Well I feel like you're mine and I've never known a time before
That's had so many meanings
Could it be forever or is my mind just wasting time
Well I don't think so because you let me know
You make me feel like you're mine
Well I feel like you're mine and I can't remember
When the feelings have been stronger
And all I know is I can't let go of you
Or be with you just a little while longer
All my feelings come together
All I need is here
Never know when I felt better
'Cause I know this won't disappear
Could it be forever or is my mind just rambling on
Well maybe it is and if it is I'll just be moving along
Well I feel like you're mine and I see in your face
I'm not wrong to have these feelings
Well I feel like you're mine and I've never known a time before
That's had so many meanings
