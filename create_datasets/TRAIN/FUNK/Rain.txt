Take off your topcoats
Put on your raincoats
And now give up your birthright
And don't you cry
'Cause in 23 verses now
A storm is a-comin'
And you'll be too surprised
To wonder why
And it will
Rain rain
Go away, go away
Rain rain
Come back again another day
Step out your cool suit
Snap on you wet boots
And now eat all you mushrooms
Until you see
That in 22 verses now
A storm is a-brewin'
And you'll be too annoyed
For victory
'Cause it will
Rain rain
Go away, go away
Rain rain
Come back again another day
China glass &
A chocolate bar
I'm leaving behind
So my children's children
Children's children
Will see what's left of me
Cue up the James Brown
And jack up the funky sound now
Say it won't be the last time
You hear a scream
'Cause in 21 verses now
A storm is a-ragin'
And you will satisfy your destiny
And it will
Rain rain
Go away, go away
Rain rain
Come back again another day
