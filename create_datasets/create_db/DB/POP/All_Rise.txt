Your honor please
Gotta believe what I say
What I will tell
Happened just the other day

I must confess
Cause I've had about enough
I need your help
Gotta make this here thing stop

Baby I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now objection overruled

Here we go, oh baby

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lies that you denied
All rise, all rise
Three for the calls you've been making
Four for the times you've been faking
All rise, all rise (I'm gonna tell it o your face I rest my case)

You're on the stand
With your back against the wall
Nowhere to run
And nobody you can call oh no
I just can't wait
Now the case is open wide
You'll try to pray
But the jury will decide

Baby I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now objection overruled

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lies that you denied
All rise, all rise
Three for the calls you've been making,
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise, all rise (I'm gonna tell it o your face I rest my case)

So step back 'cause you don't know this cat
I know deep down that
You don't want me to react
I lay low
Leaving all my options open
The decision of the jury
Has not been spoken
Step in my house
You find that your stuff has gone
But in reality to whom
Does the stuff belong?
I bring you into court
To preach my order
And you know that
You overstep the border

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lies that you denied
All rise, all rise
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise, all rise

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lies that you denied
All rise, all rise
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise, all rise

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lies that you denied
All rise, all rise
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise, all rise (I'm gonna tell it o your face I rest my case)
