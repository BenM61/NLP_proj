You used to be a partner in crime
Now you say you ain't got the time 

Gotta get serious, gotta plan
Gotta pass those entrance exams
Oh my God
It's senior year
All you care about is your career 

It's a Life Sentence
It's a Life Sentence
It's a Life Sentence
It's a Life Sentence 

You're squelching your emotions
All you talk about is old times
You don't do what you want to
But you do the same thing everyday 

No sense of humor
But such good manners
Now you're an adult
You're boring 

It's a Life Sentence
It's a Life Sentence
It's a Life Sentence
It's a Life Sentence 

The walls are closing in
You stayed too long in school
I'd rather stay a child
And keep my self-respect
If being an adult
Means being like you 

Are you really you you you
You you you you you you
Are you really you?
No 

You're a chained-up dog fenced in a yard
Don't see much, you can't go far
Pace and froth, you're getting sick
Run too fast and it'll snap your neck 

You say you'll break out
But you never do
You're just another ant in the hill
That's your Life Sentence
