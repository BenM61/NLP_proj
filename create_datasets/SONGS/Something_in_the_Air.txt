There's something strange going on right here
I can't explain what's going on right here
There's that look to every street
And my heart just skipped a beat
I feel like there's someone watching
And I feel like there's someone listening
I'm all alone, and the night surrounds me
But I feel that something's found me

There's something in the air
And girl, you drive me wild
You can turn me on all night
Something in the air
You treat me like a child
You can lead me on all night

There's a touch I've never felt before
There's a song I've never heard before
There's a light in every window
And a fire behind every door
I feel like there's someone watching
And I feel like there's someone listening
I'm with you, and your warmth surrounds me
And I feel that love has found me

Something in the air
And girl, you drive me wild
You can turn me on all night
Something in the air
You treat me like a child
You can lead me on all night
