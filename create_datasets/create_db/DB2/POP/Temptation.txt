Sex
Temptation
Lust
Pop go mama

Everybody on this earth has got a vice
And mine, little darlin', mine is the opposite of ice
Mine is the running hot water of the daughter of morality
In other words, this little prince thinks a lot about you, see?
Baby, baby, baby
I'm guilty in the first degree

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Everybody in this room
Everybody in this room has got an urge
What's yours, baby?
Mine is temptation, it reigns at a party where lovers splurge
Pop go mama when daddy gets a little to much
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Purple electricity whenever our bodies touch
Ooh baby, I love it when our bodies touch

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Temptation, temptation, temptation

Wait a minute now

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Temptation
Working my body, working my body, working my body

Temptation
I'm not talkin' about just ordinary temptation, people
I'm talking about the kind of temptation that'll make you do things
Oh, oh, temptation
Oh, darling, I can almost taste the wetness between your
Temptation, temptation
I'm not talking about any ol' kind of temptation, people, I'm talkin'
About, I'm talkin' about, sexual temptation
A lover
I need a lover, a lover, I need a, right now
You, I want you
I want you in the worst way
I want you

Oh, silly man, that's not how it works
You have to want her for the right reasons
I do!

"You don't, now die!"

No! No!

Let me go, let me go

I'm sorry
I'll be good
This time I promise
Love is more important than sex
Now I understand
I have to go now
I don't know when I'll return
Good-bye
