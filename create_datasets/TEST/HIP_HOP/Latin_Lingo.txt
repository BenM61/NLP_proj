Freak to the funk that no one else is bringin'
Sen Dog with the funky biluingi

Yeah that's the nombre
Heard that holmie
Peace to Mellow and Frost and neca cote

Sen Dog is not a kid a veterano
I'm down, another briday's follow
One of the many of the Latins that straight I know
And I got plenty for the Jenny's Alexandro

But wait, they're clownin' on me 'cause of my language
I have to tell 'em straight up, it's called Spanglish

My hoes on the pinga the gringo
Tryin' to get paid, for the funky bilingo

Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
Yeah funky bilingo
Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
It's the Latin lingo

Cuarto hentro when I come in
Suckers runnin'

La mida
Another bilingo vam beaner

Then a cueno hemplo
Check the tempo
Whaaa, it's tachingonla instrumental

Yeah woofte, como somos
Yo no hotho, I got some sodos

And you can hear it in la skunkas
Tribal ceremony as the Hill gets stronger

Don't be such a liver what ya got for that cavesa
Aye holmes pass the cerveza
Before I have to go and push up on your reza
Mmmm, she's fine something freska
Ya holmes, have a hit of this yeska

Teach yo y sin yo
The lingo lo puento
Now you know, that I am in the centro

Where ya live, see the cuertes
Now I thinks you ain't shit without your quinte

Something like a skang thang
Vactos gettin' bang banged
'Cause I hung out with 'em now you're callin' me an insane

Suck it mi cara santa mi Camino
Make way for the funky bilingual

Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
Funky bilinguals holmes
Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
It's the Latin lingo baby
Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
Funky bilingo

What's up holmie, don't you know me
Simon, ain't you the brother of the mas pincos

Straight up and down with the rasa
The Kid Frost got my back, boo-ya in la casa

'Cause everyday things get a little crazier
As I step to the microphone area

As I comb my city burro Los Angeles
You know holmes, that's where the callas is

Vactos waitin' on me along with the heinas
Catchin' all the swiffer when I set your one timer

So when you see me at the party or the paile
Before I got here I was gaffled in the carre

True like govacho who said I was borracho
Had an attitude tried to play me macho

Just relax, el mado mijo
Sen Dog with the funky bilingo

Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
Funky bilingual
Funky
Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
Funky bilingo
Funky
Latin lingo baby
Funky bilingo
Funky bilingo
Funky baby
