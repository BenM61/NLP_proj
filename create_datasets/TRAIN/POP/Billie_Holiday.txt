Hey, I can't hear what you say
And I got lost in a maze
The world got swallowed by the place

How, I'm standing hearing your name
You're moving to the sound of a train
That Carrie Billie Holliday away

And when the sun shines down, it shines on both of us
And when the storm falls down, it falls too high to touch
And you say that you can't get away
But the night is just enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

You, don't look so confused
It's all been dressed to be improved
I guess i don't read the news

Here haven't think of disguise
And see the stone blast in your eyes
But don't say I never try

And when the sun shines down, it shines on both of us
And when the storm falls down, it falls too high to touch
And you say that you can't get away
But the night is just enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
