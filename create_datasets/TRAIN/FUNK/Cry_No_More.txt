You know what this is already, man
It's something quite phenomenal, man
Your boy, Dark child, Def Jam, DTP, let's go

I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
And I can't keep thinking about you
Too many things in my mind beside you
I seen things deeper than you, and
I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
Over all the times you play me
Over all the stress and mess I don't need
Over all the stuff that hurt me and
I just can't cry no more

Now there you go just buggin' out
That's why I'm so through with you
Can't be playing games with you
Because the craziness come with you
And I just hate it
You'll never stop to think about all hardship I done seen
People shot in front of me
And I thought you change everything
But you playing the same, and I...

I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
And I can't keep thinking about you
Too many things in my mind beside you
I seen things deeper than you, and
I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
Over all the time you play me
Over all the stress and mess I don't need
Over all the stuff that hurt me, and
I just can't cry no more cause I'm
Over you, you, you, you
Over you, you, you, you
Over you, you, you, you
Just can't cry no more

Now every time I think about all things you put me through
What was I suppose to do?
I was in love with you
And I was falling
And you know what you was doing to me
When them broads would run their mouth
How you have them up in my house
You don't deserve me
Shut your mouth
Save the talk, I'm out, and I...

I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you (cry no more)
And I can't keep thinking about you (I'm so over you)
Too many thing in my mind beside you (mind beside you, yeah)
I seen things deeper than you, and
I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you (just can't cry no more)
Over all the time you play me (play me)
Over all the stress and mess I don't need (don't need)
Over all that stuff that hurt me

(And I could never be) I could never be sucker woman who scorn
I've been fighting heavy since the day I was born
(Baby, I'm a rider) 'cause, baby, I'm a rider
I'm a soul survivor
(Oh yeah) I could never be sucker woman who scorn
I've been fighting heavy since the day I was born
('Cause, baby girl's a rider) 
'Cause, baby girl's a rider
(And I'm a soul survivor) 
I'm a soul survivor

I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you 
(I just can't cry no more, nigga, I'm over you)
And I can't keep thinking about you 
(See, I hardly think about you)
Too many things in my mind beside you
I seen things deeper than you 
(I seen things deeper than you)
And I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you 
(I'm not gonna cry no more)
Over all the time you play me ('cause I'm walking out that door)
Over all the stress and mess I don't need ('cause I can't keep crying)
Over all that stuff that hurt me and (it feels like I'm dying)
I just can't cry no more cause I'm
Over you, you, you, you (I can't see it coming down my eyes)
Over you, you, you, you (So, I gotta make the song cry)
Over you, you, you, you (No more sleepless night over you, baby)
Just can't cry no more cause I'm...

Over you, you, you, you
Over you, you, you, you
Over you, you, you, you
Just can't cry no more 'cause I'm
Over you, you, you, you
Over you, you, you, you
Over you, you, you, you
