Burned down on the boulevard
Livin' so fast and sweet and hard
Don't cha try and shoot me down
Don't intend to stick around

Gotta move, move on down the road
Gotta move, move on down the road

It's a gas when you got the dice
Been to heaven maybe once or twice
Lookin' for love but love don't last
Got no time for no candy-ass

Gotta move, move on down the road
Gotta move, move on down the road
Well come on, I got time for makin' love

Gotta move, gotta move on down the road
Gotta move, gotta move on down the road
Gotta move, gotta move on down the road
Gotta move, gotta move on down the road

Come on, give me some Motown love
Come on, got time for makin' love
Come on, got time for makin' love
Well come on, got time for makin' love
Come on, come on, come on
