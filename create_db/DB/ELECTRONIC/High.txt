When you're close to tears remember 
Some day it'll all be over 
One day 'we're gonna get so high 
And though it's darker than December 
What's ahead is a different colour 
One day 'we're gonna get so high 

And at 
The end of the day 
We'll remember the days 
We were close to the edge 
And we'll wonder how we made it through 
And at 
The end of the day 
We'll remember the way 
We stayed so close to till the end 
We'll remember it was me and you 

'Cause we are gonna be forever you and me 
You'll always keep me flying high in the sky of love 

Don't you think it's time you started 
Doing what we always wanted 
One day 'we're gonna get so high 
'Cause even the impossible is easy 
When we got each other 
One day 'we're gonna get so high 

And at 
The end of the day 
We'll remember the days 
We were close to the edge 
And we'll wonder how we made it through 
And at 
The end of the day 
We'll remember the way 
We stayed so close to till the end 
We'll remember it was me and you 

'Cause we are gonna be forever you and me 
You will always keep me flying high in the sky of love 

High, high, high, high...
