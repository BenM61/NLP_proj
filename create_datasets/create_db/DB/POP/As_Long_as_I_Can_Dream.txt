When this world that I see
Is too hard to take
And too much for me
And everything's in blue,
When the rain's pouring down
And I can't find the sun,
It don't mean the sun can't be found
It always comes through
There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
That can't find the day
As long as I can dream,
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
I see it shining
And in my dreams, I see
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
As long as I can dream
In my heart, there's a place
Where there's always hope
And always a way
To make it through the night
And in my soul, I believe
If I just have faith,
Then I will be free
I'll be alright
There's not a soul that's lost (not a soul)
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
That can't find the day
As long as I can dream,
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
I see it shining
And in my dreams, I see
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
As long as I can dream
(Na na na na na na
Na na na na na) Oh yeah
(Na na na na na)
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na, oh-ohhhhhhhhhh
There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
As long as I can dream, (as long as I can dream)
There's a better world
I can see it shining on me
(In my dreams, I see) In my dreams, I see, yeah
There's a better world
As long as I can dream
(There's a better world, there's a better world)
And I can see it (I see it shining), yes, it's shining on me
(In my dreams, I see) In my dreams, I see
(There's a better world)
Just as long as I can dream
As long as I can dream,
I see a better world
As long as I can dream
When rain is pouring down,
It don't mean the sun can't be found
As long as I can dream
