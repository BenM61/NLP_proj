Folks love to talk of the good, good old days
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Well, they say it was better in oh, so many ways
Long, long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight

And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute in a bikini suit

Oh, how they sing of the good, good old days
Long, long ago, long, long ago
They couldn't swing in the good, good old days
Long long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
(But they still talk of the good, good old days)
And on a very cold and wintery night
(Long, long ago, long, long ago)
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight

So when people say to me, "Nothing's like it used to be"
(They say it was better in so many ways)
I don't believe that it's so
(Long, long ago, long, long ago)
They didn't have so much to brag about
Long, long ago, long, long ago, long, long ago
