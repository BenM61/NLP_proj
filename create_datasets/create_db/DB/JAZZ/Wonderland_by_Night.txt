Stars hang suspended above a floating yellow moon
Two hearts were blended while angels sang a lovers tune
And so we kissed not knowing if our hearts could pay the price
But heaven welcomed us to paradise blessing our love

Then came the sunrise fading the moon and stars from sight
Recalling always our wonderland by night

Recalling always our wonderland by night.
