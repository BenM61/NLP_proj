Damn girl's gone crazy
All these good-looking blues
Banshees with bad skin
Coming home to roost

Boxed into flying
Scratching out birds
Fed a diet of sharp knives
Earthworms and dirt

Damn girl's gone crazy
All these good-looking blues
Banshees with bad skin
Coming home to roost

Fishing with bare hands
Coming up dry
Branches without roots
Cover my sky
