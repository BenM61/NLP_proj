For 27 years I've been trying
To believe and confide in
Different people I found

Some of them got closer than others
And some wouldn't even bother
And then you came around

I didn't really know what to call you
You didn't know me at all
But I was happy to explain

I never really knew how to move you
So I tried to intrude through
The little holes in your veins
And I saw you

But that's not an invitation!
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you, but I don't know
How to connect
So I disconnect

You always seem to know where to find me
And I'm still here behind you
In the corner of your eye

I'll never really learn how to love you
But I know that I love you
Through the hole in the sky
Where I see you

And that's not an invitation!
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect
So I disconnect

Well, this is an invitation!
It's not a threat
If you want communication
That's what you get
I'm talking and talking
But I don't know

How to connect

And I hold
A record for being patient
With your kind of hesitation

I need you, you want me
But I don't know
How to connect
So I disconnect
I disconnect
