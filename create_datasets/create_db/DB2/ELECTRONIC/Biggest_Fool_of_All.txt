My excuse is only human 
Like any animal that breathes 
Just to find a scent that's soothing 
I give you power over me 

I'm more weak than strong 
And not a stranger to a fall 
But I won't leave you 
Till I turn to find you gone 
I'm the biggest fool of all 

There's no path of least resistance 
It's a fable that you've heard 
Any love that lacks conviction 
Is gonna grovel in the dirt 
God this road is long 
And surrounded by a wall 
But I won't leave you 
'Til I turn to find you gone 
I'm the biggest fool of all 

Foolish as the prisoner 
That listens for the jangling keys 
And smart enough to know 
That it's crazy I should run 
When you've got no claim on me 

So before your panic taunts you 
To make relations disappear 
You could help to ease my conscience 
If just for once by standing here 
I'm more weak than strong 
And surrounded by a wall 
But I won't leave you 
'Til I turn to find you gone 
I'm the biggest fool of all
