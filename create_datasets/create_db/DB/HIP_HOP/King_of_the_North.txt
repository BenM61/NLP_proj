King! King! King! King! King! King!

Ladies and Gentlemen
Right now you're listening to the King of the North
Yo
Can I get a clap please?
Can I have the bell start ringing?
Can we have the ladies singing?
'Cause this one gotta be right
And this isn't a funeral
So you can take the black clothes off
Can everyone switch their phones off?
I'm gonna celebrate life
Is that the horns that's sounding?
Oh, so he's not got long left
Is there anybody out there?
Alright, we're going in five
How do I look, am I decent?
Do you think I should change this footwear?
To something a little more formal
No?
Alright let's celebrate life

I'm the King of the North
Like it or lump it
F*ck what you thought
They come out in their thousands just to support
They play trumpets in the background when I talk
I wear tracksuits not to be casual
I just don't wanna change now, that I'm rich
I want to wear what I wore when I was poor
And right now I'm tryna' inspire the kids
I changed the game
I changed the game so much
Them niggas are physically scared
I'm in your face
I'm everywhere to the point man think their vision's impaired
They don't want me to win
They don't want me to get a trophy
They want me to kiss their feet
But I'm not the king, 'cause I said that I was the king
Just listen to the people speak

King! King! King! King! King! King!
I'm King of the North they call me the
King! King! King! King! King! King!
I'm King of the North, yeah

I'm King of the North
Forget what other MC's wanna say
Me, I got given this name by the fans
And I'm not letting them down, no way!
'Cause they say fortune favours the brave
Now that I'm lucky enough to have fans
They know that I will die for this shit
I've already got one foot in the grave
Call me deep, into this music ting and all I wanted to is vent
Now I've got wireless and when I do wireless there's hardly any room left in the tent
Housing by the Fitz would pay for the rent
I would tell a Henry VIII to my friend
I've done my first CD in two-ten
Now I do a CD and I get a top ten
Mum was scared
I was on the road so much
I forgot what it was to be safe
'Cause I be carrying a bladed article, just in case anybody got in my face
She gotta be fast if you gotta take chase
You gotta be bad if you're gonna show face
But I swore to God that I'd make it
And now that I made it, can somebody say grace? (Please)

How's everybody feelin'?
Don't want anybody nervous
I've come to serve one purpose
That's celebrate life
And you make sure the old king's watching
And the prince if you can please
And you got them a seat right?
Let them see me shine
Can I just say thanks to my true fans?
Without you I wouldn't have made it
You walk with me and I'm grateful
And I'm no longer facing time
How do I look, am I decent?
Think I should change this footwear?
Too something a little more formal
No?
Alright let's celebrate life

King! King! King! King! King! King!
I'm King of the North they call me the
King! King! King! King! King! King!
I'm King of the North, yeah

King! King! King! King! King! King!
I'm King of the North they call me the
King! King! King! King! King! King!
I'm King of the North, yeah
