Lifetime waiting, getting busy with the numbers
Suddenly the blue sky's gone
Where's the blue sky, baby
Where's the blue sky, blue sky, blue sky

Lifetime waiting, getting busy with the numbers
Suddenly the sun's gone, baby
Where's the blue sky
Where's the blue sky

Don't let it grow slow, let it grow deep
Either I stay or you let me leave
Don't let it grow slow, let it get deep
Either I stay or you let me leave
L-l-let me in, l-l-let me in
L-l-let me in

Let me go
L-l-let me in

Lifetime waiting, getting busy with the numbers
Suddenly the blue sky's gone
Where's the blue sky, baby
Where's the blue sky, blue sky, blue sky

Lifetime waiting, getting busy with the numbers
Suddenly the sun's gone, baby
Where's the blue sky
Where's the blue sky
Where's the blue sky, blue sky

Don't let it grow slow, let it grow deep
Either I stay or you let me leave
Don't let it grow slow, let it get deep
Either I stay or you let me leave
L-l-let me in

Let it get deep
Let it get deep
(Let it get deep)

(Let it get deep)
