Emergency above
Put on your hard hats and invisible gloves
What's going on?
I was on the wagon, I thought I was done
You have to watch out
When one falls in another can't get out

You say that I like what you say
I like what you say
You say that I like what you say
I like what you say

They say I have to have somebody
They say you have to be someones
They say if you're not lonely alone
Boy, there is something wrong

You say that I like what you say
I like what you say
You say that I like what you say
I like what you say

You say baby, I only wanna make you happy
Baby, I only wanna make you

They say you learn from your mistakes
That's not always the case
And seeing that I understand
How I made 'em again and again

They say you have to have somebody
They say you have to be someones
They say if you're not lonely alone
Boy, there is something wrong

You say that I like what you say
I like what you say
You say that I like what you say
I like what you say

You say baby, I only wanna make you happy
Baby, I only wanna make you happy
Lately I only wanna make you happy
Baby, I only wanna make you
