Listen ends again into the desert street, 
A strange kind of violence
And like a legend creeping down the alleyways, 
It waves a hand to silence
All though we're not aware, there is a presence there 
Until we hear them teasing
Spitting curses, verses from the sacred books of long forgotten reason
Silken suits, the clicks of heels, 
The midnight hour long decayed
The spirit moves till busker plays 
Till he wishes he could never played
But the street wise listen 
While the wet roads glisten
Don't know what you're missing

I wouldn't carry you through this tonight 
But the melody's here and the beats are all right
And though there's a risk from the street hood, 
In the mist of the rain we can feel good
All though we're not aware, 
There is a presence there, 
Until we see teasing
Stealing time in motor grime working like a lamp through the vampire season

Heaven, soothe, power versus dancers in to a groove
Moves through the inner sun with shinning proof
You've carried all the blessing you can see 
That you were getting what you fear
Love lies close to all the hate you could've reared
Blue skies always under cloud that disappears
You've died too, but wrong thing, hear the song bring proof
Under life's wing, many cycling truth

A lover's fight, the blues patrol, 
She tries to keep the cash she made
Out on the streets since twilight, 
Now she's wishing that she never stayed
But the street wise listen 
While the wet roads glisten
Don't know what you're missing

Boys from the bar spilling out
Climbs into the car without a shadow of a doubt
Boys hit a drunk on the street, 
Passenger screams as he flies from the seat
Lives in a tangle or worse, 
Lift from the pipe of the night in a hearse
Lives in a gamble or more, 
A lift from the plain day
A lift from the plain day

And the truth will set you free
From the broken lamp lying at the corner of a memory
Treasures to be found
Yes this is your town
Yes this is your town
I guess this is your town
Yes this is your town
