I like boys! 
In all the world there's just one thing for this little girl, ooh I like boys 
Some are my lovers, some are my friends, I don't try to pretend, 
Ooh I like boys 
Whatever I do, wherever I go, if you're the one I'll let you know, 
I like boys! 

People like this, people like that, but I like boys 
It's easy for me, you'd better believe, I like boys 
It's a matter of taste, I'm stating my case, I like boys 
And boys like me too, ooh, I like boys 

I like boys! 
I don't care where they're from, or what they've done, ooh I like boys 
Lay no shame, rich or not, just as long as they're hot, ooh I like boys 
Give me a boy, what should I do, don't you wish it could be you? 
I like boys! 

People like this, people like that, but I like boys 
It's easy for me, you'd better believe, I like boys 
It's a matter of taste, I'm stating my case, I like boys 
And boys like me too, ooh, I like boys 

I like boys boys!
