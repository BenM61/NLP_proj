The night's alive with wind and fire
We telegraph our heart's desire
Through the night with our eyes
Wheels are turnin' fast and hard
Hearts are burnin' on the boulevard
Hear them pound young and proud
It's the American heartbeat
Chart the stars, head out for the action
Hit the streets and find some satisfaction

It's the American heartbeat
The American heartbeat
It's the American heartbeat
Oh the American heartbeat

The stage is set the roles are chosen
The lights grow hot
As the midnight's closin'  in
At last it comes so fast
Poundin' harder as the midnight's strikin'
It hits us like a bolt of lightning
Deeper down it's the sound of the American heartbeat
Chart the stars, head out for the action
Hit the streets and find some satisfaction
