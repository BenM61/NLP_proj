Time is on your side 
No more need in runnin' 
No more need to hide 
No more need to cry 

Life Is what ya find 
Wanderin' on the other side 
No more need to sigh 
No more need to lie 

Make it what ya can 
No more need in wastin' 
Love's around the bend 
No more time to lend 

Hope the best to be 
Just to make you see 
Love's around the bend 
No more time to lend 

Now it's up to you 
It's all up in your head 
What ya gonna do 
Bring yourself true
