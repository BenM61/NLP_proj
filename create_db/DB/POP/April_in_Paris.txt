I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace till

April in Paris
Chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables
Under the trees

April in Paris
This is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise

I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
And I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace till

April in Paris
Whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?
