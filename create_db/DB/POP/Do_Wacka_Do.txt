I hear tell you're doin' well
Good thing have come to you
I wish I had your happiness
And you had a do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka-do

They tell me you're runnin' free
Your days are never blue
I wish I had your good-luck charm
And you had a do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka-do
Yeah, I see you're goin' down the street in your big Cadillac
You got girls in the front, you got girls in the back
Yeah, way in back, you got money in a sack
Both hands on the wheel and your shoulders rared back
Root-doot-doot-doot-doot, do-wah

I hear tell you're doin' well
Good things have come to you
I wish I had your happiness
And you had a do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka-do

Yeah, I see you're goin' down the street in your big Cadillac
You got girls in the front, you got girls in the back
Yeah, way in back, you got money in a sack
Both hands on the wheel and your shoulders rared back
Root-doot-doot-doot-doot, do-wah

I hear tell you're doin' well
Good things have come to you
I wish I had your good-luck charm
And you had a do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka-do
