I got the bell bottom blues cause my sweetie is a sailor
And he's sailing somewhere on the sea
I got the bell bottom blues cause I'm crazy 'bout a sailor
And I don't know when he's coming back to me
I shake my head and refuse when the fellers come a calling
And they want to take me on a date
I got the bell bottom blues while the other girls are falling
I just sit around the living room and wait

I wonder if he's looking at the same moon I'm looking at
Every night I'm looking at the moon
I know that if he's praying for the same thing I'm praying for
We'll be together soon

I got the bell bottom blues just awaiting for a letter
Heaven knows I'm lonely as can be
I got the bell bottom blues and I won't be feeling better
Till my sailor boy comes sailing home to me
