(Listen baby)

You are satisfaction, I'll guarantee
Seeing your reaction, girl that matters to me
Whatever you want me to do girl, I'll do
Let me give you love
While we make the sounds that lovers do

When we make love you go
And I'll go 
That's what it sounds like
When we make love

All night you can call me
Your moan's like a song to me
All night I could watch you
Your body's so perfect to me
I'm gonna take you there
Nice and slow
While we make the sound of 

When we make love you go
And I'll go 
That's what it sounds like
When we make love

Cries and moans
That language your body knows
The oh's and the ah's
Means exceptional
Screaming out loud
To ecstasy we go
Girl this is what it sounds like
When we make love

Cries and moans
That language your body knows
The oh's and the ah's
Means exceptional
Screaming out loud
To ecstasy we go
Girl this is what it sounds like
When we make love

When we make love you go
And I'll go 
That's what it sounds like
When we make love

When we make love you go
And I'll go 
That's what it sounds like
When we make love

When we make love you go
And I'll go 
That's what it sounds like
When we make love
