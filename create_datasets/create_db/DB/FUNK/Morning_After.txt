Start of the morning
Everyone's calling you to get some time
It can wait 'til the morning
The world is safer from where we're both inside

Tell me what it's gonna take for you to stay
You ain't gotta do a thing
No, you can just lay here with me tonight
You can just lay here, roll up and stare

I know you think it must be the alcohol
And yeah, I've been drinking, no, it ain't that at all
Is it you? Is it me? Is it both of us?
And now that we're comfortable

I really gotta know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay
I really wanna know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning

And after we wake in the morning
My mind is still on the little things we did
I know when we was talking, to worryin'
Oh that's not the way to live

Tell me what it's gonna take for you to stay
You ain't gotta do a thing
No, you can just lay here with me tonight
You can just lay here, roll up and stare

I know you think it must be the alcohol
And yeah, I've been drinking, no, it ain't that at all
Is it you? Is it me? Is it both of us?
And now that we're comfortable

I really gotta know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay
I really wanna know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning

I really gotta know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay
I really wanna know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning

I really wanna know

One I want to stay the morning
