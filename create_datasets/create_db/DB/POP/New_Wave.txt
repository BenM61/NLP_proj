We must take it or leave it
'Cause this won't last forever
The invincible summer
Is crashing in
Why are you so terrified?
Didn't you see it coming?
Why are you so terrified?
Didn't you see it? (see it)

Don't feel sorry for me
Don't feel sorry for me
No!

'Cause I love this new wave
I love this new wave

We are melting away like a dream
So wake up.
And this world isn't what it seems, it's time to wake up
Why are you look so terrified
Didn't you see it coming?
Yeah, you look so terrified
Tell me, what did you see?

Don't feel sorry for me
Don't feel sorry for me
No!

'Cause I love this new wave
I love this new wave

It's all ending
Right in front of my eyes
It's all ending
Right in front of my eyes!

This could be the last time we speak
Are you okay with that?
I hope you feel the same
Yeah, I hope you feel the same
Because some bad things, they can last forever
Thought that we were living
While the skin rotted off our bones
Yeah the skin rotted off our bones
Yeah the skin rotted off our bones

Oh I love this new wave
I love this new wave

It's all ending
Right in front of your eyes
It's all ending
Right in front of your eyes!

Blood!
Fills the earth!

Blood!
