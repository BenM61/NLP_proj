Love you with your clothes on
Take them all off
Don't you make me wait tho
'Cause every second's painful
Wall's could toumble down, but we'd still stay up
All night crashing bodies till there's just one

We could be, we could be all the hours
You and me, you and me, you and me, all the hours
Hands up against the wall
So good it's criminal
We could be, we could be all the hours
(You and me)

Oh, all the hours, you and me
Oh, all the hours, you and me

I got what we both need
And it ain't boring
No, no time for slowly
Speed it up on me
Walls could toumble down, but we'd still stay up
All night crashing bodies till there's just one

We could be, we could be all the hours
You and me, you and me, you and me
All the hours
Hands up against the wall
So good it's criminal
We could be, we could be all the hours
(You and me)

Oh, all the hours, you and me
Oh, all the hours, you and me

Mmm, don't make me wait
Don't make me wait, now baby
Make it hot and exclusive
Ye eh, you know how to do it
Mmm, why think I'm foolish, think I'm foolish, baby
Got my mind on your body
Ain't nobody on my mind
On my mind
Got your body on my mind
Oh, all the hours, you and me
Oh, all the hours, you and me

It's criminal
Oh yeah
It's criminal
So good

Oh, all the hours, you and me
Oh, all the hours, you and me
