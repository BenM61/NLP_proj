And now I stand, forsaking pride 
The time has come to turn the tide 
I've drawn the line, I've built my wall 
And I won't let one more dream fall

All days of innocence, I surrendered long ago
Where's the wind that takes me higher 
The hand that offers peace 
The heart that still gives shelter?
I want to go back to find 
The innocent days that I left behind

I still believe they're holding ground 
Behind the Battle Lines
If it takes a million miles over land and sea 
Gonna swim in the rivers of purity 
I know they still run free 
Behind the Battle Lines

One more mountain I must climb 
I've scaled so many in my time 
And if the sun goes down on me 
The light of truth will help me see

All days of innocence, I surrendered long ago
Where's the voice that speaks of mercy 
The eyes that are not blind 
The love that's never ending?
A vision of eternity Oh, Lord! 
Never take the dream from me
Here I am, standing at the edge of destiny?
