I watch your window
I shake so scared
Spying from my room
With nervous unrest
Night after night your fingers
Caressing
The skin that is so fair you slowly
Undress
Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night
Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night

I know that you know that I'm here
Each night
Watching and praying the time is now
Right
For me to undress and caress you
Until then I'll just sit here and dream.

Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night
Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night
Cold the night, Cold the night

Soon my love
Soon my secret lover
Soon my love
Soon my secret lover
Soon my love
Soon my secret lover
Soon my lover

I watch your window
I shake so scared
Spying from my room with nervous
Unrest
Night after night your fingers
Caressing
The skin that is so fair you slowly
Undress

Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night
Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night
Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night
Soon we will be together
Until then so cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Ooh it's so cold without you
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
Cold the night
