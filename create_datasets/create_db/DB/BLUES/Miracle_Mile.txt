Gonna sing it like a song, sing it mountain high
Gonna sing it river flow
I've been thinking 'bout it in my thoughts alone

When I hear that voice it's like soup to the hungry
Wanna be the teacher, gonna be the kid
I'm gonna get inside
Find out where it's hid

'Cause, baby this is it babe
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in
Till I find out where this miracle begins

Some days I get so mad, still I get out of bed
Put my shoes on and push on ahead
L look for something good to say

Gone are the days that I'm surprised or bewildered
By what they're calling quality
Most of it sounds like bullshit to me

Someday is here and tomorrow never comes

'Cause, this is it baby
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in
Till I find out where this miracle begins

Throw your old skin to the curb
Go and get a match
It's time to light it up and let it burn, oh yeah now

Bet you got a woman to keep you warm
Don't mind me, I'm over here trying not to do anything wrong
My enthusiasm tends to come on too strong

Everybody's shakin' it for the camera
Yeah, you're beautiful but isn't there anything else to say uh
Like how does it feel now?

'Cause, this is it baby
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in
Till I find out where this miracle begins

Oh, we're on the miracle
We're on the miracle mile
We're on the miracle
We're on the miracle mile
We're on the miracle
We're on the miracle mile
