It's a moonlight night, a hot July, 
A rainy day in August 
Well it doesn't matter where you are 
Everything is magic 
Ain't it strange that love can make you feel 
Like you're floating on air 
You can see some good in everyone anywhere 
That's when you least expect the pain 
Here comes the rain 
What's the mystery of change, 
That no one knows 

When love goes wrong, 
Nothing goes right 
Days last so long, 
The lonely nights 
When love goes wrong 

It's the thrill you feel, 
When sex appeals 
Pounding you like thunder 
When that someone's there to pull you in 
It's in a spell you're under 
Ain't it strange that love can make you feel 
Like you're floating on air 
You can see some good in everyone anywhere 
Well it doesn't matter who 
Or what ya going through 
If the table turns on you, 
Then you will know 

So if you've got someone to love, 
Love them while you can 
If you got someone to hold, 
Don't throw it away 

When love goes wrong you fall apart 
Try as you might, 
A broken heart.
