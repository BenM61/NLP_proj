There was a City Baby, Attacked By Rats.
Their little teeth, they gnawed and hacked ..

He grew and he fought back ..
put those rats back in their traps.
City Babys .. Revenge

Survive he did, but only just.
Now for revenge, he has a lust.

No rats are safe, when he is there.
A Pied Piper .. with a grudge to bear.
