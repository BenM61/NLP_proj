You know there1s somethin' that's come over me
You know you got somethin' that set me free
You that there is somethin' that is on my mind
All the time, all the time

Life is just a party
Ya know ya in the right
You're the life of the party
It's alright, it's alright
Sparkles on your body
You know you're in the right
You're the life of the party
It's your night, it's your night

Chorus:
Simple melody baby
Come and swing your love to me
simple melody lady
Come and swing your love to me, honey

You know there's somethin' between me and you
Tell me your wish and I will grant it to you
Give me a reason any case I swear
Name a place anywhere, I'll take you there
(Chorus)
