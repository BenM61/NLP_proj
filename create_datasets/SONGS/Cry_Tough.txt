Already late to the union hall
Tired and dragging my feet on the ground
Doctor Feelgood is right down my street
I feel run over and it hurt me sweet
"Doc Feel, and I'm getting weak in the knees"

And he said, "Cry tough, son, cry tough"

I told him about my dancing blues
And why I had to fill the bantam nights
"Doctor Feelgood, I promised this lady
If I can't dance, she gonna break my nose"

He said, "Loosen up, boy, 'cause I've go the antidote"

And he said, "Cry tough, for that girl on the floor
Help her up and watch her beg for more"
?Cry tough, go down your soul
You just need another shot of rock and roll"
Just need another shot of rock and roll
Take it away

I feel I'm crippled since they fooled me at school
Until I caught this new kind of spook
Called dancing fever I have to have it

Crazy Doctor Feelgood encouraged my habit
All his time he would devote to discover the antidote
And he said, "Cry tough on your crutches too
You were born to be a dancing fool??

Cry tough, go down your soul
You just need another shot of rock and roll
Yeah, just need another shot of rock and roll
Look out

I need another shot of rock and roll
Need another shot of rock and roll
Need another shot of rock and roll
