Crushing down the top of a motoring so
Watch the road fold
Eighteen hell wheeler cryin' out for more
Everybody knows...
Center divide everything to the right
Before I go...
Hand full of nothing from inside
Ready roll!

Up from the floor a moment or more
Did I win a sure bet, I wanted to get
Stand lazy remote four

What can I say thing are goin' my way... accelerate!!
Let it run so I can get up and go-wheel pullin more
See yourself risin' on a screen that's shown... I live for
Clear as night for the 100th time-breakin all

Up from the floor a moment or more
Did I win a sure bet, I wanted to get
Stand lazy remote four
