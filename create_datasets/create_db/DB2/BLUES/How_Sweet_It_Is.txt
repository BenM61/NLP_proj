How sweet it is
To be loved by you
How sweet it is
To be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were

With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion

How sweet it is
To be loved by you, okay
How sweet it is
To be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be, without you in my life
Everything I did was such a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before

But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways

I just wanna stop and thank you baby
I just wanna stop and thank you baby
I just wanna stop and thank you baby
I just wanna stop, thank you baby, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
How sweet it is

You were better to me than I was for myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody
Nobody, nobody else

How sweet it is, oh God
To be loved by you
How sweet it is
To be loved by you

How sweet it is
To be loved by you
How sweet it is
To be loved
