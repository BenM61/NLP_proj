Now let me tell you, baby, ?
Yes, let me tell you, baby, ?
Don't forget, pretty daddy
That this world is full of old men

I'm not going to be your servant
I told you time and time again
No, I'm not going to be your servant
I told you time and time again

Try to find yourself another woman
'Cause I've got myself another man

So leave me alone, baby
You're not going to worry my mind
Yes, leave me alone, baby
You're not going to worry my mind

Before I keep you, papa
I'll take any kind of man I can find

You had me once, daddy
You could have kept me all to yourself
Yes, you had me once, daddy
You could have kept me all to yourself

But now I'm sorry, baby
I belong to somebody else
