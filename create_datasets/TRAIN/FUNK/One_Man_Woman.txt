All I need is one man
All I need is one man

I've wanted to tell
But I wanted much too long
Things never turn out
The way you plan then
So listen well now
My words will make you strong
I must be sure you understand then

I'm a one man woman
An nothin' can shake my heart
I'm a one man woman
To hold you
To keep you
'till death do us part
I'm a one man woman
There's nothin' I would not do
To love you
To love you

Now don't be afraid of
Takin' chances with the queen
You think I'd go out and forget you
Touch me and and it takes me
To the purest side of love I've seen
I knew you were my king the day I met you

I'm a one man woman
An nothin' can shake my heart
I'm a one man woman
To hold you
To keep you
'till death do us part
I'm a one man woman
There's nothin' I would not do
To love you
To love you

Time stands still when you hold me
When you hold me baby in your arms
I always get my fill
Truth be known you were me down
You drive me crazy baby
Now you got me opened up for sure
So now what can I do?
Oh! 'cause noboby loves me like you do

I'm a one man woman
An nothin' can shake my heart
I'm a one man woman
To hold you
To keep you
'till death do us part
I'm a one man woman
There's nothin' I would not do
To love you
To love you
Nobaby can love love me like you do baby
When you hold me
When you touch me
When you love me oh! baby
I love you do you love me
I'm a one man woman
Oh darlin' c'mon on and tell me that you loveme baby
Put your arms around me and tell me that you love me
