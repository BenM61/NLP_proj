Katie got a list of times
Now that she's really gone, gone
It's always one like flies
Telling now we weren't clarified
Till we snuck out that night
Rolled a Chrysler down drive
But once we were inside
Couldn't figure out where we were off to

That was before we had made
Some terrible mistakes
That's just teenage talk
I don't think the past is better, better
Just 'cause it's cased in glass
Protecting us from our now and later

How do you see me now
Now that I'm a little bit older, older?
And now remind my albatross
Smoldering on my shoulder, shoulder,
Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder
