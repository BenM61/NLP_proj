There were shadows on the sand closely mingled,
Just two lovers by a moonlit sea,
While I watched I thought of you and I tingled,
For they kissed the way you did with me.

Then the shadows on the sand came much nearer,
And the moon was like a spotlight then,
There was one familiar face showing clearer,
It was you, I couldn't look again.

I felt so sad, there you were with someone new,
I felt so glad, when I found it wasn't true.
For the shadows on the sand seemed to break up,
And I looked around me with a start,

When the pounding of my heart made me wake up.
From a dream that nearly broke my heart.
