Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the young without mothers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let every man help his brother
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let us all love one another
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Make all our hearts blind to color
Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
