What can you do to amuse me
Now that there's nothing to do
The TV set's busted and can't get a picture
The radio plays nothing but news

Why don't you tickle me
Gee whiz won't that be fine
What a great idea
What a perfect way to kill some time
Can't stop to think 'cause if we do we'll lose our mind

Why don't you tickle me

Don't we have fun every minute
Oh what a gay life we lead
One chocolate milkshake with two straws stuck in it
What else does anyone need

Why don't you tickle me
There's nothing else to do
You won't have to talk to me
And I won't have to talk to you
When we're done I'll think of something else to do

Why don't you tickle me
