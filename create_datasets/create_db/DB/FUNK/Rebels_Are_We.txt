We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

Life's a switch
Don't let it pull a trick on you
Try not to be fooled, be wild

Don't throw a fit
Stay calm and you'll be cool
You'll find the solution
Right before your eyes

I know much more
Now that I'm older
Just a little bolder
Listen to me

We can't give up
Now that we're moving
The whole world's grooving
We must stay free

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

Don't cage us in
We might just surprise you
In order to convince you, we will

Oh, no, you can't
Take away our freedom
And get this straight
For that, we won't be still

The time is now
And if we have to fight
Come on, let's unite
We gotta do it soon

We're gonna win
On that you can depend
Cause if you don't
Me and my baby
Are going to the moon

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

My baby and me

Rebels
Rebels

Rebels, baby, rebels
Rebels, baby, rebels
Rebels, baby

Rebels
Rebels, baby

Rebels

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we
