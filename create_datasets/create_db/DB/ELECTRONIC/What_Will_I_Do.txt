When I met you, you meant the world to me 
But you were the type of girl that set love free 
Now I'm out cold, you stole my heart from me 
But I know someday you'll think back every memory 

Now what will I do 
Now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you 
Now what will I do, now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you 

Now love is gone 
You're far away from me 
You would have been so rich with love but set it free 
Now you want home but it's too late for me 
'Cause I won't be used and abused and then set free 

Now what will I do 
Now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you 
Now what will I do, now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you 

Now what will I do 
Now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you 
Now what will I do, now what will I do, what will I, what will I do, without you
