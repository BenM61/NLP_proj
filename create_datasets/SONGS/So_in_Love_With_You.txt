All those nights when you can't hold on
Needing someone there, someone
Shooting star you'd half a life
That's why you burnt so bright
Now you don't need anyone

As a kid you lived the dream
Fitted right inside it's scheme
Through a thousand love affairs
They still deny that they cared
You're gone because they got scared
I'm so in love with you

Did your world collapse one day
Nothing left to give away
Spending hours on the phone
Don't hang up I'm on my own
I can't face it when you go
I'm so in love with you

There's an ambulance outside
Reporters hang around like flies
Waiting for a photograph
When you died you weren't alone
I guess the truth will never be known
I'm so in love with you
