Hey, love, you say you need someone
To be there for you, to love you all night long
It's kinda funny but I don't think you have to look no further
Because I'm right here, and I'm ready
To do all the things your man won't do

Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold?
Treat you like you're nothin' when you're worth more than gold
Girl to me you're like a diamond, I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure, I'll give the world to make you mine

I'll put a string a pearls right in your hand
Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain we can do it all night
I'll touch the places he would not
And some you never knew would get you hot
Nothin' is forbidden when we touch

Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do, every little thing
I'll do them for you

I'll take you out on a night cruise on a yacht, just can't lose
'Cause we got a lot to look forward to, 1, 2, what ya gonna do?
What good is a diamond? Nobody can see it
I hear he got you on lock down but I got the master key, yeah

I'll light a thousand candles all around
Show me to the subway, I'll go down
Nothin' can be sweeter than the sound of makin' love
Baby, when I start I just can't stop
I'll love you from the bottom to the top
Nothin' is forbidden when we touch

Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won' do, every little
I'll do them for you
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you

I'll light up all the candles all around
Show me to the subway, I'll go down
Nothin' can be sweeter than the sound of makin' love
Baby, when I start I just can't stop
I'll love you from the bottom to the top
Nothin' is forbidden when we touch

Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you

Ooh, I got a Jones in my bones for you
There ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'll make your body cream with my sex machine
I won't stop until I hear your mother scream

Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you

Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Sweet baby, I wanna do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
