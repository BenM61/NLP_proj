Because the rhymes fourteen carat
You suckers you wanna grab it
But you run like a little bitty rabbit
Pullin' my cape is a very bad habit
Cocaine - you still smoke it
Homey dude you must be jokin'
My fat chain I am chokin'
All through the school you should be votin'
On the M-I-C I'm like a pitbull
My brain my brain is so full
Of words verbs adjectives pronouns
Come on in and sit on down
Just listen to what you been missin'
On the floor your eyes will glisten
I see you wishin' on the wishbone
My name Schoolly School I'm never alone
Just rough and tough and takin' no stuff
All I really wanna know y'all.. am I black enough?
 
(Am I black enough for ya?)
(Am I black enough for ya?)
 
Am I black enough for ya?

(Am I black enough for ya?)
 
Sung sample
"We're gonna move on up one by one
We ain't gonna stop until the work is done
Am I black enough black enough for ya?
Am I black black enough for ya?"

(You don't know the pain)
(You don't know the pain)
(You don't know the pain)
