We born to embrace, not accept it
We were given nothing more, and so we kept it
As the colors of our boots keep fading
We live a life that we hate without saying

Who would listen to the cries of a poor man
We've never done nothing
How could we be something
Every heart has an hour of existence
Every breath brings a chance for redemption
If somehow we could wake up

Let us love
Like we were children
Make us feel
Like we're still living
In a world I know that's burning to the ground
Give us time
To beat the system
Make us find
What we've been missing
In a world I know that's burning to the ground

In the crowd of the dead and disappointed
We're ashamed, giving up on what we wanted
Take a chance on a long shot this time
Aren't we all just at least worth another try

I'm a king in the land of abuses
Undetermined by the promise of excuses
Who's to win if we know that it's not fair
Who would fight when it seems that no one cares
If somehow we could wake up

Let us love
Like we were children
Make us feel
Like we're still living
In a world I know that's burning to the ground
Give us time
To beat the system
Make us find
What we've been missing
In a world I know that's burning to the ground

It's hard to stay here but where do we go
I know we can't feel it anymore
It's true that time is wearing us down
We fall further and further away
Waiting for always to change

Let us love
Like we were children
Make us feel
Like we're still living
In a world I know that's burning to the ground

Leave your hurting on the road behind you
Let the wind go with you 'til the morning comes
Yeah, your sorrow, it can't save you
It won't answer for what you've done
