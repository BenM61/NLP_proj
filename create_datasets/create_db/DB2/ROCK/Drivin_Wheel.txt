Feelin' good, can't be real, must be dreamin' 'bout my drivin' wheel
Rollin' on, drivin' on, come to me and rock me all night long
We've got a roll goin', too good to stop
Flyin' high, we've got too far to drop
Everybody needs somebody to love
I've got you, and that's love enough

You're my drivin' wheel - you're my drivin' wheel - you're my drivin' wheel
Powerful love, steady roll, move my body and it rock my soul
Let me ride, let me slide, got that lovin' feelin', way down inside
You got me walkin', goin' round and around
You got me talkin', but I can't hear a sound
Love comes easy when the going is tough
May be crazy - I may be in love

You're my drivin' wheel, yeah - you're my drivin' wheel, yeah
You're my drivin' wheel, yeah

Every night feelin' high, flyin' right, can't believe all the love that I feel
Easy rider, you're a love exciter, you're my love, you're my drivin' wheel

Feelin' good, can't be real, must be dreamin' 'bout my drivin' wheel
Rollin' on, drivin' on, come to me and rock me all night long

We've got a roll goin', too good to stop
Flyin' high, we've got too far to drop
Everybody needs somebody to love
I've got you and that's love enough

You're my drivin' wheel - You're my drivin' wheel, yeah 
You're my drivin' wheel
Why-o-you-'are-e my drivin' wheel

Keep on drivin' me baby - 'cause you're my drivin' wheel
I love the way I feel - 'cause
