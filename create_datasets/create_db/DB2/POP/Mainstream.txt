Reflection in the water I see
Six pretty girls on my mind today
Yellow foam floating down the river
Voices I hear of Yolngu heroes

Go go go go living in the mainstream
Go go go go under one dream

Monsoon clouds
Rolling over the ocean
Thunder and rain
Raging here tonight
Hear the sound of speargrass crying
Cross rivers and valleys
On Yolngu land

Go go go go living in the mainstream
Go go go go under one dream

Go go go go living in the mainstream
Go go go go under one dream
Go go go go living in the mainstream
Go go go go under one dream

Reflections in the water we see
Black and white
Living together
Sharing dreams of the red, black and gold
Living dream time now
Is the Yolngu way

Go go go go living in the mainstream
Go go go go under one dream
Go go go go living in the mainstream
Go go go go under one dream

We're living together
We're living together
We're learning together
We're living together
Yolngu
Balanda
Yo (yo) yo (yo) yo (yo)
Yo (yo) yo (yo) yo (yo)

This is Australia
