All eyes on the stage
Together now we can turn the page
All will see the dynasty

This globe is getting small
Touch one life and you've touched them all
Look and see a dynasty

Yeah, we all have given up
We all have taken up
Tonight we'll live it up
'Cause love has never gone

We all have given up
We all have taken up
But tonight we'll live it up
'Cause love has never gone

This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty

Now we celebrate
Knowing love set us straight
This will be a dynasty

We believe it, we don't try
We will be it, feel it make us fly
All will see this dynasty

Yeah, we all have given up
We all have taken up
Tonight we'll live it up
'Cause love has never gone

We all have given up
We all have taken up
But tonight we'll live it up
'Cause love has never gone

We all have given up
We all have taken up
Tonight we'll live it up
'Cause love has never gone

This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty

This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty
This is a dynasty
