Oh so, your weak rhyme
You doubt I bother reading into it
I'll probably won't
Left to my own devices
But that's the difference in our opinions

You're a mouthful
That amounts for another week on my own
Now I'm a novel made resourceful
I start a chain with my thought

Talk is cheap, my darling
When you're feeling right at home
I wanna make you move with confidence
I wanna be with you alone

Said help me help you start it
You're too comfortable to know
Throwing out those words
Oh, you gotta feel it on your own

Cold pain
I cannot sustain it
That's what I'm thinking
Not what I'm drinking

I hold up my ways
These thoughts are pervasive
It's not a statement
But peace can be evasive

You're a mouthful
That accounts for another week on my own
Now I'm a novel made resourceful
I start a chain with my thought

Talk is cheap, my darling
When you're feeling right at home
I wanna make you move with confidence
I wanna be with you alone

Said help me help you start it
You're too comfortable to know
Throwing out those words
Oh, you gotta feel it on your own

Talk is cheap, my darling
When you're feeling right at home
I wanna make you move with confidence
I wanna be with you alone

Said help me help you start it
You're too comfortable to know
Throwing out those words
Oh, you gotta feel it on your own
