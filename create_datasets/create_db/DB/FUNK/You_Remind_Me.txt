You remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories
Oh

I saw you before baby
It's a deja vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me
I saw you before baby
It's a deja vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me

You, you remind me of a love that I once knew
Is it a dream or is it deja vu
I just had to let you know
So I had to sing it
'Cause for you boy I don't know

The way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move and
You remind me, yes you do
Of the way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove it
You remind me
You remind me, yeah

I saw you before baby
It's a deja vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me
I saw you before baby
It's a deja vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me

You, you remind me of a memory
And this is something you should know
Sweet baby darling c'mon just stop playin' with my mind
'Cause for you boy I don't know

(The way)
The way you walk and
(The way)
The way you talk and
(The way)
You really like to move it
(The way)
The way you dress and
(The way)
The way you dance and
(The way)
You really like to groove it
You remind me
You remind me

I saw you before baby
It's a deja vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me
I saw you before baby
It's a deja vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me

And the way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move it
You remind me, yes you do
The way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove it
You remind me

I saw you before baby
It's a deja vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me

Don't you know that you remind me
