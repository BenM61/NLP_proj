Well we started out strong, 
And our hopes were high, 
Figured on bein' like Bonnie and Clyde, 
Twenty five years is an alibi, 
Had to get connected, 
So I wrote a long letter to a 
Government-man, 
Told him I was born in the summer of Sam, 
He said son I don't think that you understand, just wanna get elected, 
But my heart got heavy, 
And my hair grew long, 
Had to take a job just to get along, 
I was down in the gutter below, 
I was down in the gutter below, 
As my daddy always said sing this song, 
How hard can it be just to get along, 
He said, don't go sellin' your soul, 
He said, don't go sellin' your soul, 

Hey man, you know, 
What's up, too slow, 
Feels like I'm starin' at the sun, 
Get high, get low, 
Don't let your ego, 
Out there, starin' at the sun, 
Starin' at the sun, 

Well I got a lotta love for the modern man, 
Read a lotta books that I don't understand, 
Want a lotta things that I lost or stole, 
Just wanna hooker with a heart of gold, 
As my heart gets heavy, 
And my hair gets long, 
Hard can it be just to get along, 
When you don't go sellin' your soul, 
Yes don't go sellin' your soul, 

Hey man, you know, 
What's up, too slow, 
Feels like I'm starin' at the sun 
Get high, get low, 
Don't let your ego, 
Out there, starin' at the sun, 
Starin' at the sun, 

Now baby, I love you, 
But spring's in the air, 
It just seems like maybe, 
We spend our days just smokin' pot and wonderin' how we got so fucked up, 

Hey man, you know, don't let your ego, 
Feels like we're starin' at the sun, 
Hey man, you know, don't let your ego, 
I'm here starin' at the sun, 
Hey man, you know, don't let your ego, 
Feels like we're starin' at the sun, 
Hey man, you know, don't let your ego, 
Out here starin' at the sun, 
Starin' at the sun, starin' at the sun, starin' at the sun,
