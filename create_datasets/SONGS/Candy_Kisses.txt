My old lady she's so sweet and fine
I can't help wanting her kisses all the time
I run to meet her like a kid with a dollar
To the corner candy store
It's what I'm livin' for
But I want more than your candy kisses

She starts movin' I say "Honey please"
("I don't want your kisses")
I ain't foolin', you know it isn't right to tease
("I don't need your kisses")
I tell her "Sugar you're a true fine lover."
"You're as sweet as cherry pie"
But no matter how I try
I can't get high
On your candy kisses

I don't want our love to stop
("Don't stop it")
If it should stop
("Don't stop it")
My heart would break
If the sun should get to hot
("Don't stop it")
It's gonna melt away the icing on our cake

Candy kisses knock me off my feet
("I don't want your kisses")
Fill me up but leave me feelin' incomplete
("I don't need your kisses")
Fancy wrappin's and well-made trappin's
Will lead me to your door
What I'm hungry for
Is so much mooore...than your candy kisses

("Candy kisses, candy candy kisses")
("Candy kisses, candy candy kisses"

Candy kisses knock me off my feet
Fill me up but leave me incomplete
Since your wrappin's lead me to your door
It's not the only kind of love that I'm lookin' for
Candy kisses ain't enough for me
Got to have all your lovin' if you're gonna stay with me

("Candy kisses, keep your candy kisses")

Candy, candy, candy kisses ain't enough for me
Got to have all your love if you're gonna stay with me

("Candy kisses, keep your candy kisses")

Candy, candy, candy kisses ain't enough for me
Got to have all your love if you're gonna stay with me

("Candy kisses, keep your candy kisses")

Candy, candy, candy kisses ain't enough for me
Got to have all your love if you're gonna stay with me (fade, etc)
