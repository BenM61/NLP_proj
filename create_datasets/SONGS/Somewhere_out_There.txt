Last time I talked to you
You were lonely and out of place
You were looking down on me
Lost out in space

We laid underneath the stars
Strung out and feeling brave
I watched the red orange glow
I watched you float away

Down here in the atmosphere
Garbage and city lights
You've gone to save your tired soul
You've gone to save their lives

I turned on the radio
To find you on satellite
I'm waiting for this sky to fall
I'm waiting for a sign

All we are
Is all so far

You're falling back to me
You're a star that I can see, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

Hope you remember me
When you're home sick and need a change
I miss your purple hair
I miss the way you taste

I know you'll come back someday
On a bed of nails, I'll wait
I'm praying that you don't burn out
Or fade away

All we are
Is all so far

You're falling back to me
You're a star that I can see, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

You're falling back to me
You're a star that I can see, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

You're falling back to me
You're a star that I can see, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

I know
I know
You're falling out of reach
I know
