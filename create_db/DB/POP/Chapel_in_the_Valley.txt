here's a chapel in the valley
In the valley of my dreams
And the organ's playing just for you and me
There's a choir in the chapel
In my reverie it seems
I can hear their voices sing, "Oh, promise me"

My heart began to falter
As the bells began to chime
We knelt before the altar
For it was our wedding time

It was there we made a promise,
I was yours and you were mine,
In the chapel in the valley of my dreams
