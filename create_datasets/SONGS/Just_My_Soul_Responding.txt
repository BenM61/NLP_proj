Oh, and I wanna be here when morning comes
When the stars in the sky fade into one
Oh, and I wanna be here when times are hard
When the beating of your heart is like a drum
But every day
I found new ways to hurt you
And every day
We took our sides

And it's just my soul responding
To the heavy heart I'm holding
And it's just my soul responding
To the love you took from me

Oh, and I wanna be here when morning comes

Oh, and I wanna be here when times are hard
When the beating of your heart is like a drum
But every day
I found new ways to hurt you
And every day
We took our sides

And it's just my soul responding
To the heavy heart I'm holding
And it's just my soul responding
To the love, to the love, you took from me
And it's just my soul responding
To the heavy heart I'm holding
And it's just my soul responding
To the love, to the love, you took from me
And it's just my soul responding
To the heavy heart I'm holding
And it's just my soul responding
To the love, to the love, you took from me
