I didn't know you collected souls
Gambling fire, rolling bones
I shoulda known you would take it all
But I never planned to be your voodoo doll

Use your lips to pull me in
Just to stick in another pin
But if you want this heart of mine 
Your evil just wont work this time

I'm done with all your bitchcraft
I gotta get my soul back
We've played this game so long 
I'm not sure that it will come back
I'm not trying to make you feel bad
But baby I just can't live with all your bitchcraft

Every time you cast another spell
I lose a little more of my free will
Put me in a kettle full of broken hearts
Add a little pinch from your magic jar
Just so I forget the kind of girl you are

Baby I'm catching on real fast
This isn't going to last
And I'm through eating your poison seeds 
And I've built up my immunity

I'm done with all your bitchcraft
I gotta get my soul back
We've played this game so long 
I'm not sure that it will come back
I'm not trying to make you feel bad
But baby I just can't live with all your bitchcraft

Baby why you gotta act like that
You're not the girl that I thought I had
I guess I thought I knew who you were
And it's a drag knowing you're so quick to kill
It's the only way you get your thrills
But baby I'm about to show you how it feels

'Cause I'm done with all your bitchcraft
I gotta get my soul back
We've played this game so long 
I'm not sure that it will come back
I'm not trying to make you feel bad
But baby I just can't live with all your bitchcraft

I'm not trying to make you feel bad
I gotta get my soul back
'Cause baby I can't live with all your bitchcraft
