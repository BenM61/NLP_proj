At the start of the conversation
I didn't have too much to say
I was needing some inspiration
And you just got in my way
I took a shot at an easy target
You were too stunned to say anything
You were the unsuspecting martyr
You were not the most dangerous game

Bring my courage back now
Bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change
I want to be living free

Well it could be that I was mistaken
Or maybe I deceived myself
But it's hard to understand somebody
Doesn't want to understand himself
There's an ocean of unlatched windows
And a world of unlocked homes
The only reason anybody can still feel safe
Is most people still knock on the door

Bring my courage back now
Would you bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change
I want to be living free
I don't want to be a prisoner
Bound in these chains
Don't want to be a prisoner
I want to be free again

And though we all return to dust
There's a lot of us in a terrible rush

Some take the road to Damascus
Some take the road to Hell
I'll take Highway One to the evergreens
And everything will turn out well

Bring my courage back now
Would you bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change
I want to be living free
I don't want to be a prisoner
Bound in these chains
Slave to my fear
I want to be free again
I want to be free again
