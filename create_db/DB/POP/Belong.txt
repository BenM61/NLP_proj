Get in the car, I'll drive
We got no place to be on time
So let's just enjoy the ride
We can go wherever the road decides or
We can head for the shore
Or some place we've never been before
Just climb in and close the door
We've got nothing to answer for

'Cause you, you belong with me
And I belong with you
You belong with me
And I belong with you
I belong with, I belong with you

Reach out and take my hand
We got the radio pumping jams
We don't got no map and we don't got plans
We don't gotta follow anyone's demands
Feel the wind blowing in your hair
The sun on your face and a song in the air
We can go as fast as we'll ever dare
Until we see tomorrow in the rearview mirror

'Cause you, you belong with me
And I belong with you
You belong with me
And I belong with you
I belong with, I belong with you
With you
I belong with, I belong with you

Get in the car, I'll drive
We got no place to be on time
So let's just enjoy the ride
We can go wherever the road decides

'Cause you, you belong with me
And I belong with you
You belong with me
And I belong with you
You belong with me
And yeah, I belong with you

Where you go, I'll go
'Cause I belong with you
Where you go, I'll go
'Cause I belong with you

I belong with, I belong with you
With you
I belong with, I belong with you
