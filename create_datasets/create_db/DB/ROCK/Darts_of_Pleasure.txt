You are the latest contender
You are the one to remember
You are the villain who sends her
Light or dark, fantastic passion
I know that you will surrender
I know that you will surrender
I want this fantastic passion
We'll have fantastic passion

You can feel my lips undress your eyes
Undress your eyes, undress your eyes
Words of love and words so leisured
Words of poisoned darts of pleasure
Died, and so you died

You are the latest adventure
You're an emotion avenger
You are the devil that sells her
Light or dark, fantastic passion

I know that you will surrender
I know that you will surrender
I want this fantastic passion
We'll have fantastic passion

You can feel my lips undress your eyes
Undress your eyes, undress your eyes
Skin can feel my lips they tingle, tense anticipation
This one is an easy one, feel the word and melt upon it
Words of love and words so leisured
Words of poisoned darts of pleasure
Died and so you died

Ich heisse Superfantastisch!
Ich trinke Schampus mit Lachsfisch!
Ich heisse Su-per-fan-tas-tisch!
