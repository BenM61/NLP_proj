I don't like opera and I don't like ballet
And new wave french movies, they just drive me away
I guess I'm just dumb, 'cause I know that I ain't smart
But deep down inside, I got a rock 'n' roll heart
Yeah-yeah-yeah, deep down inside I got a rock 'n' roll heart

Oh, rock 'n' roll heart
Lookin' for a good time
Just a rock 'n' roll heart, roll heart, roll heart
Lookin' for a good time

I don't like massages or something meant to say
And I wish people like that would just go away
I guess I'm just dumb, 'cause I know I'm not smart
But deep down inside, I got a rock 'n' roll heart
Yeah-yeah-yeah, deep down inside I got a rock 'n' roll heart

Yeah, rock 'n' roll heart
Searchin' for a good time
Just a rock 'n' roll heart, roll heart, roll heart
Lookin' for a good time

Yeah, just a rock 'n' roll heart
Lookin' for a good time
Just a rock 'n' roll heart, roll heart, yeah, roll heart
Lookin' for a good time, yeah, now

Yeah, got a rock 'n' roll heart
Searchin' for a good time
Got a rock 'n' roll heart
Searchin' for a good time
Just a rock 'n' roll heart
Yeah, searchin' for a good time
Yeah, got a rock 'n' roll heart
Yeah, now, now, searchin' for a good time
Let me hear you, now
Oh, let me hear you, now
