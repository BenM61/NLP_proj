Wish I had of known
Baby you felt this way
Now I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm still in love with you

And after all I hav done
Can you tell me what's
Goin on
I can't understand
Why you want to treat me so cold

Guess I was a fool for loving you
Guess I was a fool for thinking that you were loving me too
Should've knew
You were breaking my heart in two 

Feel like I'm losing my mind
Just a fool to think your love could be kind 
My heart aches so, so hard to let you go
And I don't know
Which way to go

Standing here all alone
With no one to call my own
Girl look what you've done to me
Yeah you've hurt me
Got me living in misery

Guess I was a fool for loving you
Guess I was a fool for thinking you were loving me too
Should've knew
You were breaking my heart in two 
And I guess I was a fool for needing you
I guess I was a fool for thinking you were needing me too
Should've knew
'Bout the things you were taking me through

And girl my heart
Can't take this pain
There's nothing left to say
Sorry it had to be this way
But yet still I feel
You weren't keeping it real
Girl why did you lie to me

Guess I was a fool for loving you
Guess I was a fool for thinking you were loving me too
Should've knew
You were breaking my heart in two
And I guess I was a fool for needing you
And I guess I was a foll for thinking you were needing me too
Should've knew
'Bout the things you were taking me through
