I don't know where we are
And I'm barley hanging on
We've been drifting apart
We're up and down, we push and pull
Yeah, do I contemplate, starting over, no
Tell me what it takes to get throught to you
We've come so far, to close
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do

You might here but I can't hear you
Cancel out the noise, it's interfering
And I get lonely when I'm with you
Can't see your reflection in my mirror, my mirror

Black and blue, smoke and guns
We're like a cliffhang episode
Speaking in tongues, secret codes
Going down two different roads, yeah
You had me at hello, no, we're not done yet
I'm your Romeo, you're my Juliet
We've come so far, to close
Can't get through to you, ooh

You might here but I can't hear you (Ican't hear you)
Cancel out the noise, it's interfering
And I get lonely when I'm with you
Can't see your reflection in my mirror, my mirror

Uh yeah, you might here but I can't hear you (I can't hear you)
Cancel out the noise, it's interfering
And I get lonely when I'm with you
Can't see your reflection in my mirror, my mirror

My mirror
(My mirror)
