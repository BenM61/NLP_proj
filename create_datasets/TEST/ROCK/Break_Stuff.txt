Its just one of those days
Where you don't want to wake up 
Everything is fucked
Everybody sucks
You don't really know why
But you want to justify
Rippin' someone's head off 
No human contact 
And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days 
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit
I think you better quit, let the shit slip 
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit
I think you better quit, talking that shit
Its just one of those days 
Feeling like a freight train 
First one to complain
Leaves with a bloodstain
Damn right I'm a maniac
You better watch your back
Cause I'm fucking up your program
And then your stuck up 
You just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up 
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days 
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit
I think you better quit, let the shit slip 
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip 
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit
I think you better quit, talking that shit
Punk, so come and get it 
I feel like shit
My suggestion, is to keep your distance
Cause right now I'm dangerous
We've all felt like shit
And been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers
That want to step up
I hope you know, I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might 
Break something tonight 
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might 
Break something tonight 
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might 
Break your fucking face tonight
Give me something to break
Just give me something to break 
How bout yer fucking face
I hope you know, I pack a chainsaw 
What! 
A chainsaw
What! 
A motherfucking chainsaw 
What! 
So come and get it
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit
I think you better quit, let the shit slip 
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
It's all about the he-says, she-says bullshit
I think you better quit, talking that shit 
Punk, so come and get it
