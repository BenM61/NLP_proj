Swept away by the wonder of it all
So many never saw it coming
Left me dead 
And I don't know where to turn

Here and now seems I'm standing on the edge
Looking down
I can clearly see your face in the crowd
Makes me feel I'm not alone

If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me?

Seems to me I'm exactly where I dreamt I would be
And if you for here is something to see
But I need a hand to hold onto

If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me?

If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me?

If I fall (will you catch me? make me alright?)
If I fall (Cause I'm standing on the edge now, see your face)
If I fall will you catch me? 

If I fall (will you catch me? make me alright?)
(Looking down, see your face, if I fall now you'll catch me)

If I fall
If I fall
If I fall will you catch me?
