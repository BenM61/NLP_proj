Here comes a strangest reflection
Throwing a shadow on the wall
Breaking down all my defences
The distance is nowhere at all

Beautiful friend
Beautiful friend

Looking at pictures in a mirror
Counting the faces never stop
Reflecting a European stranger
Fighting the fire from the top

I've had enough of temptation
Strung up like a fox on the wheel
Waiting in so many places
The alternative is really unreal

Beautiful friend
Beautiful friend
