Preserved in time
The insect comes alive
The amber falls away
The vector strikes
How can such a tiny wound
Cause me so much pain?

It's the beauty in the flaw
The grace of imperfection
Oh, oh
Now I'm twisted out of form
By unnatural selection
Oh, oh

A horrifying violation
Of a human form
A cell divides and multiplies
A strange mutation overrides
And carbon-copies into four

It's the beauty in the flaw
The grace of imperfection
Oh, oh
Now I'm twisted out of form
By unnatural selection
Oh, oh

Alien impostor
Pretender
I'll keep you safe now
Close to my heart

The grace of imperfection
Oh, oh
Now I'm twisted out of form
By unnatural selection
Oh, oh

It's the beauty in the flaw
The grace of imperfection
Oh, oh
Now I'm twisted out of form
By unnatural selection
Oh, oh
