Remember that song called kill me
From Victim's last LP
Too much for a risc for a golden disc
The price he paid for money

Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star

Sing your song, you can't go wrong
Tempted his business advisor
No need for alarm, you'll come to no harm
He didn't mention the sniper

Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un Rock & Roll star

The news is read, the need is fed
One yawn ah, two yawn ah
And back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight
c'mon, madman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie, bonne nuit

Remember that song called kill me
A lecture on political chicanary
Of peoples rape, recorded on tape
Brought shame to the presidency

Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights

remember that song kill me
Once used by a man from Gallilea
He had nothing to lose, he was King of the Jews
Secured his place in history

Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un provocateur

The news is read, the poison's spread
One yawn ah, two yawn ah
And back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight
c'mon, maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie

Vick played his part, with all his heart
He wasn't prepared for the shock
When hollow lead bit into his head
A new martyr for the book of rock
A new martyr for the book of rock
The book of rock
A new martyr for the book of rock
