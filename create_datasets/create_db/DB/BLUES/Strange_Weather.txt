Will you take me across the channel,
London Bridge is falling down
Strange a woman tries to save
What a man will try to drown

And he's the rain that they predicted,
It's the forecast every time
The rose has died because you picked it
I believe that brandy's mine

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same

The world is getting flatter,
The sky is falling all around
And nothing is the matter
For I never cry in town

And a love like ours, my dear,
Is best measured when it's down
And I never buy umbrellas,
For there's always one around

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same

And you know that it's beginning,
And you know that is the end
When once again we are strangers
And the fog comes rolling in

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same
