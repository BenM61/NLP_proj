Not a day goes by
That a man doesn't have to choose
Between what he wants
What he's afraid to lose
Along comes temptation
And he can't refuse, no
I know the different 'tween wrong and right
Don't make no difference in the middle of the night

Take the bait
You pay the price
It's much too late
For good advice
You know and I know that our good things' through
Because there's consequences for what we do
Consequences for me and you

I was smokin' and drinkin'
And thinkin' when you walked by
The next thing I knew
I was making up my alibi, yes I was

And all I've done since then
Is lie, lie, lie

I took my chances
Had a real good time
But I'd give my soul
For a little piece of mind

To tell the truth
Is a big mistake
Homes will crumble and hearts will break
Baby, why gamble when there's so much to lose

Because there's consequences for what we do
Consequences for me and you

Oh, listen baby
It's just common sense
Sooner or later
We're gonna suffer the consequences

To tell the truth
And pay the price
I did not listen to Mama's good advice
You know and I know that our good things' through

Because there's consequences for what we do
Consequences for me and you

Consequences of the things that we do
Consequences for me and you

Yeah
We're gonna have to pay the price, baby
Yeah
We're gonna suffer the consequences
Yeah
For hot lovin'
On the side
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Consequences, baby
Hot lovin'
On the side
