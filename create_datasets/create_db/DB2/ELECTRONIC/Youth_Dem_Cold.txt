In the streets it's getting hot and the youths
Them a get so cold searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap, whoo

As generation comes and goes
You gatta make preparation for the youths them a grow
It's what you reap, it's what you sow

The youths, them have a life in the future
So when that's then you know, if education is the key
Then tell me why the people have to make it so expensive for we
Give them the key, oh, set them free

Oh, na, na, na, ayy, eee, eee, oh, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

You gatta find a better way
'Cause wen we look in a Babylon
Me see a bearful play and so the Gideon stay

Ay, all nation come together

And the light and the way

You gat to show the people there's still a brighter way, ayy

Vanity is an illusion, will have to fade away, ayy, yeah
And all the wicked deeds that done
You know you gat to pay, ayy
