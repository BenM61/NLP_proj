Hey you got to step outside to see what's going on
Hey you can't run and hide when the psybin trip is on
Not like this have you seen such green
A spot like this becomes serene
I'm glad you're here, I have no fear

[Chorus]
We trip the shrooms fantastic and shit gets drastic
Elbow pull and kick
We trip the shrooms fantastic and shit gets drastic
Check it out

Right now my brain is fragile
But then you seem so agile, we'll make it in tea
And we'll see what there is to see

[Chorus]

Make an instrumental, add a little vocal
Take it to the stage and make the people go loco
Make an instrumental, add a little vocal
Take it to the stage and make the people go loco

Boom boom you got the spinning of the room
Quite right you got the breaking of the light
Boom boom you got the spinning of the room
Quite right you got the breaking of the light

And the sun and the moon and the spinning of the room
It does to my sight what the prizm does to light
You're quicker than me ridiculous see
You come follow me get lobotomy
You're quicker than me ridiculous see
You come follow me get lobotomy

[Chorus]

Make an instrumental, add a little vocal
Take it to the stage and make the people go loco
[5x]
