I get a high whenever you're around
Sweeping from my head to my toes
I gotta get my feet back on the ground
'cause you make me go out of my way
Crossing the line making my say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't want to fight it
I start to blush

You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
Is it for real or maybe?
I start to blush
You are my Sugar Rush
I got a sweet and fine taste for you
It might me too obvious but
I can't help my self from what I do
'cause you make me go out of my way

Crossing the line
Making my say what I have in mind
You make me so excited
And I don't want to fight it
I start to blush
You are my Sugar Rush
Ain't nothing better baby
Is it for real or maybe?

I start to blush
You are my Sugar Rush
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my Sugar Rush
I get weak and talk too much
