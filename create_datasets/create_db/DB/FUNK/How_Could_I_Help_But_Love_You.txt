When you hold me close, honey, 
You're the most, baby, 
You set my soul on fire 
Ever since I met you, honey 
I had to get you, 
You have been my one desire 

How could I help but love you 
With a love so true, 
You send cold chills down my spine 
If we would ever part, 
It wouldn't be your fault, yeah, 
It would be all mine 

If you would ever leave me, honey, 
It sure would grieve me, baby, 
It would break my heart 
But I won't let that worry me, 
This love will always be, 
It was meant right from the start 

How could I help but love you, 
With a love so true, 
You send cold chills down my spine 
If we would ever part, 
It wouldn't be your fault, yeah, 
It would be all mine 

When you hold me close, honey, 
You're the most, baby, 
You set my soul on fire 
Ever since I met you, honey, 
I had to get you, 
You have been my one desire 

How could I help but love you, 
With a love so so true, 
You send cold chills down my spine 

If we would ever part
