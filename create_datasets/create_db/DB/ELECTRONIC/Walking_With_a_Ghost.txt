No matter which way you go
No matter which way you stay
You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist
I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist

No matter which way you go
No matter which way you stay
You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist
I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist

No matter which way you go
No matter which way you stay
You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost

Out of my mind, out of my mind
(I said please)
Out of my mind, out of my mind
(I said please)

You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
