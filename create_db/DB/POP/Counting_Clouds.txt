Hey baby if you catch my number drop a line to me
You can write what you wanna write, I wanna see
Hey baby if you get the time, have the time for me
We can play what you wanna play
Just stop this hide and seek

You're the in babe
You get inside my new song
It's my love song
Baby, just for you song
Now I won't stop till
You're crying out for me

Think I'm gonna lay me down and close my eyes
I think I'm gonna dream about you tonight
Walking on a beach beneath the purple skies
Just counting clouds,
You and I

Hey baby won't you tell the truth or just won't you lie to me
You can say what you wanna say just say it all to me
Hey baby, I'm not your type but would you promise me
A change of heart or a change of mind,
Would you change to me

You're the in babe
You get inside my new song
It's a love song
Baby, just for you song
Now I won't stop till
You're crying out for me

Think I'm gonna lay me down and close my eyes
I think I'm gonna dream about you tonight
Walking on a beach beneath the purple skies
Just counting clouds,
You and I

How long must I wait
Say how long, how long

Think I'm gonna lay me down and close my eyes
I think I'm gonna dream about you tonight
Just walking on a beach beneath the purple skies
Just counting clouds,
You and I
