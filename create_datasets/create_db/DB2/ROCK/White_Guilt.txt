L.A. lady you always look so uninspired
When you're hanging around
Living with creeps and loving with liars
And everybody knows it's true
That all you're ever gonna be is entertainment
So entertain me

You shiver when they wake up
And once more before they're gone
And even when you're sleeping baby
You're barely holding on

L.A. lady I know your feet must be so tired
From standing on a corner stomping out cigarettes like they were fires
The daughter of a thousand men
You've got your mothers eyes and whorish skin
You're a train wreck
But that's entertainment

You shiver when they wake up
And once more before they're gone
And even when you're sleeping baby you're barely holding on
So throw your skin back in your clothes
And wipe the blood running from your nose
'cause if the price is right tonight anything goes
Too many lines, one too many times
You're sharing the same vein
With your stage name
But it never quite feels the same
It never quite feels the same
I said, it never quite feels the same

You shiver when they wake up
And once more before they're gone
And even when you're sleeping baby you're barely holding on
So throw your skin back in your clothes
And wipe the blood running from your nose
'cause if the price is right tonight anything goes
Too many lines, one too many times
You're sharing the same vein
With your stage name
But it never quite feels the same
It never quite feels the same
I said, it never quite feels the same
