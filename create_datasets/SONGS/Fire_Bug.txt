Burn it up burn it down
Let it burn across the town
My heart will catch afire when my fire bug's around

Fire Bug, Fire Bug
She's my little fire bug
She gonn' light a fire when she begins to kiss and a hug

I took her to the winter ball and melted all the snow
That little gal starts dancing and she torches up the floor

Fire bug, fire bug
She's my little fire bug
She gonn' light a fire when she begins to cuttin' up the rug

Tried to make my killer move a lonely summer night
She strung me out and lit me up like Christmas in July

Fire Bug, fire bug
She's my little fire bug
She gonn' light a fire with a little bitty kiss and a hug

Burn it up burn it down
Let it burn across the town
My heart will catch afire when my fire bug's around

Fire bug, fire bug
She's my little fire bug
She gonn' light a fire with a little bitty kiss and a hug
She gonn' light a fire with a little bitty kiss and a hug
