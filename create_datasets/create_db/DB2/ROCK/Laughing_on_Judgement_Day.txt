There's a man with a flash car living right next to me
He's got so much, he keeps it under lock and key
And he don't give a damn about the people he turns away
He's too busy making money to give them the time of day

Gonna get a heart attack 'cause he works late all the time
I swear he doesn't know his kids, his wife thinks it's a crime
It's not the way for me, taking life so seriously
When the end comes I wanna be
Laughing on judgement day

I was thinking 'bout the time when I couldn't afford a beer
And wondering why there's so many women round here
Then the truth stepped up and hit me like a ton of lead
Now the children of the night want to know me
There's a price upon my head

Well you know it makes me laugh 'cause I've been around a while
I ought to make her happy before I'm out of style
'Cause now I've got a dream to sell
She got her feet in the wishing well
Bite the apple and you get to hell
Laughing on judgement day (I'm gonna laugh that day away)
