Mek she whine mash up the town

Give her the whining crown
Her body illegal, her whining illegal

Ya! Yea! Yea!

So I hit the road and end up in a yardy party
Baby was moving like like a naughty shorty
Need discipline, she need discipline
Need to put her on a lockdown no visiting (Bring 'em down)
Handcuffs maintain the connection
Dis baton is a rod of correction
Discipline, she need discipline
Need to put her on a lockdown no visiting
