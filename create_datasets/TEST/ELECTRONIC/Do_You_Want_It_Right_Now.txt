Do you know how lucky I feel I am 
To find a man who loves me, as I am 
You never try to change a single part of me 
You're easy to love, with those qualities 
An everyday you teach me more and more 
Inside me I wanta glow 
And every night you think of only me 
The way you keep me satisfied 
You do all the things I like 
I want ya, Oh I want ya so 
Do you want it right now 
Oh, I cant let go 
I want ya so bad, give me all you have 
I can show you now, do you want it right now 

You have a rare sensitivity 
I really believe you know how to feel 
I trust you with all my heart and soul 
You care to much too let me take control 
And every day you teach me more and more 
Inside me, I want to glow 
and every night you think of only me 
oh you keep me satisified,you do all the things I like 
I want ya, Oh I want ya so 
Do you want it right now, Oh I can't let go 
I want you so bad, give me all you have 
I Can show you how, do you want it right now 
I want ya, I want ya so 
Do you want it right now, 
Oh I can't let go 
want ya so bad, give me all you have 
I can show you how, do you want it right now 
Do you want it, want it right now baby 
right now 
do you want it, want it right now 
I can hear it from ya right now 
Do ya want it want it right now 
right here, right now, right now, right now
