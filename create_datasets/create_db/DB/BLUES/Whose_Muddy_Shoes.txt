Tell me whose
Baby, whose old muddy shoes I see?
Now, tell me whose
Baby, whose old muddy shoes I see?
They're down at the head of my bed, darling
Where my shoes outta be
My baby and I got along just fine
Until she went wrong.
I woke up in the mornin
Now, tell me whose
Baby, whose old muddy shoes I see?
Well, down at the head of my bed, darling
Where my shoes ought to be
Her hair was long and curly
And her teeth shine just like pearl
She wake up in the mornin'
She jump just like a squirrel
Now, tell me whose
Baby, whose old muddy shoes I see?
Well, they're down at the head of my bed, darling
Where my shoes ought to be
Now, when I love her in the mornin'
She always stay at home.
But, now she's gone and left me
She left me all alone
Now, tell me whose
Baby, whose old muddy shoes I see?
Well, they down at the head of my bed
Where my shoes ought to be
