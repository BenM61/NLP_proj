I look back on all those good times
We once shared, and I must have been blind
Just to think, I'd find someone new
One who'd love me better than you
Well it may come as a surprise
Loneliness has opened my eyes 
I've tried every love I could find
Still I can't get you out of my mind 
Cause there's 

[Chorus]
No one in the world, to hold me
No one in the world's gonna move me
No one in the world can love me like you do baby
Every time I'm with someone 
Loving you,yes I want to run,I want to run back to your arms again
Ain't no one in the world (no one in the world)
Loves me like you do

Are you happy now with your life
Well for me, I'm braking inside so self-assured
That I can not see
I had it all when you were with me baby

[Chorus]

Please take me back (please take me back)
Oh baby I can't go on (I can't go one)
I'm not happy in my life without you
I'll do whatever it takes
I gotta get you back with me again(with me again)
I've realized I need you here in my life

(No one in the world)
No one,no one
Nobody loves me like you
(like you do baby)
(every time)
You got the love that I need
And you bring it down heaven on me

And no one in the world
In this world
In this world
Oh (no one in the world)
