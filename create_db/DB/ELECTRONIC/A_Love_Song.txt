It all began innocent as love can be
In every word you gave it all to me
'Cause this is what a love song sounds like
Another life, two beating hearts are mine
The party's over but you're still over the line
'Cause this is what a love song sounds like

This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song sounds like
This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song, love song sounds like

I'm falling down, too much to drink again
You pull me up and tell me how it could end
This is what a love song sounds like
I gave it up, I don't wanna hurt anymore
It wasn't me, why can't you just open the door?
This is what a love song sounds like

This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song sounds like
This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song, love song sounds like

Life is always meant to replay
No heart break no more today

This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song sounds like
This could be my life, but it's only words
To make me feel right when the meaning's blurred
You've opened my eyes to the oldest tale of time
This is what a love song, love song sounds like

This is what a love song sounds like
