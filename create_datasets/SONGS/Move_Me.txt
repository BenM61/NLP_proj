Dancing
Like I'm James Brown or Michael Jackson
You came in set off a chain reaction
I can't control my two feet
You sure know how to move me
Ooh ooh ooh babe

I used to sit by myself
No one could me come out of my shell
Then you ignited a fire under me
And now I can't stop my feet from dancing
(Dancing)
You came in set off a chain reaction
(Yes you did)

Baby
Didn't know before what I was missing
(I didn't really know, know, know)
Must have been magic in the kissing
(Kissing)
I can't control my two feet
You sure know how to move me
Ooh ooh ooh babe

I thought that I'd only see shades of grey
'Till you, you brought a rainbow my way
My heart has a new kind of beat
And now I can't stop my feet from dancing
Like I'm James Brown or Michael Jackson
You came in set off a chain reaction
(Yes you did)
I can't control my two feet
You sure know how to move me
(You know how to move me)

Baby (baby)
Didn't know before what I was missing
(Didn't know, didn't know, didn't know, know, know)
Must have been some magic in the kissing
(When you kiss me)
I can't control my two feet
You sure know how to move me
Ooh ooh ooh babe

You move me, yeah
You move me, you move me, you move me
You move me, you move me, you move me
(You really move me)
Said you really move me

Ooooh
Dancing (dancing)
Like I'm James Brown or Michael Jackson
You came in set off a chain reaction
I can't control my two feet
You sure know how to move me
Ooh ooh ooh babe

Baby
Didn't know before what I was missing
(No I didn't, no I didn't, no I didn't know)
Must have been some magic in the kissing
I can't control my two feet
You sure know how to move me
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

You move me, you move me, you move me
You move me, you move me, you move me
You move me, you move me, you move me
You move me
