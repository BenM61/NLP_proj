Sit there with a blank expression
Say you can't go on anymore
It's not like me to come out and help you
Mabye I've been down this road before

Been living in the shadows
Now you come out slow
Now you're in the saddle
Got to ride a long
Now you're dream was shattered
These days are through
Maybe something mattered
It's not just for you

Some are gonna go for broke
Some are gonna lay down
I've been too long standing still
All I know is whenever you need me
You reach out and set me in motion

Looking out on that long valley
Telling me I've come so far
You're the reason I finally got there
You're the reason it's been so hard

Been living in the shadows
Now you hear the call
Now you're in the saddle
You got to ride or fall
Now you push a little harder
Like I showed you to
There's a day you'll be calling
And I'll look you to you

Some are gonna go for broke
Some will lay down
I've been too long
Standing still
All I know is whenever you need me ( 2nd rep-I'll pick you up whenever you stumble)
You just reach out and set me in motion
