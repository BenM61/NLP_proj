We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas
We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas

I'm made up my mind that I'ma strike
(Wha wha) and I'm ready to fight
Takin' out my steel killin' every punk nigga in site
We expite, I knew you bitches didn't want to brawl (uh what you say?)
Bitch I'll swang on all of y'all
I'm the beast from the east, with da fangs on my teeth
I'll murder all of y'all bitches in da middle of da street
And I don't give a f*ck if you don't like me
Straight knock yo ass out in to captivity
Down south, I'll ride, shoot and kill homicide
It be nothin' shawty till the day that I die
We strive, on tearin heads up
And everywhere we go we gon' tear dat bitch up
We don't give a f*ck about havin' no click
Dat ain't got my back and ain't takin' no shit
Excuse me shawty, get the f*ck out my face
Befo' we get mad and shoot up the whole place

We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas
We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas

I speak my mind, 'cause bitin' my tongue hurt
Murder yo ass and lyrics and put ya face on a shirt
I'm a mothafuckin' rida, 'cause I thought y'all knew
And I reppin' nothin' even it's twenty of you
I think it's plenty of you that really want da shawty dead
Watch what ya said lil shawty, I'm makin' bread
F*ck all y'all born hataz with hatred born to match
A long way but plus I roll with g's and gat'z
And shawty matter of fact these trill g's and dub's
We ain't talkin' behind yo back and we ain't scared to bust
I'm by myself, but bein' alone makes you strong
I stepped out the porch young, so shawty I been grown

We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas
We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas

Atl off da chain down here
You come with da yappin' and no action, you gon' disappear
You walk in da club, it's tight like brass knuckles
Straight elbow a hata like we jumping off turn buckles
Beatin' in ya door with dat clip on da tech
Beatin' down ya block in that 89' chevy
Tellin' stupid bros we throwin' bows that we ready
Screamin' "swang shawty" to da boys dat can't stand me
Yeah shawty, I'ma Atl slugga
Knockin' out heads on you pussy mothafuckaz
Shawty be sayin' "scrap you cool boy"
But I known in my heart dat I'ma headbussa boy!

We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas
We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas

We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas
We some head bussas, we some head bussas,
We'll knock a hata out, we some head bussas
