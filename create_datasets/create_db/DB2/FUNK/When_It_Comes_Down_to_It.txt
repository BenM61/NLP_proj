You've done nothing wrong
But it seems so long
Since we've shared some time
And I say I don't mind

But oh when it comes down to it
Do you really wanna?
But oh when it comes down to it

I suppose it's true
That maybe I'm a fool
To scare myself this way
Take my fears away

But oh when it comes down to it
Do you really wanna?
But oh when it comes down to it

Like ships in the night
We leave no sign
The course we sail
Are memories
That lead us to who knows where

Have I lost my mind
Listening to these lies
Heard from no one else
Save me from myself

But oh when it comes down to it
Do you really wanna?
But oh when it comes down to it

Like ships in the night
We leave no sign
The course we sail
Are memories
And I wonder if you really care

And oh when it comes down to it
Do you really wanna?
And oh when it comes down to it

When it really comes down to it
When it really comes down to it
And I don't believe it
When it really comes down to it
When it really comes down to it
