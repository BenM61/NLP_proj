It hurts me so 
To see you in that state you're in 
With a tear on your chin 
Tell me please what have I done 

It hurts me so 
To see you sitting by yourself 
With your head in your hands 
Tell me did I do you wrong 

I want to know 
If I can say I'm sorry 
Stop crying 
Baby please don't worry 
When I listen to your story 
I'll softly dry your tears 

It hurts me so 
To hear you crying in your sleep 
Tell me what do you keep 
Down inside I want to know
