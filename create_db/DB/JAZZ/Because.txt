BECAUSE, YOU COME TO ME,
WITH NAUGHT SAVE LOVE,
AND HOLD MY HAND,
AND LIFT MINE EYES ABOVE.
A WIDER WORLD OF HOPE AND JOY I SEE,
BECAUSE, YOU COME TO ME.

BECAUSE YOU SPEAK TO ME IN ACCENT SWEET,
I FIND THE ROSES WAKING 'ROUND MY FEET,
AND I AM LED THROUGH TEARS
AND JOYS TO THEE,
BECAUSE, YOU SPEAK TO ME.

BECAUSE GOD MADE THEE MINE,
I'LL CHERISH THEE,
THROUGH LIGHT AND DARKNESS ,
FOR ALL TIME TO BE.
AND PRAY HE'LL MAKE OUR LOVE DIVINE,
BECAUSE, GOD MADE THEE MINE.
