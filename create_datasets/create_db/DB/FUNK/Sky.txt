I painted a picture, of a day gone past
An ancient scripture, a house of glass
People looking through the window
Never knowing what they'd find
When they couldn't see me
I locked the door, left them behind
The sky will tell me... I'm not the only one
And the sky will tell me... I must believe the sun

I shut my eyes, to not go blind
Things I can't see, I see in my mind
Oh now the passing clouds of rain
Have surely passed us by
Poor is the man
That believes his own lie

And the sky will tell me
I'm not the only one
And the sky will tell me
I must believe the sun
And the sky will tell me
Long may you run
And the sky will tell me
I must believe the sun
(Yeah)

If I was wrong judge... me by name
I simplify... one and the same

And the sky will tell me
(and the sky will tell me)
I'm not the only one
(I'm not the only one)
And the sky will tell me
(and the sky will tell me)
I must believe the sun
(I must believe the sun)
And the sky will tell me
(and the sky will tell me)
Long may you run
(long may you run)
And the sky will tell me
(and the sky will tell me)
I must believe... (I must believe) the sun
(Yeah)
