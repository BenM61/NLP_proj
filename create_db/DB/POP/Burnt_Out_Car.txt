A simple / good morning /
Or hello would have done /
The silence / 10 am /
Not my idea of fun /
The papers / the photos /
Things were found in the fire /

Chorus:
Something that you said /
The look upon your face /
Something in the way you hold me /
I know what they say /
I know what this means /
I know that you never told me /

A change of hair colour /
Clairol baby-blond /
I'm not quite used to it /
It never takes too long /
No makeup / no earrings /
Nothing to identify me /

Chorus

Repeat chorus several times...
