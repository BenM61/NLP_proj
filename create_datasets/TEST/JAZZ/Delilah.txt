Sweeter than sweet 
There is none to compete with Delilah 
Armful of charm and a four dream alarm, that's Delilah 
Angels tip their halos 
The moons straightens his tie 
And weeping willows smile 
As she goes by, my... 
Rarer than rare
All my life I would share 
With Delilah 
Heaven would be 
Anywhere I could see 
My Delilah 
I'll grow strong as Samson 
When she whispers, "I do"
I'll hand her the moon and declare
"Delilah, it's for you!" 
(repeat once)
(repeat once)
