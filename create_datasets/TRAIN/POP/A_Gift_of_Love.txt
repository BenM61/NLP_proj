Here in this silent night
Now all the world is right
As if we've sundenley been giving
A gift of love
A gift of love

Warm as the fire glow
Soft as the falling snow
A precious miracles we live in
This wonder of a gift of love

Night falls
At this coldest time of the year
Love calls
At this summer it's here

Here where I love you so
Now as our blessings grow
We shear the greatest gift we'll ever know
A gift of love

A gift of love
