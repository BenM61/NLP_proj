(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Gettin' a message?
A message for me
I'm caught up in love, and I'm in ecstasy
What can I do now, when nothing's the same?
And all that I know, I wanna do it again

Well tell me now life is so simple when you are with me
'Cause when we're together, I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy 
I'm in ecstasy (yeah)
I'm in ecstasy (yeah)

Everybody go (yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
All you pretty things, get on board this mothership
I said, all you've got to be is ready for action, baby

Don't think I'm twisted, as a matter of fact
Welcome you now to the second act
Well I fought off robots, and a man in a suit
Wear out the soles of your monkey boots

Well tell me now
I can't get enough of the sunshine
I can't get enough of the moonlight
And all the colours that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on

Can't get enough of the oceans
Can't get enough of the mantra
All we will ever feel is ecstasy
We're in ecstasy 
We're in ecstasy (yeah)
We're in ecstasy (yeah)

Everybody go (yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
All you pretty things, get on board this mothership
I said, all you've got to be is ready for action, baby

Well tell me now I can't get enough of the sunshine
I can't get enough of the moonlight
Another colours that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on

Can't get enough of the oceans
Can't get enough of the mantra
All we will ever feel is ecstasy
We're in ecstasy 
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy 

Everybody go (yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
All you pretty things, get on board this mothership
All you've got to be is ready for action, baby
Ready for action, baby, ready for action, baby
