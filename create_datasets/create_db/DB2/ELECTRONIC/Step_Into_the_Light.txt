I have turned away from you
And I am godless
A wasteland of poison
A hidden fortress
I have blackened out the stars
And hidden frequencies
I have silenced all the waves
And forbidden secrecies

So step into your light
This dog doesn't bite, oh
I just wanna be your friend
You know, I've never been in love before
I've never been in love before

There is nothing of you now
No ghost, no not a trace
No flower, not a seed
Nor perfume in your place
I have searched amidst
A barren plane of emptiness

I am worthless, It is futile
You're invisible, I am infantile

So step into your light, oh
This dog doesn't bite, oh
I just wanna be your friend
You know, I've never been in love before
I've never been in love before

I have murdered the divine in me
Set the goodness free
I have squandered it all
I am less than the sum
I am parts of the whole
There is something missing
There is something I stole
(There is something I stole) 
(There is something I stole) 
(There is something I stole) 
(There is something I stole) 

Why have you forsaken me?
Where do you hide?
I feel the betrayal
Simmers, it blisters
It digs down and burrows
Deeper inside, more than a try
(I've never been in love before)
I cannot deny
(I've never been in love before)
That it
(I've never been in love before)
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like
(I've never been in love before)
(I've never been in love before)
(I've never been in love before)
(I've never been in love before)
(I've never been in love before)
(I've never been in love before)
Love

So step into the light, oh
This dog doesn't bite, oh
I just wanna be your friend
You know that I've never been in love before
I've never been in love before
So step into the light, oh
You know this dog doesn't bite, oh
They caught up our hands
You know, I've never been in love before
