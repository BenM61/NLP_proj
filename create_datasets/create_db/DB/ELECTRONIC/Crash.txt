Back it up, back it up
You got it, you got it
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up
You got it, you got it

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

I wander round the room and I'm getting things ready
I picture you driving, just like Mario Andretti
I got the cush, Kettle One, waiting for your engine
Your Grand Prix attention, it's gonna be a party

Don't forget to make a you-turn
I see you left your blinker on
I got it rolled and ready here to burn
Meet me back at home (a-oh, a-oh)

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Driving fast in your car
I've got you tracked on my radar, oh

It's just such a trip, how you're still my speed racer
You got me so addicted, just like a free-baser
I want you all over me like L.A.M.B.
So get here A.S.A.P., it's gonna be a party

Don't forget to make a you-turn (don't forget to get here)
I see you left your blinker on (you see, I want to get it on)
I got it rolled and ready here to burn
Meet me back at home (you know you need me so come back)

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Now you know you're qualified
You're in the pole position
Put it in first gear, step on the pedal and drive fast

Back it up, back it up
You got it, you got it
Back it up, back it up
You got it, you got it
(uh, uh, uh, uh)

Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up
You got it, you got it
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up
You got it, you got it
(uh, uh, uh, uh)

(I'm ready for you)
Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
(Me and you boo)
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

(Don't make me wait too long)
Drive back baby to me, fast in your car
(For me and you boo)
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Come on baby, please hurry up, you know I'm waiting for you

Come on baby, please hurry up, you know I'm waiting for you

Come on baby, please hurry up, you know I'm waiting for you

Come on baby, please hurry up, you know I'm waiting for you
