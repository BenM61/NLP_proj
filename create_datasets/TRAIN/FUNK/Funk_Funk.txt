Get up, we are eternal funk. 
Alias, the phemaldehyde funkmen
You can't see us, but you can feel us

Get up on the funk funk, funk funk, funk funk
Feel it begin to rock rock, rock rock, rock rock
If you're tired of the same o' sound, get up on the Molly funk sound!
'Cause we are living funk funk, funk funk, funk funk
"c'mon, dig the funky horns"

"It is our will to let you know that we exist, so don't resist, 
Let it all hang out. Huh, don't be a dead boogie, baby!"

Ya dig my heavy drift, ya dig my heavy drift, 
My drift's too hip to resist, my drift's too hip to resist
To get off on is a trip, to get off on is a trip, funk funk

If you can do with me I can do with you, just like 2 supposed to do. Hey, hey,
Shepdopopdobelieaaaaay!
This sure ain't gonna be funk, it's gettin' down on the sea thunk
'Cause we are living funk funk, funk funk, funk funk! Hey!

We can be funky as we want to be and can be funkier than that! 
We were here before you felt the funk. 
And we will be hear after the funky feelin's gone!

I'm stretchin' out on the floor! I'm stretchin' out on the floor
It feels too good to ignore It feels too good to ignore
Sweats all over my face, baby, sweats all over my face
It's a crazy place!

I'm breakin' out on the floor again, baby, da-nah nah na-nah na
It feels too good to ignore, da-nah nah na-nah na
Sweats all over my face, da-nah nah na-nah na
Funk funk, it's a crazy place!
