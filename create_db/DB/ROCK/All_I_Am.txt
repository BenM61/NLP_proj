I'm not your daddy or your father confessor
I'm not your monkey or your learned professor
I'm not your clown or your handsome face
I'm not a member of your master race

I'm not your blood sweat brother your sister
I'm not your sugar or your tough tongue blister
I'm not anything you need or want
All I am I am is gone

It's all I am it's all I am
That's all
I'm not your savior or your beast
I'm not your mother not in the least

I'm not your stranger or your love at first sight
I'm not your boy even for one night
I'm not anything for which you long
All I am I am is gone

It's all I am it's all I am
That's all
I'm not your milk man or your tank fish
Not your connection or your birthday wish

I'm not your pilot prophet poet protector
I'm not your banker or your collector
I'm not from here I don't belong
All I am I am is gone

It's all I am it's all I am
That's all
