Waking up aggravated
Stupid shit man I hate it
Bitches lyin' bitches cryin'
Suicidal get in line
Gettin' mine bouncin' freaks
Loosing sleep countin' sheep
Absolute cash and loot
Men in black packin' heat

Born and blazin' rotten raisin'
Fingers up time to waive 'em
Show these players playin' that 
They better get there ass to prayin'
There won't be nuttin' but dice 
After the cut in the gut
I am not like 'em there gonna wish 
They never pushed my button

The door is shuttin' and a knife 
Will do you no good
You gettin' nuttin' while 
I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else 
You can take it to the bank
I don't give a f*ck what 
None of y'all people think

[Repeat: x4]
Holdin' the gold it's so gold it's so golden y'all
Golden cobra

Uh, that's right
Yeah, that's right
(Shut the f*ck up)

Feelin' Korn going blind
Free as hell doin' time
I'm insane can't complain
Flush you turds down the drain
Down the hatch throwin' craps
Throwin' matches on the gas
Check the match check the will
Check the ride payin bills

Burnin' mouths wanna smile
If you're feelin' versatile
Versus while flippin' bitches
Grindin' trucks skatin' ditches
Hatin' all the Harley hatin' 
Knife is slicin' shit like bacon
Sick and tired you is fired
I'm the truth and you's the liar

The door is shuttin' and a knife 
Will do you no good
You gettin' nuttin' while 
I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else 
You can take it to the bank
I don't give a f*ck what 
None of y'all people think

Holdin' the gold it's so gold it's so golden y'all

[Repeat: x2]
Oh yeah listen what I'm tellin' you 
(I'm tellin' you)
There's only one king on this hill 
It sure as hell ain't you

Yeah
