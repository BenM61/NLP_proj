I wish I could rip out a page of my memory
Cause I put to much energy in him and me
Can't wait til I get through this phase
Cause it's killing me
To bad we can't re-write our own history

Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

I'm having nightmares
From sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of (my energy)

Seems only like yesterday
Not even gravity
Could keep our feet
On the ground
When u go to me
How can two be as one
We've become to divided now
There's no use hiding from memory now
Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

I'm having nightmares
From sleeping with the enemy (Oh, yeah)
How do we reverse the chemistry
(We gotta re-)
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all my energy (energy)
Energy (energy), my energy (energy)
Taking all of

Cause your taking all of my energy
I'm having nightmares
From sleeping with the enemy
We gotta reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares
From sleeping with the enemy (oh)
We gotta reverse the chemistry (oh, oh)
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love
Is taking all of my energy (energy)
Energy (energy), my energy (oh)
Taking all my energy (oh-oh)
Energy, my energy (taking all of me)
Taking all of

Ya killing me
Ya taking all of me yeah, oh
This love is taking all of my energy
