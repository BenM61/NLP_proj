I remember flashbacks lighting up magic waves
Eight o'clock, saloon emptiness, handle it
The wide old image I had to view 11 seconds ago
I didn't say anything, so you will never know

I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Swinging on the cable line to pull it
Climbing down the ghostly wine in a battery
That light in your eyes, I search for religiously
Oh, when it's not there, oh Lord, it's over me

I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Till I ever hold you out there again
Will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship driving my heart
Home, come
It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay, I need aligned a new shiner
Rat race

Living outta body here, what can I do?
It's up to the doc everyday to join here with you

I had to get away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Till I ever hold you out there again
Will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship driving my heart
Home, come
It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay, I need aligned a new shiner
Rat race

Till I ever hold you out there again
Will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship driving my heart
Home, come
It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay, I need aligned a new shiner
Rat race
Rat race
Rat race
