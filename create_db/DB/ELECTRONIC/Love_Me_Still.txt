Your friends say you love me still
Single as a dollar bill
You say I'm the one you want
'Cause I got that good and keep it trill

When I talk about it
Don't talk about it
You're lying
You wanna tell me stories
Wanna sell me on it
Don't try it
Don't pull me down with these games
I'd rather be flying
I'm fed up with you babe, so fed up with you babe

Show me who you are
(Show me pieces of your heart)
Tell me who you are
(Tell me secrets in the dark)
Show me who you are
(Show me pieces of your heart)
Tell me who you are
(Tell me secrets in the dark)

Love me still, yeah you love me still
Love me still, yeah you love me still

Why you scared to let me feel?
Send you up without a pill
You say I might be the one
You been looking for love

When I talk about it
Don't talk about it
You're lying
You wanna tell me stories
Wanna sell me on it
