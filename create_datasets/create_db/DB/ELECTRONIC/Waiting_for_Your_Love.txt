How can I explain
The sorrow and my pain
I believe that you and I should be
Together once again

Every night I pray
That you'll come back to me
But the tears keep falling down my face
When you're not around

But not no more
Gone away
All I do is wait for you
Each and every day

But not no more
Gone away
All I do is wait for you
Each and every day

Oh I'm waiting for your love
I'm wondering where you are
Are you with another guy
Are you showing him the world

Oh I'm waiting for your love
I want to see your smile
Brighten up my day
Yes I'm waiting for your love
Yes I'm waiting for your love

Didn't sleep last night
I'm waiting by the phone
Wondering where you are tonight
If you are alone

If I had another chance
I'd never let you go
My heart's been broken in two
And it's all because of you

But not no more
Gone away
All I do is wait for you
Each and every day

But not no more
Gone away
All I do is wait for you
Each and every day

Oh I'm waiting for your love
I'm wondering where you are
Are you with another guy
Are you showing him the world
Oh I'm waiting for your love

I want to see your smile
Brighten up my day
Yes I'm waiting for your love
Yes I'm waiting for your love

Oh I'm waiting for your love
I'm wondering where you are
Are you with another guy
Are you showing him the world

Oh I'm waiting for your love
I want to see your smile
Brighten up my day
Yes I'm waiting for your love
Yes I'm waiting for your love
