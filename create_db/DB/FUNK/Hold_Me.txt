[Chorus:]
Hold me, love me, give me all that you got
Tell me, truly, can I get in the right spot

For so long, I've waited, for you to come and love me
Don't waste my time, 'cause I need you
To let me know if you want me too
Do the things to you , that no other can do
(I want you too) I want you bad and I won't lie
And I can't deny that I want you tonight

[Chorus]

I wonder what is it that turns me on
When I'm next to you
Can't figure out why I want you 
Is it lust or love, either one will do
'Cause I want you for myself, and nobody else
(Take the place of you) of you right now
'Cause it is on, so unplug the phone
'Cause I want you to hold me

[Chorus x2]

Oh baby, drive me crazy, put your arms, round me baby
And hold me now, that's what I want to do
Right now baby, I want you to hold me

[Chorus to Fade]
