Where are the dreams that we once had?
This is the time to bring them back.
What were the promises caught
On the tips of our tongues?

Do we forget or forgive?
There's a whole other life waiting to be lived when
One day we're brave enough
To talk with conviction of the heart.

And down your streets I've walked alone,
As if my feet were not my own
Such is the path I chose,
Doors I have opened and closed

I'm so tired of living this life,
Fooling myself, believing we're right when
I've never given love
With any conviction of the heart.

One with the Earth, with the sky
I believe we'll survive
If we only try
How long must we wait to change

This world bound in chains that we live in
To know what it is to forgive,
And to be forgiven?
It's been too many years of talking now.

Isn't it time to stop somehow?
Air that's too angry to breathe
Water our children can't drink
You've heard it hundreds of times

You say you're aware, believe and you care, but
Do you care enough
To talk with conviction of the heart?
