I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. Mcgee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely

I was always busy doing something close 2 nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I meant 2todo her any harm

So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

Now rainy days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed

She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
I knew she knew how to get her kicks
