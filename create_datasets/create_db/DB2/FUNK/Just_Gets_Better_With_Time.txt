Can't wait till the sun goes down
I've been wanting to hold you
Counting the minutes you're not around
That's what's getting me through the day

Every thought that comes into my head
Is always centered around you
So glad to know that you're by my side
Wouldn't have it any other way

Just want to tell you how I'm feeling inside
Like I've been walking cloud number 9
Your love is rare and like the finest of wine
It just gets better with time
Said, it just gets better with time

Can't stop thinking about you, love
Got to have you around me
I pray for the moments when we touch
Such a sensation I can't explain

Just want to tell you how I'm feeling inside
Like I've been walking cloud number 9
Your love is rare and like the finest of wine
It just gets better with time
Said, it just gets better with time

Just want to tell you how I'm feeling inside
Like I've been walking cloud number 9
Your love is rare and like the finest of wine
It just gets better with time
Said, it just gets better with time

Just want to tell you how I'm feeling inside
Like I've been walking cloud number 9
Your love is rare and like the finest of wine
It just gets better with time
Said, it just gets better with time

Just want to tell you how I'm feeling inside
Like I've been walking cloud number 9
Your love is rare and like the finest of wine
It just gets better with time
Said, it just gets better with time
