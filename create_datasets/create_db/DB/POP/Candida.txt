Candida
Dawn 

The stars won't come out if they know that you're about
Cause they couldn't match the glow of your eyes
And, oh, who am I ? Just an ordinary guy
Tryin hard to win me first prize

[Chorus]
Oh my Candida
We could make it together
The further from here girl the better
Where the air is fresh and clean
Oh my Candida
Just take my hand and I'll lead ya
I promise that life will be sweeter
'Cause it said so in my dreams

The future looks bright, the gypsy told me so last night
Said she saw our children playing in the sunshine
And there were you and I in a house, baby, no lie
And all these things were yours, and they were mine

[Chorus x2]
