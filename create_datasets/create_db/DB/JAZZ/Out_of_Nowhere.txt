You came to me from out of nowhere
You took my heart and found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower for me

If you should go back to your nowhere
Leaving me with a memory
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you'll bring your love to me
