I've seen life through the eyes of a different soul
I left my past so my future would be under control
Now I' got nothin' standin' in my way
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
Whoa, I gave it all
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along
Now all my tears are dried away
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along

I feel so alive
Alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

How was I supposed to survive in this vast sea
I was so scared my own heat would try to abandon me
Now I' got nothin' standin' in my way
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along
Now all my fears have run away
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along

I feel so alive
Alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived
I feel so alive
Alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has revived

I feel so alive
(I feel a fire inside)
(It's like a whole new ride)
(I feel a sweet increase)
(Consuming all of me)

I feel so alive
Alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived
I feel so alive
Alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived
I feel so alive
