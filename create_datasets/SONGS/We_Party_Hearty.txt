When we party, we party hearty
When we boogie, we boogie-woogie
When we party, we party hearty
When we boogie, we boogie-woogie

Yeah, alright now, yeah
Givin' invitations to everybody, yeah
To come along with L.T.D. and party
Forget any troubles that you might have
Let yourself be free, get into the madness

Alright, yeah, I'm gonna go an' do that, do that, do that, do that
Let's tear the roof off if we can, yeah
Let's boogie down until the end

Hang up your hangups, they belong to yesterday
Listen to the music that we playin'
Because this song has been designed
With the people who party in mind
We've got a little thing for everyone to sing
So clap your hands and make it funky

Hey yeah
Hey yeah

When we party, we party hearty
When we boogie, we boogie-woogie
When we party, we party hearty
When we boogie, we boogie-woogie

I don't think there's anything that's better, yeah
Than a crowd of people singing, all together
And it especially makes me feel so happy, yeah
When you all join in and start to clap it

Because this song has been designed
With the people who party in mind
We've got a little thing for everyone to sing
So clap your hands and make it funky
