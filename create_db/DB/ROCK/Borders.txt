Whoo, ooh, ooh, whoo, ooh, ooh
Whoo, ooh, ooh, whoo, ooh, ooh

She's always trying' to work it out
Sitting' in a parked car
Music on the stereo is blaring out
Shutting out the world
People always say 'what you gonna do now'?
Are you gonna go far
Gonna follow your heart, till it stops?
She could never say why
'Cause she's leaving tonight
She would never say why
'Cause she's leavin'

Jessie always wanted to get away
Drive across a border, head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, blinded by the sun
Jessie are you gonna leave now?
Are you gonna leave town?

Whoo, ooh, ooh, whoo, ooh, ooh

It's funny how she hesitates
She wonders why she still cares
Tomorrow seems so far away
This moment could be hers
People always say 'what you gonna do now'?
Are you gonna go far
Gonna follow your heart, till it stops
She could never say why
'Cause she's leaving tonight
She would never say why
'Cause she's leavin'

Jessie always wanted to get away
Drive across a border, head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, blinded by the sun
Jessie are you gonna leave now?
Are you gonna leave town?

Looking for the answer, she won't be the last one out
Trying to get a head start, fight her way through the crowds
Right now

Whoo, ooh, ooh

Jessie always wanted to get away
Drive across a border, head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, blinded by the sun
Jessie don't leave it too long, too long now

Jessie always wanted to get away
Drive across a border, head out to the lakes
Life beside the water, blinded by the sun
Jessie are you gonna leave town?
