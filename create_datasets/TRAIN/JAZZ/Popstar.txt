Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to do the business
Someone's got to be the fool
Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to be the clown who's creating the sound and makes the world go round
 
I'm a topstar,rock star,shooting star,falling star,hero and a sample success
I got gold-plated toilet tissue
Money never is an issue
TV people call me as their guest (Scatting)

I got low hangin' trousers all the way to the top
All the things a home boy could ever be
My life is so upgraded
My ego's so inflated
That I've become an X-rated fantasy (Yeah)

Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to do the business
Someone's got to be the fool
Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to be the clown who's creating the sound and makes the world go round
 
I'm the Captain of Charisma and the Sultan of the Soul
I'm looking I can set you all free
Just look at me,it's plain to see
It's obvious,you must agree

I'm everything you'll ever want to be
I take my name as serious as any popstar can
I'm a leader and an icon and a revolution man
I'm starring in a video I'm to hot to flop
I'm the goal of every seeker and my ratings never drop
 
Well I'm rising to the top and you can see I'm really hot
And you know I'm everything I portray
I'm so hip-slickin' cool and so charismic as a rule
That I don't take the time to finish what I say

Popstar,lollipop,popsicle,hall of fame
Look at me,I'm bigger than life
I've got patent leather shoes and I never pay my booze
And I don't sing the blues or take a wife

Everthing you've heard me say so far is a joke
An open mind and sense of humour is our only hope
I want to say just one more thing before I move along
I betcha really glad we're near the end on the song

I leave you now,take a bow
Hope you all agree
A popstar isn't everything it's cracked up to be
If I have to do anything it's what I want to say
A pop is an explosion,all you've got is you today

Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to do the business
Someone's got to be the fool
Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to be the clown who's creating the sound and makes the world go round
 
(With Scatting Over)
Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to do the business
Someone's got to be the fool
Someone's got to be the hero
Someone's got to do the job
Someone's got to be the clown who's creating the sound and makes the world go round

Too hot to flop,too hot to flop (Just look at me)
Too hot to flop,too hot to flop (Yeah)
Too hot to flop,too hot to flop (Just look at me)
Too hot to flop,too hot to flop
