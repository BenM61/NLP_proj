We've all got troubles
We all make mistakes 
But let's not take a little river
Turn it into a lake
We've all been humbled
We've lost and we've found
But it can never get the best of us
If we're not looking down

And I wonder
Are there others like me
Yeah I wonder
I've got the whole world left to see

Hey Everybody 
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now 
By stomping our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty
While we're keeping it clean

You've got it bad 
Well she's got it worse
She's got no chocolate in the bank account
No cheese in the purse
You feel neglected, with no self-esteem
Just when you finally found your glitter
Someone's taken the gleam

And I wonder
Why is life always this way
Yes I wonder
Could there be a brighter day

Hey Everybody 
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now 
By stomping our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty
While we're keeping it clean

And I wonder now
(Can we work it out)
And I wonder now
(Ad lib bit)

Hey Everybody 
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now 
By stomping our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty
While we're keeping it clean

Hey Everybody
If we're gonna take a stand
Now let the world hear you
By clapping your hands

Hey everybody 
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now 
By stomping our feet

Na na na na na na ...
