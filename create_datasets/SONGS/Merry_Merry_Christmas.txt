Ever you ready, brother unite us
Ever you been bad, all the united

Woo, Christmas time with you
I made a little list of my favorite things to do
I count one, two, three four, up to ten
From the beginning until the end
Celebrating merry, merry Christmas time with you

So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
'Cause I spent it with you
So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
'Cause I spent it with you

Hey
Sometimes you just need to be with the one you love
Christmas just ain't Christmas without the ones you love
That's what we used to say, woo
'Cause I spent it with you
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You ain't sweatin', you ain't doin' it right
