Before, did life mean anything before today? 
Was I contented in my way? 
Sweet feelings are stealing all over me
I'm feeling this is how I want to be

Before, was there no laughter here inside my heart?
Who chose your smile to play the part of sunshine
Inside the world that is mine
And you're the only thing in my mind

You, you seem to know me very well 
I have no reason to pretend
With you there is no emptiness of time
No mountains to climb
To prove what I am

Before, was there this miracle of life in me? 
I can't explain that mystery
Without you, is half a life time ago
And you're the only life that I know
