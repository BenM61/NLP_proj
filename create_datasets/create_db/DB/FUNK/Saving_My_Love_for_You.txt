You said you want me, baby, I'm glad
I feel so good now, 'cause you're not mad
Please believe me, I'm saving my love for you

We'll be together, and it won't be long
I'll make you love me from that day on
Please believe me, I'm saving my love for you

Can't you remember last September?

We kissed and we said goodbye
I pretended that I was happy
But, darling, I wanted to cry

We'll be together, and it won't be long
I'll make you love me from that day on
Please believe me, I'm saving my love for you
