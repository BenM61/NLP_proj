Flying through the air
Side by side we dip bend and climb
Flying through the air so free
Feel them left behind below us

Flying through the air
Mad old you and me we are going
At it just for kicks for kicks
You'll see

That they'll wish they were you
Right along here with me
You and me
Climbing through the sky

Leaving all our thoughts faraway,
Climbing feel the stars up here
Touch your eyes and fall beside you
Side by side we soar

Me and you just glide
We are gaming in a fall a fall a fall
We feel,
But it's all in your mind

As we turn round and climb
Right back here
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Great whit silver bird
Soars again to catch good old mister sun who hides who hides
Who hides for fun
But it's all in the game

Life is still all the same
Here we go.
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Flying through the air
Oh oh oh oh oh
