Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats (if I let you go)
Benz and the house off the coast (if I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the VVS stones (if I let you go)
Coupes in the 'Bach Carter rolls (if I let you go)
She go profit everything I taught (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel, when I know what I know
And my female intuition, telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames, I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations, what you mean you gon' choke? (oh)

You can't stay, you gotta go (oh)
Ain't no other chick spendin' yo' dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would have saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats (if I let you go)
Benz and the house off the coast (if I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the VVS stones (if I let you go)
Coupes in the 'Bach Carter rolls (if I let you go)
She go profit everything I taught (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on (oh)

He's so arrogant and bold (oh)
But she gone love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats (if I let you go)
Benz and the house off the coast (if I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the VVS stones (if I let you go)
Coupes in the 'Bach Carter rolls (if I let you go)
She go profit everything I taught (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you (ooh)
Why would you risk it baby is that the price I that pay? (Ooh)
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me 
And not see all the things (see all the things, see all the things)

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats (if I let you go)
Benz and the house off the coast (if I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the VVS stones (if I let you go)
Coupes in the 'Bach Carter rolls (if I let you go)
She go profit everything I taught (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go
