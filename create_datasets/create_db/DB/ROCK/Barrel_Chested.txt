I'm broken down and barrel chested again
Some people try for all their lives but they never make a dent
You hang around broke, bored and restless again
Strung out stripped of all your pride with all your money spent

But it's not the same when you're not here
Let me make that picture clear
It's not the same when you're not around
I'm left alone here in this town
But it's just as lame for you,
When you leave me feeling so damn cold
I'm wishing we could both get old before
Either one of us pass this way again

And it's not the same when you're not with me, my dear
I've been trying all night long make that picture clear
Still, whose to blame if you don't miss me when I'm not here
Cartoons, clowns and run down towns tend to lose their
charms over the years

But it's not the same when you're not here
Let me make that picture clear
But it's just as lame for you,
When you leave me feeling so damn cold
I'm wishing we could both get old before
Either one of us pass this way again

But it's not the same when you're not here
Let me make that picture clear
It's not the same when you're not around
I'm left alone here in this town
And it's not the same when you don't call
It's not the same that way at all
But it's just as lame for you,
When you leave me feeling so damn cold
I'm wishing we could both get old before
Either one of us pass this way again
