Well you can ride on the crest of a wave,
If that's where you want to be,
But does the look on your face,
Mean you're really feeling happy?
Or do you feel like you're standing on a wooden leg,
Or a poor man much to proud to beg,
Or a page from a book that can't be read at all?

You gotta see by the way that they are talking,
That it's time for you to pick up your grip... start walking,
'Cause they want to see your long ... legs flying,
Go to the place where the earth meets the sky and,
Don't stop to turn around and wave goodbye at all.

They won't be satisfied, 
Till you're out of their sight,
But I wonder how will they feel,
With a deck of cards,
And you're not around to deal, yeah.

They won't be satisfied, 
Till you're out of their sight,
But I wonder how will they feel,
With a deck of cards,
You're not around to deal?
You're not around to deal.

Well, they say it's a lie, a joke that you are living,
But you know one thing they don't, you won't give in.
'Cause you're like a cat, chasin' its tail,
Makes a million circles, but you're gonna fail,
Look down you just don't understand.

Well you can ride on the crest of a wave,
If that's where you want to be,
But does the look on your face,
Mean you're really feeling happy?
Well,  do you feel like you're standing on a wooden leg,
A poor man much to proud to beg,
Or a page from a book that can't be read at all?

Well, do you feel like you're standing on a wooden leg,
Or a poor man much to proud to beg,
Or a page from a book that can't be read at all?
Read at all.
