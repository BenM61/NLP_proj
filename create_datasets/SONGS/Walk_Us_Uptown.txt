Will you walk us uptown
And wherever you go
You know we will follow
Will you walk us uptown
And we'll stand in the light
Of your new killing ground
And we won't make a sound

Except to sing our sorrow
Will you walk us uptown
While our tears run in torrents
To suffer in silence
Or pray for some solace

Will you wash away our sins
In the cross-fire
And cross-currents
As you uncross your fingers
And take out some insurance

No matter what the price
It's your own paradise
Will you walk us uptown
Will you walk us uptown

Some hearts are sinking &
Some hearts are a-flutter
Some scoop gold
From the dirt in the gutter
Or swallow the earth
Pouring into your mouth
As they bury us upright saying
"Everything's alright"

Will you walk us uptown
Like some said you could
We will feat on your flesh
And drink down your blood
Will you haul down that flag
And dishonor that vow
Cos we must not change
It's color now
Will you walk us uptown

No matter what the price
Each crushed in the corner
Of their own paradise
Will you walk us uptown
Will you walk us uptown

That's always assuming
That you're partly divine
And partly human
Your the king of our hearts
Your the clown with the drum
Will you walk us uptown
If we promise not to run

Will you walk us uptown
Will you gather us near
As cowards flee
And traitors sneer
Keep a red flag flying
Keep a blue flag as well
And a white flag in case
It all goes to hell
