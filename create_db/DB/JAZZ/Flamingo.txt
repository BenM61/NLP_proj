Flamingo, like a flame in the sky
Flying over the island
To my lover nearby

Flamingo, with your tropical hue
For it's you I rely on
And the love that is true

The wind sings a song to you as you go
The song that I hear below
The murmuring heart

Flamingo, when the sun meets the sea
Say farewell to my lover
And hasten to me

Ah, oh, ah, oh, oh, oh
Flamingo
Flamingo

Flamingo, when the sun meets the sea
Say farewell to my lover
And hasten to me

Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
