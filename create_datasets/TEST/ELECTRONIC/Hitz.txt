I make hitz, not the public
I tell the DJ what to play! Understand?

Baa baa black sheep, rock star, rap G
Make enough dough to own a black card, that's deep
I've been getting real fucking friendly with the banks man
And I don't mean Phil card or Hilary ya asking
P'hapz see me up in the vicinity and flash me
I'm the definition of definitive and catchy
The only thing that's bigger, quicker, slicker
More black and more upper London is a taxi

Bitch I'm so sick, I need a mother fucking vaccine
Pick your ring style like some other fucking fast weed
Centre of attention like a Bang & Olufsen
Hey Steevie reaching for a flat screen
The only ever time I see you niggers on kisses is like 2am or when you go to pucker up
Look 60 GM4 you need to buckle up
All my women so soon, all my women so nuts

So what and uncut and no fucking edits
She won't even get a high if she made no fucking effort

And all you silly singers and you ring tone rappers
Like school dinner curries
Don't fucking get it

My car is a unleaded
Got a yard with a terrace
She called me chauvinistic
But she can't even spell it
I don't wanna hear another nigga say you fly
If you ain't never been on business class on the Emirates

I'm a racket, I'm tennis
I'm Dennis, I'm a menace
Call me Rob Patterson, I got a lot of niggas jealous
I'm a mentos mint in a can of Dr Pepper
That's tick, tick, tick, tick, boom to you fellas

It's so important that your mighty Nigella
Ain't listening if her name ain't Remi or stella
Got a big bag of chips and Mary Poppin's umbrella
Cause we're 'bout to rain on them like London weather
