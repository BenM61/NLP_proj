Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Love's gonna come back home

Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Love's gonna come back home

Well, it knocked me off my feet
Lost my wave and lost my beat
Love's gonna come back home

Well, I ain't no man of faith
But I know what I've been saying
Love's gonna come back home

Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Love's gonna come back home

Into darkness we are thrown
But we rise again a ton
Love's gonna come back home

To be the man you need
I got to set you free
Love's gonna come back home

Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Love's gonna come back home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home

Bring it on down, everything's on for grabs now
Bring it on down
Bring it right on down

Bring it on down, everything's on for grabs now
Bring it on down
Bring it right on down

Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home

Feels like a new morning, new morning
Feels like a new morning
Love's gonna come back home

Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Feels like a new morning
Love's gonna come back home, you know it

Love's gonna come back home, you feel it
Love's gonna come back home, I know it
Love's gonna come back home
