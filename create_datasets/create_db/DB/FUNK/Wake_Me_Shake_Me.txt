Why don't you, wake me, shake me
Don't let me sleep too late
Gotta get up in the
About a quarter to eight
I'm bound to my job
My boss is a big fat slob
Can't even be a minute late
Or the boss'll blow his gate

Why don't you, wake me, shake me
Don't let me sleep too late
Gotta get up in the
About a quarter to eight
I'm bound to my garbage truck
My boss is a big fat slob
Can't even be a minute late
Or the boss'll blow his gate

Had a dream
