I don't want you to be no slave  
I don't want you to work all day
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you 
love to you 
love to you 
love to you 

I don't want you to wash my clothes
I don't want you to keep our home
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you 
love to you 
love to you 
love to you 

I can tell by the way you switch and walk
I can tell by the way you baby talk
I can see by the way you treat your man
I can love you baby until it's a crying shame

I don't want you to cook my bread
I don't want you to make my bed
I don't want you cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you 
love to you 
love to you 
love to you 

I can tell by the way you switch and walk
I can tell by the way you baby talk
I can see by the way you treat your man
I can love you baby until it's a crying shame

I don't want you to cook my bread
I don't want you to make my bed
I don't want you cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you 
love to you 
love to you 
love to you 

Let me make love to you
Let me make love to you
Let me make love to you
