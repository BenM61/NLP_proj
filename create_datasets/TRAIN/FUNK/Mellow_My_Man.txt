One two 
Yes, The Roots layin' back, real-xin 
Coolin' out with my man Malik be	 
We call him Sla-xon 
YaknowhatI'msayin? We in effect 
Mo like Al B. Sure, for your pleasure 
Aiyyo bust it 
We about to flip it on some ol' laid back, mellow my man tip 
We gon' set it like this 
Yo check it 

Bust it, La Di Da Di, who likes to party 
Like Slick Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick 
Got soul like those afro picks, with the black fist 
And leave a crowd drippin' like John the Baptist, it's 
The cause of that "Oh shit!" 
The skits I kick, flows like catfish 
And got many emcees on the blacklist 
I'm sharp as a cactus plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics 
Us, Roots is really true to that rap shit 
Now holla to the scholarly, street skats that follow me 
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies 
Max that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach 
Offender want to go like Meshach, Black 
Thought the nappy cat a bookworm shoe styles like sperm 
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn 
The herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand 
Of my mellow my man, Malik be	 

Here I goes, negroes best to know the flower 
The professional, best in those skills that kills so uhh
Whoa, slow down before you go down (sissy) 
Trixie this is Agatha Christie your slain and know now 
Next contender, Malik's the axe offender 
Critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the 
Microphones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats 
Put him in a quote, when he croaks 
They sayin', isn't it, is it the negro that did it? 
'Cause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit' 
I exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny forms 
(And we're in, your neighborhood) on the norms 
Capture, was to, whack ya 
Manu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rapture 
I figured, perhaps ya, a say it slam 
For my mellow my man 

The way we do it like this 
That, for my mellow my man 
It's like that for my mellow my man 
No no we do it like that 
This, for my mellow my man 
It's like this for my mellow my man 
No no we do it like this 
That, for my mellow my man 
It's like that for my mellow man 
No no we do it like that 
This, for my mellow my man 
It's like this for my mellow my man 

Yo, I got spunk, plus funk 
And Jump Like Punks, to Get Beat Down 
Turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool 
Deeper than the pool than Wilt the Stilt 
Damn near drowned in clowns bounce to sound 
When Thoughts pound 
And brown's, my complexion section Southern 
My brother-in is Jex, I 
Sweats no sex, cause this kid gets 
Grits n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed 
When your heart spit up, dip dup damn 
Yo I lost it but 
Back is the Black Boogey Man 
Manic mad musician, maker of noise 
That's jocked, by your homeboys 
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around 
I was lost but was found, now I gets down 
From Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit 
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound 
I kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can 
To my mellow my man, Malik be	 

Whoa, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks (uh-huh) 
Abruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts 
In wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap em 
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap em 
Negroes know we be furrow to my borough 
Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald 
Too strong to be sterile 
So I impregnates the greats (say what?) 
Bust the Pacino's, I won't trust them 
Even though I lust them shapes -- females for retail prices 
Twice this nice, this witch sure does her spices 
I won't smirk, cause my name's not Urkel 
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle 
You want to turn and page your eyes, and try to plagiarize 
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya 
Microphones I grip equipped to flip the hyp-ocrites 
And nit-wits, with tidbit skits, them ain't
That was a curse, but I divide it in half 
Gets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin the wrath 
Of Malik, aiyyo get tragic, negroes that get dramatic 
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict 
So if you can not rap I will just slap YOU 
If you wants to pick up on your nose be shows the chrome 
And then we cap, YOU 
It's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true check 
For my mellow my man 

The way we do it like this 
That, for my mellow my man 
It's like that for my mellow my man 
No no we do it like that 
This, for my mellow my man 
It's like this for my mellow my man 
No no we do it like this 
That, for my mellow my man 
It's like that for my mellow man 
No no we do it like that

My mellow my man, right 
My mellow my man, uhh 
My mellow my man, right 
My mellow my man my mellow my man my mellow my man my mellow my man 
For Scott Storch, my mellow my man 
Leonard Hubbard on the bass, my mellow my man 
B.R.O.T.H.E.R. ? on the drums, my mellow my man 
Gotta end it on the one, my mellow my man 
Check it
