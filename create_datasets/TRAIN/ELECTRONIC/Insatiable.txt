Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My
My-y-y
Love-y-y-y-y
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love

Turn the lights off
Strike a candle
No one that I've ever
Knows how to handle 
My body
The way you truly do
Insatiable's my name, when it comes to you

I got a Jones, Martha
Oh yeah, it be like this
(I can't have a hug) I can't have a hug (unless)
Unless I have a kiss, ooh

My body, baby, you truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes to you

Like a wildcat, Martha, in a celibate rage
I want your love, in my dirty little cage
Can you understand, Martha? 

Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo
My body, baby, you truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes to you

Tonight we video
No one will ever know
We'll erase the naughty bits
I'll show my-
If you show your-

I can't help it, Martha
(Instatiable) I can't help what you do to me
You are
My every fantasy

There's no telling how far I'd go
'Cause when it comes to you, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty I would drink every drop

Please, baby, don't say no
'Cause I'll surely go
Crazy

Okay
So all you do, is push the little red button
And I belong to you
And your little video box
Hey, don't look at the clock, yeah
It's two forty-five
We got all night
First you gotta tell me what you want me to do

My body, baby, you truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes to you
There's no tellin' how far I'd go (this is true)
'Cause when it comes to you, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty I would drink every drop

So take it slow baby, and let's unwind
Do you really want all my clothes off? (yes) 
What are you gonna do to prove it then? (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Aren't you afraid we're gonna be found out?
Well, let's get on with the show 
Turn the lights down low (lower)
Doesn't my body look good in the shadows?
Baby knows what to do
Have you done this before?
(I don't know)
You say you want my hips up in the air? (yeah)
I don't know, I don't care 

Ooh, My body, baby, you truly do
I know I could be nasty with you
(Oh, oh , oh, oh, oh, oh, aah!)

Up and down, just like a seesaw (back and forth)
(Back and forth) 
Listen (oh girl, I'm fallin') I love you, baby

I love you baby
You're mine
You're nastier than I thought
It's just two forty-nine
