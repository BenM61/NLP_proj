If you're ugly, i'm ugly too
In your eyes the sky's a different blue
If you could see yourself like others do
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you

And i wish i was a camera sometimes
So, i could take your picture with my mind
Put it in a frame for you to see
How beautiful you really are to me

Ugly, ugly
All of us just feel like that somedays
Ain't no rainbow in the sky
When you feel u.g.l.y.
And that's ugly, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ugly, ugly
All of us just feel like that somedays
Ain't no rainbow in the sky
When you feel u.g.l.y.
And that's ugly, ugly
All of us just feel like that somedays
Ain't no cure that you can buy
When you feel u.g.l.y.
And that's ugly

So, if you're ugly, i'm ugly too
If you're a nut, then i must be a screw
If you couls see yourself the way i do
You'd wish you were as beautiful as you
I wish i was as beautiful as you
