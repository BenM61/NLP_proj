I hear a lot of stories, I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do to you
High is the risk of striking out, the risk of getting hurt
And still I have so much to learn

I know 'cause I think about it all the time
I know that real love is quite a price

And a good heart these days is hard to find
A good heart, true love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high, I blame that on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

I know 'cause I learn a little everyday
I know 'cause I listen when the experts say

And a good heart these days is hard to find
A good heart, true love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now, I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days is hard to find

I know it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will all be worth it in the end

And a good heart these days is hard to find
A good heart, true love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

And a good heart these days is hard to find
A good heart, true love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

With this heart of mine
