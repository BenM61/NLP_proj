I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit bout how to give and take
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I'm a young soul
In this very strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout what is true and fake
But why all this hate?
Try to communicate
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

This is a happy end
'Cause you don't understand
Everything you have done
Why's everything so wrong?
This is a happy end
Come and give me your hand
I'll take you far away

I'm a new soul
I came to this straight world
Hoping I could learn a bit bout how to give and take
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake

I'm a new soul (la, la, la, la)
In this very strange world
Every possible mistake
Possible mistake
Every possible mistake
Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes
Take take take take take take a mistake
Take, take a mistake
Take, take a mistake
(oh oh oh oh)

(oh oh oh oh)
