I know I want you, I'm tired of cryin
I can't help the way you feel
No time like the present, let's not waste a minute
I can give it, and I can take it...how bout you?
I just wanna make it up don't wanna fake it
I just wanna shake it up shake it shake it shake it

Now the bottles empty, storms passin over
I've been alone here too long in my room
There's no fields of clover
No white clouds driftin over
I wanna be where the sun shines on you
I just wanna make it up, don't wanna fake it
I just wanna shake it up shake it shake it shake it

If you think I'm crazy, or just a bit too lazy
Well that ain't been my main excuse
I don't wanna hide, these feelings inside me
I just wanna share them all with you
I just wanna make it up, don't wanna fake it
I just wanna shake it up shake it shake it shake it
