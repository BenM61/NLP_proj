How I wished my folks were gracious hosts
And not dismayed
But wit and wisdom take a back seat, girl
When you're that afraid

Oh, no! Bring her home and the folks look ill
My word, they can't forget, they never will
They can hear the stormtroops on our lawn
When I show her in
And the Fuehrer is alive and well
In our panelled den...
Oh, no! Bring her home and the folks look ill
My word, they can't forget that war, what a war!

My word, she's from Germany
Well, it's the same old country
But the people have changed
My word, Germany
With its splendid castles and fine cuisine

Well, the car I drive is parked outside
It's German-made
They resent that less than the people
Who are German-made
Oh, no! Bring her home and the folks look ill
My word, they can't forget that war
What a war, some war!

My word, she's from Germany
Well, it's the same old country
But the people have changed
My word, Germany
With its splendid castles and fine cuisine

It's lovely German women and it's wonderful rivers
That do flow from her hills

My word, she's from Germany
Well, it's the same old country
But the people have changed
My word, Germany
With its splendid castles and fine cuisine

Its lovely German women and...
You and me!
