Would it make you feel better if I lied?
Try to hide the truth inside
If I could only tell you

Would it make you feel better if I left?
Thought of me as second best
Someone you knew from years ago

When everything you've ever known
Comes crashing down you feel alone
I sit and change the channels and complain

Would it work out? Would you come back?
What if the empty feeling still remains?
Somewhere in time when I see you
Would it be close enough to feel the pain?
'cause I could hardly stand it, what else can I do

Would it make you feel angry if I confessed
To all the things I never said
Words I could never tell you

Let's just keep it simple
Let it rest
Maybe I won't be depressed
And you're better off without me

When everything is touch and go
You're falling down, you're feelin' low
And things are getting stranger everyday

Would it work out? Would you come back?
What if the empty feeling still remains?
Somewhere in time when I see you
Would it be close enough to feel the pain?

Would it work out? Would you come back?
What if the empty feeling still remains?
Somewhere in time when I see you
Would it be close enough to feel the pain?
'cause I could hardly stand it, what else can I do

Go, go, go, go

When everything you've ever known
Comes crashing down you feel alone
I sit and change the channels and complain

Would it work out? Would you come back?
What if the empty feeling still remains?
Somewhere in time when I see you
Would it be close enough to feel the pain?

Would it work out? Would you come back?
What if the empty feeling still remains?
Somewhere in time when I see you
Would it be close enough to feel the pain?
'cause I could hardly stand it, what else can I do
