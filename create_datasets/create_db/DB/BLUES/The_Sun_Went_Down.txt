when the sun rose this morning i was standing in the back door cryin
i didn't know where to find my baby
and I almost lost my mind

when the sun set this evening 
i was standing in the same old place
i felt so much the better
after seeing my baby's smilin face

wish i had a heaven, a heaven of my own
well i wish i had a heaven
a heaven of my own
I'd give all you girls a real nice happy home
