Music is a language lovers understand
Melody and romance wander hand in hand
Cupid never fails assisted by a band
So if you have something sweet to tell her

Say it with music
Beautiful music

Somehow they'd rather be kissed
To the strains of Chopin or Liszt

A melody mellow
Played on a cello

Helps mister Cupid along
So say it with a beautiful song

There's a tender message deep down in my heart
Something you should know, but how am I to start?
Sentimental speeches never could impart
Just exactly what I want to tell you
