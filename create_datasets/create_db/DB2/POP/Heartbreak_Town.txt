This night is empty without you
Streets are crowded
Neon lightenin' flashin' blue
I see lovers passin' by
Feel the passion in their eyes
And that fire leaves me cold
Down at Union Station an old train brakes
And I hate the sound it makes
I've never felt so all alone
It's just another night
In Heartbreak Town

When this town belonged to you and me
The streets were paved in gold
Like heaven's gonna be
And all the promises we made
Down at Riverside Cafe
We held on to the end
In the distance I hear sirens cry
It cuts right through this heart of mine
Oh here it comes again
It's just another night
In Heartbreak Town

I know somewhere far from here
All the pain'll disappear
I'd be there now if only I had wings to fly

Down at Union Station an old train brakes
And I hate the sound it makes
I've never felt so all alone
It's just another night
Oh just another night
Just another night
In Heartbreak Town
