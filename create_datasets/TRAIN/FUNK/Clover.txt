Gonna send a message how I feel 
To the lady that's for real 
Done thought it over 
Feels real fine 
Her name is Clover in my mind 

Gotta send this message on my mind 
Can't shake this feelin' 
Ain't hard to find, 
Oh Clover, Mystery come to my resque 
Make sense of me 

Oh think, I love her... 
In my heart's... 
A Clover
