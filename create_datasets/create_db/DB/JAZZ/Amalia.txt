Well when you wake in the morning
Little eyes open wide
When there's no tender warning
No surprises, no surprise

Maybe your wing may be broken
Maybe you're learning to fly
Well so am I

Amalia, finding a way out on the open road
Amalia, going whichever way the wind gon' go
Amalia, taking your chances on the open sea
Amalia, open the breeze they're gonna carry me

Maybe fate, maybe reason
Made you fall from the sky
Like the tide, like the seasons
Ever changing, you and I

So where do you go when worry takes you?
Where do you go when somebody makes you cry?

Amalia, finding a way out on the open road
Amalia, going whichever way the wind gon' go
Amalia, taking your chances on the open sea
Amalia, such a funny little bird and you're now with me
