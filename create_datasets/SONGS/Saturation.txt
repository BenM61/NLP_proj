Colour, in the shade of winters' tide.
I'm not waiting.
Diving, diving down.
Nothing left for star gazing, tonight.
Now I know you're diving;
Diving down to the sea,
Faster than the chill that follows me.

Black and white, through rust and powdered eyes.
I'm not waiting.
Nothing to no one.
Always old, and always realize
That you're fading.
Nothing to no one, you'll stay,
Waiting for the rain.
And all that you knew,
Was divided in two.

If you run a thousand miles away,
You'll never see the day
That longed to wait.
The night, we saturate,
The stars will never shine again.
And now forever's
Running to the end,
To take you back again.

If you run a thousand miles away,
You'll never see the day
That longed to wait.
The night we saturate,
The stars will never shine again.
And now forever's
Running to the end,
To take you back again.
