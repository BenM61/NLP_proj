Hello, my love
It's getting cold on this island
I'm sad alone
I'm so sad on my own

The truth is
We were much too young
Now I'm looking for you
Or anyone like you

We said goodbye
With the smile on our faces
Now you're alone
You're so sad on your own

The truth is
We ran out of time
Now you're looking for me
Or anyone like me
