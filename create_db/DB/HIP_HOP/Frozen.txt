"How can I forget you" 4x 

[Slick Rick] 
Rick the Ruler  Raekwon  hehe the Chef  check one two 

[Raekwon] 
Touch more  taste a glass of oil 
Flash yours Rae 
Money we saw  left em dead on the door  dick 
Rots look chunky on the index 
Straight up  Lee vets and like old Adidas sweats 
We the the illest vets 

[Slick Rick] 
Apologies  even a non dog holler "he's honor" 
Please  appreciate shit I clog Wallabee's 
Brothas wit they fists like oaks wood 
Provokes doom, and you're also about to go broke soon 

[Raekwon] 
Mad current merchants, we nursed it 
Bad guerillas, feed us like guaranteed they gon' kill us 
Fleeing, ninety in a night suit, G-ing white dudes 
Hit the locks first, we made a right troop 

[Slick Rick] 
I'm lushin Russian women, via satellite I'm watchin 
I dare a nigga say he want to battle me, I'll crush ya 
Even blind girls rush next to Hammera and scream out 
"Oh my gosh, get the camera" 

Chorus[Raekwon] 
Yo we frozen, lay on the bount now, we a day on 
Ill niggas yellin "Throw Rick and Rae on" 
Hydro, how did I blow, how did I flow 
Did I glow, let them niggas know 

[Slick Rick] 
(Yo) 
Rap wars commence and they kids cause offense 
I don't have to say a word and your bitch-drawers are drenched 
Didn't say I was gonna murder the fella 
But The Ruler got some shit the could stop a herd of gorillas 

[Raekwon] 
Stressed wit Hollywood hoes, actin up 
Backin up, what? This yours, what? 
Crawlin in the cut, we lee major 
Gems on wit Timbs, brims on drawn to lay you up 
Layin in the day wit what? 

[Slick Rick] 
Next pull up CEO wit bank books full up 
Even though he's overwhelmed, this nigga Rolls Royce pull up 
One of the baddest come, noddin to a Spanish song 
Slung, orange woolridge park and a Savannah pump 

[Raekwon] 
Severe teaspoons, scary money on the moon 
Lampin wit a big goon, keep shit tight like a kid's room 
Big Bird in the driveway, bullet out Friday 
I'm liver that way, I ride only the fly way 
Olive-green thinkin, ship sinkin 
Deep-dish thinkin, big fish tank, wrist full of Franklins 
This mock-neck, shark-skin money 
Eighty-eight, summer reader dun ?dummeries? 
Rock dungarees 

[Slick Rick] 
Punctures his lung, son says "I don't want this" 
Even this so-so beat I make monstrous 
Lady cops stake to watch pair hoods 
"Freeze, you're under arrest, you look mad good" 
Hot and don't fret retard who won't let the new sherifs in town 
What part you don't get? 
Rick and Rae, and now we storin the passion 
The fashion, the dress, I went to work on your ass 

Chorus 2x
