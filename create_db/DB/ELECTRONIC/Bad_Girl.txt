A silent conversation passes through the world 
A million voices who are never really heard 
A thousand reasons why our self-esteem can't stand 
A million women let it slip right through their hands 
Don't show me anger ''cause your anitudes could change 
That glass ceiling should be radically erased 
I'm trying to show you that as friends we'd get along 
Respect my body ''cause that's where you came from 
This is not a love song X4
Oh you gotta be a bad girl in this world 
And you've got to make waves 
Go an be a bad girl to be heard 
Assen your wicked ways 
Gone be a bad girl in this world 
And you've got to make waves 
Go an be a bad girl to be heard 
And that's what I say 
It's just on loan to you it's my identity 
I'd love to love you if you give it back to me 
Don't criticize me ''cause I know it's overdue 
I've learned my lessons my lessons well by following your moves 
This is not a love song X4
Oh you gone be a bad girl in this world 
And you've got to make waves 
Oh you gotta be a bad girl in this world 
And that's what I say 
That's what I say 
This is not a love song
