Try to save it but it doesn't come off the rug
Try to build a wall that is high enough

It's all boiling over
It's all boiling over

Try to save your house
Try to save your songs
Try to run but it follows you up a hill

It's all boiling over
It's all boiling over
Your loved ones
Your loved ones

A normal conversation
A normal conversation
(you should have took me out when you had the chance)
(you should have took me out when you had the chance)
All the rooms renumbered
And losers turned away
(you should have took me out when you had the chance)
Don't turn away
(you should have took me out when you had the chance)
Don't turn away
