We been gone for such a long time that I'm almost afraid to go home
A long road is a long, dragged-out imagination where things can go wrong
But we keep rolling on

I know I'm no doctor but if I was guessing I'd say it was just growing pains
And painful as growing is we can't forget it's our ticket to taking the reins
And we'll all be okay, we'll be okay

Dusty trails can lead you to a golden road, I've been told
Can't remember who it was but all she spoke
Will a penny for her thoughts leave me broke?
'Cause everyone's around and I'm still alone
Everyone's around right now and I'm still alone

It's all in the manual that we've been writing, a future instructional guide
If we skip to add to our prefufilled dreams, we'd be lost without our own advice
We'll be alright, we'll be alright

Dusty trails can lead you to a golden road, I've been told
Can't remember who it was but all he spoke
Will a penny for his thoughts leave me broke?
'Cause everyone's around and I'm still alone
Everyone's around right now and I'm still alone

I'm halfway to misery
Some say when you go halfway there's still plenty of time to return
Oh, am I halfway to heaven?
Some may say when you go halfway, you only have halfway to go

Dusty trails can lead you to a golden road, I've been told
Can't remember who it was but all he spoke
Will a penny for his thoughts leave me broke?
'Cause everyone's around and I'm still alone
Everyone's around right now and I'm still alone
