This is our time
They go fearless shine
As the dawn brings
The world wakes
Catch you in my eye
Nothing can touch
Where we've been tonight
As the sun moves to cross you
Standing in our half light
(In the half light)
We go home
What we feel tonight (What we feel tonight)

(We go home)
What we feel tonight
In the half light
(We go home)
What we feel tonight

This is our time
They go fearless shine
As the dawn brings
The world wakes
Catch you in my eye
Nothing can touch
Where we've been tonight
As the sun moves to cross you
Standing in our half light

In the half light
(We go home)
What we feel tonight

In the half light
(We go home)
What we feel tonight (What we feel tonight)
(We go home)
(What we feel tonight)

This is our time
They go fearless shine
As the dawn brings
The world wakes
Catch you in my eye
Nothing can touch
Where we've been tonight
As the sun moves to cross you
Standing in our half light
In the half light
(We go home)
What we feel tonight
In the half light
(We go home)
What we feel tonight
