I'm so ignorant 'cause I done played my last tears 
And pain is bliss been through so many things
It's hard to resist a mind that's currently
Thinking on his last wish it's nothing to f*ck with
When I know what I want because you must think I'm a fool
Claiming you love what I do and be out playing the Rule
Bad move, more cars, more hoes, more jewels, and I'd love
Nothin' more than to see you (6 Feet Underground) doesn't
Matter how we gonna get outta weed rollin' it outta mindows
Nor from Adam? but we show them uh now we leave them niggas
Creating a deal let it open so won't be goin' (6 Feet Underground)
Because I've feel I've cursed
My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin' more than to see my niggas eat with me

Sort of a sacrifice money, bitches, and ice.
But f*ck it whoa whoa something let me 
Still to something ride 125 in a low low frontin'
It's free will emotion you know I'm high flickin' ashes
At police while I'm ridin' by I'm ghetto I don't fear
Is deeper than love if you want to get it nigga then 
Come on nigga get it in blood because I've feel I've cursed
My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin' more than to see my niggas eat with me
But my enemies want nothin' more than to see me (6 Feet Underground)
