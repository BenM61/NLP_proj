When you cry, be sure to dry your eyes,
Cause better days are sure to come.
And when you smile, be sure to smile wide,
And don't let them know that they have won.
And when you walk, walk with pride,
And don't show the hurt inside,
Because the pain sill soon be gone.

[Chorus]
And when you dream, dream big,
As big as the ocean, blue.
Cause when you dream it might come true.
For when you dream, dream big.

And when you laugh, be sure to laugh out loud,
Cause it will carry all your cares away.
And when you see, see the beauty all around and in yourself,
And it will help you feel okay.
And when you pray, pray for strength to help to carry on,
But when the troubles come your way.

[Chorus]

(Dream big)
(Dream big)

When you cry be sure to dry your eyes,
Cause better days are sure to come.
And when you smile be sure to smile wide, and
Don't let them know that they have one.
And when you laugh be sure to laugh out loud,
Cause it will carry all your cares away.
And when you see, see the beauty all
Around and in yourself, and it will help you feel okay.
And when you pray, pray for strength to
Help to carry on when the troubles come your way.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
