She moved back around here thirty-five weeks ago today
Oh down the lane
At night she walks on the banks and remembers how she
Dreamed of rowing away
And how she left one day
She left with a driven look in her eyes
Came back around with it still inside
They said give it some time and you'll forget about it too
We know they always do
Well I know

Some fine day
You will find your way across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river

She was proud and so strong
And she tried not to listen to idle talk
Downtown where she walked
They sit around and they say
That she came back with her tail between her legs
Like they always said she would

Well I hear it's better on the other side
They say you'll never do it so don't even try
Well you may be beaten down with your closed mind
But don't try and make it mine
Well I know

Some fine day
You will find your way across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river

Your wild days are through is what they said
I dreamed she came, when I was down and
I walked where she led

Standing on the shore
She looks to the west with a look of longing
To where the grass seems greener
There's a hard and distant prize
It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
Well even if it doesn't happen for me
It still beats hanging around here
Well I know

Some fine day
You will find your way across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river
