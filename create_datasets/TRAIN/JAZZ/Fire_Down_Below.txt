Don't believe my eyes, they're the coldest eyes
But I'm not so cold, let me put you wise
Keeping the temperature so low, this is a work of art
For there's a fire down below, down below in my heart

And my crazy lips, they're such lazy lips
But there'll come to life should we come to grips
If you have anything in mind, warn you before you start
There is a fire down below, down below in my heart

Now that you're getting my number, know what I'm talking about
Pile on the coal and the lumber, don't let the fire go out

I'll admit my face is the quiet type
This can all be changed when the time is right
Call off the volunteer brigade, call off the fire cart 
For there's a fire down below, down below, down below
Down below in my heart

Now that you're getting my number, know what I'm talking about
Pile on the coal and the lumber, don't let the fire go out

I'll admit my face is the quiet type
This can all be changed when the time is right
Call off the volunteer brigade, call off the fire cart 
For there's a fire down below, down below, down below
Down below in my heart
