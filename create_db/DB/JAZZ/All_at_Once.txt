All at once, my lucky star was glowing,
All at once, I knew I'd met my one for all.
For I found when I heard you hello-ing
That my heart,somehow, was answering your call.

Once or twice, I thought I'd met that someone,
But I soon found that, that someone 
Never would do.
Felt I never would fall,
I'd given up my hoping when
All at once, my one for all was you.
