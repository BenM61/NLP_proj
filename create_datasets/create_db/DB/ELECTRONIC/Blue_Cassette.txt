I found a tape in my back garden
A blue cassette covered in dirt
And through the dust the reels start turning
And played some memories stored in it

As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire

That with all the noise
It sets my heart on fire

And I can't stop the reels from tuning
I can't stop the tape machine
As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire

I found a place I thought was stolen
A place that's built on noise and needs
And in my hand it spins so gently
Fills a void was winding me

As I hear your voice
It sets my heart on fire
That with all the noise
It sets my heart on fire

And I can't stop the reels from turning
I can't stop the tape machine

As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire

Lay back down I told myself
How could I ever forget you?

As I hear your voice
It sets my heart on fire
That with all the noise
It sets my heart on fire

And I can't stop the reels from turning
I can't stop the tape machine

I found a tape in my back garden
A blue cassette covered in dirt
