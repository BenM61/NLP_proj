Run, baby, run, baby, run
Run, baby, run, baby, run
Run, baby, run, baby, run

Baby, run
Baby, run

Run from his smile
From his pretty eyes
Run away from his lies

Runnin' from his arms
Runnin' from his charm
Run as fast as you can

Baby, run
Baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run

When life is too much
Why not run away?
Leave your troubles behind.

When you feel depressed
When you're in a mess
Pack up your bags and run.

Baby, run
Baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run

Run, baby, run, baby, run

Run, baby, run, baby, run
Run, baby, run, baby, run

Baby, run
Baby, run

When you can't take it anymore
Why not forget the past
And off you run
Baby, run

No more tears, no more mistakes
Why don't you just check out your bags and run?
Baby, run

Run, baby, run, baby, run
Run, baby, run, baby, run

Baby, run
Baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run

Run away from his smile, run away from his lies, run away

Baby, run
Baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run
