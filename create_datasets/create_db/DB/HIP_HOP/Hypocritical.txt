(TiLo)
Power to the positive people
Please push you panic button stop, the press
It's those hypocritical judge and condemning preachers
With pens behind the desk

(Tommy Lee)
We protest against the negative stress
Time time time to get that shit off our chest
I know that violence don't fix drama
If you want to' have good karma
Go ask your momma'
Did you uncover your third eye?

(TiLo)
Yeah and utilized my mental telepathy
To get them away from T.Lee
And the rest of the posse

(Tommy Lee)
Click click camera flash
Freeze frame a time for the past
If I had a gat, I probably would blast
But livin' like that, probably would not last

(TiLo)
Cause somebody one day may do unto you, as you did to them
Leave you six feet deep in the ground
Your last tour date in a casket with no quadro sound's

(Chorus)
Who set's the standards? Who sets the lines?
Who you? Or do they rule your mind?
*repeat 2X's*

(TiLo)
The snitches,the bitches
Be takin' advantages, of the chances
That they be giving, confidentiality
T-Bone gave a brotha' love,
and he turned that shit into 10 G's

(Tommy Lee)
And now he who sails the seven seas
Left us in the studio, trackin' our tracks
And were getting freaky-o
Uh oh, with a direct line,
that goes directly, live to the Tonight Show
Where they prep like chefs, cutting and chopping
With their fake ass voice O's

(Tilo)
And supporting a low life sucka', who stole a video tape
of my brotha' and his wife, without they clothes

(Tommy Lee)
Now they pack that shit,in the public's nose
But! Ironically we burn the trash up at our shows
Who sets the standards? Who sets the lines?
Who keeps feeding us ethnic separation?
Tax levels -n- levels of occupation
Were all significant parts in this universal creation

(Chorus)
Who set's the standards? Who sets the lines?
Who you? Or do they rule your mind?
*repeat 2X's*

(TiLo)
We sick and tired of their tricks
We using voodoo, on the whole rag-mag click
And that Hard Copy shit
Here were gonna' give em a real topic
for the new millennium, real quick

(Chorus)
Who sets the standards? Who sets the lines?
Who you? Or do they rule your mind?
*repeat 4X's*

(Tommy Lee)
Or do they rule your mind!
Or do they rule your mind!!
Or do they rule your mind!!!
