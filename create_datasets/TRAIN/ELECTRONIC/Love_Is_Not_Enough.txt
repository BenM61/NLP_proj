Well, I've had too many a
Good cry for you
Well, this is my time to say
Goodbye to you

In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through

This is not yours alone
It hurts me too
Please don't say you don't care
I know you do

In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through

Love is not enough for me
If it screams when you hold it
Love is not enough for me
Love is hurting if it screams
Oh, if it's screaming out loud
I've been screaming for love, oh oh
Love is not enough

In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through
