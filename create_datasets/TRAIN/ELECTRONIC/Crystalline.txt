Underneath our feet
Crystals grow like plants (listen how they grow)
I'm blinded by the lights (listen how they glow)
In the core of the earth (listen how they grow)

Crystalline internal nebula (crystalline)
Rocks growing slow mo (crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia (crystalline)
And demand the lights

We mimic the openness
Of the ones we love
Dove tail our generosity
Equalize the flow
With our hearts
We chisel quartz
To reach love

Crystalline internal nebula (crystalline)
Rocks growing slow mo (crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia (crystalline)
And demand the lights

Octagon, polygon
Pipes up an organ
Sonic branches
Murmuring drone
Crystallizing galaxies
Spread out like my fingers

(Crystalline) internal nebula
(Crystalline) rocks growing slow mo
(Crystalline) I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline) and demand the lights

(Crystalline) internal nebula
(Crystalline) rocks growing slow mo
(Crystalline) I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline) and demand the lights

It's the sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety
It's the sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety
