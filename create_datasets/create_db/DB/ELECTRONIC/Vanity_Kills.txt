Have you heard the latest (You love you)
Have you seen who just walked in (Vain vain vain vain)
(Uh huh You love you) Right over there
She's so vain vain vain vain
Vain vain vain vain

I'm glad you found some one who loves you
But sad to say that some one is you
And now perhaps you'll both be happy
Guess that makes two just you and you
Someone who cares so much about you
But does that some one have to be you
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom yeah
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom yeah

Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills you love you
Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills it kills

Do glad I found you glancing in the mirror
Gazing deeply at love's patron saint
Admire the frame survey the scenery
Or are you just inspecting the paint
Temptation's high modesty's so weak
High on yourself humble you ain't
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom yeah
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom yeah

Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills you love you
Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills you love you
Vanity kills it don't pay bills (No way)
Vanity kills you love you
Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills it kills

So vain vain vain vain
You love you (yeah)
Give it give it us give it us
So Vain so vain so vain

Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills you love you
Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills you love you
Vanity kills it don't pay bills
Vanity kills you love you

Vanity kills if the blast don't get you
Then the fallout will
You love you
