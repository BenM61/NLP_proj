Some say a trick, some say a look
It's just a way of thinking after all
From underneath something concrete
It's just a way of coping with it all
Some with revolt, some will obey
Who attains perfection and who's to say
A criminal, a cardinal
Both frightened of angels
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future

For some a walk, to some a dance
It's just a form of motion one and all
Without dispute the least aware
Will no doubt see the ragings of a fool
First we look then we spy
The man who has a vision wants it all
A sin so clean rule supreme
The power to undermine
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future

First a glance, then a chance
To make a simple gesture worth it all
A conquer all, a desert stall
That serves a drink to people under sun
At last the place, now where's the time
To take in all the other points of view
Some are inert but one exists
To build a bridge
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future
