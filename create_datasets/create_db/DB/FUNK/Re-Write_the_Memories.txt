Man

(Oh yeah)
I don't know what I'm gonna say to her Rizz ya know?
(Ooh yeah)
I ain't ever been through nuttin' like this
This was my heart man
(Listen)
I just gotta step up and just be a man about it

Flashback
Time passed
Then nothin's the same
Lost our
Love in
Too many games

And girl I hope that you
Forgot about
The reasons you forgave
But the memories don't seem to go away
No

[Chorus:]
No I never ever meant to hurt you
No I never meant to make you cry
And I wish I could erase the heartache
And turn back the hands of time
And I'm sorry that you're still reminded
Wish I could just rewrite it
Our short stories last so long
Re-write the memories

[Ronnie:]
This crazy
I wish I can do it all again

[Johnny:]
So much
To talk about
(That's right)
But nothing to say
(Nothin to say)
'Cause words are
So empty
When you feel betrayed

(When you feel betrayed)
I can't find a way
To justify
The reason I just lied
(Why)
But I did it all to spare you any pain
Oh yeah

[Chorus:]
'Cause I never ever meant to hurt you
(Never meant to hurt you)
No I never meant to make you cry
(Never meant to make you cry)
And I wish I could erase the heartache

(Heartache)
And turn back the hands of time
And I'm sorry that you're still reminded
Wish I could just re-write it

(Said I'm sorry)
Our short stories last so long
(Last so long)
Rewrite the memories

[Ronnie:]
Baby I know you hurtin
Just pick up the phone
(Get back where we used to be)
Baby just talk to me

[Johnny and Ricky:]
Oh baby let me hold you and rewind
And I won't make that silly mistake twice
Please hold me 'cause I need you in my life

[Chorus:]
No I never ever meant to hurt you
No I never meant to make you cry
And I wish I could erase the heartache

(Wish I yeah, yeah)
And turn back the hands of time
(Turn back the hands of time)
And I'm sorry that you're still reminded
(I'm so, I'm so sorry that you still reminded)
If could just re-write it
Our short stories last so long

And I'm sorry that you're still reminded
Wish could just rewrite it
(Never meant to make you cry)
Our short stories last so long

[Ralph:]
Re-write the memories

[Ricky:]
(Re-write the memories)

[Johnny:]
(Never meant to make you cry)

[Ralph:]
Get back where we used to be

[Ricky:]
(Back where we used to be)

[Johnny:]
(I wanna turn back the hands of time)

[Ralph:]
If I could just re-write it
I would just re-write it
If I could just re-write it
I'd re-write our memories

[Mike:]
Y'all just don't understand
(Sorry)
To have somebody real close to you
(Sorry for the pain)
When you lost that trust
You basically lose everything

[Ralph:]
Ahh sugar no, no no no
