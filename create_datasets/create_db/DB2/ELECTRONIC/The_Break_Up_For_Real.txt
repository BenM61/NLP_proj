go back and see the folks, 
they're always glad to see you. 
trot out the same old jokes, 
avoid the things that seem new. 

no talk about the wife - 
she lives with someone else now. 
forget your former life, 
warm love became a cold cow. 

driving to the coast, 
it's hard to know what hurts the most. 

learning how to feel, 
it's the break-up for real. 

go out to see some friends, 
you hope that you won't lose it. 
you sit there and pretend - 
play adolescent music. 

singing to the sea, 
you sing the songs that set you free. 

learning how to feel, 
it's the break-up for real.
