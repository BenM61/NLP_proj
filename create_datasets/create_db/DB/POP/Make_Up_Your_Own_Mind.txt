Walking through the contradiction way 
In a world where for fashion your friend's gay 
You must try to be yourself 
Everyday and every night 
Live your life like a daily fight 
To get what you think is right for you 
I believe in what I said 
Can't you see it's alright? 
All around 
Nobody hears your voice 
Nobody hears you make this noise 
Make up your own mind 
All around 
No one can label you 
Nobody can judge what you do 
Make up your own mind 

People could say you're a freak 
Please don't care they make you sick 
Keep on doing what you want to do 
Like your father last year said 
During the thanksgiving day: 
'F*ck' em all, don't give a shit of them'
I believe in what I said 
Can't you see it's alright? 

All around 
Nobody hears your voice 
Nobody hears you make this noise 
Make up your own mind 
All around 
No one can label you 
Nobody can judge what you do 
Make up your own mind
