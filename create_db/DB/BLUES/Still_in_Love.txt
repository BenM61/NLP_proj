Have no fear, Big Joe is here
Oh you're real crazy baby, love you madly

Well all right, well all right, you got yourself a Cadillac car
Well all right, well all right, you hangin' out in the finest bars
Well all right, well all right, you've gone just a little too far

Well all right, well all right, the bebop's gone to your head
You used to love me baby, now your love is dead
We used to scuffle for hot dogs, tell me where you got that bread

Well, you ride around with all the finest cats in town
You in your black dress and your sequin gown
Ah, you'll be coming back when the deal goes down

Oh, boy

Down girl down
Down girl down
Down girl down
Down girl down
Down girl down
You been running all over town

I said yes, yes (yes, yes)
Yes, yes (yes, yes)
Yes, yes (yes, yes)
Yes, yes (yes, yes)
Yes, yes (yes, yes)

Yeah, ought to know

Well, all right then (well, all right then)
Well, all reet then (well, all reet then)
Well, all root then (well, all root then)
Well, all rote then (well, all rote then)
Well, all right then (well, all right then)

Oh, reet then, all right then
