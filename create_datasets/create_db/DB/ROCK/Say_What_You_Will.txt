Nowhere To Run 
Nowhere To Hide 
What You Doin' To Me 
All This Jive 
I Can See It 'Fore The Light Of Day 
'Cause Now You're Gonna', Gonna' Do It My Way 
You Are 

Say What You Will, You Will 
Say What You Will 

Don't Push Me Around, If You Don't Mind 
But You Keep On Doin' It To Me All The Time 
I Don't Know Much, But I Can Say 
You Got Me Feelin' Like A Fool Left To Pay 
You Do 

Say What You Will, You Will
Say What You Will

You Got Me Feelin' Like I'm Going Nowhere 
Hit And Love 
See In Me The Love, The Drive I want to' Feel 
See In Me The Love, The Drive I want to' Feel
Tonight 

Say What You Will, You Will
Say What You Will

Mercy I'm Gonna' Bleed 
Nobody's Gonna' Make A Monkey Of Me 
I Can Do It For You 
I'd Be So Kind 
'Cause If I Don't I Think I'll Blow My Mind 
Tonight 

Say What You Will, You Will
Say What You Will
You Will
