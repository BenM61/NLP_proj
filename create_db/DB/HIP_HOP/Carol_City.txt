Word to the pusher, nigga never kept a job
Boobie gave me game
We used to sell dope and rob
I left a stain off in Carol City
My last name should be Carol City
Used to sell dope just to feed the fam
Max box jumping with the kilograms
I feel your pain if you from Carol City
My last name should be Carol City

Black Dollar, I wanna buy a house on every block
Build one bigger than Dolphin Stadium, young nigga watch
Captain Crabs AK shells, living your aftermath
Ain't no love, get your money or get a body bag
Hammers and vogues, There's lord
River City let the son ride clean for the deadliest hoes
Gotta represent, nigga so meet me at the minute
And if you living how I'm living, stay behind the tenant
Marble floors mink rugs and got the gold faucets
Be cautious, well known to take the weak hostage
U.S Marshalls on the way and they cut open the gates
Know we going to trial by the look on my face

Fake niggas found face down in abandoned buildings
Picture pennies, fair cases get you
A lengthy sentence
Niggas snitching, bitches switching is what I seen the most
Three 0-5, but Carol City got the cleanest coke
Match box, projects, I gave my point of view
Bomb man, two lieutenant I was appointed to
60 thousand in nickle rocks outside the silver fox
Duval County to Virginia , my pockets 'bout to pop
Move 'em hoe, mind your business, therefore nobody told
And when they did they come and get you, seen you up the road
We met his kids fishing on the bridge
Ten years later, bumped into him, he threw me a brick

Walking home from school, always was quick to jump a nigga
Third day on school, they knew I was a thumper nigga
My lil hitta doing 4 he caught a gun charge
Rolling bumpkin backwoods they outta bush park
Position yourself, it's timing that's coming to the end
Caught him slippin', at Simons he tried to get a fit'
It's either
Or baby boy, you can meet the lord
I pray we meet again, maybe we be on one accord
Walking through the flea market
Bouncing like I hit a lick
Going open, the record label just to go legit
Had to car cash on 27th was a pastime
Pay for 60 keys, all at once just like the last time
