Now you see not the grass is green 
Didn't you know that my love was true 
Why did you go 
You hurt me so 
Why did you go 
You hurt me so 
Didn't you know 
I love you so 
I got a girl 
And I call her so 
And you know that I love her so 
She went away She broke my heart 
Didn't you know 
I love you so 
Didn't you know 
Now you see not the grass is green 
And you knew that my love was true 
Why did you go You hurt me so 
Why did you go That hurt me so 
Didn't you know I love you so 
I got a girl And I call her so 
'Cause I know that you love me so 
She went away She broke my heart 
And broke my heart She went away 
Didn't you know 
I love you so 
I love you so, 
didn't you know 
My pretty so
