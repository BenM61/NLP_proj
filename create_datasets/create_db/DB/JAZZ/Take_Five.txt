Won't you stop and take a little
Time out with me, just take five
Stop your busy day and take the
Time out to see if I'm alive

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way

Wouldn't it be better not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now, it's alright
Just take five, just take five

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play
