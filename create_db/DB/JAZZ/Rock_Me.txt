Now won't you hear me singin
Hear the words that I'm saying
Wash my soul with water from on high
Why the world loves love is around me
Even forced to buy me
But oh, if you leave me,
I will die

You hold me in the bosom
Till the storms of life is over 
Rock me in the cradle of our love
Only feed me till I want no more
Then you take me to your blessed home above

Make me journey
You make my burning brighter
Help me to do good wherever I can
Oh, let thou praise and thrill me
Thou loving kindess fill me
Then you hold me
Hold me in the hollow of the hand

You hold me in the bosom
Till storms of life is over
Rock me in the cradle of our love
Only feed
