Well, good morning, baby, welcome back to town
How do, fine papa, welcome back to town
You're doing so much traveling
Never know when you'll be around

You're a fine and mellow fellow
But you're stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel
But you treat me like a fool

Two faced daddy
Don't hand me no double cross
You'll see any time I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost

You're cheating on the outside
Doing anything you choose
You better come back on the inside
'Cause you've got too much to lose

Don't want no trouble
I've got to be the boss
And if you can't play it my way
Well, now baby get lost

I try to stop your cheating
But I just don't have the time
'Cause I've got so many men
That they're standing right in line

Keep cool papa
You got to come across

'Cause any time I'm ready
Yes, any time I'm ready
You know when I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost

Why don't you get lost?
