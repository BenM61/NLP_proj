Behind closed doors your words ring hollow
What you said they'd be
What behavior? Who are you, but I like it
Now I'm done with nothing new, sometimes green sometimes blue
And I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
Hey hey hey I'm guilty and you're guilty too
Hey hey hey hey
I'll tell you something, something new
You're hearing nothing, nothing true
You're killing me, I'm killing you
And I'm guilty too
One two three, I found you out so easily
One two three, I found in you what I found in me
The time is wrong, the time is right, be careful who you kill tonight
And I'm melting, and I'm melting, and I'm melting, and I'm melting
And I'm melting in you
Hey hey hey I'm guilty and you're guilty too
Hey hey hey hey
One and one and one makes three
One and one why don't you see
I'm killing you, you're killing me
Can't you set me free
Inside out, I can't describe it, what you do to me
Inside out, I cannot hide it looking right through me
Now I've reached the living end, pointing fingers to defend
And I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty, and I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
I'll tell you something, something new
You're hearing nothing, nothing true
You're killing me, I'm killing you
And I'm guilty too
