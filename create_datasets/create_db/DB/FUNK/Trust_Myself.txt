When I heard your phone ring after midnight
When I saw her number on display
When I thought you're lyin' there beside me, you were far away

Why is it so easy to commence me?
Why is it so hard to let you go
But I can't deny what I already know

I got this feeling down deep inside
I use to look away but I can't this time, yeah
I'm movin' on, I wish you well

I think I better never take any advice
I'm gonna listen to the voice inside me
In spite of everybody else, I'm gonna trust myself

I know I'm the one for bein' stupid
I know I'm the one for being blind
Somewhere deeper within I always knew that
You were lyin'

Maybe it was easier to give in
Cause I didn't want to let you go
But I can't deny what I already know

I got this feeling down deep inside
I use to look away but I can't this time, yeah
I'm movin' on, I wish you well

I think I better never take an advice
I'm gonna listen to the voice inside me
In spite of everybody else, I'm gonna trust myself

Something all along, tell me this is wrong
Even though I couldn't let go
I just gotta trust myself

The writings on the wall
Now I see it all
And I know the truth now
I just gotta trust myself

I got this feeling down deep inside
I use to look away but I can't this time, yeah
I'm movin' on, I wish you well

I think I better never take an advice
I'm gonna listen to the voice inside me
In spite of everybody else, I'm gonna trust myself

I gotta trust myself
(I got a feelin' inside)
I gotta trust myself
(That I just can't hide, no)
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta trust myself

I gotta trust myself
(Knew it all along)
(I gotta trust myself)
Something that was wrong
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta trust myself
