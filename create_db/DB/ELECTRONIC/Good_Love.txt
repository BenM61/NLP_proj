If you believe that you get out what you put in
You better move on 'cos there's no time to fool around
All the right intentions & promises don't mean a thing
If you can't get the job done

If you insist on making life a compromise
You're gonna wake up to find your world has come undone
All the right intentions & promises are never enough
And soon you find it all gone

Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Good love, precious & gifted
Can't stand waitin' forever
Good love, no greater feelin'
No one could ever deny
Stop wastin' all the good love

You're takin' your time comin' to let me know
Now you better decide 'cos there's a limit to your games
Let your intuition lead you on
Follow the signs to the place you belong
If you believe that you get out what you put in
You better move on 'cos there's no time to fool around
All the right intentions & promises don't mean a thing
If you can't get the job done

Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus: x 2]

Don't go wastin' good love
Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus until fade]
