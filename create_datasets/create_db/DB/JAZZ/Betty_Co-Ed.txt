Flirtation is an art with Betty Co-ed, 
Her station quite depends upon her charms, 
She gets the men in rushes by well-cultivated blushes 
And she's happy with a fellow on each arm! 

Betty Co-ed has lips of red for Harvard, 
Betty Co-ed has eyes of Yale's deep blue, 
Betty Co-ed's a golden haired for Princeton, 
Her dress I guess is black for old Purdue! 

Betty Co-ed's a smile for Pennsylvania, 
Her heart is Dartmouth's treasure, so 'tis said, 
Betty Co-ed is loved by every college boy, 
But I'm the one who's loved by Betty Co-ed! 

She made a wreck of Carnegie Tech and all its engineers; 
She did the same at old Notre Dame, her line is good for years; 
Roguish eyes, telling lies, breathing sighs! 

Betty Co-ed has lips of red for Cornell, 
Betty Co-ed has eyes of Navy blue, 
Betty Co-ed, the golden haired for Amherst, 
Her dress I guess is white for Georgia, too! 

Betty Co-ed's a smile for old Northwestern, 
Her heart is Texas treasure, so 'tis said, 
Betty Co-ed is loved by every college boy, 
But I'm the one who's loved by Betty Co-ed!
