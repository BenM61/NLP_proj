Fools they think I do not know
The road I'm taking
If you meet me on the way
Hesitating
That is just because I know which way I will choose

The corridors of discontent
That I've been traveling
All alone in search for truth
The world's so frightening
Nothing's going right today
'cause nothing ever does

Oh, I don't wanna know your secrets
Oh, they lie heavy on my head
Oh, let's break the night with colour
Time for me to move ahead

Monday morning coming down
Like understanding
Mama thinks you are the ground
Looking so frightening
Nothing's going right today
'Cause nothing ever does

Oh, I don't wanna know your secrets
Oh, they lie heavy on my head
Oh, let's break the night with colour
Time for me to move ahead

Time for me to break my cover
Time for me to move ahead

Been givin' up
You will come again

Oh, I don't wanna know your secrets
Oh, they lie heavy on my head
Oh, let's break the night with colour
Time for me to move ahead

Time for us to move ahead
