The missing

He's missing, they took him away!

The last days
The sinking shunned
The last rites
Of what we have done
So watch yourself
And watch what you say
The martyr dies
So what's at stake?

He takes it for granted
His time's gonna come
He's missing, they took him away!

Watch yourself!
The missing!
He's missing, they took him away!

The last days
The time has come
The last rites
Of what we've become
So watch yourself
And watch what you say
The martyr dies
So what's at stake?

He takes it for granted
His time's gonna come
He's missing, they took him away!

Watch yourself!
They took him away!
