You're the reason I don't trust no one
And I don't love no one
From the places I've come
Sad songs I've sung
All the times I've been stung
For you bring the worst out of me
(Hollar!)
And I can't down these tears I've cried
The heaviness inside
Left me so petrified
Tried ta keep love alive
But I became too tired
'cause you bring the worst out of me

(Eh, eh, eh, he hey)

[Bridge:]
I wish I could change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but something must've went wrong
And all I can say

[Chorus]
Is when I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'cause you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you,
Stay true to you, live life wit you
But look what you've done to me (me)

And I compromised all my time
And rearranged my life
To make sure you was fine
'cause our love was on the line
And I became so unkind
'cause you brought the worst out of me
(You brought the worst out of me)
This is (this is) how the story goes
Those ones who know
When its out of control
You work (work) and you work (work)
And some one gets hurt
And I guess that be me

(When I sing)
When I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'cause you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you,
Stay true to you, live life wit you
But look what you've done to me (me)

(Eh, eh, eh, he hay)

[Bridge]

(When I sing)
Is when I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'cause you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you,
Stay true to you, live life wit you
But look what you've done to me (me)
