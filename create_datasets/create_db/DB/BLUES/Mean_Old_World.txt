This is a mean old world
Try to live it by yourself
This is a mean old world
Try to live it by yourself

Can't get the one you're lovin'
Have to use somebody else

I've got the blues
Gonna pack my things and go
Yes, I've got the blues
Gonna pack my things and go

Well, I guess you don't love me
You're lovin' Mr. So-And-So

Sometime I wonder why
Can your love be so cold
Sometime I wonder why
Can your love be so cold

Seem like, to me, you don't want me
I'm just an unlucky So-And-So
