Making believe 
That you still love me 
It's leaving me alone and so blue 
Still I'll always dream
But I'll never own you 
Making believe 
It's all I can do 
 
Can't hold you close 
When you're not with me 
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine 
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime 
Loving you and making believe 

Making believe 
I never lost you 
But my happy hours 
Are far and so few 
My plans for the future 
Will never come true 
Making believe 
What else can I do 

Making believe 
I'll spend my lifetime 
Loving you and making believe
