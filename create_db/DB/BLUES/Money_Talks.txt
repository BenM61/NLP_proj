Money talks, it'll tell you a story
Money talks, says strange things
Money talks very loudly
You'd be surprised the friends 
You can buy with small change
They say it's the root of all evil
They say gold is the king
Money talks, you'd better believe it
All that gold don't mean a thing
Rich people, hear those pockets jingle
Spare change, hear the down-and-outers cry
Money talks, tip-toe up behind you
Steal what they can, 
Off the cuff or on the sly
Money talks
Money talks
Money talks
Money talks
