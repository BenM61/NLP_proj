Dreamer time to awake
No time to be afraid
Enter her secret place
Love her until she breaks
Till she breaks
Till she breaks

Skin diving for golden pearls
Found you between the two worlds
Fold you into a star shape
Timelss, an altered state
In a state
In a state

Adventure
To touch a soul
No structure to handle heartbreak
Water has no shape
Surrender
I'll take your weight
Take your weight
Take your weight

Attention

Attention
Attention

Attention

This is you
This is me
Underneath a Manzanita tree
Fire consumes the fruit to seed
We are forged, We are baked
By this fire, We are shaped
Fire love, Fire wild

We don't learn from our mistakes
Stars will fall
Stars will fall
Stars will fall
Underneath a Manzanita tree
We are forged, We are baked
By this fire, We are shaped
Fire love, Fire wild
We don't learn from our mistakes
Stars will fall
Stars will fall
Stars will fall
Underneath a Manzanita tree
Attention
