If you want fire, then we better start smoking
If you want water, then we better start crying
If you want ice, then we better start drinking
If you want tears, then we better start dying
I guess you're proud to be different

If you want sleep, then we better start dreaming
If you want war, then we better start fighting
If you want lies, then we better start confessing
If you want forgiveness, you better start apologizing
I guess you're proud to be different

If you want the truth, then we better start lying
If you want to feel, then we better start touching
If you want air, then we better start breathing
If you want to die, then we better start living
I guess you'e proud to be different
