Have you ever met my friend?
Her name is June
She's a solid piece of work

Brought up in a shitty little town
Which stays unknown
Still she misses home

She's done it well on her own

Here she comes
She won't be brushed aside, oh, no
Here she comes
You'll know it's her
Here she comes
Here she comes

While you've been sleepin' she been up
Since I don't know when
Never waste her time

Once she sets herself a goal
She switches mode
You'd better be on her side

You'd better be careful!

Here she comes
She won't be brushed aside, oh,no
Here she comes
You'll know it's her
You'll know for sure
Here she comes

And her voices lead her on
Embrace the shadows, enjoy the sun
She's bright
She's the one!

Here she comes
