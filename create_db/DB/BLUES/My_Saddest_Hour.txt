Pretty little angel eyes, pretty little angel eyes
Pretty little angel, pretty little angel
Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little angel

(Pretty, pretty, pretty little angel eyes)
Angel eyes, I really love you so
Angel eyes, I'll never let you go
Because I love you, my darlin' angel eyes

(Pretty, pretty, pretty little angel eyes)
Angel eyes, you are so good to me
And when I'm in your arms you be so heavenly
You know I love you, my darlin' angel eyes

I know you were sent from Heaven above
You rule my life with your wonderful love
I know we'll be happy for eternity
'Cause I know that our love is really real

(Angel eyes, angel eyes)
Angel eyes, I really love you so
Angel eyes, I'll never let you go
Because I love you, my darlin' angel eyes

Pretty little angel eyes
Pretty little angel eyes
Pretty little angel, pretty little angel
Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little angel

(Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty little angel eyes)
Angel eyes, I really love you so
Angel eyes, I'll never let you go
Because I love you, my darlin' angel eyes
(Pretty, pretty, pretty little angel eyes)
