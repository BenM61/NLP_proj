Wasn't into dancin', forget about romancing
Cause I already got a lady
Wasn't tryin' to be flirty, wasn't feeling dirty
'Til this shorty started runnin' on me

With her itty-bitty waist and her pretty pretty face
And the leanest, meanest, badest, badest body
Didn't have no time to waste, she was looking for a taste
And she was wanting me to party

Oh, it's so crazy, she's like Baby, I'm like Swayze
I'm said, oh, and I'm burning up
So, lets turn it up, I said turn it up now

She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me

Now, I ain't looking for no drama,
I don't want karma cause my baby sittin' in bed at home
She know that I be lying and that I be trying
To be trying to get this shorty with me all alone

Pretty pretty lips and her big 'ol hips
It's getting hotter when she touches me with her fingertips
And her sexy eyes and thembig 'ol thighs
It's getting hotter like the block up in the summertime

Oh, it's so crazy, she's like Baby, I'm like Swayze
I'm said, oh, and I'm burning up
So, lets turn it up, I said turn it up now

She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me

Now, I know that my girl is alone
And she's been blowing me up on my phone
But I can shower when I get back home
Cause tonight I'm dancing dirty, yeah'

Now, I know that my girl is alone
And she's been blowing me up on my phone
But I can shower when I get back home
Cause tonight I'm dancing dirty, yeah

Oh, it's so crazy, she's like Baby, I'm like Swayze
I'm said, oh, and I'm burning up
So, lets turn it up, I said turn it up now

She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me

She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
