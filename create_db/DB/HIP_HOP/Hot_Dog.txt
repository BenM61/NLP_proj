Ladies and gentlemen!
Introducing the Chocolate Starfish!
And the Hotdog Flavored Water
Bring it on!

Get the f*ck up!
Yeah!
Check, one, two

Listen up, listen up!
Here we go
It's a fucked up world
We're a fucked up place

Everybody's judged by their fucked up face
Fucked up dreams
Fucked up life
A fucked up kid

With a fucked up knife
Fucked up moms
And fucked up dads
It's a fucked up cop

With a fucked up badge
Fucked up job
With fucked up pay
And a fucked up boss

Is a fucked up pain
Fucked up press
And fucked up lies
Well, Lethal's in the back
With the fact of the fires

Hey, it's on
Everybody knows this song
Hey, it's on
Everybody knows this song

Ain't it a shame that you can't say "F*ck"
F*ck's just a word
And it's all fucked up
Like a fucked up punk

With a fucked up mouth
A nine inch nail
I'll get knocked the f*ck out
Fucked up aids

From fucked up sex
Fake ass titties
On a fucked up chest
We're all fucked up

So what you want to do?
We fucked up me
And fucked up you

You want to f*ck me like an animal
You'd like to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug
Just know that nothing you do
Will bring you closer to me

Ain't life a bitch?
A fucked up bitch
A fucked up soul with a fucked up stitch
A fucked up head

Is a fucked up shame
Swinging on my nuts
Is a fucked up game
Jealousy filling up a fucked up mind

It's real fucked up
Like a fucked up crime
If I say "F*ck" two more times
That's forty six "Fucks" in this fucked up rhyme

Hey, it's on
Everybody knows this song
Hey, it's on
Everybody knows this song

You want to f*ck me like an animal
You'd like to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug
Just know that nothing you do
Will bring you closer to me

Hooo-aaa Haaaw!
Listen up baby
You... can't... bring... me... (bring me)... down
I... don't... think... so

I don't want some
You... better... check... your... (check it)... self
Before.. you.. wreck.. your.. self
Kiss.. my.. star.. fish

My... choco... late.. Star... fish.. punk
Kiss... my... star... fish
My... choco... late... Star... fish

You want to f*ck me like an animal
You want to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug
Just know that nothing you do
Will bring you closer to me
