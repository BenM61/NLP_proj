Venice Night At 5 O'clock
The Station Hazy Light
A sleepin' Bum, A Single Girl
She's leavin' overnight

An' She Knows That It's Forever
An' She'll Never Ever Return

Hey Little Girl
Don't want to Cause You Pain
But The Big Boys Feel No Sorrow
Hey Little Girl
They're All The Same
But They Feel No Sorrow

In Italy On Holidays
She Had To See Da Vinci's Style
All The Arts For Credit Cards
She Would Forgive Him For A Smile

An' She Knows That It's Forever
An' She'll Never Ever Return

Hey Little Girl
Don't want to Cause You Pain
But The Big Boys Feel No Sorrow
Hey Little Girl
They're All The Same
But They Feel No Sorrow

There She Is Inside A Train
An' Now She's Leanin' Back
She's Got Money For One Day
An' Nothing In The Rack

An' She Knows That It's Forever
An' She'll Never Ever Return

Hey Little Girl
Don't want to Cause You Pain
But The Big Boys Feel No Sorrow
Hey Little Girl
The're All The Same
But They Feel No Sorrow
