Two Sides To Every Story

Chris:
I really love it when you say to me,
That I'm the one who makes you strong.
When we're together we are so complete,
You say here's where you belong.

But when you dance,
Oh, how you dance tonight,
With every man in sight,
Seduction pouring from your eyes.

Together:
Two sides to every story,
We're standing worlds apart,
How can you say you love me,
When you keep on playing with my heart?

Shelley:
I really love it when you hold me tight,
And you tell me that I'm the best.
The way you touch me and the way you kiss,
And the thrill of your caress.

But when you smile,
You smile at every girl.
Like you're the greatest lover in the world,
You should keep your feelings to yourself.

Together:
Two sides to every story,
We're standing worlds apart.
How can you say you love me,
When you keep on playing with my heart?

Chris: You dance with any man.
Shelley: What about you? Going like a hurricane.
Chris: That's not true! There's nothing to explain.
Shelley: Well there you go again!
Together: You're always trying to get the last word!

Together:
Two sides to every story,
We're standing worlds apart.
Two sides to every story,
Let's get back to the start.
Two sides to every story,
Stop playing with my heart.

Shelley: Stop playing with my heart.
Chris: Let's talk about it in the morning.
Shelley: No! I want to talk about it now.
Chris: Maybe I flirt a litte to much.
Shelley: And I just love to dance.
Chris: Well, let me say it loud and clear. I want you!
Shelley: I want you too.
