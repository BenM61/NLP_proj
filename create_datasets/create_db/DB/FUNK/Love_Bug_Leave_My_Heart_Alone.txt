LOVE BUG LEAVE MY HEART ALONE
Martha and The Vandellas

Oh yeah (get out of here, 
Love bug leave my heart alone)
Leave my heart alone (get out of here,
Love bug leave my heart alone)
Spring is here and like a wayward breeze
The love that left me came back haunting me
He's like the ever changin' sun
That warms my heart and leaves
The love but tries to bite again
Ooh I'm falling, the same old heartaches calling

Oh yeah (get out of here, 
Love bug leave my heart alone)
I don't want to love him
Get out of here love bug leave my heart alone
Behind each gentle word he speaks
Love bug there you hide
To stir my tender feelings through his words of honey 
But if you wait to sleep in love
I bear it deep inside 
Love bug you love and leave me 
Sobbing and sighing 
Again he'll leave me cryin'

Oh yeah (get out of here, 
Love bug leave my heart alone)
Get out of here love bug leave my heart alone
I'm telling you love bug, love bug
Hope you fly away
Spread your little wings, leave my heart and fly away 
Cause I don't want to love a guy 
Who truly don't love me
I don't want the heartaches that I had before 
He wants me for the moment and another girl he'll see
And through long and sleepless nights
When I'm tossin' and turnin'
My heart will be burning
Oh yeah (get out of here, 
Love bug leave my heart alone)
I don't want to love him
Get out of here love bug leave my heart alone
You know, you know, he don't love me
