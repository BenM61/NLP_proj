When are you coming up?
Get away now and go to bed
I'm gonna pick you up
Hear what you say and you're going so fast

And I see you coming down that line
See the future for tomorrow's child
And I watch you when you're losing your mind
And you can't let go

All the places, all the steps
You clamber up the beaten track
When you've fallen and you keep on climbing
You never look back

So hi hello
Whatever you need and wherever you go
I can't say no
One heart beat, any place we run

And I see you coming down that line
See the future for tomorrow's child
And I'll find you when the lights are blinding
And you can't get home

It's never soon enough
And forever's gonna come too fast
Time is calling us
Gets in the way and unfolds the past

When there's nobody else around
On a train, on the way from town
And you feel like you can't be found
And you can't let go

All the faces taking up your time
You say leave me alone
Yes, tomorrow you're the future's child
And I know where to go

So hi hello
Whatever you need and wherever you go
I can't say no
Walk our street any day you want

And I see you coming down that line
On the street, all alone at night
And I'll find you if you're losing your mind
And you can't let go

No, I won't let go
Hi hello
Hi hello
