Softly, softly come to me 
Touch my lips so tenderly 
Softly, softly turn the key 
And open up my heart 

Handle me with gentleness 
And say you'll leave me never 
In the warmth of your caress 
My love will live for ever and ever 

So softly, softly come to me 
Touch my lips so tenderly 
Softly, softly turn the key 
And open up my heart 

Softly, softly turn the key 
And open up my heart
