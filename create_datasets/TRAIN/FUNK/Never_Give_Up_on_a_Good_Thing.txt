Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, whoa)
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Money's tight, he's workin' every night
It ain't easy to keep the flame alive
And when he finally comes home to ya
He's just too tired to do the things you want to

You can't help but wonder to yourself
How would it be with someone else
Just keep in mind, every storm ends in time
Love is forever, stay together

(Stay together) When you got something real
(Love forever) That you may never feel again

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, whoa)
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Now you're the man, you've got to understand
She don't mean to make a scene
Like you, she feels all the weight you're under
And when she breaks, is it any wonder

I know sometimes it crosses your mind
To get on out and stay hard to find
Before you try, you'd better look in her eyes
Love is forever, stay together

(Stay together) You've got something real
(Love forever) That you may never feel again
(You've got a lot)

(Stay together)
(Love forever)
You've got something real
That you may never feel again

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, whoa)
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Don't give up your good thing
Don't give it, oh, don't, oh, oh
Don't give up your good thing
Please don't, oh, don't
Don't live it up, don't give it up

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, whoa)
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Never give up on a good thing (Oh, he's all you need)
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, oh)
Never give up on a good thing
