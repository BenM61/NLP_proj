The look of love
Is in your eyes
The look your heart
Can't disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than just words could every say
And what my heart has heard, well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited, waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine, tonight
Let this be just the start of so many nights like this
Let's take a lovers' vow and seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited, waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Don't ever go

I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited, waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Don't ever go, don't ever go

I love you so
