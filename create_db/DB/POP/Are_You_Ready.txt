Are you ready, are you ready,
Are you ready for me, are you ready
Let's go

Pull up to the club we don't walk just stride
We know how to sell it all the fellas say hi
Here with all the people that we're meeting inside
It's gonna be our night, it's gonna be our night
When I hear he dance floor kickin' that groove
DJ's got the beat to make your body go oooh
Everybody's checkin' as I start to move
It's gonna be our night, it's gonna be our night

Are you ready, are you ready,
Are you ready for me, are you ready
Let's go

If you come to party and you're feelin' naughty
When you shake your body, go "oh, oh, oh"
If your hands are dirty and you're feelin' flirty
Then take off your shirt and go "oh, oh, oh"
As the club is shakin' and the floors vibratin'
Everybody's saying "oh, oh, oh"
So, if you're ready for me, come and sing it with me
If you feel me, go "oh, oh, oh"

Sexy senorita shakin' on by
Comin' on to you with my slither and my slide
My whole body's moving
And my hips are on fire, I got what
You want what you've always desired
Feelin' sensations outta control
Can you feel the beat as it rips your soul
Everybody's freakin', it's the weekend "oh, oh"
It's gonna be our night, it's gonna be our night

Are you ready, are you ready,
Are you ready for me, are you ready
Let's go

If you come to party and you're feelin' naughty
When you shake your body, go "oh, oh, oh"
If your hands are dirty and you're feelin' flirty
Then take off your shirt and go "oh, oh, oh"
As the club is shakin' and the floors vibratin'
Everybody's saying "oh, oh, oh"
So, if you're ready for me, come and sing it with me
If you feel me, go "oh, oh, oh"

Keep your body movin'
Keep your hot body groovin'
There's nothing to be losin'
Keep your hands on me
