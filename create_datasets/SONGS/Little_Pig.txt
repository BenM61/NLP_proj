I hear of the things that you'll do
Like a little piece of hell and baby it's true
I hear all the things that I've tried
But there's nothing on Earth
That kills me in your mind (it's true) . . .

There's nothing so good as the heat
And a little piece of cheese exquisite and so sweet
I know that you're expensive
When you find your way to hell
But that's when the lying quits

What fancy this, You're his
And like a thousand times
I know when it's time to kiss
And with all the things we know we just can't miss

What fancy this, It's his
And like a thousand times
I know when its time to kiss
And with all the things we know I just can't miss

It's this, and like a thousand times
I know in time we'll kiss
It's the only thing I know is worth the risk
