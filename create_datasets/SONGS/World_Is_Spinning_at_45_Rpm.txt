World Is Spinning At 45 RPM

one day as I woke up
a wonderful morning was waiting for me
very bright
and I felt happy

my sadness that I felt
like a thick cloud
around me
like a lie, had vanished

one day as I woke up
I felt like I had been wrapped up
with love

I can finally say today
humbly
thank you very much
to all the people in the world

one day as I woke up
a wonderful morning was waiting for me
I cannot express it properly
it felt like I was a kid again

and then it came to me that
I have
a dad and a mom
a brother and a sister
a grandpa a grandma
friends I love
a cute child
and on top of that
I have you

one day as I woke up
a wonderful morning was there waiting
the world begins today
to spin gently

and I have
no sorrow
left

I have people to whom I owe much
around me
my father my mother
my brother and my sister
my grandfather and my grandmother
my friends I love
a cute child
and most of all
I have you

one day as I woke up
a lovely morning was there for me
the world today
smiles gently
to me

and I have
no fear
left

now inside
my head
the music begins
now inside
my head
the world
starts to spin
at
45
rpm
