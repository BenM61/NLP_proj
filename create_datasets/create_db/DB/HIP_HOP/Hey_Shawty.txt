Swisher in my ear when I'm rollin' up
I see this beautiful whore, she finer than a mutha' fu'
Got ya hair and ya nails did, got the little kid with the cashews
With an attitude that you could never lose
I know you think I'm paid because I'm lookin' at ya car
Just call me Old E 'cause baby, you the star
I see you lookin' at me, lookin' at you
That voodoo that you do got me gone so I sing a song
(Hey shawty)

For times I'm alone with the number of your phone
You givin' me the eye so I know it's really real on
First let me tell you 'bout my baby mama at home
And as you'll find out, it's time to time out
You in the same situation
The love probation got you fiendin' for some dick, you ain't slick
But you got your hair right
Plus you look and smell good and it read right

You overdue, I'm a hit you like you told me to

Slow ya roll 'cause I'm a make you love me slow
Before you go, don't even wanna open the door
I'm in you again, we smokin', eyes rollin' again
We in the bed, got ya legs up, pumpin' again
Please ya good, ya need, I'm a feed you good
Feed you good, my girl don't need no nigga
Rubbin' ya down, I'm so in love with your mind

I's at the club, kickin; it and watch them hoes shake
Puffin' on weed, guzzlin' gin and O.J.
I was fucked up, itchin to bust a fast nut
Lovin' nothin' but sluts who back that ass up
Then I met you, me sweat who, sweat you?
If I did it was to caress and undress you
You was off the chain with the eyes
Nice smile, fat butt, big breasts too, I had to stress you

To see if you was gonna let me hit it and run
Whip it and quit it, because you made it quicker to come
But you told me, slowly, no, no
Plus you'll never ask me for no dough
Now I mention the [unverified], me and you been livin' it up
Things done changed, but now you been givin' it up

You say you need a nigga
That could take you to your destiny, ecstasy
I can take you there, right hand up in ya cock
Left hand strokin' through yo' micro-braided hair
I'm a make you come
Tantilizing erotic pleasure for both of us, let me ease your pain
Come and let me heat your flame
Relax as I ease your strain as I beat your thing

Not the one to eat your thing
I leave that to your lucious, lunch box, cocksucker for free
But if you keep it on the low-low, I'm a hurt if you don't know
You can keep the cock in it for me
