I've been alone inside myself for far too long 
Never really wanted it that way but I let it happen 
If I could do it all again my life would be 
Infinitely better than before I wouldn´t waste a moment 

I'd make time for laughing with my friends 
Make love, make music, make amends 
Try to make a difference, try to love, try to understand 
Instead of just giving up I'd use the power at my command 

But there´s always tomorrow to start over again 
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing is change 
That´s why there´s always tomorrow 

I guess it took a little time, for me to see 
The reason I was born into this world and what I'd have to go through 
For I've finally realized that I could be 
Infinitely better than before, definitely stronger 
I'll face whatever comes my way 
Savor each moment of the day 
Love as many people as I can along the way
Help someone who´s giving up if it´s just to raise my eyes and pray. 

But there's always tomorrow to start over again 
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing is change 
That´s why there´s always tomorrow 

Before your last setting sun 
And everything your heart has longed for 
Has yet to be (one) 
Yes there´s always tomorrow though people come and they go 
But if you´ve brought some love to their lives 
Then you've got something to show (to show)

But there's always, always, always tomorrow to start over again 
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing is change 
That's why there's always, always, always, always, always, always tomorrow
