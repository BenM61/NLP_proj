I could be someone else if you'd rather
Try to win you over like a new step father
Smart but still a sucker for whoever asks you
I pictured the scene
So you wont have to spell it out for me

Cos things go together
Better than other
Like manic depression
And act sexuality

That's another, that's another
Cheat on me, cheat on me yeah

That's another, that's another
Cheat on me, cheat on me yeah

Giving up, without a thought
And then you'll be the chosen one
Through which your friends live vicariously

Cause things go together
Better than other
Like manic depression
And act sexuality 

That's another, that's another
Cheat on me, cheat on me yeah

That's another, that's another
Cheat on me, cheat on me yeah
