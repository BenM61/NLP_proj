Well, I don't understand this love I have inside
Would it be the same without that twinkle in your eye?
And would it be the same if you came and said goodbye
Forever?

I only know that the love that I feel
Doesn't come from somewhere inside of me
But I see it keeps on growing, so I guess I'll just keep going
'Cause I'm confidently knowing it's from the Lord

And it grows on and on, flowing on and on
Don't you see we just can't hide love?
From growing on and on, flowing on and on
There's so many ways to say I love you, I love you

So I pray for eyes to see your needs
And ears to hear your spirit gently plead

Well, I think I understand this love I have inside
It's coming from the Father; it will never be denied
Even if you came to me right now and said goodbye
Forever

Forever
Forever

On and on, flowing on and on
Don't you see we just can't hide love?
From growing on and on, flowing on and on
Got to show this love in my heart

Growing on and on, flowing on and on
Don't you see we just can't hide love?
From growing on and on, flowing on and on
Got to show this love in my heart

Growing on and on, flowing on and on
Don't you see we just can't hide love?
From growing on and on
