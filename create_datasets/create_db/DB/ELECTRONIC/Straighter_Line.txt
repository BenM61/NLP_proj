Who can say when things go wrong
Just rolling with the changes?
Time is short, the list is long
Of words that I have wasted.

I see my soul reaching out
I hear your voice in the clouds
Is there no straighter line
I got my heart up in air
But I begin to wonder
Will you be here in time?

How do I act differently?
I thank you for asking.
Stronger than I used to be,

Or can you not imagine?

I see my soul reaching out
I hear your voice in the clouds
Is there no straighter line

A much straighter line
A place to jump in.
I'm ready to fight,
I'm ready to win
