I really wanna stop but I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

Oh did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're outta touch (outta touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love (no)
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

Oh did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're outta touch (when we're outta touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

Who gave you eyes like that, said you could keep them?
I dunno how to act or if I should be leavin'
I'm running outta time, going outta my mind
I need to tell you something, yeah I need to tell you something
Yeah

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

Oh I did say too much? (did I say too much?)
I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)
When we're outta touch (when we're outta touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?

(Yeah) I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too? (yeah I need to tell you something)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
