Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And I just can't get enough

The walls are closing in
On me, oh my
The walls are closing in
On me right now
Just like a boat out on the open sea
Well on the distance, no sirens sing for me
Like Moses he did divide the waves
We'll say that's an infant
To free the slaves

Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And I just can't get enough
I need your love
I need your love

Just like I'm starved
Exhausted in this draught
I need a drink of water
Oh boy, I need it fast
I'm stuck out in the desert
And all I can see
Is you and your (?)
You're waiting for me

Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And I just can't get enough

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
Well, I need your kiss
And I need your love
All I care every day

Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And I just can't get enough

Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And I just can't get enough
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
