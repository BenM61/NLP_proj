I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery

Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Yes. it seems like everything I do
Everything I do is wrong

I had a good reputation
The greatest man in town
But I'm having so much troubles
Till they 'bout to drag me down

I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery

I got up on my feet
I had lots of friends
But hard luck have hit me
Now I'm down again

I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
