Last night as I lay dreamin'
This stranges kinda feelin'
Reviled its secret meaning 
and now I know 

[Repeat: x2]
I've never ever been to paradise
I never ever seen no angels eyes
No never ever let this magic die 
No mater where you are, you are my lucky star 

Na na na na na, na na na na na,
Na na na na na

No mater where you are
You are my lucky star

I've never ever been to paradise
No never ever left this magic die 
And now I know

[Repeat: x2]
I've never ever been to paradise
I never ever seen no angels eyes
No never ever let this magic die 
No mater where you are, you are my lucky star
