Up on the stand, the society meeting
That was the way, was the way that I found you
Drunk after work, here in the late night feelings
That was the way, was the way that I found you
Sat in the crowd, watching the women's tennis
That was the way, was the way that I found you
Saw who you were, picking up from the canvas
That was the way; I was wrapped around you,
Met you while you were switching on
And checked your box on the blue coupon
That was how  I  found...

Up on the stand, the society meeting
That was the way, was the way that I found you
Drunk after work, here in the late night feelings
That was the way; I was wrapped around you
Kicked your wheel in the midday sun
And saved your place in the peloton
That was how I found...

Sat in the crowd, watching the women's tennis
That was the way, was the way that I found you
Saw who you were, picking up from the canvas
That was the way; I was wrapped around you
You still don't know what I want
Picked up your book in a street kiosk
That was how I found...

Up on the stand, the society meeting
That was the way, was the way that I found you
Late night feelings, trying to set for the winter
To leave you this way, the way I found you
Met you while you were switching on
And checked your box on the blue coupon
That was how I found...
