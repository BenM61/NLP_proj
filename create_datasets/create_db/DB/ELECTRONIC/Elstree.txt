I had a dream on a back lot
I saw my life like a long shot
I smile at faces in a picture parade
Of all the stills from the films that you've made
We would see in the Essoldo
Up there drinking coffee on the Giocondo 

Elstree, remember me
I had a part in a B movie 
I played a man from History 
Elstree, look at me
Now I work for the BBC 
Life is not what it used to be 

I took no dives in the fight scene
I had a stuntman keep my suit clean
There's no technology to fake up a song 
They stop the orchestra if you get it wrong 

Elstree, remember me,
I had a part in a B movie 
I played a man from history 
Elstree, look at me,
Now I work for the BBC,
Life is not what it used to be, 
Elstree

They made a field into a war zone 
I beat the enemy on my own 
All the bullets just went over my head 
There's no reality and no one dead, in

Elstree, remember me,
I had a part in a B movie 
I played a man from history 
Elstree, look at me 
now I work for the BBC 
Life is not what it used to be 
Elstree 
Elstree 
Elstree 
Elstree 
Elstree
