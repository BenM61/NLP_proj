Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
Look up, look up and greet your maker,
For Gabriel blows his horn.

Weary, totin' such a load,
Travelin' down that lonesome road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Weary totin', it's such a load,
Whike I'm travelin' down, travelin' down that lonesome old road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
