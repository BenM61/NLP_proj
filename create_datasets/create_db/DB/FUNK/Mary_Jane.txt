Come here, baby
Mary I love you, do it girl

Mary Jane, Mary Jane

I'm in love with Mary Jane
She's my main thing
She makes me feel alright
She makes my heart sing

And when I'm feeling low,
She comes as no surprise
Turns me on with her love
Takes me to paradise, do you love me Mary Jane?
Yeah, whoa-oh-oh
Do ya?  Do ya?  Do ya? Do ya?  Do ya?  Do ya?
Now do you think you love me Mary Jane
Don't you play no games

Mary Jane, I love her just the same
Mary Jane I love her, Mary baby, just the same, Mary Jane
The woman plays no games, now, now, now, Mary Jane

I'm in love with Mary Jane, I'm not the only one
If Mary wanna play around, I let her have her fun
She's not the kind of girl that you can just tie down
She likes to spread her love and turn your head around

Do ya love me Mary Jane, yeah
