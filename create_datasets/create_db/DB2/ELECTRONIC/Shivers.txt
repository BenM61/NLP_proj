A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit

World's on turn around 
Music make no sound 
Where is sweetness found 
Where love is gone 

Sun don't come around 
Don't make a sound 
Where can love be found 
If your heart won't feel 

Shivers 
Up and down my spine 
Breaker 
Not on my mind 

A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit

How could it end this way 
Don't leave me, love me 
Just a little bit longer 
Just a little bit longer 
Just a little bit longer 

They don't turn tonight 
Morning don't bring light 
Where is sweetness found 
Where love is gone 

Won't you stay tonight 
Let the truth shine bright 
Where can love be found 
If your heart won't feel 

Memories 
Emotions that we share 
Teardrops 
Signing my face 

How could it end this way 
Don't leave me, love me 
Just a little bit longer 
Just a little bit longer 
Just a little bit longer 
Just a little bit longer 

A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit
A little bit just a little bit
