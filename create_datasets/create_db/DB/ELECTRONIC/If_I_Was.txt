If I was (if I was) a better man (a better man)
Would fellow men (would fellow men) take me to their hearts
If I was (if I was) a stronger man (a stronger man)
Carrying the weight of a popular demand
Tell me would that alarm her
I'd never harm her at all

If I was a soldier
Captive arms I'd lay before her
If I was a sailor
Seven oceans I'd sail to her

If I was (if I was) a wiser man (a wiser man)
Would other men (would other men) reach out and touch me
If I was (if I was) a kinder man (a kinder man)
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me would that appease her
I want to please her again

If I was a painter
I'd paint a world that couldn't taint her
If I was a leader
On food of love from above I would feed her

If I was a poet
All my love and burning words I would show it
If I was her lover
Her eyes in kisses I would cover

Come here my baby
Oh they can't touch you now
I'll keep you save and warm
I'll never leave you at all
Come here my baby
Oh they won't touch you
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me would that appease you
I want to please you again
