I'm never goin' home when the summer is a come
And it's morning again at my window
I look back in my life through the pages of time
And the days of my life with you

When we ran in the sunlight with love on our faces
And laughed at the world through the rain
There were days of my life filled with people and places
And I wish I could live them again

So I'm never goin' home when the summer is a come
And I think of the good life we knew
And it's sad to see it end and to know I will spend
All the days of my life without you

Once a young sailor I met by the sea
Said he wished I was eleven years older
Maybe some summer he'll come back to me
And he'll carry me off on his shoulder

So I'm never goin' home when the summer is a come
And I think of the good life we knew
And it's sad to see it end and to know I will spend
All the days of my life without you

So I'm never goin' home when the summer is a come
And I think of the good life we knew
And it's sad to see it end and to know I will spend
All the days of my life without you
All the days of my life without you
