Boats rocking slow on the water
Wheat fields just wave goodbye
Pictures to you of my roaming alone at night
Oh, what a surprise
Even I look on to see the lights of dawn

Daylight so bright it comes easy
To rest a weary soul
When holding on gets you weary, just let it go
What a surprise
Even I look on to see the lights of dawn

Sometimes you just believe
That broken hearts will mend
In matters of the heart
You know time is the oldest friend

Love comes when no one is looking
And brings you home to stay
All of my life
I've been longing to feel this way
Oh, what a surprise
You and I are gone to see the lights of dawn
