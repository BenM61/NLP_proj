Yesterday I swore 
I was gonna switch you 
But today I'm back for more, oooh 
I cant resist you 
Starvin' just to feed the feel 
But lust just to make a deal 
Will power disappears 
You become the music in my ears 

I want you tonight 
I feel like getting crazy 
Oh, I know its not right 
But who is gonna save me? 

Now and then I stop 
And wonder what I'm doin 
And sometimes when I talk 
I dont know who Im foolin' 
As the demon livin' deep inside 
Its really me all right 
Temptations doin' it to me 
Got me in the mood I cant get free, no 

I want you tonight man I'm thinkin' maybe 
Oh, I know it ain't right but who is gonna save me? 

Is there no way of fighting this feeling inside 
Where ecstasy lives but sanity dies? 
We all need more of each other 

I want you tonight 
I feel like getting crazy, yeh 
Oh, I know its not right 
But who is gonna save me? oh-oohhh! 
I want you tonight man I'm thinkin maybe 
Oh, I know it ain't right but who is gonna save me? 

Ohhh! 
I want you tonight 
I want you tonight 
I want you tonight 
I want you, I want you tonight 
 
I want you tonight 
I feel like gettin craaaaaazy 
Oh-ohhh I know its not right 
But who is gonna saaaay-yave me? 
I want you, I want you tonight 
Wontcha baby, wontcha baby
