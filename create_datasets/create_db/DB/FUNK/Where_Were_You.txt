Tried to call you 
Come back to see you too 
But I could never get you on the phone 
When I'd come by you were never at home 

Where were you when I need you most 
You know I do 
When I needed you most 
Oh, oh, oh...oh, ho, ho...yeah 

Oh, baby, you say you love me 
It seems to me I've heard those words before 
There's an old sayin' that 
"Action speaks louder than words" 

Where were you when I need you most 
You know I do 
When I needed you most 
Oh, oh, oh...oh, ho, ho...yeah 

Baby, oh, oh...
