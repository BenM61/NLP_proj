I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
And see what there is to see
Time is just a melody

With all the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet
Can take them
I just roam through town

And though my window's got a view
Where the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for me now
So for now

Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

Well, this engine screams out loud
Sayin' the beat gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
'Cause it's gonna sting me when I leave this town

And all the people in the street that I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get to

But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows

You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
The things that you find
And you lose and you know

You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
So put the blinds down low and

I need this here
Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

I need this here
Old train to breakdown
Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
