Cadence and Cascade
Kept a man named Jade
Cool in the shade
While his audience played

Purred, whispered "Spend us too
We only serve for you"

Sliding mystified
On the wine of the tide
Stared pale-eyed
As his veil fell aside

Sad paper courtesan
They found him just a man

Caravan Hotel
Where the sequin spell fell
Custom of the game
Cadence oiled in love
Licked his velvet gloved hand
Cascade kissed his name

Sad paper courtesan
They knew him just a man

Cadence and Cascade
Cadence and Cascade
