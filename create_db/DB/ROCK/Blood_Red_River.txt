This is the blues and I want you
When I sail down the blood red river to your heart
This is the poise that I want to an angel calling come to me come save
There's a place that I once knew and I came to you for your heart
Here's a girl that I brought with me I ll take yours with your life

Come with me, come with me
Here's a life that I once had now once a week ill have yours
Here's the time that I needed filled so I'll take yours and come for my heart
And then the rise there exchanged
This is the blues when I want you when I sail down the blood red river to your heart
