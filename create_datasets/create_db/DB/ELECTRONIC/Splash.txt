Well, I can hear the noise in the city
But I can't move
What is that in the distance
Well it's the gateway through
The night's so young
I feel numb

If you hear them, hear them too
I won't be far, too far from you
And if you see them, see them too
They won't be far, too far from you
You get the sickness from the heat wave
The sickness of the afraid
I get the shakies from the party, oh
And I can't find you
My conscience found its new name
It tries and gets me in a new way
I'm like a voice in the city
I know I won't find you this time

Now I can hear the noise from the city
Is there no one here
What is that in the subtext
Will your voice be clear
As time goes by
You'll might find

If you hear them, hear them too
I won't be far, too far from you
And if you see them, see them too
They won't be far, too far from you
You get the sickness from the heat wave
The sickness of the afraid
I get the shakies from the party, oh
And I can't find you
My conscience found its new name
It tries and gets me in a new way
I'm like a voice in the city
I know I won't find you this time

The night's so young
I feel numb
If you hear them, hear them too
I won't be far, too far from you
And if you see them, see them too
They won't be far, too far from you
