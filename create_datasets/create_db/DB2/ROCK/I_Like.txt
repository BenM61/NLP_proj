I like your nose, I like your hair
I like you clothed, I like you bare
I like your boots, your skirts and your blouses
I like your suits, your shirts and your trousers
I like your mild political stances
I like your wild spontaneous dances
I like the way you drive me insane, morning, noon and night

I like you 'cause you're sexy
I like the sexy things you dress in
I like it when you're sitting next to me whispering sexy things
I like you cause you like me
I like the poems that you write me
I like the pictures that you thoughtfully draw for me
They make me look all right
Oh yeah, I like, I like, I like

I like the way you make me laugh
I like your brain, both left and right half
I like the songs you sing when you're bathing
I like your dog when he's behaving
I like your car, you curse like a trooper
During a hard reversing manoeuvre
I like the way we kiss and we make up after a fight

I like you cause you're sexy
I like the sexy things you dress in
I like it when you're sitting next to me texting me sexy things
I like you cause you like me
I like the poems that you write me
I like the pictures that you thoughtfully draw for me
They make me look all right
Oh yeah, I like, I like, I like

I like you cause you're crazy
I like the way you do whatever you like
It constantly amazes me, baby please stay with me tonight
Oh yeah, I like, I like, I like
