You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at its where he
Where he wanna be

(Huh huh oh)
(Huh huh oh)
(Huh huh oh)
(Huh huh)

(I don't want yo man)
'Cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like that
(Eh he he he he)
Yo man he be calling me back
'Cause see I'm fine and a matter of fact
(Eh he he he he)
He asked how I do that that
Fit my jeans over baby fat
Listen
I don't know the type of tricks he playin
But I should warn you I don't want ya man

I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if wanna go he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinking about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How ya love someone who didn't love me
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he
Where he wanna be

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

When this song come on in the club
They gon be like damn that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They gon drop they tops like damn that's hot
They gon mix it wit Biggie "It was all a dream" like damn that's hot
Me and Keyshia won't stop
Til the tick don't tock like damn that's hot

Now understand why I take my time
'Cause you come wit alibis
Trying to get me to see that's where you trying to be
But I don't want yo man
Your man's been calling me
Trying to get me to see
That he wants me to be wit him
But he ain't the one for me
And if you only knew
You would
Do what you had to
Finally see that
You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at its where he
Where he wanna be

Here's a little lesson Lil Kim don't stress 'em
Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke up wit my Ex he wit her for now but
Little do she know she just a rebound
Callin' my phone she so outta pocket
I been there before old girl you need to stop it
When he's wit you he's wishin' it was me
You might be where he's at but I'm where he wanna be (baby baby)

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go

If he ain't gonna love you
The way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you
The way he should
Then let it go
