Ever and ever, forever and ever you'll be the one 
That shines in me like the morning sun
Ever and ever, forever and ever you'll be my spring
My rainbow's end and the song I sing

Take me far beyond imagination
You're my dream come true, my consolation

(Ever and ever, forever and ever) you'll be my dream
My symphony, my own lover's theme
(Ever and ever forever and ever) my destiny 
Will follow you eternally 

Take me far beyond imagination
You're my dream come true, my consolation

(Ever and ever, forever and ever) you'll be the one 
That shines in me like the morning sun  
(Ever and ever, forever and ever) my destiny  
Will follow you eternally
