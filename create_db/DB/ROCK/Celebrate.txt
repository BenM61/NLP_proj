She insists that she's a lunatic, closer to the bone
She hardly ever visits upstairs, we'll ride the telephone
Well I guess beauty does what beauty does best
It's beautiful

She says that's the trouble with reality

This party's over
I'm going home
Celebrate
This party's over
I'm going home

His essential complications are hung up on confused
It's a planet full of traffic lights and traffic light abusers
But that's no stranger than strange

Histories of insanity intruding on the sane
Celebrate
This party's over
I'm going home
Celebrate (celebrate)
This party's over
I'm going home

Histories of insanity intruding on the sane

For anyone to shoulder

See that's the trouble with reality
It's taken far too seriously
I do hope God is good to me
And Santa Claus to the children
Celebrate (celebrate)
This party's over
I'm going home
Celebrate (celebrate)
This party's over
I'm going home
Celebrate (celebrate)
This party's over
I'm going home
