With nothing to lose you'd waste away 
Obscure in exile 
They've witnessed the times 
You've gone astray 
Whose fault? now you're thinking... 

There's nothing to prove 
A message from the crowd 
To the shore... 

And it feels now 
Just like heaven's coming down 
Your soul shakes free 
As its conscience hits the ground 

So strange are the ways, 
They all have changed 
Still life it stays the same 
A break from the past 
Could make it last 
Maybe just a little longer 

There's nothing to prove 
A message from the crowd 
To the shore... 

You surrender 
Love under will 
Rest assured you're adored 

And it feels now 
Just lie heaven's coming down 
Your soul shakes free 
As its conscience hits the ground 
 
This time, no tears, 
Just one last chance to see you prove 
Stay strong, no fears 
There is a change that's
 
Coming through 
Hold on my love 
Hold on...
