Top off the ride
We could cruise around
Listen to the sounds till the sun goes down
Staring at my window at you

Am I the same without you
And I ain't the same without you
Can't even do my thing without you
So gone to the one that I love

And I remember how it was
I wish I could be back there because
I want to be there where I can
Take a

[Chorus]
Top off the ride
We can cruise around
Listen to the sounds till the sun goes down
There's a party goin on in every
Corner

That's why I gotta be in California
We can take a top off the ride
We can hit the shore
We can hit sunset
There's a party going on in every corner

That's why I gotta be in California
Staring at my window at you
Am I the same without you
But life ain't the same without you
Because I know that it'll be too long
Before I see you

Tears for my eyes cry to
Tears for my eyes cry blue
I love it when the breeze comes through
So as soon as I get back
I'm gonna take a

[Chorus]
Top off the ride
We can cruise around
Listen to the sounds till the sun goes down
There's a party goin on in every corner

That's why I gotta be in California
We can take a top off the ride
We can hit the shore
We can hit sunset 
There's a party goin on in every corner
That's why I gotta be in California
