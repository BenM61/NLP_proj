Won't someone tell me what is happenin to me
why am i so miunderstood?
Why can't they see?
Now I'm caught between the devil and the angel   that I used to be

They say I'll understand it all in good time 
but age ain't nothin but a number inmy mind
I'm goin crazy with this push me pull me
caught between wrong and right

                     CHORUS
(I want to give in to the woman in me
I want to be someone they don't want me to be
The moral of this story is i got no choice
I must not chase the boys)

I started writing down my deepest secrets
seven days a week of truth and fantasy
got the feelin that the way my life is
got to be prepared for changes

won't someone tell me what is happenin to me
why am i so misunderstood?
why can't they see? Now I'm caught between the devil and the angel that I used to be

                    CHORUS(extended)
(I want to give in to the woman in me
I want to be someone they don't want me to be
the moral of this story is i got no choice
I must not chase
I want to go left but they tell me go right
don't want to be the little girl they kissin goodnight
The moral of this story is i got no choice
i must not chase the boys)

they can try to make me write a thousand lies
but that won't ever change the way i feel inside
they've got their opinions but i don't care
cause that's not what i want to hear

i, i must, i must not chase the boys
i, i must, i must not chase the boys
i must, i must, i must not...chase...the boys

                    CHORUS(extended)
