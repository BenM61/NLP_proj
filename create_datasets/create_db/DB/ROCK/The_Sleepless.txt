You sing it so lovely
It hit me like a stone
Some trees they fall down
But I know some will grow

The shadow has left me
She put me in my place
But I think I'm fine here
It's a place where I can stay

I can stay
I can stay

The turning of winter
Do you miss your home
Or do you have it?
A love to call your own

Laughing is easy
And laughing is all I have
Some mornings
I hope the light will understand

Understand
Understand

Let's try it out now, breathe it in now
And all we have is now
Hold it in now but let her out now
Let's keep so still now

The sweetest confusion
Left me in the sun
And I forgot you
I forgot we were one

The sleepless, the wonder
Puts holes inside my brain
But I think I'm fine now
I see a light with no pain

No pain
No pain

Let's try it out now, breathe it in now
And all we have is now
Hold it in now but let her out now
Let's keep so still now

You sing it so lovely
It hit me like a stone
Some trees they fall down
But I know some will grow
