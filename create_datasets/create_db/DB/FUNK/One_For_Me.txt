There was a lonely place that I used to know
it used to lie way down deep in my soul
until I met this fly guy we caught each others eye
by then i knew that everything was all right
talkn til dawn everynight i knew that it was love
cant help the feelin that we're feeln it keep growin strong
spend every minute holdin hands, I got the perfect man
brought so much joy back into my life

Since the day that I first saw him
cant stop thinkn of him
right then I knew that he was the one for me
maybe we can do that somethin somethin
cant stop thinkn of him
right when I knew that he was the one for me

Girl let me tell you bout his style, with his gorgeous smile...
oooh
his kiss so chocolate, i wanna licc it, drives me crazaay
I cant see no other lady, but me
huggin and kissin on my baby
oh how I love it wen he share his fantasy
no doubt his momma raised him like he's supposed to be
I'm feelin him, he's feelin me
and thats the way we got to have it

Since the day that I first saw him
 
cant stop thinkn of him
right then I knew that he was the one for me
maybe we can do that somethin somethin
cant stop thinkn of him
right when I knew that he was the one for me

He chosed me... he loves me like no other
without his love dont know what to do
heal, his touches mends without heaven
I know we fit together cuz... 

We side to side like two turn tables right
jumped in the middle and hooked chu up like cable right
how we do the puff, food on the table
Nivea's hott plus we on the same damn lable, riight
u like my favorite sandwich with no mayo mah
I like yo thuggish ways and datz for realz mah
and at the bar, im callin u on the cell, u bz
den hook up the steak and potatoe

Since the day that I first saw him
cant stop thinkn of him
right then I knew that he was the one for me
maybe we can do that somethin somethin
cant stop thinkn of him
right when i knew that he was the one for me
