This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of y'all, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home wit trigga

I see you in the club oh shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said baby wassup
Reach for that hand shake got a hug
Bottles of H got me wit a lil' buzz
Up in V-I-P wit' all of my thugs niggas
You leaned over and said you want me
Girl when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib shawty where we gon' end up
Girl sit back relax hold up
Let me turn the radio on

Girl when I get you to the crib (get to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

Put the code in the gate
Pull up to the driveway
Cause she like the way I touch her
Listenin' to usher I got a confession
Know we bout to sin but your body is a blessing
(Father forgive me)
Can we take it up stairs
My bed is waiting there
All I want to do is
Give you all of me
And want you give me all of you
I want your body like right now (right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle (lifestyle)
Baby turn the lights down
And I'ma turn you on

Girl when I get you to the crib (get to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

It's a celebration clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gon' do it big like this
Yea and he was just practice
He ain't in your world you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire can I be the one you match with
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at
Maybe I can grasps it
If you ever come up wit a question you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still I can get you past it
Yea and your friends all suggest
Whats the chance of this nigga being betta' than the rest
Just tell em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

Girl when I get you to the crib (get to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
