Ooh, ooh moving violation
(Moving violation)
You ran the stop sign, moving violation
(Moving violation)

When you gave him what was mine, moving violation
(Moving violation)
Ain't nothin' you can say, moving violation
(Moving violation)
(The games you love to play)

I saw you at the wheel
And you drove me out of my mind
(You've been careless with my love)
Hurt me a thousand times
And that's a moving violation
(Moving violation)

Moving violation
(Moving violation)
You ran the stop sign, moving violation
(Moving violation)

When you gave him what was mine, moving violation
(Moving violation)
Ain't nothin' you can say, moving violation
(Moving violation)

Girl, I'm a witness
Girl, I'm a witness

(Oh)
Oh, I placed you high above the rest
I gave you my, my very best
(But you played your game)
It was just an act
And you gave your love when I turned my back

You're pushing me back now, baby
(Pushing me back, pushing me back)
I've taken all I can stand
(Pushing me back, pushing me back)

But I saw you standing there
(Yes, I did now)
Giving him your hand
(You gave him your hand)
And that's a moving violation
(Moving violation)

You should have read the sign, moving violation
When you gave him what was mine, moving violation
(Stop, red light)
You should have made him stop
(Stop, red light)

Ooh, red light
(Stop, red light)
(Moving violation)
You should have made him stop
(Stop, red light)
(Moving violation)

Saw him at the red light
(Stop, red light)
(Moving violation)
Should have made him put on the brakes
(Stop, red light)
