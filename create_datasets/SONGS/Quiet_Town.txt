I know somewhere 
There is a party going down
Interesting people 
Conversation to be found
I've lived in cities 
Where there is no solitude 
I've made some friends here
That I hope I never lose 
But, for now 
I want to stay in this quiet town

The neighbors on my block
They've got stories to tell
This is the grocery 
But, once was a hotel
And Mr. Driskle he just stands there 
With his smile 
Inviting everyone he sees 
To come inside
This is the life 
I want to live in a quiet town

Ohhhh
Sometimes I miss the show
I learned a long time ago

Ohhhh
Sometimes I miss the show
I learned a long time ago

Come Sunday morning
There's a market on the square
Children are playing 
Bells are ringing in the air
Old men are drinking
It's a lazy afternoon
Content with thinking 
That there is nothing to do
But, for now
I'm going to stay in this quiet town
In this quiet town
In this quiet town
