A little jazz is just a bit of this and that
Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's groovin', how the groove makes you move

Jazz music sprouted rock and roll
It was the very first music that we call soul
Jazz is hot, it's cool, it's good, it's bad
And it can change your mood to happy from sad

Jazz is hip, it's groovy, it's fresh, it's jive
And when you play it, it makes your soul come alive
You know it's the upbeat rhythm that makes it bop
And once you get it started, well, it sure is hard to stop

No other music can compare
When the bass starts walkin', it fills the air
You know that the sass of brass has made it last
And it's the groove of blues from present to past

Hey, what about some of those great legends of jazz?
Yeah, like Jazz Royalty
Oh, you mean Duke Ellington and Count Bassie
What about the great horn players?
Louis Armstrong, yeah, and Miles and Dizzy too
Don't forget Snookie
What about Yarnburn?
What, don't you mean Charlie Parker?
Yeah, this cool named Freddy Hubert

A little jazz is just a little bit of this and that
Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's grovin', how the groove makes you move
