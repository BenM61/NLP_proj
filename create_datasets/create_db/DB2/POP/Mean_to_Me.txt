You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you'll phone
You don't and I'm left alone.
Singing the blues and sighin'.

You treat me coldly
Each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
It must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me

Sweetheart I love you
Think the world of you
But I'm afraid you don't care for me
You never show it
Don't let me know it
Everyone says I'm a fool to be
Pining the whole day through
Why do you act like you do?

You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you'll phone
You don't and I'm left alone.
Singing the blues and sighin'.

You treat me coldly
Each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
It must be great fun for you
Can't you see what you're doing to me
Please tell me why you're so mean to me.
That's all?
