Ten thousand stories sent
Two lovers disguise
You've seen the future now
A love that is blind

Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

You've dialed that number now
So where's the surprise
Temptations calling you
A secret reply

Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

All along I've had feelings I can't help
Makes me want to kiss and not tell

You say in evidence
They won't take you alive
But when the sun goes down
You cover your lies

Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

You like the elegance
But it's weighing you down
And sometimes you just need a night on the town, oh

Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

All along I've had feelings I can't help
Makes me want to kiss and not
And all I want is to come right out of my shell
Makes me want to kiss and not tell

All along I've had feelings I can't help
Makes me want to kiss and not
And all I want is to come right out of my shell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

All along I
Feelings I can't
Feelings I can't help
All I want is
To come right out my
Come right out my shell

All along I
Feelings I can't
Feelings I can't help
All I want is
To come right out my
To come right out my shell (Makes me want to kiss)

All along I
Feelings I can't
Feelings I can't help (Makes me want to kiss)
All I want is
To come right out my
To come right out my shell (Makes me want to kiss)
