All my family, all my friends
They won't take me back again
It's not hard to understand
Why they finally washed their hands

Try to save me
Oh don't betray me
Try to save me
Give back what you gave me
Try to save me
I know I'm crazy but
Try to save me
Like I saved you

When you were scared and full of doubt
I got down and pulled you out
And if in time you feel the same
I'll always hold myself to blame

Try to save me
Please don't betray me
Try to save me
Give back what you gave me
Try to save me
Lord knows I'm crazy but
Try to save me
Like I saved you

It's a lonely weight to carry
I need your help to keep me strong

Try to save me
No don't betray me
Try to save me
Give back what you gave me
Try to save me
Oh Lord I'm crazy but
Try to save me
Like I saved you
