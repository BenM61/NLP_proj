Why don't you listen to the preacher, preacher man
Just be aware, if you can
There's a war on the horizon, yes they've got a bomb
Bea it right or be it wrong
You know the book, it will not save you
Will not save you from the fall
Yeas, why don't you keep on praying
That judgement day would end it all
End it all

Command or opinion
Truthdare doubledare
Truthdare doubledare
Dare to be different
Truthdare doubledare
To be yourself

Now judgement day is comin'
And the people will be free
We always think about our children
And the way it's got to be
I'm not praying for a miracle
I never listen to the law
I'm gonna put it all behind me
I want you all to know the score.

Why don't you listen to me preacher
Would jesus like what you have done?
Why don't you know what you've been preaching
To each and everyone
You know your church has been a lying
Been unfaithful to us all
You know we gotta trust each other
Or we'll all go up with the bomb
Won't you listen to me preacher
Listen to me please
Hold your hand out to me preacher
I'd even get down on my knees
Yes there's war on the horizon
And yes they've got the bomb
This world it might be ending
Be it right or be it wrong
