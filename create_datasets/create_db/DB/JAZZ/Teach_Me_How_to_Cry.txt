I wanna cry because I'm blue
But I can't cry like others do
I'd feel much better and I'd try
Somebody, teach me how to cry

I've been in love a time or two
To lose a love is nothing new
But every time my tears are dry
Won't someone teach me how to cry?

It may be that I'm too young
To know the meaning of the blues
If I could throw away the pride
That's hidden deep inside
The tears in my heart I could lose

I wish someone would come along
And make my life a happy song
I'd weep and tell the blues goodbye
Somebody, teach me how to cry

It may be that I'm too young
To know the meaning of the blues
If I could throw away the pride
That's hidden deep inside
The tears in my heart I could lose

I wish someone would come along
And make my life a happy song
I'd weep and tell the blues goodbye
Somebody, teach me how to cry
