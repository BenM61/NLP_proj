I tell myself I love you
Because I really care
I tell myself I need you
But is that really fair?

I really truly love you
And I'll always be there
Just don't know how to tell you
I don't want to be here

I can be the friend that I was to you
Like we were right from the start
I can be right there when you want me to
Even a million miles apart

I gave you every part of me that I could
But the one thing I can't give you
Is my heart
Is my heart

(Your heart, your heart, your heart, your heart)

I wish that I could like you
My feelings are sincere
But every time I try to
It kinda disappears

I know how much you love me, mmm
And you want me to love you
But every time I try to
Ooh the feelings ain't there

I can be a friend like we used to be
Like we were right from the start
I can be right there when you call me up
Even a million miles apart

See, I gave you every part of me that I could
But the one thing I can't give you
Is my heart
Is my heart

(Your heart, your heart, your heart)
My heart, your heart (your heart)

I gave you every part of me that I could
The one thing I can't give you
Is my heart (give you my heart, give you my heart)
Is my heart (give you my heart, give you my heart)
Is my heart (give you my heart, give you my heart)
Is my heart (give you my heart, give you my heart)

But I can't do it, I can't do it
