I was walking along, minding my business
When out of an orange-colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam!
Wonderful you came by

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange-colored view
Wham, bam, alakazam!
I got a look at you

One look and I yelled "timber
Watch out for flying glass"
'Cause the ceiling fell and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
"I've been hit; this is it, this is it!"

I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alakazam!
Out of an orange-colored sky
