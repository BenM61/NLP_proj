Look at all the tables standing still
The smoke has settled from the air
Everyone was laughing, finding romance
Now there's only empty chairs

People used to dance here after hours
Wrapped around each other in a song
Every now and then, so very long ago
Doesn't really seem so long

Driving up at midnight, ladies dressed in fur
When I see the quiet street, I always think of her
Not the way she is now, but the way that she was then
Sometimes you can't go back again

Driving up at midnight, ladies dressed in fur
When I drive these rainy streets, I always think of her
Not the way she is now, but the way that she was then
Sometimes you can't go back again
