The gold road's sure a long road
 Winds on through the hills for 15 days
 The pack on my back is aching
 The straps seem to cut me like a knife
Repeat
Repeat
 I'm no clown I won't back down
 I don't need you to tell me what's going down
 Down down down
 I'm standing alone, I'm watching you all
 I'm seeing you sinking
 I'm standing alone, you're weighing the gold
 I'm watching you sinking
 Fool's gold
 These boots weren't made for walking
 The marquis de sade never made no boots like these
 Gold's just around the corner
 Breakdown's coming up round the bend
 Sometimes you have to try to get along dear
 I know the truth and I know what you're thinking
 Down down down
 I'm standing alone, I'm watching you all
 I'm seeing you sinking
 I'm standing alone, you're weighing the gold
 I'm watching you sinking
 Fool's gold
