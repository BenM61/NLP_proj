Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
I love somebody but I won't say who

Handsome, say, he's six feet tall
And his picture's on my wall
Love to be his baby doll
If he kissed me I (Buddy joins in) wouldn't mind at all

I love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody but I won't say who

Don't know why she acts so shy,
She oughta know I wouldn't dream
Of even hurtin' a fly
Hope she doesn't pass me by
'cause if she did I'd die, I know I'd die

I love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody, yes, I do
Love somebody but I won't say who

He's big and strong
Would'ja like to feel my muscle?
Bold and gay
I never once lost a tussle
At the moment he's not very far away
Why don'tcha say who, say already?
I'd want to marry him today
But you don't say who
That I cannot do
Happen to be me?
Possibility
Won'tcha tell me who ya love?
Love somebody
Tell me true
Yes, I do
Yes, you do
Love somebody
I do, too
And I do
Maybe me
Love somebody
I hope it's me

Love somebody but I won't say who
(At this point Doris sang, "say and Buddy sang tell".

C'mon confess
Why don'tcha try and guess?
Do tell. 
Let's tell.
You promise not to breathe a word?
Doris, don't be absurd
Strictly entre-nous?
Oui, oui!! We two

Well
Confidentially
Between you and me
Confidentially
I love somebody
I've got news for you
Love somebody
I feel that way, too
Love somebody
Glad it's true
That somebody that I love is you
