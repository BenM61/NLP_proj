Beautiful day
Shined when I needed that most
Shined on the church yard
Tin cans full of gold
Come on home
It's not too late
We can fall apart together

Beautiful girls smiled
When I needed it the most
Smiled on my heavy eyelids again

Come on home
It's not too late
You can fall apart together
Come on home
It's not too late
We can fall apart together
Fall apart together

Fall apart together
Fall apart together

Ooh don't wait to long

Come on home
It's not too late
We can fall apart together
Come on home
Oh baby It's not too late
We can fall apart together
Fall apart together
