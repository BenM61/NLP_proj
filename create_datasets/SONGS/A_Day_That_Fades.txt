One more touch
And then we're leaving
One more move
The curtain falls
Yet our final destination
Is unknown

One more shelter
Then it's over
One more tear
When love moves on
Yet our simple exhalation
Still shows
No

Don't want to face goodbye
Until tomorrow
Don't wanna look into
The eyes of
A day that fades

One more night
Before the dawning
One more change
For us to get there
Yet I know this adoration
It will pass

One more time
I'll hear you stories
One more tine
I'll tell you mine
Yet underneath this
Conversation
We both know
No

Our hearts still feel
Connected
And ending might reveal
Because there's no tomorrow
So let us make believe
