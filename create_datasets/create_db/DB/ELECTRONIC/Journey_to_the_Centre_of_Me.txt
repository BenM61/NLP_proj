Come on a fantastic journey
Ride into me, come inside me
All you have to do is enter
Journey to the centre

Journey to the centre of me

Dig me deeper, delve in more
On your journey to the core
Captain Nemo's digger bore
Twenty thousand leagues

Journey to the centre of me

Push inside me like a mole
Burrow through this little hole
Make a tunnel, keep control
Of your exploration

First you push and then you pull
When I ask, go slow or faster
When I ask, go hot or cool
Push me pull me lover

Stop when I say stop
Go when I say go
Quick when I say quick
Slow when I say slow

Journey to the centre of me

Stop!
Go!

Journey to the centre of me

Slow!
Slow!
Now go!
