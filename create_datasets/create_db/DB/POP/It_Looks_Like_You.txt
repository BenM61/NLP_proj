I can't for the life of me tell you
What all this is really about
So I'm leaving you with the burden of proof
And a strong case of reasonable doubt

Honey, it looks like you
Got some explaning to do
Honey, it looks like you
Got some explaning to do

I can't for the love of jehovah
Comprehend why you knock at my door
When you said it was over, over and over
Wasn't that what you told me before?

Honey, it looks like you
Got some explaning to do
Honey, it looks like you 
Got some explaning to do

Like where you've been and what you've done
And who you saw and was it fun
Was it places that you never thought you'd go
Why you went on the attack
Why you left and why you're back
And the fact that you refuse to let me know

Honey, it looks like you
Got some explaning to do
Honey, it looks like you
Got some explaning to do
Honey, it looks like you
Got some explaning to do
Honey, it looks like you
Got some explaning to do
