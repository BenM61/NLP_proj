So many times you said we'd be together
What does it take to get you close to me?
So many times you said things would get better
But time after time you failed to convince me

And now you're tellin' me it's all in the past
How can you be sure it's gonna last?
Say you wanna be with me
And that you're comin' to me right now

I want to believe, I need to believe
I almost think I can believe

Just my luck, you'll get caught up in the rain
That's the last time that you'll come my way again
Just my luck, you get caught up in the rain
But that's the last time that you'll come my way again

So many times you said that you would never
Never take your love away from me
But girl, you know sometimes you're like the weather
You brighten my day and then you rain on me

And now you're tellin' me it's all in the past
How can you be sure it's gonna last?
Say you gonna be with me
And that you're comin' to me right now

I want to believe, I need to believe
I almost think I can believe you

Just my luck, you get caught up in the rain
But that's the last time that you'll come my way again
Just my luck, you get caught up in the rain
But that's the last time that you'll come my way again

Just my luck, you get caught up in the rain
But that's the last time that you'll come my way again
Just my luck, you get caught up in the rain
But that's the last time that you'll come my way again

Just my luck, just my luck
But that's the last time that you'll come my way again

Say it again one more time
That's the last time that you'll come my
You get caught up in the rain
But that's the last time that you'll come my way again
