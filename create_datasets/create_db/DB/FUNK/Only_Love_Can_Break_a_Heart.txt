Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Last night I hurt you
But darling remember this

Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

You know I'm sorry
I'll prove it with just one kiss

Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Give me a chance to make up
For the harm I've done
Try to forgive me and let's keep
The two of us one

Please let me hold you
And love you for always and always

Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again
