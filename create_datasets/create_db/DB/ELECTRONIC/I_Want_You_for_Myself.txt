[Chorus]
I want you for myself
I don't want nobody else
To try to intervene or come between
You and me
'Cause we got a thing, yeah
I want you for myself
I don't want nobody else
To try to intervene or come between you and me
'Cause we got a good thing, babe
Why should I play the field
When it's you that I want?
I'm not that jealous type
But I ain't gonna front
We should just settle down
And stop fooling around
'Cause we both feel each other
So why should there be those other lovers

I know what love is
So I know that my feeling true
'Cause I feel for you
But sometimes I feel hurt
'Cause I play the fool
So if loving you alone is wrong
I don't wanna be right

[Chorus]

Let's get legitimate and concentrate on us
So when we're intimate, our love is based on trust
Love is so good when there just two
People involved just me and you
'Cause the thought of you with someone else
Just makes me crazy, baby

What love is
So I know that my feeling true
'Cause I'm a fool for you
But sometimes I feel hurt
'Cause I play the fool
So if loving you alone is wrong
I don't wanna be right

[Chorus]

Girl, you got me 
Think I want you all for my own
Girl, you got me 
Think I want you for my own
Baby, come on, come on, come on
Girl, you got me 
Think I want you all for my own
Girl, you got me 
Think I want you for my own
Got me going, love you sugar, got me going
Girl, you got me 
Think I want you all for my own
Girl, you got me 
Think I want you for my own
Just you, babe
Baby, I want you for my own

[Chorus]
