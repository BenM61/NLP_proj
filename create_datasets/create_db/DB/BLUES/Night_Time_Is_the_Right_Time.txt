I'm gonna tell you baby something I want you to do
Don't stay out all night baby, and I want your little heart to be true
Yeah because night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
With the one you love

Now don't forget baby, I love you with all my might
If you get home before midnight baby, I declare everything will be all right
Yeah because night time is the right time
To be in the bed with the one you love
With the one you love

I ain't gonna beat you baby, I declare I ain't gonna dog you around
Gal I'm just gonna warn you baby before the news gets all over town
Gal that night time is the right time
To be in the bed with the one you love
With the one you love

Play it mister man! Night time is the right time!
Listen to me baby, I mean with your whole heart and mind
I just want to hold you baby in my arms and hold you for a long long time
Yeah because night time is the right time
Baby to be with the one you love
Oh with the one you love
