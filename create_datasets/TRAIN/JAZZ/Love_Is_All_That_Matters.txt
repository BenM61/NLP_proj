(Love is all, love is all, love is all, love is all, love is all)
Love is all that matters
And we've got love
We have walked all with a prize (love is all, love is all)

The stars that I used to see
Are not where they used to be
They only will shine for me in your eyes
(Love is all that matters to me)

You are all that matters
And I've got you
We're on top and we won't fall (we won't fall 'cause love is all)
No fortune that we can boast

We're happy with tea and toast
For we've got love and love matters most of all
(You are all that matters and I've got you)
(We're on top and we won't fall)

No fortune that we can boast
We're happy with tea and toast
For we've got love and love matters most of all
(Love is all that matters, love is all)
