Oh, come and take me away,
Oh, 'cause everything is wrong today,
Look to the east, there are colors in the sky
The sun and the flames, and tho I started to cry

'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Every time you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's so high, never feeling bad,
Used to be alone now I feel so glad,
Every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born

Anytime you need some peace
Come along and stay with me
The forest burns, there are fires in the sky

'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Every time you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's so high, never feeling bad,
Used to be alone now I feel so glad,
'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born

Want time in your fist, you got to be free
Want time in your fist, now come stay with me
Cause I pull it to the left
Pull it to the right
Mass this song wid dem dat uptight
Want everybody just feel alright
Mass it 'course to make you excite

'Cause every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Every time you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's so high, never feeling bad,
Used to be alone now I feel so glad,
Every time you touch me I feel like I'm being born
