Outta space ballin, put you up on astronomy
Mathematically with a pistol I do triginomatry
Humbly eat up a n**** like a piranna be	
Ridin in tha cutless same color as a bumble bee

Paint tha chevy sad blue, you know my devi sad blue
Ride straight past you
My choppas will outlast you
I promise I'm a smash you
Thirty aught sixes blast you
600 see through benz, call it tha gla** coupe
Diamonds look like pa**ion fruit
Viper look like apple fruit
Ride through tha hood
You know tha 'burban look like snapple juice
Bricks from black facts, from summa hill pappa 2
Rapper who, b**** you know I'm tha best thang smokin
Hit him in tha neck with tha tek and leave ya throat smokin
Dro rollin, b**** I got a million for ya million (what)
We up in these hoods, trappin buildin after buildin

I love flippin down screens
And love ridin 23
Love glidin down tha street
And love watchin lean on me
Love payin ten a key
Love sellin pounds of weed
Love in tha club when my thugs are surroundin me
Ain't nobody bouncin me

Feds try and pounce on me
I'm larger than a mountain be	
Shawty say she f*** wit grand hustle, b**** bounce on me
Ice come from tokyo, roll like a rolly poll
5 blunts of total dro, I think I'm bout ta overdose
Trunk ain't bumpin, it jumpin, it got tha holy ghost
Bricks by tha 50, 10 naw shawty 40 more
Trap time n****, yeah strap time n**** put out better rubberband
Crap time n****, in my lap a nine n****
