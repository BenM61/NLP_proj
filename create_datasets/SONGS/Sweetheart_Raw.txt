Her life is sinking--
Drinking up this stinking pain.
She gets to thinking,
"There's nothing now could ever change."

She lies, for hours,
Crashed upon the concrete floor;
Remembers flowers,
And looks that left her sweetheart raw.

Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart,
Sweetheart raw.
No hope, no fear.
No hope, no fear, no more.

The drunken fumbling,
The shaking hands and shaken head.
The constant stumbling;
The ghosts of what she should have said.

She sees her children,
Crushed beneath her coward feet.
Still not forgiven,
She's broken by her heart's sweet beat.

Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart,
Sweetheart raw.
No hope, no fear.
No hope, no fear, no more.

Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart,
Sweetheart raw.
No hope, no fear.
No hope, no fear, no more.
