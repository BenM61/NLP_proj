No more lonely nights
Baby, that's just what you told me
(That's what you said)
But you're nowhere to be found
Something just ain't right
'Cause I can't get you to hold me 
Even when you're around

Baby you promised me 
That you'd always be there for me
(Tell me) Tell me what's on your mind
(Tell me what's on your mind)

What happened to the "I Love You"s
The hugs and kisses and the rendezvous'
What happened to me and you
You said you'd never change
What happened
Baby, talk to me
You used to be sugar sweet
Just like candy
Now you're breaking my heart 
With all your broken promises

Open up your eyes
Baby that's what people tell me 
(That's what they say)
But it's hard to let you go
I can't take your lies
If you're spending time with somebody else
You gotta let me know

Baby you promised me
That you'd never run a game on me
(Tell me) Tell me what's on your mind

What happened to the "I Love You"s
The hugs and kisses and the rendezvous'
What happened to me and you
You said you'd never change
What happened
Baby, talk to me
You used to be sugar sweet
Just like candy
Now you're breaking my heart 
With all your broken promises

You say you're gonna do this 
And you say you're gonna do that 
But you never come through
(But you never come through)
And it's so different lately 
'Cause you don't call me baby
I just don't know what to do
(I just don't know what to do)

What happened to the "I Love You"s
The hugs and kisses and the rendezvous'
What happened to me and you
You said you'd never change
What happened
Baby, talk to me
You used to be sugar sweet
Just like candy
Now you're breaking my heart 
With all your broken promises

You say you're gonna do this
And you say you're gonna do that
Oh what happened to me and you
You said you'd never change
Baby baby tell me
What happened
Baby, talk to me
You used to be sugar sweet
Just like candy
Now you're breaking my heart 
With all your broken promises

So quit breaking my heart 
With all your broken promises
