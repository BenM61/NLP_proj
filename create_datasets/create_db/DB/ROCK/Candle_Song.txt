Anyone can light a candle
But not the way that you do

Anyone can light a candle
Just like a flower in the rain
You are unique, the same
Each step you take, each dream you realize
Will open your heart, your life

Anyone can light a candle
But not the way that you do
For if we look too close
Pure magic we would see
Pure magic we will be
 
 It's all around each one, it's all around within
The perfect union close inside your dreams
To watch in wonderment as each day begins
They tell me you can hear this song

Anyone can light a candle
But not the way that you do
For if we look too close
Pure magic we would see
Pure magic we will be
