I look at you
And that's a dancer drinking
What a mess
A drink record lipstick
You've made a joke
Do you hear me laughing?
Get out my face 
Before I loose my patience

Oh me and you
Let's cut the story
And when I'm gone
It takes a lot to shake me
So shake it,
It's the battle in me

It's the battle in you
It's a battle in me

It's a bloody war
Of patricians
Let's see which one of us
Is gonna least the ?

Cause I hear voices of my witch
Surround me
And I'll be down 
If I'm done
Why ride the place?
Why ride the ? stop spinning
?
I want something to happen
So make it happen

It's the battle in you
It's a battle in me

Let's take a torch
Through the past to the future
?
See how it feels
With the passing warning
We'll be down 
When we're done

Shake it, shake it
Shake it up

Shake it, shake it
Shake it up

Cause it's the battle in you
It's the battle in me

It's the battle in you
It's a battle in me

Shake it, shake it
Shake it up

Shake it, shake it
Shake it up
