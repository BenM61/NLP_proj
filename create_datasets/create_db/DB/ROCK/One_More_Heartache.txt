One more heartache, baby, I can't take it, now
My heart is carryin' such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like the camel with the heavy back, yeah
One last straw, they say broke the camel's back

Oh baby, oh, I can't take it, babe
I can't stand it, now

One more heartache, it would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high then you let me down
Like the house's built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down, the foundation was not able

Oh, baby, oh, I can't take it, babe
I can't stand it, now, oh

One more heartache

One more heartache, baby, I can't take it, now
My heart is carryin' such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like the camel with the heavy back, yeah
One last straw, they say broke the camel's back

Oh baby, oh, I can't take it, babe
I can't stand it, now
One more heartache, baby
One more, now, heartache, baby

Without your love, I (?) baby
Now, I can't stand it no longer
Oh, baby, ooh, come on
Won't you listen to my plea?
Oh please, baby, oh please, baby
