Wind it up, here comes the video
It's that song again
Turn it up, it's on the radio

Rockarama, charge me up, I got electric eyes, I won't fall own
Light me up, just like a Christmas tree, Or am I seeing things
Wind it up, turn it up, charge me up, never stop
Wind me up, plug me in, turn me on and give me rock and roll
Strap me in to the rocket ship I'm headin' for the sun
Tune me in to the mother ship I must be seeing things

Rockarama it's on the video
Rockarama on my radio
Rockarama on the stereo

Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll

Plug me in jack to jack
Pin me to the wall
Hey leave that on
I'm on M.T.V. Now I'm seeing things
Wind it up, here comes the video
It's that song again
Turn it up, it's on the radio
Or am I hearing things
