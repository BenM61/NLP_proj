Tonight
I know in my heart I want to be with you
Let me love you tonight

How can I make you want me?
How can I make it for real?
I want to love you forever
I hope that you feel the same

I'd give everything for you
To make you want to stay
I'll give everything I have
I love you more than I can say

Let me love you tonight
And I'll make you feel alright
I know in my heart I want to be with you

Oh, baby, let me love you tonight
And I'll make you feel alright
In a million years I won't be over you
Let me love you tonight

I know you don't want to
Be without my love
And if you're gonna kiss me
You know that you'll have to stay

I'd give everything for you
To make you want to stay
I'll give everything I have
I love you more than I can say

Let me love you tonight
And I'll make you feel alright
I know in my heart I want to be with you

Oh, baby, let me love you tonight
And I'll make you feel alright
In a million years I won't be over you

Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight

In the light I see your face
But only in my dreams
Let me be the one to hold your hand
And make you understand

Oh let me love you
I want to make you feel alright
Yes I know in my heart I want to be with you

Oh baby let me love you
Let me love you tonight
And I'll make you feel alright
I know in my heart I want to be with you

Let me love you tonight
And I'll make you feel alright
In a million years I won't be over you

Let me love you tonight 
Let me love you tonight
