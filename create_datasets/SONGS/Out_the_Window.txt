It's about time your heart fills up
I can make you mine now watch me
Drop a lil' something in your cup 

Have another sip beside me

Slow down, carry me home
My legs feel like jello
Lights out, arms open wide
Exhale, step inside

It's about time the sun comes up
We don't wanna believe it
Seven hours later I'm still up
I can't really see us sleeping

Think I-I'm staying home
My hair's up and you know
My face starts in the light
Tell my mother hi

My oh my, out the window
Sunshine, in my eye
My oh my, Lord I don't know
Sunshine, in my eyes
Eye, eye, eyes

I only want a good time (I only want a good time)
I only wanted to try (and free my mind)
I only want a good time (I only want a good time)
Where I can take in the sunshine

I only want a good time
Try to free my mind
I only want a good time
And sunshine

My oh my, out the window
Sunshine, in my eye
My oh my, Lord I don't know
Sunshine, in my eyes
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
