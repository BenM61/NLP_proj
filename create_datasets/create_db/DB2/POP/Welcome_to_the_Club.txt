Oh, do I hear you saying you got hurt?
Did you say that she's a flimflam flirt?
Are you saying that some
Double-dealing doll went and did you dirt?
Well, bub, welcome, welcome, welcome to the club

Now you know the feeling when you're stung
Now you know why Torchy songs are sung
So you stumbled down the ladder of love to the bottom rung
Well, bub, welcome, welcome, welcome to the club

Hear, hear, hear, don't look so gloomy
Look a here, here, here, it?s happened to me
So have no fear, love went and threw me
But we all snap back, mac

Ten to one, you'll give up wondering why
Why she gave you up for that new guy
But until you find the kiss
That makes you kiss all your blues goodbye
Well, bub, welcome, welcome, welcome to the club

But until you find the kiss
That makes you kiss all your blues goodbye
Well, bub, ah, wel, wel, wel, wel, welcome
Ah, wel, wel, wel, wel, welcome
Wel, wel, wel, wel, welcome to the club
