Oooh, Winchester Cathedral, you're bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as my baby left town
You coulda done somethin', hey, you didn't try
You didn't do nothin', you just let her walk by

Now everyone knows just how much I needed that girl
She wouldn't have gone far away if only you'd started ringin' your bell

Winchester Cathedral, you're bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as my baby left town

Hey, Winchester Cathedral, you are bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as, you watched her go by, my baby left town
You coulda done somethin', but you didn't even try
You didn't do nothin', you didn't ding-dong, you let her get by

Now everyone knows just how much I needed that girl
She wouldn't have gone far away, if only you'd started ringin' your bell

Now, Winchester Cathedral, man, you've brought me down
You just stood there and watched as my baby left town!
