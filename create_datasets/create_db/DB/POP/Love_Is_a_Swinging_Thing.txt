Yes, love, love, love, love, love is a swingin' thing.
It's a swingin' thing.
Makes you laugh, makes you cry,
Makes you live, makes you die,
'Cause love is such a swingin' thing.
 
Take a look in the sky; I see two little birdies flyin' by.
Don't wonder why, they have all the joys love can bring,
'Cause love is a swingin' thing.

Say you need my lips, (come on, come on) come on.
Say you want my heart, (come on, come on) come on.
Say you need my love, (come on, come on, come on) come on. 
I may be young today, but tomorrow I will be grown 

Some people say love, love ain't this, that, and nothin,' I don't lie.
There is no other.
I don't need a wedding gown, I don't need a diamong ring,
'Cause I dig love; it's such a swingin' thing; you tell 'em, girls.

Some people say love, love takes all of your new kissing in the head.
Well, I think it's cute.
No more, and I'll take a little chance.
I'm gonna have a fling,
'Cause I dig love; it's such a swingin' thing.
