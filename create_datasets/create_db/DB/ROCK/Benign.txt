Would it be so hard for you
To state just for the record
That you've done your best to do nothing at all
And that you stood around
And watched from every corner
As everyone around you hit the ground 
Would it tear you up inside
To take on the reflection 
Of everyone around you that you know
Instead of getting by
With lying and deception 
Of everyone around you letting go

All of this time
It's been benign

Only heaven knows
Only heaven shows the way
Back to everything you know and love
Only heaven knows
Only heaven shows the way
Back to everything you know and love
Everything you know and love
Everything you know and love
Back to everything you know and
All of this time 
It's been benign

Would it be so hard for you 
To state just for the moment
That you've done your best to do nothing at all
And that you stood around
And wallowed in your splendor
As everyone around you hit the ground

All of this time
It's been benign

Only heaven knows
Only heaven shows the way
Back to everything you know and love
Only heaven knows
Only heaven shows the way
Back to everything you know and love
Everything you know and love
Everything you know and love
Back to everything you know and 
Everything you know and love
Everything you know and love
And love
And love
And love
Back to everything you know and love
And love 
And love
And love
Back to everything you know and
All of this time
It's been benign
