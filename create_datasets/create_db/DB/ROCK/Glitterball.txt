Full of doubt, took the easy way out
Always said they couldn't find their place
Among some real dark stuff, they got to thinking enough
Remember halcyon days

We'll spend our time with a bottle of wine
And a love that knows no human state
Never got to wake up early
Never got to feel so poorly
As the great unloved go dancing all the way

Glitterball, radiate round the hall
Lifts me up, then leaves me to fall
Glitterball, radiate round the hall
As the great unloved go dancing all the way

One step, two step, three step, four
Drag me to the middle, then you pulled me to the floor
Glitterball, radiate round the hall
As the great unloved go dancing all the way

And I've been captured by imagination
I feel the faint vibration in the air
Been taken hostage by the one creation
Anticipate the night that's in your hair

Glitterball, radiate round the hall
Lifts me up, then leaves me to fall
Glitterball, radiate round the hall
As the great unloved go dancing all the way
Glitterball, radiate round the hall
Lifts me up, then leaves me to fall
Glitterball, radiate round the hall
As the great unloved go dancing all the way

One step, two step, three step, four
Drag me to the middle, then you pulled me to the floor
Glitterball, radiate round the hall
As the great unloved go dancing all the way
One final day
As the great unloved go dancing all the way
Don't make me wait
As the great unloved go dancing all the way
Don't make me wait
As the great unloved go dancing all the way
