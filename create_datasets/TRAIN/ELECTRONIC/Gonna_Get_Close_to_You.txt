I like to look at shadows sweating on the wall
I get excited when I hear footsteps in the hall
La la la la la la la la la la - ah-hah
(Ooh) Outside your balcony... I have a room with a view

(And I'm watching you)
I dial your telephone... each and every afternoon
I wait by your door
'Til your asleep at night

And when your alone
I'm there when you turn out the light
You fumble for the keys
I'm six or seven steps behind you!

(I'm so close to you)
Are you terrified of me?!
What do I know 'bout you?
How did I find out?

You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic
Say I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with it
It's as plain as black and white...

I'm Gonna Get Close To You
Oh-oh so close to you
I'm Gonna Get Close To You
Oh-oh so close...

If you knew my infinite charm ...oh oh
There'd be no reason to be so alarmed
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right, maybe i'm some kind of lunatic
You say I'm wasting all my time, but I know what to do with it
It's as plain as black and white...

I'm Gonna Get Close To You
Oh-oh so close to you
I'm Gonna Get Close To You
I'm gonna get so...

I'm Gonna Get Close To You
Oh-oh so close to you
I'm like a hungry criminal
And your protection is minimal

So minimal
I'm gonna get...
Ooh... Ooh-ooh...

I'm Gonna Get Close To You
I'm gonna get close...
I'm Gona Get Close To You
So close
I'm Gonna Get Close To You
So close
