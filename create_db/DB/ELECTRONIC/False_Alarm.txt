I heard sirens in my head
From the first time that we met
Thought it was a false alarm
Yeah, we started as a spark
Didn't think we'd come this far
But here we are, oh

I'm dancing in flames
I'm dancing in flames
I ain't scared of the blaze
Don't rescue me
And now I'm burning in your arms
Endless fire in my heart
No, it's not a false alarm
No, it's not a false alarm

But here we are
I never get my hopes up
'Cause then I'll never get let down
But you were something special
I didn't notice until now

I heard sirens in my head
From the first time that we met
Thought it was a false alarm
Yeah, we started as a spark
Didn't think we'd come this far
But here we are, oh

I'm dancing in flames
I'm dancing in flames
I ain't scared of the blaze
Don't rescue me (don't rescue me)
And now I'm burning in your arms
Endless fire in my heart
No, it's not a false alarm
No, it's not a false alarm
No, it's not a false alarm
No, no
No, it's not a false alarm
No, no
No, it's not a false alarm

Maybe I'm too careful
Didn't trust the signs
Didn't wanna jump
Too scared of the height

And now I'm burning in your arms
Endless fire in my heart
No, it's not a false alarm
No, it's not a false alarm
Oh, no, it's not a false alarm
No, no
No, it's not a false alarm
No, it's not a false alarm
No, it's not a false alarm
