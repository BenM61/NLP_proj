He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one with good intentions
He was down with his brother, respectful
to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention

One kid with the promise
The brightest kid in school, he's not a fool
Reading books 'bout science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool

Well he's not invisible anymore
With his father's nine and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over prime time news

Mary's got the same size hands as
Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole Oh Oh, now we'll never know

They're crying to the camera
Said he never fitted in, he wasn't welcome
He'd show up to the parties we was hanging in
Some guys were putting him down, bullin' him 'round

Now I wish I would have talked to him
Gave him the time of day, not turn away

If I would've then it wouldn't maybe go this far
He'd might'a stayed at home playing
angry  chords on his guitar

He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name

Mary's got the same size hands as
Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole Oh Oh, now we'll never know

Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away
He had a tryout with the sixahs couldn't
wait for Saturday
Now we're never gonna see him slam
Flyin' as high as Kobe can
His life was stole Oh! Oh! Now we'll never know

Ya their lives were stole
Now we'll never know
We were here, all together yesterday
