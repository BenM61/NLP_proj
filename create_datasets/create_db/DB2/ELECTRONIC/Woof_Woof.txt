Beast Antelope grazed the fields today
Beast Lion eats fat and flesh away
'Least little bugs clean the road and say
Now that's the price you're gonna pay!

Beasts, really sir, I like you.
Still got the eyes but the heart's run through.
Little beast, lion at a feast,
These little things run a tiny little playground

Singer
But I don't have a backup singer
And I wonder why I glow now
Oh, and I might ask her

Some beasts are living in the day.
Some beasts still litter upon the ground.
Some beasts don't really like music.
Some beasts are rarely seen!

Some beasts are living in the day.
Some beasts still litter upon the ground.
Some beasts don't really like music.
Some beasts are rarely seen!

Please go wild
Let your skin breathe
Hold your head up
Beasts still recive
Beyond the Rainbow
Let the Moon Grow
Follow your Neighbor
Go where they go

Please go wild
Let your skin breathe
Hold your head up
Beasts still recive
Beyond the Rainbow
Let the Moon Grow
Follow your Neighbor
Go where they go
