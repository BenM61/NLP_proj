(Body to body, body to body)
(Body to body) Nobody does it like you do (body to body)
I love the way you make me feel when you do what you're doin' to me, oh
Touchin' either way you do, you don't know you got to feel it too, ooh
When your body's next to mine, you've got me hypnotized
(Body to body, body to body)
You know I like the way you do what you do when you do it to me, oh
(Body to body) Nobody does it like you do (body to body)
You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no, oh what you do
Flowin' through this magic night, I love to feel you hold me tight
You wonder what is right for me, you've got me feelin' tinglin'
Share the night with stars above, I think I found this thing called love
Fever running through my eyes, you are my heavenly device
(Body to body, body to body)
(Instrumental break)
(Body to body) Nobody does it like you do (body to body)
You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no, oh what you do
You open up a world to me, you change my life so tenderly
I know you are the only one, you're brighter than the burnin' sun
Don't know where you're goin' to, I don't care as long as I'm with you
That sudden sparkle in your eyes has got me feelin' oh so high
(Body to body, body to body, body to body, body to body)
(Body to body) I like what you do (body to body) when you do
(Body to body) all those things to me (body to body) that you do to me, baby
(Body to body) yeah yeah yeah yeah, that you do to me (body to body)
(Body to body) body to body (body to body, body to body, body to body)
(Body to body, body to body)
