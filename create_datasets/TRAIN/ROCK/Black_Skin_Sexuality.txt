Oohh...
I think I'll stay in my little closet
I think I'll stay where it's nice and warm
There's no one to ask me embarrassing questions
There's no one to wonder where I've been

I think I'll stay in my little posse
I think I'll stay where I think I'm free
So they can protect me from my infidelity
And I can believe they care about me

I can beat you, I can beat you
I love aggression, I love aggression
I can reach you
Inside your dirty mind
But don't talk about...
Skin, skin, black skin, Sexuality
You're not wanted
Skin, skin, black skin, Sexuality
You're not wanted
You're not wanted 'cause you look too much like I do

I think I'll stay in my little culture
I think I'll try to be, what you wanna see
And I can pretend I'm one of the girlies
I can pretend it's no big deal

But what do I do if I'm not black enough
What do I do if I'm too weird
I will deny me, I will survive me
I will be one of my pressured peers

I can beat you,I can beat you
I love aggression,I love aggression
I can reach you
Inside your dirty mind
But don't talk about...
Skin, skin, black skin, Sexuality
You're not wanted
Skin, skin, black skin, Sexuality
You're not wanted
You're not wanted 'cause you look too much like I do
