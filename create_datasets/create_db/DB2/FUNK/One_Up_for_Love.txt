When it all began
We were perfect then
Somehow we have lost our way

We keep going there and I know you're scared
We will make it back one day

Well no more, no more, no more fighting now
Cause together there's nothing that we can't do

Throw one up for the love
So one up for the love
Put one up, put one up
Don't give up just stand up
One up for love
One up for love
One up for love
Don't you wanna stand up for love
Everybody all around the world
One up for love, one up for love

So many are angry
Too many are broken in
And the smoke keeps rising up

You know, with all this confusion (all this confusion)
Everybody's loosing, when is it gonna be enough?
Oh yeah,

So no more, no more, no more fighting now
Cause together there's nothing that we can't do

Throw one up for the love
So one up for the love
Put one up, put one up
Don't give up just stand up
One up for love
One up for love
One up for love
Don't you wanna stand up for love
Everybody all around the world
One up for love, one up for love

No more, no more excuses
We don't need to fight,
Find a way to bring it back to love
(Bring it back, bring it back)
No more
We can change the world
We can change the world this time

Throw one up for the love
So one up for the love
Put one up, put one up
Don't give up just stand up
One up for love
One up for love
One up for love
Don't you wanna stand up for love
Everybody all around the world
One up for love, one up for love

One up for love
Oh oh oh
One up

One up for love
Oh oh oh
One love

One up for love
