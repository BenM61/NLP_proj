You say you're all alone
With visions all your own
The thing you feel nobody feels the same
But you, you know me you know what I've been through

Everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
Touches you

Friends along the road
May lighten up your load
By saying what they think you want to hear
But I'll only tell you what I feel is true

'Cause everything that touches me
Everything that touches me, baby
Everything that touches me
Touches you

Share 'cause I can't take you there
Unless I know a part of what you're thinking
But can it be only thing
Darling, can't feel my poor hearts breaking
My heart is breaking

Everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
It touches you

Oh, everything that touches me
Everything that love can do now
Everything that touches me
It touches you, you

Everything that touches me
And everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
Touches you, you

Everything that touches me
And everything that touches me
Everything and everything oh yeah, yeah
