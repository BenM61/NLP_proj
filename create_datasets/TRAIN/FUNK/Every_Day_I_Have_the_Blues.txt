Ev'ry day, 
Ev'ry day I have the blues, 
Ev'ry day, 
Ev'ry day I have the blues;
Well, you see me worry, baby, 
Because it's you I hate to lose.
Nobody loves me, 
Nobody seems to care,
Nobody loves me, 
Nobody seems to care;
Speakin' of bad luck and trouble, 
Well, you know I've had my share.
I'm gonna pack my suitcase, 
Movin' on down the line,
Oh, I'm gonna pack my suitcase, 
Move on down the line;
Well there ain't nobody worryin' 
And there ain't nobody cryin'.
Seems to me ev'ry day, ev'ry day, 
Ev'ry day I have the blues, 
Ev'ry day, ev'ry day, ev'ry day, 
Ev'ry day I have the blues.
You see me worry, baby, 
Cause it's you I hate to lose.
Nobody loves me, 
Nobody seems to care;
Nobody loves me, 
Nobody seems to care;
Speakin' of bad luck and trouble, 
Well, you know I've had my share.
Ev'ry day, 
Ev'ry day I have the blues, 
Ev'ry day, 
Ev'ry day I have the blues;
Well, you see me worry, baby, 
Because it's you I hate to lose.
