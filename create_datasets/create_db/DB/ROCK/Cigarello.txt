Filthy rag dolls in the bed
I cant listen to what they said
Don't get silly don't get so sick
Get some trousers and get some quick
All the wasters they come in threes
Honey that's no excuse to tease
Is this your house do you live here
Your not as sick as you appear

In the day though your dumb in a way

And everybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be there side show
A brown 'n' yellow cigarello dancing under your window

Can we watch movies on your TV
Don't have to get dressed just for me
We could stay home and get drunk quick
I could wear your dress and your lipstick
Or we could go out and steal a car

Both get loaded and drive real far
Is this your house do you live here your not as sick as you appear

In the day???

And everybody?s giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be there side show
A brown 'n' yellow cigarello dancing under your window

And everybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be there side show
A brown 'n' yellow cigarello dancing under your window

And everybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be there side show
A brown 'n' yellow cigarello dancing under your window
