Now what we came here to do
It means more to me than just a night
That we share
So make sure that you're prepared
Baby and know that love is not just something to do
It's the moment that transcends
Our physical into a more spiritual level of understanding


And who knows
Somehow this night
Just might lead us into a place
Where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows
What may happen
If we act on our attractions
And loose ourselves
Inside a world made for us
And no one else
Hey girl just let me love you

Now ain't no need to be afraid
Cause I'll be as gentle as it takes
To provide you with the right amount of
Pleasure and pain and I'll
Make sure that you feel alright
Even if it takes me all night
Cause the joy is all mine
When I know your satisfied
So lets keep giving all we got


Listen, now I can see it in your eyes (yeah)
(I can handle whatever's on your mind)
That you want to baby just as bad as I do
(and girl I wanna give it to you)
Now if you can just set aside your fears
And just try to deal with what's going on with us right now


Oh baby girl
Come on and let me love you
