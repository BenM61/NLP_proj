It's funny how I watch the day go by
I'm sitting watching TV
Talk shows high
There's banging on the walls
My head aches
I'm drinking out the world
That I hate

I had a big car, new clothes everything
I've had a watch engraved in Switzerland
Today I saw her buying a magazine
It's time to get myself some therapy

How do I stop this, how do I stop this
How do I stop this disease?

She's got a new dress on (I'm in cement)
Sits by her radio (I'm in cement)
She's got those x-ray eyes (I'm in cement)
Don't know which way to go

It's funny but I dream for yesterday
I'm blistered by the burns that life has made
I'm staring out behind the window shade
I see her face across the street again

I"m in quicksand sinking in again
I've got concrete shoes and I can't swim

How do I stop this, how do I stop this
How do I stop this disease?

She's got a new dress on (I'm in cement)
Sits by her radio (I'm in cement)
She's got those x-ray eyes (I'm in cement)
Don't know which way to go

I don't know what to do
But I know that I must pull through
I can't keep watching you

How do I stop this, how do I stop this
How do I stop this disease?

She's got a new dress on (I'm in cement)
Sits by her radio (I'm in cement)
She's got those x-ray eyes (I'm in cement)
Don't know which way to go
