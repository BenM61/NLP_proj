Got the heat turned on and the windows down
She's hell on wheels, telling everyone how good it feels
My teethy she-wolf, knocking on my door
She wants to roam the road just to get down on the floor
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride

Steering with her knees, she's got both hands free
Using the cruise control, you know, reaching over she likes to tease
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride
Just use your body, don't need to hitch-hike
When you ride with me, little boy, take it any way you like
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride

Creatures and swerves, screwing up my nerves, start flying across the seat
Pulling me close at every curve
Just use your body, she says, don't hitch hike
When you ride with me, little boy, take it any way you like
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said ride
