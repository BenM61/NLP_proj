Do you really love your baby
Do you care
Do you really love your baby
Do you really really care
I really wanna know

Do you mean what you say
When you say that you love me, baby
Tell me now

If you're going away
Will she come back to find me playing?
Never

You're away on your love boat
Now do you love any other
Do you dare if the temptation is there?
How much do you dare?

Do you really love her?
Do you love her
Do you really love your baby
Do you love her

Now I know what it is
When you're touched by that lovely feeling
And if you're going away
If you need someone for sensual healing, all right

There comes a time when you hunger
And you hate being, being far away
What do you do when the temptation is there?
How much do you dare?

Do you really love your baby
Do you care?
Do you really love your baby
Do you love her

It's not easy to love someone
'Cause being free is a lot of fun
Do you know what you're gonna do
I've got me feeling, don't you ever lose

Do you love your baby
Do you love her

There comes a time when you hunger
And you hate being, being far away
What do you do when the temptation is there?
How much do you dare?

Do you really love your baby
Do you care?
Do you love her

Do you really love your baby
Do you really, really care?
Do you love her?

Do you love your baby
Do you love her
Do you love your baby
Do you care?
