Oh no It's 3am
And the party is still jumpin'
And the club it is about to close down
DJ tellin' everyone to get out
But the girls and I ain't ready to go
The night is young and we ain't tryna go home
So we gotta find another spot
Cause you know the party ain't goin' stop, no

Lets roll and not stop
It's on to the next block
The party is hot and won't stop till 6 o'clock
Everyone come on along
We're gonna have some fun oh yeah

Oh no it's time to go
Everyone's finished but don't want to go home
We gotta find another place to be
Let's get somewhere cause it's still early
Everybody meet outside
Pump some music in your ride
Don't worry about the time
Cause we're gonna kick it tonight

Forget about the clock
Take everything we got
And make our own hot spot
Right in the parking lot
Play the hot songs
Get your drink on
Find a partner
And get your grove on
