I can see the older man
Looking at the younger man
I can see the younger man
Looking at the boy
Other there the older woman
Is looking at the younger woman
I can see the younger woman
Looking at the girl

Cause every man sees
In the younger man the hope
Every woman sees
In the younger girl the dream
Everybody lives
The pride and passion of the young
From the womb to the tomb
we will remember what it means

So celebrate youth (celebrate)
Those who have it (young ones)
Celebrate youth (celebrate)
Give them sight
The future of the world's in the (celebrate)
Hands of the children (young ones)
So celebrate youth (celebrate)
Teach them right

Look in a child's eye
There's no hate and there's no lie
There's no black and there's no white

I can see the older man
And sometimes in the older man
I still see the young boy
Burning in his eye

And locked up here inside out spirit
Is the child that we are hear it
Some of us will always fear it
And some will heed the cry

So celebrate youth (celebrate)
Those who have it (young ones)
Celebrate youth (celebrate)
Give them sight
The future of the world's in the (celebrate)
Hands of the children (young ones)
So celebrate youth (celebrate)
Teach them right
