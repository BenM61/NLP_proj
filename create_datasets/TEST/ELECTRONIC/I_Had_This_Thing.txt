I had this thing to call my own
Just one slip and it was gone

A minor flaw and then it fell
I brought this house down on myself

I didn't know just what I'd done

I didn't know just what I'd done

I don't remember anymore what I used to be
Where is the quiet piece of home where I could breathe?

Just like a razor to my soul when I'm alone
Oh, I had this thing to call my own

I'm so confused, I cannot see
This wave of guilt is drowing me

It feels like blood is on my hands
I'd give it all for a second chance

I still don't know just what I've done
I still don't know just what I've done

I don't remember anymore what I used to be
There was a fire burning strong inside of me

Just like the soothing loving warmth of summer sun

Oh, I had this thing to call my own
I had this thing to call my own
I had this thing to call my own

I never meant to let you go
I never meant to let you go
I never meant to let you go
I never meant to let you go
To let you go, oh
