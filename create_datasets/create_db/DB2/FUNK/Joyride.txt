Oh

What you lookin' at now baby?
Won't you use your mind, oh
I been on a long ride, baby
Can't do a sober drive, no
Found love in November nights
Cold weather in the winter time, oh, woah
Guess you know when the time is right
Let's go on a little joyride, oh

Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Tell me what you lookin' at baby?
Been in this club for a long time, no
Need another shot now baby (la, la)
Roll another joint, let go
I been rock and rollin' with my ex (living)
We be gettin' closer to the x (living)
We be always poppin' like the ex (living)
Crossin' out the haters with the x (living)

Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Tell me what you're lookin' at, oh (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Let's go on a little joyride, oh (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Let's go on a little joyride (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Let's go on a little, on a little
Whoa
Let's go on a little joyride

Don't watch me
Don't watch me
Don't watch me
Don't watch me
Don't watch me
Don't watch me
Don't watch me
Don't stop lookin' at me

Livin' life, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Livin' life, la, la, la (free my inhibitions in the seasons)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Livin' life, la, la, la  (this is what adventure's made of)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Ain't lookin' back on the old me
No more waitin' 'round for a sign
'Cause my life is mine

Livin' life
It's a joyride
