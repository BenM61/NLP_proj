Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...
Tonight let's take our time, erase what's on our minds
This may not come again
Gonna make this magic last, so let's not move too fast
You feel so good to me

I want to hold you in my arms forever
Not let go of you, never
Fill me with your touch
'Cause I could never get too much

Just a little bit more (I need)
Just a little bit more (Don't turn your back on me, don't you fall asleep)
Just a little bit more (Oh, oh)

Tonight we'll move real slow, tomorrow you will go
And I will dream this
So your feelings show, let your passion overflow
Give me the love I miss

I want to hold you in my arms forever
Not let go of you, no, never
Fill me with your touch
Because I could never get enough

Just a little bit more (I need)
Just a little bit more (Let your passion overflow, I need some more)
Just a little bit more (Oh, yes, I do)

I want to hold you in my arms forever
And not let go of you, no, never
Fill me with your touch
Because I could never, never get too much

Just a little bit more, baby (I need)
Just a little bit more, baby (Don't turn your back on me, don't you fall asleep)
Just a little bit more, baby (Oh, don't you do it, girl, don't-don't-don't-don't you do it)
Just a little bit more, more, more (I need you here, girl, you are next to me)

Just a little bit more, baby (Girl, hey, I need you here today)
Just a little bit more, baby (Just a little, just-just a little, just a little)
Just a little bit more (Just a little, just-just a little, just a little, just-just a little)
Just a little bit more (I need you, don't you hear me callin?)

I need to give you more (Let your passion overflow, I need some more)
Just got to give you more (I need you, give me your lovin', I need you, give me your lovin')
I've got to give you more (Oh, baby, just a little bit more)
Just got to give you more (Just a little, just-just a little, just a little, just-just a little)

I need to give you more (Just a little, just-just a little, just a little, just-just a little)
I need to give you more (Oh, can we do the things we used to do together)
I've got to give you some more (Just a little bit more, I need)
Ooh... (I need, I need just a little bit)

Ooh, give you more (Oh, make me feel the way, the way you know that I should feel)
Just to give you more (Give me just-just-just a little, I need just a little bit more)
I'll give you some more
