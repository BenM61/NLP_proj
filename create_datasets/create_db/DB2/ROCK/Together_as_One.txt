Now... is the time...
that we stand...together as one
A new life... inside us will shine...
as bright... as the sun

Let's bring... bring in the new...
and do... away with the old
A new love... a new love that's true...
A love that's never cold... a love that never dies
A love that fills our souls... we will survive

Together as one... we'll stand for the world to see
Together as one... we'll shine throughout eternity
All the dreams... we dreamed before...are now reality
And now the dreams (now the dreams) of a perfect love... will always be...

Together as one... we'll stand for the world to see
Together as one... we'll shine throughout eternity
All the dreams... we've dreamed before...are now reality
You and I... in a perfect love... faithfully
All the dreams... we've dreamed before... are now reality...
You and I... in a perfect love... faithfully
