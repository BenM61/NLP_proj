ROSALIA 
Puerto Rico, 
You lovely island . . . 
Island of tropical breezes. 
Always the pineapples growing, 
Always the coffee blossoms blowing . . . 
ANITA 
Puerto Rico . . . 
You ugly island . . . 
Island of tropic diseases. 
Always the hurricanes blowing, 
Always the population growing . . . 
And the money owing, 
And the babies crying, 
And the bullets flying. 
I like the island Manhattan. 
Smoke on your pipe and put that in! 
OTHERS 
I like to be in America! 
O.K. by me in America! 
Ev'rything free in America 
For a small fee in America! 
ROSALIA 
I like the city of San Juan. 
ANITA 
I know a boat you can get on. 
ROSALIA 
Hundreds of flowers in full bloom. 
ANITA 
Hundreds of people in each room! 
ALL 
Automobile in America, 
Chromium steel in America, 
Wire-spoke wheel in America, 
Very big deal in America! 
ROSALIA 
I'll drive a Buick through San Juan. 
ANITA 
If there's a road you can drive on. 
ROSALIA 
I'll give my cousins a free ride. 
ANITA 
How you get all of them inside? 
ALL 
Immigrant goes to America, 
Many hellos in America; 
Nobody knows in America 
Puerto Rico's in America! 
ROSALIA 
I'll bring a T.V. to San Juan. 
ANITA 
If there a current to turn on! 
ROSALIA 
I'll give them new washing machine. 
ANITA 
What have they got there to keep clean? 
ALL 
I like the shores of America! 
Comfort is yours in America! 
Knobs on the doors in America, 
Wall-to-wall floors in America! 
ROSALIA 
When I will go back to San Juan. 
ANITA 
When you will shut up and get gone? 
ROSALIA 
Everyone there will give big cheer! 
ANITA 
Everyone there will have moved here!
