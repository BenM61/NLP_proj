He was the kind of man that good men talk about
The way he showed his faith was how he lived it out
His hands were rough and calloused and his shoes were old and torn
And the lines that framed his smile were lines so well and deep and worn
So what will be remembered of what he left behind?
What will stand the test of time?

How to love your neighbor, how to love your wife
Wrap your arms around your children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

He worked a second job to make the ends all meet
But somehow managed to always be there for me
Showed me how to listen, how to stand for what is right
And taught me all the things that really matter in this life

How to love your neighbor, how to love your wife
Wrap your arms around your children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

And as I look into the eyes of my daughters and my sons
I hope I've stood for something that they'll want to carry on
Cause life is far too short not to finally realize
That it's long enough to make a difference in someone?s life

So I'm gonna love my neighbor and I'm gonna love my wife
Wrap my arms around my children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

Oh, the ties that bind and leave behind a legacy
A legacy of love, of love
