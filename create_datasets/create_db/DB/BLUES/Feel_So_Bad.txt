I woke up this morning
'Bout the break of day
I looked over the pillow
Where she used to lay

You know I feel so bad
Yes, I feel so bad
I feel so bad 'til I could
Regret that and cry

I got a letter, come to me today
My baby didn't come home
It say that I'm to blame

You know I feel so bad
Yes, I feel so bad
I feel so bad 'til I could
Regret that and cry

You know I give her all my money
Then I give her my time
Mad, she done messed up with another man
And she won't pay me no mind

You know I feel so bad
Yes, I feel so bad
I feel so bad 'til I could
Regret that and cry
