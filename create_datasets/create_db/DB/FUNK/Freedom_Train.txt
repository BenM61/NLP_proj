The freedom train is coming
Can't you hear that whistle blowing?
It's time to get your ticket y'all and get on board
It's time for all the people to take this freedom ride
Got to together and work for freedom side by side

That's why I tell ya
I'm gonna ride on the freedom train
I ain't gonna live this way again
I got to get on the freedom train
From this day on
I'll be a free man, yes I will, I'll be a free man now

Look like the times are changing, people
The train is waiting in the station
Go on up to the mountain top and get on board
We gonna ride on through the valley
Under the clear blue sky
Every man is gonna walk right proud with his head up high

Come on, y'all, come on
We got to, we got to ride the freedom train
We ain't gonna live this way again
I got to get on the freedom train
From this day on
Oh, I'll be a free man, yes I will I'll be a free man, yeah

(Got to ride the freedom train) we gonna ride with our heads held high
(Got to ride the freedom train) we gonna move
