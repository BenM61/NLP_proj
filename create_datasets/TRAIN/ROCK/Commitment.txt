Under the gun to wear my teenage aggression
Tell everyone it's the high school's newest succession
We didn't know what he was getting us into
Look out below, below

Come blazing your guns 
You write us off when times are rough, baby I couldn't say it enough, no
Your commitment's so dangerous

Under the scope, the new craze from the paid and the faceless
Packaged and sold by the gross to the young and the tasteless
Does anyone know where they go when they find the replacements
Look out below, below

Come blazing your guns 
You write us off when times are rough, baby I couldn't say it enough, no
Your commitment's so dangerous

Hours and hours of stipulation
Slowly adding up to manipulation
We bought into your presentation
Rock 'n' roll and speculation
Throw your pitch and show your numbers
Dropping names of the people you're working under
I'll keep the miles, you can have the cash
Here's your word you can have it back

Come blazing your guns 
You write us off when times are rough, baby I couldn't say it enough, no
Your commitment's so dangerous
I can't stand the crossroads
Turn around when the times are rough, baby I couldn't say it enough
Your commitment's so dangerous
