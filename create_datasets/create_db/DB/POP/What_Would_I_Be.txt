The angry voices raised in vain
The feeling deep inside of pain
Sometimes I think it's not worthwhile
Until once more I see you smile
What would I be without your love I'll never know
If I were free what could I do where would I go
I'm only me and I love you so.

Unspoken thoughts we both regret
Forgive the past but can't forget
Sometimes I just don't understand
Until once more I hold your hand
What would I be without your love I'll never know
If I were free what could I do where would I go
I'm only me and I love you so.

Sometimes it seems I can't go on
Sometimes it feels that everything we had is gone

But though there may be many tears
We'll stay together through the years
You only have to love me too
And I need no one else but you
What would I be without your love I'll never know
If I were free what could I do where would I go
I'm only me and I love you so.

What would I be without your love I'll never know
If I were free what could I do where would I go
I'm only me and I love you so.
