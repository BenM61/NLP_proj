Now I was super messed up
Like it would never end
Floatin' over the black top
Without a single friend
Down came a light beam
Right through my breaking heart
Message from the galaxy
That's how it's gotta start

Bang pop pop
When does this searchin' stop?
Bang bang pop pop
When the mind goes
Bang bang pop pop
Where does the moment stop?
Bang pop pop
Oh-way-oh

Now she was walkin' downstairs
Completely crystallized
Cherry lips and long hair
With a pair of sunset eyes
She's from a weird world
A mistake in Earth descent
Neon lips like a rainbow kid
She's poppin' gum in the basement

We glance
I move around
And come into her sights
The power's on
And it's burnin through the night
Her lips don't move
And it's comin through her eyes
It's makin' me out of my mind

Bang pop pop
When does this searchin' stop?
Bang bang pop pop
When the mind goes
Bang bang pop pop
Where does the moment stop?
Bang pop pop
Oh-way-oh
We glance
I move around
And get her in my sights
The heat comes on
And it's burnin' through the night
Her lips don't move
And it's comin' through her eyes
It's makin' me out of my mind

Bang pop pop
When does this searchin' stop?
Bang bang pop pop
When the mind goes
Bang bang pop pop
Where does the moment stop?
Bang pop pop
Oh-way-oh

Bang pop pop
When does this searchin' stop?
Bang bang pop pop
When the mind goes
Bang bang pop pop
Where does the moment stop?
Bang pop pop
