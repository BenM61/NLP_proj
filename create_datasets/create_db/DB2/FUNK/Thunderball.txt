He always runs while others walk;
He acts while other men just talk.
They call him the winner who takes all;
And he strikes like Thunderball

He knows the meaning of success;
His needs are more so he gives less.
He looks at this world and once in all;
Then he strikes like Thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get;
He will break any heart without regret

His days of asking are all gone;
His fight goes on, and on, and on.
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all;
So he strikes like Thunderball
