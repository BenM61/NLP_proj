Could I ever explain this feeling of love? 
It just lingers on 
The fear in my heart that keeps telling me 
Which way to turn 

We'll wander again 
Our clothes they are wet 
We shy from the rain 
Longing to touch all the places we know we can hide 
The width of a room that can hold so much pleasure inside 

Here am I alone again 
A quiet town where life gives in 
Here am I just wondering 
Nightporters go 
Nightporters slip away 

I'll watch for a sign 
And if I should ever again cross your mind 
I'll sit my room and wait until nightlife begins 
And catching my breath, we'll both brave the weather again 

Here am I alone again 
The quiet town where life gives in 
Here am I just wondering 
Nightporters go 
Nightporters slip away
