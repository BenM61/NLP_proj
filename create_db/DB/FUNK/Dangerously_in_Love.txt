I love you, I love you, I love you

Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation in connection to the sun
With you next to me there's no darkness
I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's the sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away
From this cold and mixed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life
Without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life
Without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me

And I know you love me, love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
Sometimes make me want to cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful to have you by my side

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life
Without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life
Without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me

Every time I see your face my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel
To breathe, to love you

Dangerously in love

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life
Without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life
Without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me

Dangerous
Dangerous in love with you
Oh I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
Dangerous in love
