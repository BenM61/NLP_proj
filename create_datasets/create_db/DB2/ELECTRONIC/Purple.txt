Sitting in the silent twilight
The purple half light
Of the twilight
Wrap the night around me
Blanket of black on my back
I feel safe in the darkness

Your voice is a caress
Delights my senses
Heightens my happiness
Lightens my sadness
Your eyes were on me I remember
Those days in September
Sunset run night
Your hand held in mine

Sitting in the silent twilight
The purple half light
Of the twilight
Wrap the night around me
Blanket of black on my back
I feel safe in the darkness

The silence is so loud
I almost feel it
Nothing to say now
Barely can talk now
I'm feeling like I'm lost
I'm feeling dumb
Speechless and numb
So long I've been blind
I'm losing my mind

Sitting in the silent twilight
The purple half light
Of the twilight
Wrap the night around me
Blanket of black on my back
I feel safe in the darkness

Sitting in the silent twilight rapture
Could it be too hard to capture ?
This velvet moment of serenity
