Now that you got it right
Bring love and it'll make it alright
Bring love and we'll take it tonight
Now that you got it right

Who wants the sinner
Coming 'round for dinner
Who needs effects
Who needs to pay for sex
When they drop the bomb
Who will stay calm
Blood will spill
Who would you kill

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has just begun

Walking down the road with my little rude gun
Top of my gun, cock it for fun
Block on ya tongue
Top of my earth
Tip of my birth
Top of my death
Tip of my breast
Top of my chest
Tip of my guess
I like the singles
I got the jingles
Bet you ate Springles
Walking on your road with my little rude gun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has just begun

Stepping on the street with my little rude girl
Tip of my toes
Top of my world
Top of my world
Top of my earth
Top of my rock
Tip of my block
Now that you got it right
Bring love and I'll make it alright
Bring love and we'll take it tonight
Now that you got it right

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has just begun

She was born in the ghetto outside the Bronx
In the project blocks
Where time stands still
It don't tick, it don't tock
Top of my sun
Tip of my land
Top of my chest
Tip of my breast
Top of my earth
Tip of my rock
Walking on the road with my soul in my hand
Tip of my toes
Top of my span

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has
Just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has
Just begun, just begun, just begun, just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has
Just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has
Just begun

Now that I understand this right
Let me take it to the mic
This revolution has
Just begun
