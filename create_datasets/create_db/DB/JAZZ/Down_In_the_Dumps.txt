My man's got somethin', he gives me such a thrill
Every time he smiles at me, I can't keep my body still
I done cried so much, look like I've got the mumps
I can't keep from worryin', 'cause I'm down in the dumps

I had a nightmare last night, when I laid down
When I woke up this mornin', my sweet man couldn't be found
I'm goin' down to the river, into it I'm goin' to jump
Can't keep from worryin', 'cause I'm down in the dumps

Someone knocked on my door, last night when I was asleep
I thought it was that sweet man of mine, makin' his 'fore day creep
Wasn't nothin' but my landlord, a great big chump
Stay away from my door, Mr. Landlord, 'cause I'm down in the dumps

When I woke up, my pillow was wet with tears
Just one day from that man of mine
Seems like a thousand years
But I'm gonna straighten up, straighter than Andy Gump
Ain't no use of me tellin' that lie, 'cause I'm down in the dumps

I'm twenty-five years old, that ain't no old maid
I got plenty of vim and vitality, I'm sure that I can make the grade
I'm always like a tiger, I'm ready to jump
I need a whole lots of lovin', 'cause I'm down in the dumps
