I'm going down
When I hear the sound
The sound of my tears
Always alike at the party
Always the clown of the class
All my friends see me happy, baby
But happy is only a fact
Nobody knows
When I'm alone inside my room
I sing under the two

[Chorus:]
I'm going down
When I hear the sound
The sound of my tears
When you're not around
It's all I can do
When I listen to
The sound of my tears

Baby when I'm missin' you
Don't buy the sound of the sea, baby
Don't buy the noise of the falls
Just when I'm lonely with my thoughts of you
The silence is always too loud
And it's no mine
You know we truly hang the sound
It's only just like a sign

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
The sound of my tears

[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
