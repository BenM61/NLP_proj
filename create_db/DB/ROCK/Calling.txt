Your face is burned inside my brain
I lost my way
Your taste of stale flows through my veins
The cost of hate
Cause you'll never understand me
You want me to stay

You're see-see-see-calling but I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore

The race of slowing down the pain, I found a way
The pace of speaking so mundane, the sound of gain
But you'll never make me happy
So I've extinguished the flame

You're see-see-see-calling, but I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling, but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore

And what you want me to say I'll never say
You're playing the game that I'll never play
So what do you want from me?
Now I've extinguished the flame

Your see-see-see-calling but I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore
You're see-see-see-calling but I can't hear you, I'm not listening anymore
You're f-f-f-falling, but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore
