Like dynamite
Need a cheerleader
Let me throw you down
While I look at her
I'm like "Oh my god
I think I need a girlfriend"

I'm like dynamite
Need a cheerleader

While I look at her
I'm like "Oh my god
I think I need a girlfriend"

F*ck all you bad boys
You bad bad boys

I'm like dynamite
Exploding sweet
Take out your lips
And put em back here
I'm like "Oh my god
I wish I hadn't said that"

I'm like dynamite
It's a gentle pull
You can let em wait
But you never feel full
I'm like "Oh my god
You know you need a girl
(Girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl)"
