I remember yet be'fore we met,
With every night and day
I had to live the life
Of a lonely one.
I remember meeting you
Discovering love could be so true,
When shared by two
Instead of only one.
When you said you love me
And we could not be parted
I built my world around you,
I'm so thankful that I found you.
Loving you, has made my life sweeter than ever
(I never felt like this before)
Loving you, has made my life sweeter than ever
Each night I pray we'd never part,
For the love within my heart
Grows stronger - from day to day
As best I can, and how I try
To reassure and satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost - if you went away
'Cause I really need you
And I need for you to need me too
I've built my world around you
I'm so thankful that I found you.
Loving you, has made my life sweeter than ever
(I never felt like this before)
Loving you, has made my life sweeter than ever
'Cause I really love you,
And I'm thankful that you love me too,
I have built my world around you,
And I'm truly glad,
Truly glad, that - loving you
Loving you, has made my life sweeter than ever
(I never felt like this before)
Loving you, has made my life sweeter than ever
