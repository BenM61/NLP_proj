Here I am again, alone in my lonely room
How can I believe you loved me?
Here I sit, just thinking of it
All the time that we spent together

We were holding hands
Making lots of plans, the good things
A lover and a friend to me
You were so easy to love

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

What happened boy, to the love we shared
How can I believe you loved me?
I just need to know that you cared
Honestly, is the love still there?

And if you love me like you say you do
Why don't we make plans for two?
All I need is some kind of sign

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
