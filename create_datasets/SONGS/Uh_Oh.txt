You forgot to call
Now she's sleeping without you
If you thought to call
She's sleeping without you

I don't want you to call before me
I don't want you to call before me
I don't want you to call before me
I don't want you to call

She's sleeping without you
Sleeping without you

I want you to fall, fall, fall
Don't want you to call, call, call
I want you to fall, fall, fall
She don't want you at all, all, all

She said uh oh, she said uh oh
Is it a go?
She said uh oh, uh, uh oh
I know it's go
She said uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

You forgot to call now she's sleeping without you
And I know that you're sleepless
You forgot to call
Now she's sleeping without you
Is it go?

I don't want you to call before me
I don't want you to call before me

And she ain't thinking about you
She's sleeping without you

She said uh oh, she said uh oh
She said uh oh, uh, uh oh
I know it's go
She said uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
She said uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

That's why she went home without you
Last night she went home without you
