If giving left me lonely
If giving was my friend
I'd keep in all the old themes
I keep in all the sense
But now you're feeling empty
I tried my best last time
I'll leave you with your feelings
I'll leave you in your lies
Oh, oh

I'm nothing if not subtle
Heartache at its best
Are you the one who breaks my, heart out of my chest?
I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you're waiting for a girl like me to come along (come along, to come along)
Baby go your own

I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you're waiting for a girl like me to come along (to come along, to come along)
Baby go your own

More and more

If giving left me lonely
If giving was my friend (giving's my friend)
I'd keep in all the old themes (Keeping all the old themes)
I keep in all the sense
But now you're feeling empty (now you're feeling empty)
I tried my best last time (Tried my best this time)
I'll leave you with your feelings (I'll leave you with your, ah)
I'll leave you with your lies

I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you're waiting for a girl like me to come along
Baby go your own

I'll never leave you if you're thinking that it's all the same
I'll never trust you if you're thinking that it's just a game
I see you're waiting for a girl like me to come along (come along, to come along)
Baby go your own (come along, to come along)
