I believe that we can make it
I don't care what others say
They don't know the way we love, they're outside
If you can meet me in the middle
Maybe we can compromise a little
'Cause our love is worth it all,
It's bigger than the little things we fight
For you, I'll give up all the lives that don't lift us

We're falling back in love
Here we are again
Now you're singing my song
And I'm singing your song
We're falling back in love
And we're both movin'
To the beat that goes like this
I'm singing yeah
And oh
We're falling back in love

Now that we are here together
Let this moment last forever
As I look into your eyes, they're so bright
I promise I'll tell you all my secrets
Tell you my fears, and face my demons
'Cause honesty will bring in the light
For you, I'll give up all the lives that don't lift us

We're falling back in love
Here we are again
Now you're singing my song
And I'm singing your song
We're falling back in love
And we're both movin'
To the beat that goes like this
I'm singing yeah
And oh
We're falling back in love
