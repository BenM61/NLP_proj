Hooh-hooh..., hooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hooh, hooh, hooh
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, when you're go-one

When you leave my arms (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I feel so ba-ad
And I just think about the good times we ha-ad
When we kiss goodni-ight (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh, I want to cry-why-why
I can't wait till you're back, back in my arms again

So baby, baby
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, when you're go-one

I wish there could be-ee (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
A way for you-us
To be together-er, both day and ni-i-i-hight
When I see you lea-eave (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
How my poor heart grea-eaves
Call me as soon as you walk in the door
Then I won't have to worry no more-ore

Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh, when you're go-one

Hooh-hooh..., hooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hooh, hooh, hooh
Hooh-hooh..., hooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hooh, hooh, hooh

So be back baby
(Take good care of yourself) Take good care of yourself
(Take good care of yourself, take good care of yourself)
I worry 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, baby
(Take good care of yourself, take good care of yourself) 
I worry 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, baby
(Take good care of yourself, take good care of yourself) 
I worry 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, 'bout ya, baby (fade)
