I was a wanderer
Far away from God
I had sorrow in my bosom
And my way was mighty hard

Then I heard that gospel story
How He came down from His throne in glory
He paid the debt
I know He paid the debt for you and me

He paid the debt, Jesus paid the debt
He paid the debt, He paid the debt
I know He paid the debt
He paid the, the debt for you and me

You know He's stretched out on a tree
And died on rugged Calvary
That's why I know
Jesus paid the debt for you and me

(Paul)
He paid the debt
Paid the debt
Paid the debt
Oh, yeah
Oh, it was

Jesus paid the debt a long time ago
You know they stretched Him on a tree
On rugged Calvary
Jesus paid the debt for you and me

Jesus paid the debt
For the (unverified)
Jesus paid the debt
It was Jesus He died way out on Cavalry

You know they stretched Him
On a tree on rugged Calvary
You know that Jesus, who paid
Yes, who paid the debt
