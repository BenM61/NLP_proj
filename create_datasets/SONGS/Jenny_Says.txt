I got no reason for the things I fear
The things that plague me when I see and hear
A dime's a nickel and a nickel's none
I'll throw myself into the Sunday sun
A summer Sunday when you went insane
You said you're going and I said I came
I'm throwing oranges in an apple cart
The ties that bind are tearing me apart

Jenny says turn off the radio
Jenny says turn out the light
Jenny says turn off the video
You beat yourself up to bring yourself down
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go! 
When the world is coming down on me I let it go!

I got no reason for the things I say
She turned toward me then she turned away
There's lot of forces in a modern world
That take a toll upon a modern girl
I got no reason for the things I fear
The things that plague me when I see and hear
I'll press my finger on an itchy trigger
What once was small right now is so much bigger

Jenny says turn off the radio
Jenny says turn out the light
Jenny says turn off the video
You beat yourself up to bring yourself down
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go! 
When the world is coming down on me I let it go!

I got no reason for the things I do
The dealer deals and then the dealer's screwed
You throw your cards upon a playing table
My name is Cain and I am now unable
I got no reason for the things I fear
The things that plague me when I see and hear
A dime's a nickel and a nickel's none
I'll throw myself into the Sunday sun

Jenny says turn off the radio
Jenny says turn out the light
Jenny says turn off the video
You beat yourself up because you LOVE it!
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go! 
When the world is coming down on me I let it go!
