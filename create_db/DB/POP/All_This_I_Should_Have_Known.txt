If only I'd tried a little harder
To reach this goal
To reach your soul
If only we'd been a little closer
If only we'd pulled together

I'll try to leave behind
This sense of wasted time
So much promise we denied
If only I'd let go of my pride
Cast my doubts and fears aside

All this I should have known
All this I should have known

Hold me one more time
Hold me while we dance together
Hold me now our love has gone
We tried to talk to no avail
We knew inside that this had failed

With you, I could never say what lay within my heart
With you, there was always something keeping us apart
With you, I was never really sure-

Hold me one more time
Hold me while we dance together
Hold me now our love has gone
We tried to talk to no avail
We knew inside that this had failed
All this I should have known
All this I should have known
