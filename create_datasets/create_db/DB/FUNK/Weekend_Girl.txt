I'm really please to meet you, girl 
And I'd like to get to know you better 
Maybe tonight we can get together 
For awhile, you and I 

I just don't have time 
But I'm not turning you down 
I can accept your invitation now 
'Cause I work all day and sleep all night 

I'm a weekend girl 
And I don't have time on the weekday 
Weekend girl 
But maybe we can try to work it out 

My offer stands, I think you're worth the wait 
And there's only one way to find out 
To spend some time is the only way 
But it may require some sacrifice 

I would like to see you tonight 
What's holding you back 
My J-O-B is rough on me 
It that keeps me from hangin' out 

I'm a weekend girl 
And I don't have time on the weekday 
Weekend girl 
But maybe we can try to work it out 

Weekend girl (Oh...oh...oh...) 
And I wish that I could see you 
Weekend girl (Oh...oh...oh...) 
But maybe we can try to work it out 

I never let nothin' keep me from what I want 
No rent, no job, gonna do what I want to do 
It has never dawned on me that I was so tied down (So tied down) 
This time I'll let myself go free 
Take the chance and find some happiness 

(So what are you gonna do) 
(Can we get together tonight, on the weekend, or what) 
I really don't know what to do 
I've never been in this situation before 

Weekend girl 
Weekend girl 

Go 'head, weekend girl 
Have some fun on the weekday 
Go 'head, weekend girl 
Have some fun on the weekday 

Yes, why not 
What time shall I expect you 
(Say, seven o'clock) 
Uh-huh 
(Maybe I can pick you up for dinner, you know) 
(And, uh, check this movie out) 
Oh, yeah, that sounds good 
(Maybe we'll slide by the beach a little later on) 
Uh-huh 
(Probably might take some video out there all night) 
(Ha-ha-ha) 

Weekend girl 
Weekend girl 
Weekend girl
