Excuse me, may I have this dance
I was all alone, I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up, so I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance and there this sweet lovin' thing was

She was more than enough I asked her for her hand
Said, "Would you like to dance?"
So pleased that I had asked, she quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love on a slow jam, yeah, yeah

Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
A slow jam for my baby and for me, ooh
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Play)
A slow jam
(A slow jam, yeah)

Seems what you say is true I feel the same way too
See, I've waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand I knew you were the man
To turn my world around and make my dreams come true

The magic in your eyes made me realize
That everything I feel has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love on a slow jam

Play another slow jam
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
This time make it sweet
(Play)
A slow jam
(Play another-nother slow jam for me and my baby, yeah)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Play another slow jam)

A slow jam
(Yeah, boy)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
Play a slow jam
(For my baby, my baby)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet

A slow jam
(Ooh, for my baby)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
Play a slow jam
(For my baby)
(Won't you play another slow jam?)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet

(Please Mr. DJ)
A slow jam
(Play, ooh)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
