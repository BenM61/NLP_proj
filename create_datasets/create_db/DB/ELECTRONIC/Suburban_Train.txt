We go our separate ways through the portals of love
Truth was in creating, not the aftermath
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life
But I will keep the memories for when my soul gets weary

Bittersweet stores, they always have no end
In the quietude of daybreak, we watch the sunlight bend
Can't say I was nothing before you came into my life
Now I'm late for the urban train to get back on the road again

Running thristy in the rain
I'm breaking through those clouds again
