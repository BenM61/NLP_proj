Hey, we heard the news 
That someone's cryin' the blues 
'Cause words still go unsaid 
As hungry minds are never fed 

Take a chance as you dance 
In romance in a trance 
To advance and expand 
Got a dime and a rhyme 
brilliant mind still incline 
In your prime to design 

For a man's great strength to meet 
Another trembling heart defeat 
Is read between the lines 
When change of mind 
Is hard to find 

The blossoms that you reap 
From binding challenges complete 
And wisdom's gentle rain 
Immensely crown the brain 

Take a chance as you dance 
In romance in a trance 
To advance and expand 
Got a dime and a rhyme 
brilliant mind still incline 
In your prime to design 

Moving soon, upper room 
paid your dues 
'Cause you're through feelin' blue
