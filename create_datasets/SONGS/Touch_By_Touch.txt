I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you like what you see
I can tell by the touch of your hand
That you've got what I need

Baby there's no hurry
We've got no worries
Let's take all night
Give me sweet lovin'
Come taste my honey
Into the light

Touch by touch
Your fingers do the talking
I need to hear so much
Touch by touch
Now you're getting closer
To what I want so much

I can tell by the woman in me
You're the man that I need
So much lovin' that comes from your heart
That you give tenderly

Come take my hand
I'll show you where
Where you can lean
Baby there's no hurry
We've got no worries
Make me believe

Touch by touch
Your fingers do the talking
I need to hear so much
Touch by touch
Chemical reaction
Makes me give it up

Touch by touch
And put your arms around me
Baby wrap me up
Touch by touch
Now you're gettin' closer
To what I want so much
