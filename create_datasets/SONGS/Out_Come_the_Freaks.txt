Little Rita and her sister Betty
Met some mook who drove a purple Chevy
He took them for a ride one summer night (Are you angry?)
Told the girls he was a big producer
Truth be told he was a cheap seducer
He drove them to the hills to see the lights
(Heh, heh, heh, yeah, right)

Two days later they were reading him his rights
(Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks) Shot
Out come the freaks
(Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks) Oh yeah

Tara Venus was a rent a stripper
You could feast your eyes but you couldn't grip her
She went nowhere without Jack the human knife
He'd slice you silly if you got too friendly
If you value living better treat her gently
Once she does her sexy cha-cha let her go

She will tempt you (uh-huh) but it's just part of the show
(Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks)
Out come the freaks, yo, yeah
(Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks) 
Oh yeah, oh, do, yeah

Bobby Maggot was a big attorney
Through the courtroom down to hell he journeyed
Bald headed piece of garbage that he was. (Ha, ha, ha!)
(Woof! Woof! Woof!) (Bad, bad boy!)
He'll defend you if your money's honest
Says he'll do his best but that's no promise
Off he goes in his Corvette to get a tan

Oh Lord I ask you what kind of beast is man?
(Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks) 
Oh, out come the freaks, out come the freaks, y'all
(Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks) 
Out come the freaks, yeah
(Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks) 
Out come the freaks, y'all
(Woodwork squeaks and out comes Trotsky)
Out comes Trotsky, yeah
(Woodwork squeaks and out comes Coltrane)
Coltrane, Coltrane, out comes Coltrane
(Woodwork squeaks and out comes Che Guevara)
Che Guevara, Che Guevara, oh
(Woodwork squeaks and out comes the Powell)
Buddy Powell, Buddy Powell, baby, yeah
Out come the freaks
