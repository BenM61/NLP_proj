Hello baby how ya been nice to see your face again
Strange to see you comin' 'round when you're the one who put me down
We were such a happy pair but then another man was there
So forgive me I don't understand just what you want from me
As you can see my life's been good I moved the family out the neighborhood
And all my dreams I've realized to think you said it was a waste of time

It's never hard to make new friends when you're making Benjamins
Now did I hear you say again, 
You're still thinking of me?

Do you feel like dying, do you break down crying
Do you fall down on your knees
Don't want to go on living, does your world spinning
When you think of me

All I had was love to bring, 
But you was on some ol' material thing
Looks like you're still trying to drive them mad, 
But it's not easy when you're credits bad
I didn't know that I could feel so blue, 
It took some time but girl I'm over you
Would've gladly gave my life for you, 
You should have thought the whole thing through
All those nights with your girlfriends, 
Was just a front for you and him

Y'all was supposed to leave for Honolulu, 
Leaving yo' ass was 'bout the best he could do
Dry your tears now baby it's O.K., 
I'll introduce you to my fiancee
Now tell me baby say again, you been thinking of me?

Do you feel like dying, do you break down crying
Do you fall down on your knees
Don't want to go on living, does your world spinning
When you think of me

Do you think of me in waves that pull you under
From my memory is there nowhere you can hide
Do you close your eyes, see my face and wonder
How could a love so strong be nothing but a lies

Do you feel like dying, do you break down crying
Do you fall down on your knees
Don't want to go on living, does your world spinning
When you think of me
