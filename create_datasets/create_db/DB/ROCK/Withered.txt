I can't even remember 
The first time you led me down this path
F*ck
I never once in my life thought I could ever feel much lower than this

This book is open
I try to pour my thoughts out on these pages 
But my will is broken
The fear is setting in
I could give you everything you need
But I think the motivation's leaving me

Every day is the same dark feeling
Time's fleeting, anger's leaving me
It's getting harder to relate and release
This road is pulling away from what I want but that's okay
Some things are easier missed
I'd rather fail than sit and wish
So why would I quit?
So why would I quit? yeah

Maybe indecisiveness is the winner
Shadow's getting bigger
My soul starts to crumble and wither
And I think I'm losing all control

Where's that old fire that I'd pride myself 
For always holding inside?
Guess I could stop pretending to be something I'm not
Is it something I want, or is it something I've got?
It's time to stop second guessing every single thought
I think I've lost

Scraping the bottom of the fucking barrel from the start
How could I be so pathetic?

Every day is the same dark feeling
Time's fleeting, anger's leaving me
It's getting harder to relate and release
This road is pulling away from what I want but that's okay
Some things are easier missed
I'd rather fail than sit and wish

Every line's the same
They're all the fucking same
I think the motivation's leaving me
It's like the answer's right in front of me 
But old me won't let go of me
The answer's there in front of me 
But old me'd never let me see
