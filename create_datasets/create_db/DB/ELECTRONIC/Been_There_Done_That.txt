Do you know what it's like waiting for ya?
Then you apologize, but you never change at all
You know what you're doing to me, doing to me, doing to me
Do you know what it's like waiting for ya? Mm

Why don't I save myself some time?
Why?

Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Why do I keep missing you for messing up something
'Stead of letting go?
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Keep on wanting something that'll change
Been there, done that

Been there, done that

You don't know what it's like loving someone
Got my heart at the back of your mind
No, I never felt so small
Now you know what you're doing to me, doing to me, doing to me
You don't know what it's like loving someone, mm

Why don't I save myself some time?

When I know I've been there, done that
Why do I keep missing you for messing up something
'Stead of letting go?
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Keep on wanting something that'll change

Yes, you don't know me, go
If you don't know me, no

Why do I keep missing you for messing up something
