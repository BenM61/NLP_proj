I have lost my baby, almost lost my mind
I have lost my baby, almost lost my mind
Way she treat me, gonna drive a man stone blind

Well, the road seems dark and dreary, while I traveled down that way
Well, the road seems dark and dreary, while I traveled down that way
Well, my baby left me, she just come back home today

Oh, I love my baby, tell the world I do
Oh, I love my baby, tell the world I do
Well, I need a little lovin', darlin', gonna make my dream come true

Oh, I love you darlin', like a schoolboy loves his pie
Oh, I love you darlin', like a schoolboy loves his pie
Now ain't that the way to treat me, darlin', my hurt's so long that I will die
