They follow the forgotten like they promised me so often
Moving fingers, charging hymns to other gods
Complicated missions, covered convalescing structures
Mountains hidden inside more unspoken words

Chimes unearthly bells, before the reason we could never tell
A secret simply liberates the finish
Claustrophobic empty and competing to surround you
Asking, ?Do you want to hear about the damage??

Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?

Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?

Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?
Do you want to hear about the damage?
