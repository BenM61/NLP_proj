Nothing it so good it lasts eternally.
Perfect situations must go wrong.
But this has never yet prevented me,
Wanting far too much for far too long.

Looking back, I could have played it differently,
Learned about the man before I fell,
But it took time to understand the man,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good
(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine.
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
(More security)
He needs his fantasies and freedom
I know him so well.

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side,
And though I move my world to be with him,
Still the gap between him is too much.

Looking back I could have played it differently,
One or a few more who can tell,
But I was ever so much younger then,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good
(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine.

Didn't I know,
How it would go from the start If I knew,
Why am I falling apart.

Wasn't it good
Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness,
He can't be mine.
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me.
(More security)
He needs his fantasies and freedom.
I know him so well.

It took time to understand him.
I know him so well
