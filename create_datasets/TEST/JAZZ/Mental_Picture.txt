I've been avoiding things I'm missing
Then you came into my life a brand new flower, baby
A reminder of what happiness is like
On the other side

(What can't I feel?)
I'm saying my blind side
And if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on
For a while or more
Girl you know I'll always think of you, think of you

Yes if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on
I know you're a picture to remember

Time was of the essence
And as usual the day turns into minutes
Sharing love and tenderness
That's the nerve you struck in me that sent a signal
To the other side (girl I don't know)
I'm saying my blind side

And if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on
For a while or more
Girl you know I'll always think of you, think of you

And if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on, I know
You're a picture to remember, remember

Take me to the other side (why can't I feel?)
Out of my blind side

And I, if a mental picture's all I've got, all I've got, all I've got to go on
For a while or more
Girl you know I'll always think of you, think of you

Yes if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on, I know
You're a picture to remember, remember

(And if a mental picture's all I've got, to go on)
