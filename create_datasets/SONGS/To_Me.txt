To me
You are the hand that I reach for
When I've lost my way
To me
You are the first star of the evening
The sun that warms my day

Just as sure as I'm sure there's a heaven
This was meant to be
No road is too long
As long as you belong
To me

To me
You are the truth I believe in
The love I believe in you
To me
You are the heart I have looked for
My whole life trough

Just as sure as I'm sure there's a heaven
This was meant to be
No road is too long
As long as you belong
To me

Just as sure as I'm sure there's a heaven
This was meant to be
No road is too long
As long as you belong
To me

Always belong
Always belong to me
Belong
To me
Belong
To me
