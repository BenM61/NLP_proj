Oh oh 
Mmh

In this game of love everybody plays
There are no guarantees
The king and queen of hearts
They can be torn apart
It's a crazy game and I'm here to say
There really ain't no rules
But there's something you just
Got to do

You got to keep the fire going
Keep the lovelight glowing
Make it work 'cause love is worth it all
You gotta keep the fire burning
Keep the passion yearning
Make it work 'cause love is worth it all
Ooh, it's worth it all

Oh did I explain it's a couple game
It's two against the world
Together me and you
We'll get each other through
And if we are wise we won't compromise
We've gotta winning hand
There's just some things we both
Got to do

We got to keep the fire going
Keep the lovelight glowing
Make it work 'cause love is worth it all
You gotta keep the fire burning
Keep the passion yearning
Make it work 'cause love is worth it all
I'm just saying (saying)

It's so easy to run
And let love come undone
But somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to face it
Once again so why not get it right
'Cause the love game is for life
Do the few little things
That will keep your love alive
Listen to me

You got to keep the fire going
Keep the lovelight glowing (Keep glowing)
Make it work 'cause love is worth it all
You gotta keep the fire burning
Keep the passion yearning (keep the passion yearning)
Make it work 'cause love is worth it all
Love is worth it all
Oh oh 
Mhm
