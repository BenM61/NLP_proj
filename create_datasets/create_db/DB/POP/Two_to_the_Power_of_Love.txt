(Janet) I know we just met, but I feel like I've known you before
(Cliff) But something about you my heart has been searching
(Janet) I don't understand it, it's over my head
(Cliff) So don't try to solve it, just feel it instead. Ooh

It isn't really such a mystery
Anyway you add it up it turns out to be
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematics
Two to the power of love

(Janet) I look in your eyes and everything falls into place
(Cliff) You don't have to say it, it's written all over your face
(Janet) By my calculation, I'm falling for you
(Cliff) It's a perfect equation
(Janet and Cliff) And I know that it's true

It isn't really such a mystery
Anyway you add it up it turns out to be
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematics
Two to the power of love

(Janet and Cliff)
It's complicated, but it's easy to see
A combination that was meant to be
It's something you can count on

It isn't really such a mystery
Anyway you add it up it turns out to be
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematics
Two to the power of love

It isn't really just a shot in the dark
Somebody must've worked it out on the chart
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematics
Two to the power of love
