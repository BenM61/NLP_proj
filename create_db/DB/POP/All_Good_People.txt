Oh yeah hmmmm...

Hey was that something that you wanted to say?
I don't know what to do when you look that way.
Cigarettes and tequila at six
And the sun going down on our life as it is
In the blue light, oh your face, it looks so pale
In the blue light, oh oh, I can tell what you're gonna to say.

But all good people have a sense of themselves
They never worry they know what tomorrow will bring
And all good people know the world is ok
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

Do do do do do do... 

I heard that story, how you never went back
What your mouth will not say, your eyes do for you
A paper flower and a pill in your drawer
And her ghost at the bar drinks tequila too
In the blue light, could we put this one to bed?
In the blue light, oh oh, will you think of me instead?

Cos all good people have a sense of themselves
They never worry they know what tomorrow will bring
And all good people know the world is ok
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

Do do do do do do... ah hey

Mmmmmmm hmmmmmm

In the blue light, oh your face, it looks so pale
In the blue light, oh oh, I can tell what you're gonna to say.

Cos all good people have a sense of themselves
They never worry they know what tomorrow will bring
And all good people know the world is ok
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

All good people have a sense of themselves
They never worry they know what tomorrow will bring
And all good people know the world is ok
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

Do do do do do do...

All good people, all good people know, good people (repeat until fade).
