They say love is blind
But you are always on my mind
I'll never, never feel this way again
It's hard for me to say
To tell you why I feel this way
I'll never, never feel this way again

I wouldn't try to fool you
It's you I give my love to

From the bottom of my lonely heart
Every moment that we spend apart
Baby, I promise you my love
From the bottom of my lonely heart

Just for you no matter where you are
Baby, I promise you my love

Love hurts so they say
This time love is here to stay
I'll never, never feel this way again
It's all clear to me
That loving you is all I need
I'll never, never feel this way again

From the bottom of my lonely heart
Every moment that we spend apart
Baby, I promise you my love
From the bottom of my lonely heart
