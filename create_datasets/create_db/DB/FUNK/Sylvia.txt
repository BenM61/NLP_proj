Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
Mmm, hmm

Sylvia
You Know you're getting to me now
Mmm, mmm, mmm, Sylvia
You gently touched my heart somehow

Yesterday you made me happy as a child at play
Just like the summer sun that warms my heart
And move on, now you are gone

Whoa, oh, oh, Sylvia
You're everything that I adore
That sweet song, that caught a spark I'm me more, yeah
Tenderly that's how you whisper that you loved me
As if a raindrop kissed my ear and disappeared, now you are gone

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
You know I love my little Sylvia

Sylvia, uh, uh, uh, uh, ah

And yeah, whoa, uh, yeah

And yesterday I feel in love with you all the way
Tenderly you lit a spark in my heart, now you are gone

Mmm, hmm, Sylvia
I gently miss Sylvia
I'm crazy 'bout ya, Sylvia
You know I love my little Sylvia
