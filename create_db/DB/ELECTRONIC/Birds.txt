We haven't burned these bridges 
For the last time 
So I'll get the gas,
You bring the matches

We can dowse these threads on our backs.
No longer birds of prey 
We are just fuel for this fire.
This is gone...it feels so wrong 

Yet sometimes it feels so right.
This is gone on for to long baby.
I broke your heart 
When the winds go colder,

Broke my neck 
Explaining things I can't explain.
Back and forth,
Its always back and forth 
When it comes to you and I.
