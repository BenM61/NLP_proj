Everything, anything I see
Anything, everything I feel
Everyday, anytime I know
Anything everyone has to go

Champagne lingers in my glass
Party's over
I see my reflection sipping
And it reminds me

I'd like to see you
Having more fun
If you can
I look at you
But it's me I see

It's everything I know
(It's me I see)
It's everything I feel
(It's me I see)
It's everything and everyone around me that I see
Everything is real
Everything I feel

In my mirror
I see myself
In that mirror
Inside myself

Sometimes I feel it coming to me
Thinking of you when I'm looking at my body
I can touch myself with my own understanding
My resolution to be broken that I see now

(But it's me I see)
And it's everything I know
(It's me I see)
And it's everything I feel
(It's me I see)
And it's everything and everyone around me that I know
Everything is real
Everything I feel

No real solutions
In clippings from the past
I see my reflection at last

Books full of pictures
Remembering the blasts
Times consequences
Makes me go fast

(And it's me I see)
And it's everywhere I go
(It's me I see)
It's everything I see
(It's me I see)
And it's everywhere I go, yeah
(It's me I see)
And it's everything I feel

(It's me I see)
And it's everywhere I go
(It's me I see)
And it's everything I see
(It's me I see)
And it's everything and everyone around me that I love
Everything is real
Everything I feel
