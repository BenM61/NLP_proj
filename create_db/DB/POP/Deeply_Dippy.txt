Deeply dippy 'bout the curves you got
Deeply hot, hot for the curves you got
Deeply dippy 'bout the fun we had
Deeply mad, mad for the fun we had

Oh my love, I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh my love, let's set sail for seas of passion now

Deeply dippy bout the way you walk
A contact sport, let the neighbours talk
Deeply dippy I'm your Superman
I'll explain, you're my Lois Lane

Oh my love, I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh my love, let's set sail for seas of passion now

Deeply dippy bout your Spanish eyes,
Sierra smile, legs that go on for miles and miles
(Oh, see those legs man!)
Miles and miles

(I said)oh my love, I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh my love, so let's set sail for seas of passion
Oh my love, I can't make head nor tail of passion
Oh my love, so let's set sail for seas of passion now
