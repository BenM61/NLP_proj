SATURDAY night! (4x)

Gonna keep on dancing to the 
rock and roll 
On Saturday night, Saturday night 
Dancing to the rhythm in our 
heart and soul 
On Saturday Night, Saturday night 
IIIII just can't wait, 
IIII got a date 

*At the good old rock and roll road 
show, I gotta go 

Saturday Night, 
Saturday Night 
Gonna rock it up, roll it up 
Do it all, have a ball, 
Saturday Night, 
Saturday Night 
It's just a Saturday Night 
It's just a Saturday Night 
It's just a Saturday Night 

Gonna dance with my baby till the 
night is through 
On Saturday Night, Saturday Night 
Tell her all the little things I'm 
gonna do 
On Saturday night, Saturday Night 
IIIII love her so 
III I'm gonna let her know 

*repeat

SATURDAY NIGHT, SATURDAY NIGHT, 
SATURDAY NIGHT, SATURDAY NIGHT, 

It's just a Saturday night 
It's just a Saturday Night, 
It's just a Saturday Night, 
It's just a Saturday Night,
