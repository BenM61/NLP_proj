And when my troubles start to get me down
She's always there you know she always can be found
And never lets it weight too much on me
She always seems to be in touch with me you see

She knows 
And I am drawn to her it is as thought
I were a moth and she the candles glow

And when the world has got the best of me
She seems to have the power to change my destiny
I try to tell her what is on my mind
And even though the words are hard to find at times
She knows
And when she comes to me it is as though
I were earth and she new fallen snow
And I will sing of all the things she knows
She gives me wings with all the things she knows
