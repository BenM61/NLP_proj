You Bring the Sun Out
You bring the sun out
To warm my life up
To make my love grow everyday

You bring the stars out
To light the night up
To make the darkness go away

You bring the sun out 
To warm my life up
To make my love grow everyday

You bring the stars out 
To light the night up
To make the darkness go away

I reach to you
You reach to me
Not matter where I go I know you'll always be
Never to far
Far from my heart
I'll always have you here
I always know you're near 

You bring the sun out
To warm my life up
To make my love grow everyday

You bring the stars out
To light the night up
To make the darkness go away

To make the darkness go away
Ooh...
