Any moment, everything can change.
Feel the wind on your shoulders.
For a minute, all the world can wait.
Let go of your yesterday.

Can you hear it calling?
Can you feel it in your soul?
Can you trust this longing
And take control?

Fly
Open up the part of you that wants to hide away.
You can shine.
Forget about the reasons why you can in life.
And start to try
'Cause it's your time
Time to fly.

All your worries, leave them somewhere else.
Find a dream you can follow.
Reach for something when there's nothing left.
And the world's feeling hollow.

Can you hear it calling?
Can you feel it in your soul?
Can you trust this longing
And take control?

Fly
Open up the part of you that wants to hide away.
You can shine.
Forget about the reasons why you can in life.
And start to try
'Cause it's your time
Time to fly.

And when your down and feel alone
Just want to run away
Trust yourself
And don't give up.
You know you better than anyone else.

Any moment, everything can change.
Feel the wind on your shoulders.
For a minute, all the world can wait
Let go of yesterday

Fly
Open up the part of you that wants to hide away.
You can shine.
Forget about the reasons why you can in life.
And start to try
'Cause it's your time
Time to fly.

Any moment, everything can change.
