I've been ready, with lovin'on my mind
Don't say you're not that kind
My love, we've been through this before
It seems you're back for more
Of my love, it's forever
Ooh baby forever, forever for now

I said baby, I'll give you all I can
And I hope you understand, my love
And you, you mean so much to me
But darling can't you see
That my love is forever
Ooh baby forever, forever for now
Ooh baby for now, I said my love is forever
Ooh baby forever, forever for now, my love

Come on baby you know I'd love to turn you on
Tomorrow I may be gone
But my love, that's forever
Ooh baby forever, forever for now
Ooh baby for now, I said my love is forever
Ooh baby forever, forever for now
Ooh baby forever, and ever, and ever, now
My love is forever
My love is forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
Oh, oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is forever
My love is forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
