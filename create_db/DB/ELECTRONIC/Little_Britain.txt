In this green and pleasant land
We have a dream to understand
In the mountains of the mind
There is a spirit you will find
Just like the angel from above
Sent to deliver words of love
Ancient cross and Zion star
Eastern ways and praise to Jah

This is our land
This is your land
This is our inheritance
To lead you on a merry dance

In the beginning there was light
Shining path and journeys bright
When the nations pray as one
Then will the races all be won
In this green and pleasant land
We have a dream to understand
Open paradises gate
Dance on the land and celebrate

Say no matter what your color
Your race or your culture
This is our inheritance
To lead you on a merry dance
