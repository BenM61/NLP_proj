If you ever lost your philoshophy
One is rising up from the sand
You just keep on drifting away from land
If you ever lost your horizon
And you can even find the sun
Just keep on staring 'til the damage is done
Out of tide, out of fight
Tracing circles you don't feel right

Out of tide, out of fight
At least we know at least we tried
At least we tried
We're swimming against the tide

If you ever lost on a type roll
Running on your depth of your toes
You keep on getting higher
And never close
If you're ever lost in the darkness
And you don't know where to begin
Need to change if you wanna live again

Out of tide, out of fight
Tracing circles you don't feel right
Out of tide, out of fight
At least we know at least we tried
At least we tried
We're swimming against the tide

Only time is really lost when you're standing still
Any you cross the ocean

Out of tide, out of fight
Tracing circles you don't feel right
Out of tide, out of fight
At least we know at least we tried
Night and day ,day and night
At least we know at least we tried
At least we tried
We're swimming against the tide
We're swimming against the tide
