Hey man, leave my wife alone! 

I done told you once
Ain't goin' to tell you no more
Next time I see you
Goin' to mow you down
Better leave her alone.
I said leave her alone
I said man don't you know
Leave my wife alone.

I said look at here, babe
What you done done
Got my lovin'
Got me on a bomb
Babe, leave him alone
Babe, leave him alone

I done told you once
Ain't goin' to tell you no more.

Have mercy.

Said look at here, babe
What you done done
Got my lovin'
Got me on a bomb
I done told you, babe
Done told you, babe
I done told you, baby
Leave that man alone.

I said, leave him alone
I said, baby, now baby, 
Leave that man alone.
