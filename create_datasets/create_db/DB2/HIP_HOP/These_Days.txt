Ah-ooohhhh
Mis-teeq

Sometimes ya get happy
Sometimes ya get blue
No matter the reason
A life's about what you do

A little by little
You make it somehow
No use for your worry
The time is now

These days
I'm walking on air
Just jump if you dare and we'll fly (we'll fly so high)
These days
I feel so alive
Wherever we fall we'll survive

Some people look forward
Some people look back
It's now that we're living
And that's a simple fact
Don't ever forget it
Don't be confused
Don't live to regret it
Or you will lose

These days
I'm walking on air
Just jump if you dare and we'll fly (I'll fly so high)
These days
I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
Wherever we fall we'll survive
These days
I'm walking on air (walking on air)
Just jump if you dare and we'll fly (I'll fly so high)
These days
I feel so alive 
Wherever we fall we'll survive

Whatever we try
Whatever we do
We live and we die
It's all up to you
A new life will grow
And follow it through
And rivers will flow
And dreams will come true

These days
I'm walking on air
Just jump if you dare and we'll fly (we'll fly so high)
These days
I feel so alive
Wherever we fall we'll survive (ooh we'll survive)
These days
I'm walking on air
Just jump if you dare and we'll fly (we'll fly so high)
These days
I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
Wherever we fall we'll survive

Whatever we try
Whatever we do
Just jump if you dare and we'll fly
Whatever we try
Whatever we do
Wherever we fall we'll survive

These days
