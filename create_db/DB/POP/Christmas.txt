Did you ever see the faces of the children
They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited

They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heavens generosity
Peeping 'round the door
To see what parcels are for free in curiosity

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved from the eternal grave?

Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently
And unaware of everything
Playing poxy pinball
Picks his nose and smiles and pokes his tongue at everything

I believe in love but how can men
Who've never seen light be enlightened?
Only if he's cured
Will his spirits future level ever heighten

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved from the eternal grave?

Tommy can you hear me? Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me? Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Can you, can you, can you hear me?
How can he be saved?
