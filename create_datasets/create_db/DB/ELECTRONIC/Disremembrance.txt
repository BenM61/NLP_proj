I feel so calm tonight
Like I'm floating into space
I feel my anger now
Vanishing without a trace

I feel so weak tonight
I'm no longer in control
I feel so different now
That it's time to face my soul

You gave me the time
To change the memories
But if I forget myself
Will you remember me?

(Remember me, Remember me)
Will you remember me?
Oh love, Oh love
Will you remember me?

(Remember me, Remember me)
Will you remember me?
Oh love, Oh love
Will you remember me?

I feel so bright tonight
Like I'm glowing in the dark
I feel so distant now
Burning like the smallest spark

I feel so faint tonight
Like I'm hardly even there
I feel much older now
But I'm still too young to care

You gave me the hope
That this was meant to be
But if I forget myself
Will you remember me?

(Remember me, Remember me)
Will you remember me?
Oh love, Oh love
Will you remember me?

(Remember me, Remember me)
Will you remember me?
Oh love, Oh love
Will you remember me?

Oh love
I feel so different now
I feel so different now
I feel no fear tonight

I feel no pain
I don't know what I feel
Or hope to gain
(Remember me, Remember me)

Will you remember me?
Oh love, Oh love
Will you remember me?
(Remember me, Remember me)

Will you remember me?
Oh love, Oh love
Will you remember me?
Remember me, Remember me
