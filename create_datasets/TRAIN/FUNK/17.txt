A little girl came up to me, acting young and shy
A look of curiosity was flashing in her eyes
She had seen my face before and thought she knew me well
So I said "Shall we talk some more, you'll come to my hotel"

She was only seventeen, seventeen
But she was sexy
She was only seventeen, seventeen
She said she loved me
Seventeen years old
Seventeen years old

How we talked all through the night and never even touched
Even talked of love and life, I wanted her that much
She said she'd read a magazine that said I was a freak
"You'll never know now, little girl, unless you take a peak"

She was only seventeen, seventeen
And she was sexy
She was only seventeen, seventeen
But she was you and fine and oh so tender
Would I break down tonight and surrender
This young girl, this sweet thing, I just can't wait
No, I mustn't do this, she's almost jailbait!
