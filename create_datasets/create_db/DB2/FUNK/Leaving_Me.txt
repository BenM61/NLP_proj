Oh, darling 
After all this time 
You seem to me, girl 
To be changing your mind 

We don't talk no more 
Like we used to do 
What in the world 
Has come over you 

(Leaving me) oh, baby 
(Can't be) tell me 
(What you're telling me) 
I wanna know (baby) 

I heard somebody say 
(Leaving me can't be) 
You want your clothes back 
(What you're telling me) 
I want you to know (baby) 

Lately, I felt that you 
Avoided my conversations 
You would turn on the TV 
Didn't need the aggravation 

I just don't know 
I just don't know 
What I've done to you 
But whatever it is, child 
I hope one thing can be true 
And that is 

(Leaving me can't be) ah 
(What you're telling me) 
(Can't be) 

Sometimes I moan 
(Leaving me can't be) 
You don't know 
(What you're telling me) 
Don't know what 
You're doing to me, baby 
(Can't be) oh, lord 

Girl, if you only knew what 
Was going through my mind 
You'd stop fooling around 
And give me all your time 

The best years I've had 
I spent em all with you 
If you left me one day 
I'd be through 

(Leaving me) I'm sick, baby 
(Can't be) somebody, somebody 
(What you're telling me) 
Somebody know what I'm 
Talking about out there (baby) 

(Leaving me can't be) 
I know it's gonna be like 
(What you're telling me) 
(Baby) I'm gonna be here 
I'm gonna be here 
With the neighbors 

And you know how 
The neighbors talk 
Old Tom over there 
He want you to 
Leave me the house 
And old Mary down there 
She don't know what 
She's talking about 

She think I'm cutting 
Up on you, baby
