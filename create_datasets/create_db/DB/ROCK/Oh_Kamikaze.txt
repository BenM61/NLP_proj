You, You,
You were a fast one always in control, Kamikaze,
Spreading your wings full of holes as you drag the sky
And no-one can tell you if this is to spin or free falling
'Cause no-one is so sure that this was meant to fly.

Uptight.
You flicker and flame like the 
Bright light.
They're calling your name from the
Outside.
You don't believe in the real world.

Tryin to process all of your need and desperation
So you can straighten out every devil lie.
The ripple is falling comin' down slow like silent movie
And they will abandon time

So far
You wanted too much and it's 
Closer
So close you could touch it for 
One time.
You disappear, you disappear

Uptight.
You flicker and flame like the 
Bright light.
They're calling your name it's a 
Sure sign
You don't belong in the real world, the real world.

You never see it comin' 'till it carries you off the ground.
I see it in your face when you come back, come back
Down, down, down
Down, down, come back down

Uptight.
You flicker and flame like the 
Bright light.
They're callin' your name in your 
Sweet time
You slip away from the real world.

Uptight
You flicker, you flicker, 
Bright light
They're callin, they're callin your name
Sweet time
You slip away from the, the real world.
