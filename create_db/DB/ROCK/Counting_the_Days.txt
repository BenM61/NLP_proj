Hey baby are you listening,
I'll battened all the hatches down.
I've taken all your prescriptions,
With no remedy I've found

Counting the days.
Until some freedom can scream my name.
Counting the days.
Until the Gods break these chains.

Hey baby are you watching,
I'm saddled in for your side show.
I never want to become prescious
This life is so touch-and-go

Counting the days.
Until some freedom can scream my name.
Counting the days.
Until the Gods break these chains.

Dig it, get it, dig it whatcha lookin' for.
Dig it, get it, dig it whatcha searchin' for.
Dig it, get it, dig it, yeah dig!
Yeah dig

Counting the days.
Until some freedom can scream my name.
Counting the days.
Until the Gods break these chains.
Until the Gods break these chains.

Break these chains 
Break these chains 
Break these chains
