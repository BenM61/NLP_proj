Smooth road, clear day
But why am I the only one
Travelin' this way
How strange the road you love
Should be so easy
Can there be a detour ahead

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart
Gullible clown

You fool, you're headin'
In the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead

The further you travel
The harder to unravel
The way he spins around you
Turn back while there is time
Can't you see the danger sign
Soft shoulders surround you

Smooth road, clear night
Oh lucky me, that suddenly
I saw the light
I'm turning back away
From all this trouble

Smooth road, smooth road
No detour ahead
