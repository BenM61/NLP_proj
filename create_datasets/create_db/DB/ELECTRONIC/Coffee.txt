True, it's dance, we know the moves
The bar, the dip, the woo
Though the words are true
The state is old news

Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but
Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation
And stop, see the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

I know my words will dry upon the skin
Just like a name I remember hearing
Wild winter, warm coffee
Mom's gone, do you love me?
Blazing summer, cold coffee
Baby's gone, do you love me?

Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but
Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation
And stop, see the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation
And stop, see the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does

My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
(Rock me)
My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation
And stop, see the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change
