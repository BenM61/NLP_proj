Alone
It's like being in a crowded room with no familiar faces
Alone
It's like thinking that I see your face in unfamiliar places
Alone 
It's waking up to an empty bed you used to lay your head on
Alone
And I don't want to be alone anymore

See, I was wrong
Not afraid to admit
I was such a jerk
Can't believe the things I did
I made you hurt
You don't deserve that
Never know just what got until it's gone

Now I'm shook-up (I can hardly sleep)
Now I'm choked up (I can hardly eat)
Now we broke up and it's killing me
I'm falling, I'm falling, baby
Don't want to be, don't want to be
Alone

Never brought a rose
Never said I love you
Oh baby
Never realized
I couldn't live without you
Always heard you talk
Never really listened
And I never said how beautiful you are

If I had another chance 
Promise I'd be twice the man
I was
Yesterday 
If I had another try
I never tell another lie
I swear
Give you all the love you deserve
