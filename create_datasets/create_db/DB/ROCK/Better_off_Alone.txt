I never gave a reason
Of why I didn't call
Now I've grown so tired
Of lying to myself
It cannot go unsaid
I regret what they know
Don't think it's all been a waste of time

Are you better off alone? Stop lying to yourself
I regret what was said I deny what they know
Are you better off alone?

Those that we admired
All stood their ground and cried
I didn't start the fire
I just tried to see your eyes
It cannot go unsaid
I only want you to know
I think it's all going to
Work out fine

Are we Better Off Alone (you better off alone?)
Than lying to ourselves
Who cares what they've said?
Who cares what they know?
Are we better off alone

I know that my love I'll send
Could we still be friends?
But this is the end

I think it's all going to work out fine
We're better off alone (You better off alone)
Than lying to ourselves
I regret what you say
I don't care what I know
Don't say it's all been a waste of time
Are you better off alone (send my love)
Stop lying to yourself (send my love)
It cannot go unsaid (send my love)
I only want you to know (to yooou)
It cannot go unsaid,
I only want you to know,
I think it's all going to work out fine.
