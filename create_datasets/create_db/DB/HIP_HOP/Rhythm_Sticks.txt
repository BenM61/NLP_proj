[Chorus] 
Rhythm Sticks 
Rhythm Sticks 
Get 'em 
Go 
(Repeat 8 times) 

Go from out the gate 
The Great 
Create the styles that dwell within 
The flow no doubt will wake you take you 
Acres aways well within 
The sacred space 
The place 
Where we awaken 
From this hell within 
If you ain't heard about my crew 
I guess I have to spell it then 
B 
B is for the beat you knock 
While puffin on you L 
L is for the lyrics on the beat that have to get to 
A 
A is for the absolute that dwells 
Everywhere you can't C 
C C C C 
C is for creating that is if you're in the K 
K is for the knownin' which will bring us back to A 
A as in another A and then another L 
I hope you follow me me me me 
I as in myself 
Myself and me 
C cultivate and capture 
Put a cease 
To I 
Ignorance cause ignorance must die 
Die die die 
Fly away make us free 
Free free free 
O 
O is for the oneness that is U 
U U U U 
U is universal like the sound your listenin' to 
S 
Essence of the spirit in the music that opens up 
The Chi Chi Chi 

[Chorus]

Up and 
Down the trails 
Of many styles we can go 
What's in 
Store for the future 
Doubt that we can know 
But in 
Ourself we can create 
And we can grow 
To be a vessel 
For these days days days days 
Touchin'the moon and stars 
With such a cosmic glow 
Rushin' 
MCs that end up in the hospital 
It's nothin' 
Sometimes it's simply how it's got to go 
That's if you suckas want to play play play play 
It's such an 
Inebriating feeling 
To be creatin' really 
It really makes me feel free 
You think this ain't the real thing 
Then you just can't be listenin' 
To what my ears are hearin' 
There ain't no way way way 
Pitchin' 
So twisted if you're hittin' 
Nigga it isn't pretty 
Wittier inner dealings 
Committed venom deadly 
All in your inner city 
I'll spit it when I'm ready 
Don't make me spray spray spray 

[Chorus] 

Now this is not 
Your average 
Everyday tune 
It is in tune 
With frequencies 
Speakin' through me 
And keep reachin' 
Way out to you 
Seekin' to find 
The triple I 
Mastery through 
The rhythm sticks 
Given to listeners 
Rendered prisoners 
To the mu-mu-mu-mu-music 
Inner centered 
Vessel astral planning travelers 
Sent to this dimension here 
To inform the whole planet earth 
Time is runnin' out 
At any moment death it can occur 
Celebrate the moment fully 
This is what you have it for 
Avid rap fanatic 
Magic 
Add it and subtract it 
Rabid 
Mathematic patterns 
The sporadic 
Manic anthem 
Static 
Cannot have a chance 
Enchanted random 
Valiant chantin' 
And some 
Gallant cabbage grabbin' 
Stackin' 
Hammer slammin' 
Captain 
Stabbin talent lackin; 
Yappin' 
Slackin' 
Rappers 
Smack 'em 
Backwards 
Ballads 
Tackles 
Actors 
Savage 
At this 
Bammer crap is damned and banished 
Lavish 
Fans will go bananas 
And command 
Some Gab 
A master at this 
Transcendental gathering 
Of rhythm sticks
