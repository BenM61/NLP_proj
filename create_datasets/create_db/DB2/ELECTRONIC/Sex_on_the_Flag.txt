Discrete arhead, sleeping below
The wind that passes is heard no more
Trust only movement, talking split tongue
Don't be concerned with what's right and what's wrong.

Lord is gracious to the chosen generation
Royal Priesthood of a holy nation
Zealous forces here and youth and bloom
But reason's finger is pointing at the tomb

Sex on the flag, Give me respect or give me death
Sex on the flag, Responsibility
Sex on the flag, You gotta have some fantasy
Sex on the flag, Crack down and cry for me.

Captive caption, indestructible cage
Silenced with fire, trembling with rage.
Sacrifice beauty, finish your hand
I don't wanna be stuck without a spirit for the future.

God is gracious to the chosen generation
Royal Priesthood of a holy nation
Zealous forces here and youth and bloom
But reason's finger is pointing at the tomb

Sex on the flag, Give me respect or give me death
Sex on the flag, Responsibility
Sex on the flag, You gotta have some fantasy
Sex on the flag, Give me respect or give me death.

Sex on the flag, Give me respect or give me death
Sex on the flag, Responsibility
Sex on the flag, You gotta have some fantasy
Sex on the flag, Crack down and cry for me (this section twice)

Sex on the flag, crack down and cry for me
Sex on the flag, crack down and cry for me

crack down and cry for me (six times)

Give me respect or give me death
