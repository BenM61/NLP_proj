With the sugar sickness 
You spy the kidnap kid 
Who kids you to oblivion 
It's the perfect hassle 
For the perfumed kiss 
He makes you miss him more than home 

You love him 
You love him more than this 
You love him and you cannot, you can't resist 
You love him 
You love him for yourself 
You love him and no one, no one else 

Past sidewalk ashes 
A last lovers arc 
You come apart to intertwine 
It was all so simple 
As you watched him move 
Across the darkness in your room 

You love him 
You love him for yourself 
You love him and no one, no one else 

And the winding vines 
The pretty boys dive 
And through the pinhole stars 
Into the shadow mind 
You will lose him then 
On some gentle dawn 
This boy is here and gone 

You love him 
You love him for yourself 
You love him and no one, no one else 
You love him 
You love him more than this 
You love him and you cannot, you can't resist 

You love him...
