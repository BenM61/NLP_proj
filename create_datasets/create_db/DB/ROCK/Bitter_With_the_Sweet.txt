Sometimes I'm tired and I wonder what's so all-fired important
About being someplace at some time
Oh, but I don't really mind
'Cause I could be on East Street, and I know that
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet

I guess it gets to everyone, you think you're not having any fun
And you wonder what you're doing playing the games you play
Hey, well, it's true what they say
If you want to feel complete, don't you know that
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet

A friend of mine once told me
And I know he knows all about feelin' down
He said everything good in life you've got to pay for
But feelin' good is what you're paving the way for

So don't let it get you down, my friend, though it seems the blues will never end
On this you can depend, they always do
And I can tell you that it's true, it's a feeling that can't be beat
And you've got to do it
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
