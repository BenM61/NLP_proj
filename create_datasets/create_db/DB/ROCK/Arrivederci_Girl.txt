You know that you're steppin' on me
Draggin' my bone to bed
You know that you're real politely
Kickin' me right in my head
But I want to move
So leave me alone
Distress me
And give somebody else your own kind of lovin'
Your kind of movin'
You're kinda thinkin' about the wrong things too
Good-bye my baby
Arrivederci girl to you
