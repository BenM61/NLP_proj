Yesterday was an accident
On the street where they held hands
They were looking for their hearts
They were there from the start from me to we
Just a little too young then to understand
What's easy to advance isn't always made to last
Oh Here we are
Caught shoveling past ambivalence somewhere
Considering her half
And trying not to laugh
When they can see
The red was blood of humanity tempers the quiet
And all the time they spent
And Let 'em chew another end again and again

At night in dreams of a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems that if we could build a love to free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age

Boy treat her to a white and church house made of glass
Play an imaginary part and they knew it from the start
Now here we are, barely holding on to a promise of forever
Made lying in the grass or it isn't such a task
Or maybe we just a little too cool and not to understand
When reason finds its end, where an open heart begins
To love again

At night in dreams of a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems that if we could build a love to free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age

At night in dreams of a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems that if we could build a love to free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age

We don't move on, when we don't have to
We can go, we understand
More life, more vision
People seeing what they can

At night in dreams of a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems that if we could build a love to free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age
