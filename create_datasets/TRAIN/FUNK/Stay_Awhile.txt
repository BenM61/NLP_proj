As they were being said I wished those words were
Dead they grow and grow and grow in our heads
They linger, linger and haunt us days on end

It was all in a moment of anger these daggers that I threw
They're still deeply embedded into you
I swear I fear there's nothing I can do

Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Over one night when the love went wrong 

I can see it in your eyes in the way you look at me
Mistrust has now replaced intimacy
I feel you drifting drifting far away from me

Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Over one night when the love went wrong

I swear, I will fight this
I vow not to lose
I'll be damned if this destroys us
I'll be damned if I lose you

Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Stay a while young is the night
Give me a chance to set things right
Don't you throw away those years of love
Over one night when the love went wrong
Over one night when the love went wrong
