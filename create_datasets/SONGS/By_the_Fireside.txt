In the gloaming by the fireside
With you, I'll be content
In the gloaming by the fireside
Every hour will be well spent

We'll see our hopes and dreams, dear
Like pictures in the fire
Finding in its gleams, dear
Our heart's desire

In an armchair by the fireside
Just big enough for two
We'll be happy, oh so happy
While we do as lovers do

With no-one there to notice
A little kiss or two
In the gloaming by the fireside
With you
