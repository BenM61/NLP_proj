Deep slumber awakened by sirens
I realize life's been thrown to the lions
What I saw last night, our city so fair
And to my horror, the bloody town square

The time is now, we must avenge
We form to fight, we kill tonight
We must rest to regain our strength
We form to fight, we kill tonight

Battalion advances surrounding their backs
In the night we'll attack with no questions or mercy
We'll take all they have and we'll drive them before us
Hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to avenge

Gather all survivors, the forces retreat
They've leveled our city, there's rubble in the streets
Surprise attack with no explanation
What will we do with this demolished nation?

Death to come for what they've done
Stab their backs, their necks will crack
Stronger than ever, our guns held high
Stab their backs, their necks will crack

Battalion advances surrounding their backs
In the night we'll attack with no questions of mercy
We'll take all they have and we'll drive them before us
Hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to avenge

The people have organized an army of vengeance
Struck them down, the bodies just like remnants
Dogs of war, like lepers that are shunned
We stand proud, the battle has been won

The time is now, we must avenge
We form to fight, We kill tonight
We must rest to regain our strength
We form to fight, we kill tonight

Battalion advances surrounding their backs
In the night we'll attack with no questions of mercy
We'll take all they have and we'll drive them before us
Hear lamentations of women who cry for the loved ones we crush to avenge
