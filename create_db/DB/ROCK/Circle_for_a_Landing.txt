You've got your head up in the air
Act like you don't even care
When I tell ya I'll be there
Come on, stop what your doin' to me

Circle for a landing, get your feet back on the ground
Circle for a landing, it's time to come on down
Just the thought of losing you is more than I can take
Circle for a landing before it's too late

No one loves you like I do
When I think, I think of you
I'll have to find somebody new
If you don't stop what else can I do?

Circle for a landing, get your feet back on the ground
Circle for a landing, it's time to come on down, chickie, chickie
Just the thought of losing you is more than I can take
Circle for a landing before it's too late

Used to think I knew you, ha
Now you're flying much to high
Now baby, I can see right through ya
You're afraid that love will make you cry

Circle for a landing, get your feet back on the ground
Circle for a landing, it's time to come on down, chickie, chickie
Just the thought of losing you is more than I can take
Circle for a landing before it's too late

Circle for a landing, get your feet back on the ground
Circle for a landing, it's time to come on down
Circle for a landing, get your feet back on the ground
Circle for a landing, it's time to come on down
