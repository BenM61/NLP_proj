I've been up and down and 'round and 'round and back again,
Been so many places I can't remember where or when.
And my only boss was the clock on the wall
And my only friend never really was a friend at all.

I've traded love for pennies; sold my soul for less.
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time.
And I've turned inside out and 'round about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started again.

Once I had myself a million, now I've only got a dime.
Difference so seem quite as bad today.
With a nickel or a million I was searchin' all the time
For something that I never lost or left behind.

I've traded love for pennies; sold my soul for less.
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time.
And I've turned inside out and 'round about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started again.

And now I'm in my second circle and I'm headed for the top;
I learned a lot of things along the way.
I'll be careful while I'm climbin', 'cause it hurts a lot to drop.
Nobody gives a damn anyway.

I've traded love for pennies; sold my soul for less.
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time.
And I've turned inside out and 'round about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started again.
