Just lately I've had a go
To find me a new world and candy home
All I needed was a little affection for my soul

Hey, maybe it's time to go
I should have told you a couple of years ago
And I know what's gonna play on my mind

So, I'll meet you on the floor
Are you ready for some more?

[Chorus]
Just be careful what you wish for
Just be careful what you hope for
Just be careful what you wish for
Just be careful what you hope for

Tell me, who do you think you see?
Am I still the girl that you thought I'd be?
Do you care that I might be for real?

Hey, maybe it's time to go
I should have told you a couple of years ago
And I know what's gonna play on my mind

So, I'll meet you on the floor
Are you ready for some more?

[Chorus]

Just be careful what you wish for
Just be careful what you hope for
Just be careful what you wish for
Just be careful what you hope for
Just be careful what you wish for
Just be careful what you hope for

You're wish, it may come true!
You're wish, it may come true!
You're wish, it may come true!
You're wish, it may come true!
