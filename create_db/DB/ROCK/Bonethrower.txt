You warned me that I wasn't ready for this
How can anyone be it?
And so this is our chance to know
Say good-bye before you go.

You're holding me down
Making me drown.

I'm bleeding from sores I cannot heal
It took so long and now you feel
This is your world that I live in
I won't bend to this again.
