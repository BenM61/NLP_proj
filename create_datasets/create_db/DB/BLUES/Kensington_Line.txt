 work on a wreckin' wall
Just off the liquor tracks
Onto the shaky ground
Oh, I'm fallin' down
hey, I'm ridin' 

A fool to confide. Hey, Eddie watch your name
Let that lady be your guide
hey, she's comin' round
Hey, I'm flyin' 

When the sleep gets in your eyes 
I'll be on Kensington Line
And I'll run my hundred miles
Hey, don't you follow me tonight 

Didn't like the look I see
Runnin' in the autumn leaves
Hasn't got a brain or peeve
Oh, the walls are closin' in
Hey, I'm headed out of here
Oh, I never meant to leave you cryin'
