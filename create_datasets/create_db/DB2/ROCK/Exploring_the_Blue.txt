I go down into the water
Dive as deep as man can go
Into those dark places
Watch the underwater flow

Exploring the blue
Exploring the blue
Exploring the blue
Search of you

Here I stand by the mountain
And I look up to the sky
Knowing it's a matter of having to climb
'Bove this place, these clouds lie

Exploring the blue
Exploring the blue
Exploring the blue
Search of you

It may be high, it may be low
Where I think you are
Is that's where I'll go
That's where I'll go, that's where I'll go

I go down into the water
Dive as deep as man can go
