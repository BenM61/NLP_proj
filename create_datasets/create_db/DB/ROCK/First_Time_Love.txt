First time you fall for somebody 
The world becomes your lucky star 
You wander around like a peacock 
With your lover on your arm 

Next time you fall 
You think you've heard it all 
No one could turn your insides out 
And your friends hear you say 
If your heart slips away 
I'll wonder what its all about 

And it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

So never say never another 
Just because somebody broke your heart 
Get your chin off the floor 
You'll never know what's in store 
If you don't give love a chance to start 
And if you don't believe in following feelings 

It's never too late to start 
Cause when you open your eyes 
Then you'll realize 
I'm the one who's chasing your heart 

Well it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

And it's first time love making your heart beat 
Second time love making it stop 
Finally love picks you up from the bottom 
And leads you home some how.
