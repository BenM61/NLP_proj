When there are hard times I'll step it up
When there are dangerous times I'll spot them up
I'll take my time to make up my own mind
To set it up when the times are calling for a steady creed

How do I know it's time?
Even if I've got mine
'Cause if the wise do know what wisdom is
If I could err on every good side every time

Out on the water
A rider can ready
Though waves comes crashing
A good board can steady
I wouldn't ever want to bet upon the balance on what's going on
Would I?

Stay
What's in my way?
Got to have it to get over it

To have an empty fortune when I fear
To have a deadly weapon, as it's called
Which is an answer to a challenge made by anything
Then to always know just what things violence needs

How do I know its time?
Even if I got mine
'Cause if the wise do know what wisdom is
If I could err on every good side every time

Out on the water
A rider can ready
Though waves comes crashing
A good board can steady
I wouldn't ever want to bet upon the balance on what's going on
Would I?

Why wouldn't I?
