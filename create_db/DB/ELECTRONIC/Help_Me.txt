There's an awful world inside of me
You wouldn't believe all the things I've seen
Who should I be? The sounds stifle me
To feed in fear, try penetration here

[Chorus]
Help me, help me
Help me, help me

The realest part is my reflection's clear 
I know its crazy but the end is near
We're all alone, and judgments will reveal
Deep coat cause some will have eternity

[Chorus]

This is just my destiny so come with me [Repeat: x4]

[Chorus]
