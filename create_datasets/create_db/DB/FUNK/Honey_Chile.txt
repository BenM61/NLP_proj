You're shiftless and you're lazy
Just like the hound dog, Daisy 
I had when grandma raised me
Honey chile, poor Granny 
Got too old to scorn me
Dear old auntie warned me 
You sure was no good for me
Honey chile, but your kiss 
Is sweeter than the cake
That grandma used to make
Oh them sweet little things about ya 
Sure enough takes the cake
You ain't gonna amount to nothing
'Cause you ain't gonna work for nothing
Without you, I'm good for nothing
Honey chile, honey chile
Sure 'bout to drive me wild
And I love you so 
Can't let go 
Now honey chile oh sugar chile
I'd walk a country mile 
Just to be with you 
And to stay with you, now honey chile

I try to act like a lady 
But you've been courtin' Sadie
Your reputation's shady 
Honey chile, hey you even took out Sally
Who lives across the alley 
Oh I've been keeping tally 
Honey chile you're like the grapes
Upon the vine at winning pretty wine
'Cause like that home made wine so sweet
You sure enough drove me out of my mind now
You ain't nothing but a playboy 
Using me for a play toy 
You're ruining my pride and joy 
Now honey chile, honey chile
Sure 'bout to drive me wild
And I love you so, can't let go 
Now honey, ,oh sugar chile
I'd walk a country mile 
Just to be with you 
And to stay with you, now honey chile

One day I'm gonna get stronger
And I won't need you no longer
This feeling will be a goner
Honey chile, hey now I can't take disgracin'
That ain't the way granny raised me
You're gonna just hurt like crazy 
Honey chile, sugar chile
I'd walk a country mile 
Just to be with you 
And to stay with you, honey chile
Hey honey chile sure 'bout to drive me wild
