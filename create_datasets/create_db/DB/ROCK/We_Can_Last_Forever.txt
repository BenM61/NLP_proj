Don't turn away
'Cause there is something I just want to say
I need you to stay
Don't ask me why
'Cause I don't even know
How I gave you my heart
I gave it all to you
Now there's no way that I can lose

Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever
Every little moment we can share
Gonna let you know how much I care
I'll always be there

Don't walk away
'Cause there is something I just gotta say
I love you today
Just ask me why
You're all I'll ever need
Now that you're in my life
I'm gonna please you now
And I'm never gonna let you go

Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever
Every little moment we can share
Gonna let you know how much I care
Love lift us away...
We can last forever!

Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever
Every little moment we can share
Gonna let you know how much I care
