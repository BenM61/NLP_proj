Mary Hill used to hang out in Cherry Hill Park
The game she played lasted all day till way after dark
All the girls they criticized her
But all the guys just idolized her
'Cause Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
In Cherry Hill Park
Mary Hill used to love to ride the merry-go-round
All the guys got eager eyes watchin Mary go round
In the daytime Mary Hill was a teaser 
Come the night she was such a pleaser
Oh Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
In Cherry Hill Park
Mary Hill sure was smart down in Cherry Hill Park
Playing games with everyone till way after dark
In Cherry Hill Park, Cherry Hill Park
Then one day, Mary Hill, she married away
A man with some money said come on honey
And she said okay
She went away to play a one man game
And since that day it ain't been the same
Cause Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
Yeah in Cherry Hill Park
Now Mary Hill sure was smart down in Cherry Hill Park
Playing games with everyone till way after dark
