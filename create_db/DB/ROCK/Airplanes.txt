The desk where you sit inside of a frame made of
Made of, of wood
I keep those chopsticks you had from when you taught abroad
Taught abroad in Japan

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

I did not know you as well as my father
Father knew you
Every question you took the time to sit and look it up
Look it up in the encyclopedia

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back, yeah

It sounds like we would've had a great deal to say
To say to each other
I bet when I leave my body for the sky the wait
The wait will be worth it

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back
