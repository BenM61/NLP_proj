Turn up the sound make it feel louder

Open the dark side of me
Find what your faith needs to be
Help me gain focus on you
Heart bleeds I know what to do

Turn up the sound now
Make it feel louder
Who is this playing
Are you still here
Who's all around now
Are you still listening
What are they saying
Words that aren't clear
Turn up the sound now
Lost in the crowd and
I haven't heard this one before
Turn up the sound now
What are you saying
No I'm not listening anymore

Please don't confess to the sin
Unless you are set to begin
Fallout seems more than just trust
Walls down dive into us
