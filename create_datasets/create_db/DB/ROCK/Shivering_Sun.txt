Isn't it the dark winter night
When your gleam caught my sight
Isn't it the same cold rain
We are under again
It's the man of the moon
Running as fast as a fool
Being here it's being alone

What have I done
Oh, my shivering sun
Her voice whispering
Among the leaves of spring
What have I done
Oh, my shivering sun

Isn't it the same cold breeze
Blowing from the same arctic sea
Isn't it the smile on your face
Lost in its grace
It's the man of the moon
Running as fast as a fool
Being here, it's being alone

What have I done
Oh, my shivering sun
Her voice whispering
Among the leaves of spring
Where have you gone
Oh, my shivering sun
Oh, my shivering sun

Isn't it the dark winter night
When your gleam caught my sight
Being here, it's being in love
