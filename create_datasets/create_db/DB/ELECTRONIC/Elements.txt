Hey, hey, wow, yeah

Alice in her Wonderland
Her world is big but it's just pretend
Is there a day when we will understand
This circus we call life?

I keep on hearing time and time again
If we won't listen then our world will end
We don't say it just to make amends
Listen through the script of prayers

It's not necessary for an eagle to be a crow
The circle of life is here and respect we must show

[Chorus]
Earth, wind, water and fire
Seems like we've lost our desire
To fight for what we know is right
Lost in our way of life
Earth, wind, water and fire
Seems like we've lost our desire
To fight for what we know is right
The elements of life

Would you believe there are better ways
To justify what the people say?
Nothing seems unique these days
In the circus we call life

I've heard the line that I'm just a man
Nothing changes we must make a stand
And if that means to fight we can

It's not necessary for an eagle to be a crow
The circle of life is here and respect must be shown

[Chorus]

Colors and fountains and mountains and trees
Take just a second to stop and to think
God was an artist painted pictures to see
Look how beautiful life can be

Colors and fountains and mountains and trees
Take just a second to stop and to think
God was an artist painted pictures to see
Look how beautiful life can be

[Chorus]

Colors and fountains and mountains and trees
Take just a second to stop and to think
God was an artist painted pictures to see
Look how beautiful life can be

Colors and fountains and mountains and trees
Take just a second to stop and to think
God was an artist painted pictures to see
Look how beautiful life can be
