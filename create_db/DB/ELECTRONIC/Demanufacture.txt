Desensitized by the values of life
Maligned and despaired by government lies

Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy

Dislocated by the eyes of disdain
Abused beyond recognition

I can't hope with
The madness abounding
Blasts in my head
Of gunfire resounding
Firing relentless
Killing the senses

I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect

I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye

Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy

I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
