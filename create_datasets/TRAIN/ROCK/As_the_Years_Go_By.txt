A child asks his mother do you love me
And it really means will you protect me
His mother answers him I love you
And it really means you've been a good boy
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
At seventeen a girl says do you love me
And it really means will you respect me
The teenage boy answers yes I love you
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
I-I-I love you forever
I-I-I love you forever

She says do you love me
And it means I'd like to hear it again
Her husband says to her I love you
But it really means I love you till the end
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
Now you're asking me if I love you
And it really means will I marry you
And I answer yes I love you
But it really means that I won't be untrue
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
I-I-I love you forever
I-I-I love you forever
