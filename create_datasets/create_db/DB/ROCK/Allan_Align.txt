Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the beat of my heart

Obey to the chimes of the bells
Your time is running away
You got to get going now
Life, it will not wait

I remember when you were a soldier
Now all you do is growing older
I remember when there was light outside

No more time to fight
No more time to realize
Now adjust your feet
Lay down on my knees

Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the beat of my heart

Obey to the chimes of the bells
Your time is running away
You got to get going now
Life, it will not wait

Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the sound, align to the sound
Obey to the chimes of the bells
Align to the sound, align to the sound
Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the sound, align to the sound

Obey to the chimes of the bells
Your time is running away
You got to get going now
Life, it will not wait
Hey!
