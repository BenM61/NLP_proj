You appear on the horizon, far away
My desire to be there with you
Stirs the wind and fills the sails
In the bay I drop the anchor down, swim ashore
On the beach the coconut palms
Jasmine, frangipane and you

Your silent eyes convince me
I'm marooned
We're safe inside this azure blue lagoon

I want to know you, bird of paradise
I want to show you, all the love that I feel
I need to touch you, bird of paradise
I need your touch to make this fantasy real

On sea o storm is raging, far away
And the ships - like so many toys
Fear the wind and fight the waves
In your arms a forgotten dream
nothing more
Here the sky is perfectly clear
Evening star, the moonlight and you

Your silent eyes convince me
I'm marooned
We're safe inside this azure blue lagoon

I want to know you, bird of paradise
I want to show you, all the love that I feel
I need to touch you, bird of paradise
I need your touch to make this fantasy real

I want to know you, bird of paradise
I want to show you, all the love that I feel

Just you and me, a mango tree
The bare necessities of love
My bird of paradise, I realize
That you were sent here from above
You're my bird
Of paradise
My bird of paradise
