Woke up sorry for yourself
Could not think of no one else
Up all night and down all day
Obvious you were born that way

(We all agree, fortunately)
You're a special case history

A realistical chance you find
You double-cross and change your mind
I can't believe a word you say
Obvious you were born that way

The weak get's late and never change
The voice may change yet sound the same
Bridge that gap, make my day
Obvious you're here to stay

We all agree, fortunately
We all agree, fortunately
We all agree, fortunately
We all agree, fortunately
