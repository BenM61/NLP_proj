I know it comes as no surprise
That I am so in love with you
When I think of us two, I start feeling blue
Something that I've gotten used to
But lately I must admit times have been hard
Put a straining pain on my heart
As much as it hurts to say these words
I think that is best for you to

Leave me live your life don't worry
I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday we'll get another try

It seems as though every time
I speak your name I get weak
'Cause I imagine before I go to sleep
That you are right here with me
Somebody told be
You can't appreciate what you got until it is gone
But they were so wrong because I have cherished you
Its just that I'm not the one you care

Leave me live your life don't worry
I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday we'll get another try

Deep down inside
Please hear me now
You expect so much
That's why I'm hurtin' inside
And I don't even
And appreciate it for my average girl
This is where we've grown apart
And I don't know if we can handle
The trouble
If not its gonna hurt me to see you

Leave me live your life don't worry
I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday
We'll get another try

Leave me live your life don't worry
I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
