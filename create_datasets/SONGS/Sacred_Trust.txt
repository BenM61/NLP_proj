I meant to fight it to the finish but you made me forget, 
And though it's possible I'm dreaming, don't wake me yet. 
You know I love you, I can't see the day for night. 
You know I twist around and turn around and then I give in. 
You end up in control of me, it's really a sin, 
I don't know what you're doing to me but I know it's a crime. 

And, baby, I can't last another night, 
And every moment is eternity, 
And from the depth of my soul can't let another day go by. 

I follow my heart right up to the end, as far as the eye can see. 
I'm faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me. 
I'll never give out to somebody else, I know where my arms should be. 
I'm faithful and true and making it through your sacred trust in me, 
Your sacred trust in me. 

You take and you break me and do what you please, 
I stumble and I tremble and I'm weak at the knees, 
The vision that lies before me is not reality. 

I tell you I can't wait another night 
For every secret that your soul reveals, 
And you and I may get to know 
That it's real, that it's real. 

I follow my heart that leads me to you, and all that my love should be, 
And you can be sure I'm doing it for your sacred trust in me. 
I'll never give out to somebody else, there's nowhere my heart should be, 
I'm faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me, 
Your sacred trust in me. 

I follow my heart right up to the end as far as the eye can see. 
I'm faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me. 
I'll never give out to somebody else, I know where my arms should be. 
I'm faithful and true and making it through your sacred trust in me, 
Your sacred trust. 

I follow my heart that leads me to you, and all that my love should be, 
And you can be sure I'm doing it for your sacred trust in me. 
I'll never give out to somebody else, there's nowhere my heart should be, 
I'm faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me, 
Your sacred trust
