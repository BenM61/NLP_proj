Across a crowded room, set apart from it all
You took my breath away (yes, you did)

Like a sparkle in the dark
You smiled and I knew
That you would make my dreams come true

Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound

It's unbelievable, I hardly know you at all
Still you make me feel this way
You're unpredictable
In all the things that you do
Now my heart belongs to you (yes, it does)

Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound

I'm bein' true to myself
With every word I say, in all the things I do
And though you may not feel the same
You know I'm there for you
I can't stop lovin' you
Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound

Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound

Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound
