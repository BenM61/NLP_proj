Weary of roamin' on,
Yearning to see the dawn,
Counting the hours till I can lay down my load.
Weary, but I don't mind,
Knowing that I'll soon find
Peace and contentment at the end of the road.

The way is long, the night is dark,
But I don't mind 'cause a happy lark
Will be singing at the end of the road.
I can't go wrong, I must go right,
I'll find my way 'cause a guiding light
Will be shining at the end of the road.

There may be thorns in my path, but I'll wear a smile,
For in a little while my path will be roses!

The rain may fall from up above,
But I won't stop 'cause the one I love
Will be waiting at the end of the road.

Say, the way may be long and the night is dark,
But I don't mind 'cause a happy lark
Will be singing at the end of the road;
And I can't go wrong, I must go right,
I'll find my way 'cause a guiding light
Will be shining at the end of the road.

There may be thorns in my path, but I'll wear a smile,
For in a little while my path will be roses!

And the rain may fall from up above,
But I won't stop 'cause the one I love
Will be waiting at the end of the road.
