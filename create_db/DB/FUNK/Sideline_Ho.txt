Ho, ho, sideline ho
You's a ho, you's a ho, sideline ho

When you called his phone, did he pick it up?
No, 'cause we was makin' love
Did you meet his moms, have you met his kid?
No, did you know my kid was his?

[Chorus]
Get your shit together, you're makin' a fool of yourself, yeah
It don't matter if he spends the night 
His home is somewhere else
Ain't you tired of being on the sideline
Tired of getting yours after I gets mine?
Baby, second place don't get a prize
When you gonna realize you wasting your time?
Baby, ain't you tired of him gettin' in, hittin' it real quick then rollin'?
And ain't you tired of you need a little change, and he lie about what he holdin'?
Ain't you tired of spending all the holidays alone?
Tired of being his little sideline ho

Do he take you out? Do he foot your bills? 
No, 'cause I know what his balance is
Have you been to his church? Do he ask you to pray? 
No, 'cause Sunday's family day

[Chorus]

[Bridge x 2]
Do you got benefits? (No) Credit cards? (No) House keys? (No)
Then you's a sideline ho
Do you get pillow talk? (No) Held at night? (No)
If you don't make his breakfast, you's a sideline ho

[Chorus]

You's a ho, you's a ho, sideline ho
You's a ho, you's a ho, sideline ho
You's a ho, you's a ho, sideline ho
