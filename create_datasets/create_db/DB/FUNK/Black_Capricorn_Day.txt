Hey hey
Hey hey
Let the rain come down on me
Hey hey
Hey hey

I see people and they're craving blood
And I'm so rarely understood
Well I don't know what they want from me
It's gonna take some time just to let them see

I'm going through a black, hey, Capricorn day
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black, hey, Capricorn day
Though you want to check me out
I'm not the man to play, play, play, play
Hey hey
Don't you see I'm not the man to play
Hey hey
No way you can play with me today
Hey hey
Just let me sing it to my Capricorn day
Hey hey

My heart is a pure sun and the sky is black
And I can feel cold steel when I turn my back
It stings like needles, with a jagged tongue
You know this scream reminds me
Of when I was so young

I never had any of those
Black, hey, Capricorn days
Though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black, hey, Capricorn day
And though you want to check me out
I'm not the man to play, play, play, play

It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black

I'm stuck on the highway
Leading straight to Hell
Like any other drifter with a soul to sell
You know I'm dealing with the devil
In everyone I meet
And their faces tell a story,
That life ain't so sweet

I'm going through a black, hey, Capricorn day
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black, hey, Capricorn day
Though you want to check me out
I'm not the man to play, play, play, play

Black, hey, Capricorn day
Though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I've got to get this way
Black, hey, Capricorn day
Though you want to check me out
You wanna check me out
I'm not the man to play

It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
It's just too black for me
