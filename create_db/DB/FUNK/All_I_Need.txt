Oh, this heart of mine carries a heavy load 
When I think about how I've hurt you so
After you been, been so good to me
I've been unfaithful, darling
I've caused you misery
A feeling of guilt, oh it tortures me
And only you my darling, oh can set me free
 
And darling all, all I need is just to hear you say you forgive me
Forgive me baby
All, all I need is to have you touch my hand
Say you understand, baby
A moment of weakness darling, caused me to stray
Your trust in me, dear I threw away
When I look, look into your eyes
I can see the hurt baby that you feel inside
Although I've hurt you, baby you never once complain
It makes me feel sweet darling, that much more ashamed
Tears of guilt, tears of guilt running down my face
Tears that only you, baby, only you can erase
 
And darling, all, all I need is just to hear you say you forgive me
Forgive me baby
All, all I need is to have you touch my hand
Say you understand, ooh
I know I made a big mistake
When all your love darling, yes, I did forsake
It's on my mind, it's in my heart
This guilty feeling tearing me apart
With ev'ry step I make, with ev'ry breath I take
I'll make it up to you, I'll make it up to you
 
Undo the wrong I've done, undo the wrong I've done
I've been unfaithful I know it's true, but I'll make it up to you baby
All, all I need is just to hear you say you forgive me, forgive me baby
All, all I need is to have you touch my hand,
Say you understand, baby
All, all I need is just to hear you say you forgive me, forgive me baby
