Move me, move me no mountain
Move me no, move me no mountain
Move me, move me no mountain
Move me no, move me no mountain

Just as sure as I am, I will love you alone
You belong in my arms, you belong in my home
I don't expect you to be someone else that you're not
All I expect you to give is all that you've got, so

Move me no mountain, turn me no tide
Swim me no ocean, long, deep and wide
Just say you love me, long, strong and true and
Move me no mountain to prove that you do
Move me no mountain to prove that you do

Fill my life with your love, you're my bread, you're my wine
Fill my life with your love and I'll fill yours with mine
You'll never hear me cry tears of regret
And it's fine with me if what I see is what I get

Move me no mountain, turn me no tide
Swim me no ocean, long, deep and wide
Just say you love me, long, strong and true and
Move me no mountain to prove that you do
Move me no mountain to prove that you do

Move me no mountain
Move me no mountain

Move me no mountain, yeah
Move me, move me no mountain
Move me, move me no mountain
Move me, move me no mountain
Give me love, move me no mountain

Move me no mountain
Move me, move me no mountain
Move me, move me no mountain
Give me love, move me no mountain

Move me no mountain, babe
Move me no mountain
