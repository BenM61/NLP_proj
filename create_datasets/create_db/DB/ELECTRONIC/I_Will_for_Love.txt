I will for love

Even if our world is done
And the sky is falling down
It won't even matter to us
No, it won't even matter to us, no

Oh, we could risk it all
We'll fight until we fall
Oh, we could risk it all
Oh, I, I will for love, I will for love

I will for love
I will for love
I will for love
I will for love, I will for love

And even if our world is done
And the sky is falling down
It will never change my love
No, it will never change my love, no, no

Oh, we could risk it all
We'll fight until we fall
Oh, we could risk it all
Oh, I, I will for love, I will for love

I will for love
I will for love
I will for love
I will for love, I will for love

And even if our world is done
And the sky is falling, the sky is falling down
'Cause it will never change my love
No, no
It will never change, it will never change my love
My love, my love

I will for love
I will for love
I will for love
I will for love, I will for love

(I will for love)
(I will for love)
(I will for love)
I will for love, I will for love

I will for love
Oh, yeah
