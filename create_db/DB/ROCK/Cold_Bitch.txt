Yeah
On your breast
I might lay my crowded head
In your light
I might bathe in cold burnt sweat
In your mouth
I might feel the serpent's kiss
In you womb
I might swim in fetal bliss

But in your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze

In your eyes
I might be your saving grace
In your head
I might say it through your eyes
In your lungs
I might stare between you

In your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze
I'd freeze

I would feed your heart
Take a vow of silence
And put your love out of business

But in your heart
In your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze
In your heart I'd freeze
