Yeah, you know Katie Mae is a good girl, folks, and she don't run around at night 
Yeah, you know you can bet your last dollar Katie Mae will treat you right 
Yeah, you know I try to give that woman everything in the world she need, 
that's why she don't do nothing but lay up in the bed and read 
You know she walks just like she got oil wells in her backyard 
Yes, you'll never hear that woman whoop and holler and cry and talking 'bout these times being hard 
You know some folks say she must be a Cadillac, but I say she must be a T-model Ford 
Yeah, you know some folks say she must be a Cadillac, but I say she must be a T-model Ford 
Yeah, you know she got the shape all right, but she can't carry no heavy load 
I say goodbye, goodbye poor Katie Mae, these are the last words that I got to say 
I say goodbye, goodbye poor Katie Mae, these are the last words I got to say 
Yes, if I don't see you tomorrow I hope I'll meet you early the next day
