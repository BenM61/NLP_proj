Have you ever had the feelin'
You were all alone
And the world just passed you by

Tell me have you ever tried forgivin'
When somebody's done you wrong
Well, the price of love runs high

So high, so high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Well, the look that's on your face
It shows an old heartbreak
And I believe
(I believe)

Whoa, whoa I believe I can make it better
I can see it in your eyes
Your feelings can't disguise

I believe
(I believe)
Whoa, I believe I can make it better, whoa, my love
I believe I can make it better, better, baby
But the price of love runs high

Tell me are you feelin' up to givin'
Just one more chance
Well, love don't love no one

And have you had enough of livin'
A one-way romance
Or has it all been for
For fun, for fun, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Well, the look that's on your face
It shows an old heartbreak
And I believe
(I believe)

Yeah, I believe I can make it better
I can see it in your eyes
Feeling can't disguise

And I believe
(I believe)
Whoa, whoa, I believe I can make it better
Whoa, whoa, I believe I can make it better
So much better, baby
But the price of love runs high

So high, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So high
So high, oh, oh, well
So high

You got me so, so, so high
Price of love, love, love, love's so high
Oh, oh, oh
So high, oh, yeah
Price of love
