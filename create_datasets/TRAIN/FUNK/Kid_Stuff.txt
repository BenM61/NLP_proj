One, two, three, four

Remember when you were a kid? All the things you did (can't stop)
You don't wanna be the fool, got to go to school (oh ma, I'm sleepy still) (can't stop)
And the Sunday afternoon watching your cartoons (I'm sorry) (No, I'm sorry) (can't stop)
Mommy cooks my favorite meat, you don't wanna eat (give it to Mikey, ma) (I don't want it) (can't stop)
Ma
I'm gonna knock Mikey
It's the best grilled roast she cooked, make you want a book (can't stop)
'Course your mama makes you wash, gotta eat that squash (agh) (can't stop)
Clean your room, make your bed, get that grease out of your head (it makes me look good, ma) (can't stop)
Sunday night, take your bath, so we'll know, so it won't last (mommy my fingers are getting wrinkled) (can't stop)
Fee fi fo fana (go son, play that piano)

Can't stop

Remember when you were a kid? All the things you did (can't stop)
You don't wanna be no fool, got to go to school, aha (can't stop)
Ah heh heh, ah hee, ah hee hee, ha ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna ride my bike, here you go
I never get to ride that bike (this is ridiculous)
Give me my bicycle
