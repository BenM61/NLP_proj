Beware of his promise
Believe what I say
Before the night is ending 
Be sure of what you're saying 

Cause he paints a pretty picture 
And he tells you that he loves you 
And he covers you with roses 
And he always keeps you dreaming
If he always keeps you dreaming 
You won't have a lonely hour 
If the day could last forever 
You might like your ivory tower 

But the night begins to turn your head around 
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found 
Oh yeah the night begins to turn your head around 

Beware of his promise
Believe what I say 
Before I go forever 
Be sure of what you're saying 

Cause the words might come too quickly 
If you really think I'm leaving 
And goodbye might come too easy 
If you really think he loves you 
If you really think he loves you 
You would give yourself completely 
If the day could last forever 
You would give yourself completely 

But the night begins to turn your head around 
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found 
Oh yeah the night begins to turn your head around 

(????)
And the night begins to turn your head around 
Oh yeah you know you're gonna lose more than you found 
Ma ma ma ma oh the night begins to turn your head around 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah and you know you're gonna lose more than you found, oh
