Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am
Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

I may not be rich
Got diamond (Incomprehensible) and gold
But I got something brother
Bound to satisfy your soul

Babe, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

Don't look for no princess
'Cause princesses don't have a thing
Nothing they can do for you
But reach for what you bring

Babe, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

Hey, but, but, but
But, but, but

I am soul sister with nothing to know how, now
I know to make a liver quiver
And I know how to make a love come down
I can make you wanna need this time

Baby, bring the thing home
Baby, bring the thing home

Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home

Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
