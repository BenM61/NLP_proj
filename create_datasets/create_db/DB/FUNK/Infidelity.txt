When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

Your call has been registered
It'll be returned when I get back home
I've been out loving all night long
I can't help it, that love it makes me strong

When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

Ask me all the questions you need
I don't tell lies, my conscience don't bleed
You'll get all the time I can give
As long as you respect my freedom to live

When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

I just can't be trusted

A kick in the ribs for the arrival late at night
So late in the evening you could see the morning light
When you're sat up alone and you wonder where I've been
You can pick up my belongings and tell me where I can take them

When a man just can't be trusted
And again he's gone and lost it

I just can't be trusted

Infidelity
