Bring a little laughter
Shine a little light
On anyone who's coming your way
'Cause every morning after
A never ending night
Will bring another dish of the day

Johnny was a sailor
Johnny was a queen
He loved to play the double-cross game
Little johnny sailer
Barely seventeen
Almost at the height of his fame
Picured with his boyfriends in paris '99
Butterflies from heaven for a while
It's paradise forever
Let's lay it on the line
That's fine

So bring a little laughter
Shine a little light
On everything that's coming your way
'Cause every morning after
A never ending night
Will bring another dish of the day

Tommy was darling
Darling double screen
Tommy was so glad to be gay
Pretty tommy darling
A hero in his teens
Twenty-seven blowjobs a day
He blew a few too many
The camera never lies
As some of you will surely understand
He's twenty-nine forever
Let's lay it on the line
That's fine

So bring a little laughter
Shine a little light
On anyone who's coming your way
'Cause every morning after
A never ending night
Will bring another dish of the day

It's paradise forever
Let's lay it on the line
That's fine

So bring a little laughter
Shine a little light
On anyone who's coming your way
'Cause every morning after
A never ending night
Will bring another dish of the day
