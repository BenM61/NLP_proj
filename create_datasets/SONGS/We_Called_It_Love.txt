I don't suppose you remember me
I was the one who set you free
You lived a lie until I was gone
Pretending I was the only one

Keep tripping upon the things I say
It never worked but we lived it anyway
Cradle to grave, I'll be trailing you
I dreamt I broke your heart and my dream came true

At Echo Park in 2002
You made it to the end, I was there with you

Put down the blade and mirror, look at me
I see my reflection, what do you see?

You start the day totally alone
Baring your soul to the dial tone

A golden chain that we buy and sell
I've always been alone, but you have as well

We used to call it something
We used to call it something
We called it love
We called it love
We called it love
We called it love

I don't believe people ever change
I don't believe people ever change
I don't believe people ever change
But I've changed

I don't believe people ever change
No, I don't believe people ever change
I don't believe people ever change
But I've changed

Oh, I've changed
