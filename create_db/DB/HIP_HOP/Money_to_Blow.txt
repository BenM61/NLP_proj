Mo' money bitches

Comin' to you live
From the city of hustatlantavegas

So what it do young nigga

I am on a twenty four hour
Champagne diet
Spillin' while I'm sippin'
I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just sayin' that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it
Boy I'm on that fly shit
I am, what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what, I made it
I'm da motherfuckin' man
I jus' want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of dis nigga
Quit frontin' on me
Don't come around and try to gas me up I like runnin' on E

Goofy flow on records I'm Captain Hook
And my new car is Rufio
Damn where my roof just go
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin' somethin' cause that's what drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for, like
Leavin' girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl, I got 'em

They can't help it,
And I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous
But bitch I got money to blow
I'm gettin' it in, letting these bills fall
All over your skin

Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh

We certified gettin' it C-M Y-M Cash Money business
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird, hit the Gucci store
And later get served
We smoked out with no roof on it
Them people passi' so we smash on 'em
Binnin' out we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini's and the Bentleys on the V-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider
No lie I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich born uptown born to win
Fully loaded automatic six Benz
Candy paint foreign lights with my bitch in
Born hustlin' too big nigga to size me up
Kept stuntin' mo more money binnin' up

They can't help it,
And I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous
But bitch I got money to blow
I'm gettin' it in, letting these bills fall
All over your skin

Oh oh oh ooh I got oh oh

Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh

Well I get paid every 24 hours money and the power
Come to V-I-P and get a Champagne Shower
I don't have to worry because everything ours,
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Janes Flower
That kush I promise that's my dude
But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
And I'm with two women make you take a second look
We poppin' like champagne bottles but we never shook
And we goin be alright if we put drake on every hook

They can't help it,
And I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous
But bitch I got money to blow

All over your skin
