Oh they danced on the ceiling
And they danced on the wall
At the Gandy Dancer's ball
Hey! swing around, swing around,
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
The Jimmy, Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing the pretty girl round
The Jimmy, Jimmy John

The Gandy Dancer is a railroad man
And his work is never done
With his pick and his shovel and his willing hands
He makes the railroad run
There's Macanaw Mack and Toledo Jack
And the boys from Idaho
And the Frisco kid and Saginaw Sid
And good old Cotton-eyed Joe

Oh they danced on the ceiling
And they danced on the wall
At the Gandy Dancer's ball
Hey! swing around, swing around,
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
The Jimmy, Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing the pretty girl round
The Jimmy, Jimmy John

The boys will gather at the great affair
The Gandy Dancer's ball
A-kissin' their ladies with perfumed hair
And prancin' round the hall
They got the biggest band in all the land
And the rhythm rocks the room
And they holler out with a mighty shout
When the big bass drum goes boom

Oh they danced on the ceiling
And they danced on the wall
At the Gandy Dancer's ball
Hey! swing around, swing around,
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
The Jimmy, Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing the pretty girl round
The Jimmy, Jimmy John

The railroads bring 'em to the great affair
The Gandy Dancer's ball
An' every line is represented there
The big ones and the small
There's the M-K-T and the old SP
And the Lehigh Valley too
The C-N-J and the Santa Fe
The Southern and the Soo.

Oh they danced on the ceiling
And they danced on the wall
At the Gandy Dancer's ball
Hey! swing around, swing around,
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
The Jimmy, Jimmy John
Swing around, swing around
Swing around the Jimmy John
Swing the pretty girl round
The Jimmy, Jimmy John

They danced all day
And they danced all night
They all danced till the broad daylight
At the Gandy Dancer's ball

(swing around, swing around
Swing around, swing around
The Jimmy John)
