It's the truth
If you told me last year I'd be laid up like this man
I would have never believed you
Things are a lot different

Seems like it was just a year ago
I was talking sleek about girls
About the little things they do to just piss me off, oh yeah
I was better off alone

I became numb and insensitive
Started being bitter and cold
Tuning in and listening to pimps on the radio and you know
It started making sense to me

But that's when I met my lady
Woman came and changed the game
Happy that I found my lady
And my life would never be the same, oh yeah

Wasn't even looking to fall in love
Was the last thing on my mind
Didn't see it coming till it already had me down
Struck me blind

I was on the verge of being through with the pain
Didn't see a reason to try
Couldn't understand what all these fools kept singing about
'Till I became one of them

When I became your lady
Everything started to change
Happy I became your lady
Life can never be the same

That's when I found my lady
And I've changed the way I think of things
Happy that I found, happy that I found
Nothing in the world can change the way I feel about you baby
Feel so good baby, don't you ever go away
