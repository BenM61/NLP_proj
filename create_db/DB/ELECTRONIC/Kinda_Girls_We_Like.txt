Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

We came out before. 
Now we're back again.
Singin' the kinda girls we like 
Now is this the end
We're about to blast off 
So hold on real tight.
While Michael tells you 
The kinda girl he likes.

Hey, I like a girl who likes to tease 
Not the kinda girl who's always there to please
The kinda girl who makes up her mind 
When she (I never knew this part) her given time.
The kinda girl whom you always think about. 
That's the kinda girl whom you can't be without.
I'm Michael B. That's the girl for me. 
She's the only girl I could never leave.

You've heard one description 
Now listen to this. 
Because this one for sure 
You can't afford to miss.
So turn up the volume 
And open your ears. 
Because this next description 
Is for you my dear.

Well, my friends call me flash be
And here's the kinda girl that's just for me.
I like a girl that is right on time. 
She's also sweet and she's oh so fine.
I like a nice young lady with beautiful hair 
So if you want to be with Bob you gotta care
She give me her love. 
She give me her time. 
This kinda girl is mine all mine.

You've heard two descriptions 
Now here comes the third. 
And it's flyer than anything 
That you've ever heard. 
We love all you girls without any doubt. 
And as long as you know this, 
You won't feel left out.

I like a nice young lady with class and style 
And when I'm with her she makes it worth my while.
You know that has to be 
Just the right girl for Ricky.
I like a nice young lady who likes to have fun 
So if you fit this description
I said, "Hey girl, don't hesitate. 
If you want me, I'll be your playmate."

I'm Ronnie D and I'd love to meet. 
A girl that would knock me off my feet. 
A girl that's fine and divine. 
A girl that wants to be all mine.
A girl that can grant my every wish 
Is the girl I want to love and cherish.
I promise you that if you are true. 
Tell me girl if it could be you.

You've heard the last. 
We're running out of time. 
But wait just a minute there's one last line.
Now listen to this 
And keep that in mind. 
And we're sure that this next rap 
Will blow your mind.

Yes, I like a girl that will stay with me. 
A girl that's a pretty sight to see.
A girl with style and much finesse. 
A girl that's smart and wants the best.
I like a girl with a pretty smile. 
A girl that stands out in a pile.
But most of all on top of all above. 
Ralph needs a girl that he can love. 

We came out before. 
Now we're back again.
Singin' the kinda girls we like 
Now is this the end
Now I'm sure you'll agree 
Our deep words are divine.
But if you fit the description , 
You'll do just fine fine fine fine fine fine
