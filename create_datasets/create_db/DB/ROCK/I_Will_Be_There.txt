A fight for king or country
Can liven any heart
To sleep beneath the open skies
A love affair can start
Echoes in the valley
As embers cross "red skies"
I'm calling from the mountain
Echoes of no reply

I will be there
Oh! When you call my name
I will be there
Oh! If you call my name...
I will be there

Listen to the silence
As shadows dance with me
A ticking clock of endless time
Clouds my memory
I'm calling from the mountains
Echoes of no reply.

I will be there
Oh! When you call my name
I will be there
Oh! If you call my name...
I will be there
