Oh, the world is hard to understand
It's better to forget now
Why was I left all alone
To fight the darkness that surrounds me?
Clouds in the upstairs
Clouds in the memory

I'm a headline
Non-existent person
I'm a shell with no name
I am no one
Family doesn't want me
No one comes to claim me
With scars on my forehead
Scars on my memory
I've got scars on my poor hands
Scars all over me
But I know who I am
I know, I mean, I think I should know
I think I should know who I am
I remember me

Because I am the daughter of a soldier
You won't see me crying
"Malenkaya" - that's what Papa called me
And, so I always will be
With clouds in the upstairs
Clouds in the memory
I've got clouds in the upstairs
Clouds in the memory
I've got clouds in the upstairs
But I still remember
I remember me
In the back of my head
In the middle of the night
