I sit and drink Prosecco 
Cause he said just let go 
He left me beggin' on my knees 
Please, go play some old piano 
Something that I know I like I hate ya 
You dirty filthy flea 

Please, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play 
Just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play 
Just get a bump for me, put my mind at ease, 
Bring the rest, my drink, my heart won't break 
Just play 

[Repeat: x8]
Let's play Le Bump

I sit and drink tequila, 
Say just how I feel-a, 
Like stupid people on TV 
How could you turn the channel? 
Tired of all the chatter? 
I hate this new "reality" 

Please, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play 
Just wanna bump, just wanna bump, just wanna bump, let's play 
Just get a bump for me, put my mind at ease, 
Bring the rest, my drink, I'm not afraid of all you said 
Just play 

Prosecco, just let go, Tequila, how I feel-a 

Le Bump 
[Repeat: x8]
Let's play Le Bump
