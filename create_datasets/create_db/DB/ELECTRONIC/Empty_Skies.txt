Look in my eyes, shocked with terror.
Paralizin', pull me over.
I'm so dumb, and your so clever.
Scrutinize, my best endeavor.
Come the day, when I will leave, at my pride. 
You will be.

Empty skies but a butterflies wings beat silent like air
Call us free by a promise torn, you said ill meet you there
Empty skies but a butterflies wings beat silent like air
Call us free by a promise torn, you said ill meet you there
Meet you there,
You know I'm there.

I left the sun in Africa
To be with you, to fly
Cross the oceans
Licking flame
Every movement
Speaks your name.
Come the day
When I will leave
At my pride
You will be

Empty skies but a butterflies wings beat silent like air
Call us free by a promise torn, you said ill meet you there
Empty skies but a butterflies wings beat silent like air
Call us free by a promise torn, you said ill meet you there
Meet you there,
You know I'm there.

Empty skies but a butterflies wings beat silent like air
Call us free by a promise torn, you said ill meet you there
Empty skies but a butterflies wings beat silent like air
Call us free by a promise torn, you said ill meet you there
Meet you there,
You know I'm there.
