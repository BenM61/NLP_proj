Sawing,
With my jaw tooth down.

Guarded,
Down upside frown.

I'm, I'm looking for a pill,
Something to ease my will,
A kick in the teeth.

You, You may not realize,
When it's done or why,
But it may be the best thing, it may be the best thing.
Oh and it may be the best thing.

Pulsing,
With a familiar pain.

A comfort,
From this disdain.
Grind away.

I'm, I'm looking for a thrill,
Something to ease my will,

You, You may not realize,
When it's done or why,

But it may be the best thing, it may be the best thing.
Oh and it may be the best thing.
