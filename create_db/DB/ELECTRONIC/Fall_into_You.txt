I've been losing leaving
Fooling, deceiving
I've been stealing, hiding
Calling, crying

I've been alone
I'd rather be in love
I'm gonna let it all go
And fall into you

I've been longing, searching
Wanting, hurting
I've been looking finding
Forgetting, reminding

I've been alone
I'd rather be in love
I'm gonna let it all go
And fall into you

Just want to let it all go
Falling for you
Falling into you
Falling into you

I've been living, learning
Relieving, returning
I've been talking, freeing
Loving, being

I've been alone
I'd rather be in love
I'm gonna let it all go
And fall into you

Just want to let it all go
Falling for you
Fall into you falling for you fall into
