Oh follow me here
Oh follow me there
It's my kinda place
It's my kinda place

I've given up on everyone it seems
(ooooh)
Do I take hold and take our memories
(ooooh)

Bodies on the outside baby
Bodies on the inside baby

Is it something I said
Is it something I said
There's a lock in my heart
There's a line down my eye

I see the bodies lined up and I sleep
(ooooh)
I have survivors true have I
(woah)

I'm sick of feeling this way
My body's ok
You only give what you can
To my emotions

Bodies on the outside baby
Bodies on the inside baby
Bodies on the outside baby
Bodies on the inside baby

Calling out
Calling out for you
Calling out
I'm calling out for you

Bodies on the outside baby
Bodies on the inside baby
Bodies on the outside baby
Bodies on the inside baby

(woah)
I'm sick of feeling this way
My body's ok
You only give what you can
To my emotions

I'm sick of feeling this way
My body's ok
You only give what you can
To my emotions

I'm sick of feeling this way
My body's ok
(i'm free to love, I'm free to love on the inside)
You only give what you can
To my emotions
(i'm free to love, I'm free to love on the outside)

I'm sick of feeling this way
My body's ok
(i'm free to love, I'm free to love on the inside)
You only give what you can
To my emotions
(i'm free to love, I'm free to love on the outside)
