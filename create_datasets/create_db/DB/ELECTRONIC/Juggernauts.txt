And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'Cause I do not think we're invincible

crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path

Now don't get me wrong, I love what you done with the place
I just wish we had a chance to help build it
Instead of just moving into this home of disrepair
And expect it to work, prosper and then share

Constantly relying on consuming to feel content
But only because we lost such with this home that we've spent
Trillions of dollars paying for our wants and not our needs
And now we're growing tired of planting bleary-eyed seeds

And I'm not saying that we could do better
But given the chance we'd try
We dig up the earth's not won soil
And feel the drench with greedy eyes

And I'm not saying that we could do better
But given the chance we'd try

And feel the drench with greedy eyes
Imagine

Switch

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another juggernaut

Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path

What the hell, what happened now?
I really don't know, man

We'll do what we've always done
Shut our eyes and hope for the best
No, we're gonna face this
And step out onto the tracks
Stare it right in the face
Thou shall not pass

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'cause I do not think we're invincible

Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I think that it is a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another juggernaut

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm think that it's a sign
And I do not think we're invincible

And I hope that we've still got time
'cause I do not think we're invincible
