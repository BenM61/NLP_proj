My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front
I'm real when I shop my face

Artificial bloom
Hydroponic skin
Chemical release
Synthesize the real
Plastic surgery
Social dialect
Positive results
Documents of life

Oh
Nana nana nana nana
Nana nana nana nana na
Na na na na na
Na nana nana

My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front
I'm real when I shop my face

Scalpel, lipstick, gel
Action, camera, lights
Violence in your heart
Memories of love (what?)
Professor?

Oh
Nana nana nana nana (hold it)
Nana nana nana nana na
Na na na na na
Na nana nana

My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front
I'm real when I shop my face

So you must be the one
That I've seen in my dreams
Come on, touch me
Set my spirit free
Oh, test me
Do you feel what I feel?
Do you see what I see?
Oh, reduce me to nothingness
Yes, yes

My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front
I'm real when I shop my face

And you know what I want
My face is the front of shop
So give me what I want
My face is the real shop front
I said everything I want
My shop is the face I front
So give me what I want
I'm real when I shop my face

And you know what I want
My face is the front of shop
So give me what I want
My face is the real shop front
I said everything I want
My shop is the face I front
So give me what I want
I'm real when I shop my face
