All attempts have failed
All my heads are tails
She's got teary eyes
I've got reasons why
I'm losing ground
And gaining speed
I've lost myself
Or most of me
I'm ready for the final precipice

But you haven't lost me yet
No, you haven't lost me yet
I'll sing until my heart caves in
No, you haven't lost me

These days pass me by
I dream with open eyes
Nightmares haunt my days
Visions blur my nights
I'm so confused
What's true or false
What's fact or fiction after all
I feel like I'm an apparition's pet

But you haven't lost me yet
You haven't lost me yet
I'll run until my heart breaks in
No, you haven't lost me yet
Oh, oh, yeah

If it doesn't break
If it doesn't break
Yeah, if it doesn't break your heart it isn't love
Now if it doesn't break your heart it's not enough
It's when you're breaking down with your insides coming out
It's when you find out what your heart is made up of

And you haven't lost me yet
No, you haven't lost me yet
I'll sing until my heart caves in
No, you haven't lost me yet
