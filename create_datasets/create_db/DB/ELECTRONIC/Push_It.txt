Corrosive
Tainted by my sin
I'm spilling blood
And I can hardly contain it
Corrosive
Hallowing the hand
Stiffened
I eat away
Eat
Eat into the surface

Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it

Explosive
More violent more violent
All consuming
Throbbing
Straight to the circle
Explosive
Move on reaction
I slow it down
I slow it
Down down down down

Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it

I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it

My mind is corrosive
I trip on corrosive
I freak
See through me
My eyes are explosive
I feed on it
Black out
Crucify me

Yeah, you push it
