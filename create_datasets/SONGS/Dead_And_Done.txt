Heaven is a place where people die pretty
Skies don't lie and there's cash in the kitty
Running from the rocks, there's water for the lips
To ease your mouth and bathe your fist

There's no need for trouble when the roads are down
Nobody's out of work cause the mine's in town
The circus has been here twice already
My throwing arm is good and my heart is steady

I'm dead and I'm done by the heat of the sun
And I'll rest my hat in a Autumn field
And I'll hang my hat in a Autumn field
In a Autumn field

Tell my mama not to worry
The food is sweet and the weather's been sunny
And I'm well known here round about
The local pick pocket is a lay-about

Tell my daddio there's no need for washing
They do it in your sleep when you're not watching
I've already had the neighbors here
Johnny Cash came around and we split a beer

I'm dead and I'm done by the heat of the sun
And I'll rest my hat in a Autumn field
And I'll hang my hat in a Autumn field
In a Autumn field

The girls up here sure look swell
They sing like birds
I hear it's nothing like hell
The local priest says there's no need for cheatin'
The local wags call it meetin' and a-greetin'

I'm dead and I'm done by the heat of the sun
And I'll rest my hat in a Autumn field
And I'll hang my hat in a Autumn field
