This one's for the girls that like to lose their minds
They hit rewind and then they lose their minds
Hey, this one's for a girl that keeps me up all night
She's working overtime, my heart's working overtime

So hey girl, hey girl, why you hesitate, girl?
'Cause I gotta see pretty and it's right by me tonight, tonight
Wait girl, wait girl, why you complicate, girl?
I got money in my pocket and I kinda wanna blow it tonight, tonight

So if I lose my head tonight
Don't forget to tell the morning light
To wake, wake me up, up, up in time
And do it all over again, do it all over again

Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again.

Let's go to a place we've never been before
I wanna see it all so let's see it all
Can't stop, won't stop till we've seen the freaking world
It's just outside the door so what you waiting for?

So hey girl, hey girl, why you hesitate, girl?
'Cause I gotta see pretty and it's right by me tonight, tonight
Wait girl, wait girl, why you complicate, girl?
I got money in my pocket and I kinda wanna blow it tonight, tonight

So if I lose my head tonight
Don't forget to tell the morning light
To wake, wake me up, up, up in time
And do it all over again, do it all over again
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again.

Let's go, let's do it again
We've got time, let's sleep every other weekend
Let go, put your hands up higher
And higher and higher

Hold on if you feeling the love
Baby, take another second just to dial it up
Hit play, rewind, turn back in time
We start the night till the sunrise

So if I lose my head tonight
Don't forget to tell the morning light
To wake, wake me up, up, up in time
And do it all over again, do it all over again

Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again.

We do it all over again.
