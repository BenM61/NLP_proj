Is it alright if I come 'round
Is it too late if I come now
Would you stay up to figure this out
Some way
If I stay here would you come back
If I stay cool would you be mad
Would you want me if I want you
That way

'Cause all I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming o- coming over

Isn't it strange, oh oh oh, isn't strange, oh oh oh, isn't is strange, oh oh oh
Isn't it strange that every time
I look at your name I'm suddenly high
For you to feel the same I would do almost anything
I'd give away this, give away that
All of my shoes and all of my hats
All I need's you and a bit of music

'Cause all I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming o, coming over

Isn't it strange, oh oh oh, isn't strange, oh oh oh, isn't is strange, oh oh oh, isn't it strange, oh oh oh
'Cause all I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming over
All I can think about is coming over, coming o-, coming over
