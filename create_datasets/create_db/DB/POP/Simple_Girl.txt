She's a simple girl.
She's governed by simple pleasures.
She wont ever let you meet her family, 
But she'll show you pictures.

She's a simple girl
And she's got simple emotions.
She wont ever let you in, 
But she wants to keep you in her corner.

I'm always looking for some kind of sadness,
Something more than this. 

She's a simple girl
And she's got simple feelings.
No one ever let her know that she could get it out her heart, now
