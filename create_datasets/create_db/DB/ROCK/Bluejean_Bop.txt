Bluejean baby
With your big blue eyes 
Don't want you looking
At other guys 
Got to make you give me
One more chance 

I can't keep still, so baby let's dance!

Well the bluejean bop is the bop for me 
It's the bop that's done in a dungaree 
You dip your hip, free your knee 
Squeal on your heel baby, one-two-three 
Well, the bluejean bop, bluejean bop, oh baby!
Bluejean bop, bluejean bop, oh baby! 
Bluejean bop, baby won't you bop with Gene?
Bop, Blue Caps, Bop!

Well, bluejean baby when I bop with you 
Well, my heart starts a-hoppin' like a kangaroo 
My feet do things they never done before 
Well, bluejean baby, give me more more more 
Well, the bluejean bop, bluejean bop, oh baby!
Bluejean bop, bluejean bop, oh baby! 
Bluejean bop, baby won't you bop with Gene? 
Rock it again, Blue Caps, Go!

Well, the bluejean bop, bluejean bop, oh baby!
Bluejean bop, bluejean bop, oh baby! 
Bluejean bop, baby won't you bop with Gene? 
Blue Caps, bop with Gene, now, Let's go!

Well, it's bluejean, bluejean bop
Bluejean bop, bluejean bop, oh baby! 
Bluejean, bluejean bop
Bluejean, bluejean bop
Bluejean, baby won't you bop with Gene?
