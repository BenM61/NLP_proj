I think I'm alright
I think it's not a good day to die today
You know I feel like flying
Anywhere fast, fucking far away
And where the stars all shine
I hope that I can be like that, baby
Because I feel like dying
Is every little thing in it's natural place yeah

I think of my life
About every little thing in my life to date
And everything that's mine
Was I the big boss still nothing came to me
You know the moon's so bright
Like every little thing that you said baby
And kiss kiss alright
I'ma holdin' out my hand let me see your face yeah

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing

This aint my fight
Everybody wanna little piece of bread
And yeah you look so fine
Yeah but everybody thinks that you better than
You know you get so high
8 in the morning just goin' to bed
And now your hands are tied
No one made you do it blue white and red yeah

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing

I'm gonna take what's mine
Everybody thinks I belong to them
But this shit worldwide
Going round a circle on a silver jet
Her reality bites
You broke a little promise and I understand
You gon' be alright
I see a winter band we can do it again yeah

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
