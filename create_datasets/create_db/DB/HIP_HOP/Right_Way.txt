Thinking back to the time when I was so into you
I thought that I knew it all
My perception of love was it was something to do
But I didn't expect the fall

I understand your feelings now
I know I must have let you down
But I wonder would you be around

If I loved you the right way
Loved you the right way
I would have put that smile upon your face
And loved you the right way

Never thought that I'd thank you for the hurt and the pain
And the changes it put me through
Guess I needed to look at my intentions again
I didn't give enough to you

My mind has never been so clear
And I feel my happiness is near
But I wonder would you still be here

If I loved you the right way
Cause you deserve the right way
I should have put that smile upon your face
I should have kept you in my warm embrace
And loved you the right way

Sometimes love is so mistaken
Simple values pushed aside
Modern love is just a ride
And when it's over no one seems to care

If I ever find myself with someone new
I'll remember what I learned from you

I will love her the right way
Love her the right way
I will put that smile upon her face
I will keep her warm in my embrace

I will love you baby
Gonna make each day a better day
I'm never gonna sacrifice her needs
I will love her the right way

I'm gonna love you baby
