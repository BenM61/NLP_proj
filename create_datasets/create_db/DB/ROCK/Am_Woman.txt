American Woman, stay away from me 
American Woman, mama let me be 
Don't come a hangin' around my door 
I don't want to see your face no more 
I got more important things to do 
Than spend my time growin' old with you 
Now Woman, I said stay away 
American Woman, listen what I say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay 

American Woman, get away from me 
American Woman, mama let me be 
Don't come a knockin' around my door 
Don't want to see your shadow no more 
Coloured lights can hypnotize 
Sparkle someone else's eyes 
Now Woman, I said get away 
American Woman, listen what I say-ay-ay-ay 

American Woman, said get away 
American Woman, listen what I say 
Don't come a hangin' around my door 
Don't want to see your face no more 
I don't need your war machines 
I don't need your ghetto scenes 
Coloured lights can hypnotize 
Sparkle someone else's eyes 
Now Woman, get away from me 
American Woman, mama let me be 

Go, gotta get away, gotta get away now go, go, go 
I 'm gonna leave you woman 
Gonna leave you woman 
Bye-bye Bye-bye Bye-bye Bye-bye 
You 're no good for me 
I 'm no good for you 
Gonna look you right in the eye 
Tell you what I 'm gonna do 
You know I 'm gonna leave 
You know I 'm gonna go 
You know I 'm gonna leave 
You know I 'm gonna go-o, woman 
I 'm gonna leave you woman 
Goodbye American Woman 
Goodbye American chick
