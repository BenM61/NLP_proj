Don't get me started on what it means to be alive
You're lying to yourself and then you still act surprised
'Cause you're scared
Can't come to terms with what you are
The wolves in sheep's clothin' will only lead you so far

You'll wait and they'll go
'Cause in the end, we all end up alone
So just wait, you'll know

Forget everything just for tonight
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
'Cause I've been waiting for tonight to sing (whoa, whoa)

I rely on myself, just making sure that was clear
I'm not in need of your crutches
I've faced all my fears and I won what I knew I could have
Life is not a punchcard
Make the best of what you have, but don't wait
Just go and when you find yourself, please let me know
It's not too late, just let go

Forget everything just for tonight
And I will sing like everyone when they're alone
'Cause I've been waiting for tonight to sing whoa whoa
Let's believe that if we all stand together
We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once I'm doing something right, when we sing whoa whoa

In the end it's not about what you have
In the end it's all about where you wanna go
And the roads you take to help you get there
I hope you think that's fair
'Cause you only got one life to lead
So don't take for granted those little things
Those little things are all that we have

Forget everything just for tonight
And I will sing like everyone when they're alone
'Cause I've been waiting for tonight to sing whoa whoa
Let's believe that if we all stand together
We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once I'm doing something right, when we sing whoa whoa

For tonight we'll forget everything (everything)
'Cause I've been waiting for tonight to sing whoa whoa
