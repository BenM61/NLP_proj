Hey little shorty (Yeah, I'm watching you)
Can we get naughty? (Flying high)
While we keep creeping (I'm the bird of prey)
Let him keep sleeping (Here I come baby)

He leaves you every night
He doesn't do you right
How could he jeopardize?
There's hawks up in the sky, whoa

And like a bird of prey
My vision can sense the night
From miles away
Like a shadow of my love for you

Hey little shorty
I'm stalking you, I'm watching
Can we get naughty?
I'm your black hawk in the window
While we keep creeping?
I'm swooping through your window
Let him keep sleeping
I'm you're black hawk in the window

You got so pretty eyes
So dark and so sexy
They tantalize
In the midnight sky
I'll give you wings to expand
That will take you high
To get away from the vulture

And like a bird of prey
My vision can sense the night
From miles away
Like a shadow of my love for you

Hey little shorty
I'm stalking you, I'm watching

I'm your black hawk in the window
While we keep creeping?
I'm swooping through your window
Let him keep sleeping
I'm you're black hawk in the window

Hey little shorty

While we keep creeping?

Let him keep sleeping
I'm you're black hawk in the window

[Repeat: x2]
Black hawk, black hawk
Black hawk, black hawk
Black hawk, black hawk
Black hawk, black hawk

And like a bird of prey
My vision can sense the night
From miles away
Like a shadow of my love for you
