No one's ever held me like you hold me
No one's ever touched me in this way
But I'm not runnin' anymore
Never felt this way before

[Chorus]
All of my love I will give to you
All of my dreams will be comin' true
In the heat of a tangled kiss
Say you will and I promise you this
All of my love I will give to you
All that I ask is you love me too
Take a look, I'm never far behind
Turn around and gimme gimme gimme a sign

I will put my feelings into one place
Center my emotions on your face
I could spend a lifetime sharin' night time
'Cause when you're lyin close to me
Somethin' tells me that you need

[Chorus]

So, be my lover, be my friend
Say this love will never end
Want no other in my life
Our forever starts tonight
All of my love
Oh yes

[Chorus]
