Same old shit, dog, just a different day (It is not a fucking game)
You know how niggas do when we play how we play 
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do 
If it's f*ck me, nigga, you know it's f*ck you 

I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand (Uh) 
Hit him with work 'cause, yo, that's my little man (Uh-huh) 
He asked a few questions 'bout the game, and I told him (Yeah) 
So when he made a bad move, it was my place to scold him (Aight) 
Never told him nothin' wrong, kept it fair 
Didn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin' to the air (Damn) 
Everybody makes mistakes, a mistake is aight 
But if it ain't, I'm a tell you straight, time to say goodnight 
Nobody likes to be played regardless of the relationship 
But shorty's fuckin' up big time, I hate this shit
I'm caught in the middle of havin' love for a lil' nigga 
And knowin' what's expected of me as a real nigga (Damn) 
My next move is crucial, what do I do? 
How do I keep it real with shorty and my crew? 
Didn't want to kill him, so instead of puttin' the Mac on him 
I did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him (Aight) 

Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day 
Here we go again
You know how niggas do when we play how we play 
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do 
Here we go again
So if it's f*ck me, nigga, then you know it's f*ck you 

Niggas that I f*ck wit' want to get him dead 
But I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live 
Under normal circumstances, he would be a marked man 
But I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand (Oh) 
Go about your business, do what you gonna do (Uh) 
Be what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through (Aight) 
I can forgive, I just can't forget
You're on your own, lil' man, don't ask me for shit (No)
If you paid attention to what I taught you, then you good (Uh)
If I see you again, forget it, understood? 
Go 'head before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead 
"I just wanted to say" Ah! Go 'head! 
Instinct told me to kill him, but the savior is 
I'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor (Hmm) 
But I also knew the decision I just made (Yeah) 
Went against the rules of the game that we played (Damn) 

Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day 
Here we go again
You know how niggas do when we play how we play 
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do 
Here we go again
So if it's f*ck me, nigga, then you know it's f*ck you 

I should have followed my first instinct 'cause I knew 
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do 
Now this nigga's fuckin' with the competition (What) 
Ungrateful motherfucker, shoulda got him missin' (What) 
This nigga got the nerve to take my kindness for a weakness 
Gots ta get back on some street shit so I can creep this 
Rat, when I act, take one, set him up, to take two 
Get him there, take three, get him done 
Wasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him 
Bzt, click, there is a bullet in one of them 
Feelin' lucky? Click, looks like you are 
Click, click, click, luck ain't goin' too far 
What you did was throw on another pair of shoes 
And they just happened to be too big 
What you did was stupid (damn), real fuckin' stupid (Aight) 
Well, shorty, I gave you a chance, and what did you do? 
Threw it back in my fuckin' face, so f*ck you too! Aight

Here we go again
