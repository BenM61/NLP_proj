I've looked all around this
Big old world and found that
All I really want is love

Nothing can compare
This world I've had my share of
All I really want is love

In this life of chasing dreams
Such strife in seeking schemes
Designed for happiness

Now I finally realized
Deep underneath my lies
All I really want is love.

I've had twice my share
From fortune to despair now
All I really want is love

Nothing satisfies this
World won't compromise me
All I really want is love
