There's only one [x4]
You're the only one [x2]

My baby he's the perfect ten (perfect ten)
He punches in at nine
Eight the breakfast that I made for him
Hops in the seven

He gets six figures
When he gets off at five
I'm what he's hungry for
Three little letters and I'm in the mood (in the mood)

And he's the only man that I give it to
If ya man don't be stressing ya
Need to count ya blessings
Ladies let me see them hands now
Help me with this count down.

[Chorus]
Ten, so many reasons why I stick with you
Nine and my body adore you cause of the things you do
Eight, I want you here with me, seven days of the week, six if I let you go I'm a fool, because boy 
There's Only one you, five said I never wanna let you go thats from my heart, four ever and ever Just to be 
With you thats what I want, three no I never wanna leave your love is too good to me, two, there's Never a wrong you can do,thats why theres only one you

I count the seconds till he's at the door
I kissed his lips at least a thousand times before,
Still get that feeling
My knees get to trembling (my)

My head start to spinning
He's one and a million to me
And he don't have to say a word (don't say a word)
When he gets me with a dozen red roses I
Know I got a winner, so if you got a winner, ladies let me see ya hands now
Help me with this count down.

[Chorus]

Cant see me
Without you by my side
So many reasons why
I'm your girl and your my guy

Your all I need
All I need to get by
Like method man and Mary Blige
You don't have to wonder why

[Chorus]
