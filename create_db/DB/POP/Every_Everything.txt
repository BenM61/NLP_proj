I've got something she wants
She's got something I need
Got a lock on my heart
She's got the key

Softly spoken words of love
These are what she said to me
Honey be a man 
Get off your knees

Every heartbeat
Every movement
Every moment
Every sigh
Every heartbeat
Every movement
Every moment
Every sigh
Every everything

Something in my heart
Something in my arms
Fell in love with your
Possessive charms

Softly spoken words of love
This is what she said to me
Got a lock on my heart
And she's got the key

Every heartbeat
Every movement
Every moment
Every sigh
Every heartbeat
Every movement
Every moment
Every sigh
Every everything

Whaa, whaa

Every heartbeat
Every movement
Every moment
Every sigh
Every heartbeat
Every movement
Every moment
Every sigh
Every heartbeat
Every movement
Every moment
Every sigh
Every heartbeat
Movement
Moment
Every sigh
Every everything
