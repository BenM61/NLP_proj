Looking out my window.
Staring through the pain.
I can't see the rainbow for the rain.
Someday I'll forget you.
Life goes on, they say;
But they don't know what's standing in my way. 

There's a wall of tears that I got to get over.
Got to stop thinking of you;
Got to learn not to love you.
I know the sun will shine,
I'm gonna be fine, but until then:
The rain's gonna fall just like a wall of tears.

Another morning finds me
Still not over you,
Just another day to stumble through.
Nights go on forever,
I've got nothing but time;
Even time can't mend this heart of mine.

There's a wall of tears that I got to get over.
Got to stop thinking of you;
Got to learn not to love you.
I know the sun will shine,
I'm gonna be fine, but until then:
The rain's gonna fall just like a wall of tears.

They're gonna fall like a wall of tears.
Oh, oh, gonna fall.
Fall, fall, fall, like a wall of tears.
