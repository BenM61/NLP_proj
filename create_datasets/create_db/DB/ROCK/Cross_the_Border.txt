So dangerous
Like freedom she fades away
The vision that chains the heart
Foundations that fall apart

Well, I know this place

(east, west
Points to the nation
North, south
Cut the connection)

Stealer
Steal her
We cross the border
Steal love
Still life
We cross the border

And time builds the wall
The wall that is standing still
And she breaks the spell
The spell that may hold us all
You build stone by stone
The line that will last for so long
But for those who dare
Her secret is safe with no one

Well, I know this place

(east, west
Points to the nation
North, south
Cut the connection)

Stealer
Steal her
We cross the border
Steal love
Still life
We cross the border

(east, west
Points to the nation
North, south
Lines of persuasion break
(east, west
Points to the nation
North, south
Cut the connection, break)
