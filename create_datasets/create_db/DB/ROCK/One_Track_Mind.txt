Love is like problems
We all got 'em

A dark night, remember
The sunrise, surrender
There isn't any other way
There isn't any other way
Hands tied, remember
It's suicide to surrender
There isn't any other way
There isn't any other way

I have a one track mind
I have a one track mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one track mind, ooh

The sex and lies, remember
Look in my eyes, surrender
There isn't any other way
There isn't any other way
Outta luck, outta time
Outta sight, I'm outta mind
Mind

I have a one track mind
I have a one track mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one track mind, ooh

Rode around town, I made it official now
Think about you every now and again
There's the times, spend days runnin' with you, girl
On my downtime, lockin' in
Take a ride around downtown
I'm not in the rain time
Come alive in the nighttime
Wasn't the right state
Wasn't the right mind
Love is like problems
We all got 'em
How come when you stop poppin'
Everybody problems
Come your problems
Let me cry about it
Ain't my problems
Ain't my fault, Mr. Kells with the shakka
Heard it's only 30 seconds 'til Mars
Then it take you even less just to get to my heart

I have a one track mind
Method to the madness
One track mind
Method to the madness
One track mind
Method to the madness
One track mind
