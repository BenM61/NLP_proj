Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

If you're askin' me to say
Livin' life without you, girl, is alright
If you really want to know
I'd have to say it's dangerous to my mind

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Let me love you all the time
Lady, love me

Yes, I'm askin' you to stay
Remembering it used to be so right
If you're askin' for the truth
I'd have to say I won't believe it's goodnight

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me all the time
Lady, love me

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me all the time
Love me, lady, all the time

Let me love you one more time
Hold me closer, now you're mine
Lady, love me one last time
Love me, lady
Oh, love me, lady

Oh, oh, oh, oh

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me one last time
Lady, love me (Love me, lady, all the time)

Let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me all the time
Lady, love me (Love me, lady, now you're mine)

Let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
