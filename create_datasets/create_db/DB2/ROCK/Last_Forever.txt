Can we stay awake
And lay the day to waste forsake these bones
Hopelessly abandoning our phones 
To watch the clouds awake over the homes
Of people we won't ever know (ever know)

'Cause nothing is bigger and brighter than this
Yeah, I could tell you that we won't exist
And here is the last dance, trying to admit that I should let you go

Love, don't feel it could last forever
Love, I'm ready to let you know
Love, don't feel it could last forever
Love, I'm ready to let you go

Can we stay alight
Reignite these embers just for one more night
Never to grow old if we just frame it right
So much for foresight in this last dance 
Trying to admit that I should let this go

Love, don't feel it could last forever
Love, I'm ready to let you know
Love, don't feel it could last forever
Love, I'm ready to let you go

Ready to let you know (you know)
Ready to let you go (you go)
Ready to let you go

Can we stay awake
Can we stay awake
Can we stay awake
Can we stay awake

Love, don't feel it could last forever (forever)
Love, I'm ready to let you know (ready to let you know)
Love, don't feel it could last forever (ready to let you go)
Love, I'm ready to let you go

Ready to let you go (you go)
Ready to let you know (you know)
Ready to let you go (you go)
Ready to let you know
Ready to let you know
Ready to let you go (you go)
Ready to let you know
This feeling won't last forever, forever
