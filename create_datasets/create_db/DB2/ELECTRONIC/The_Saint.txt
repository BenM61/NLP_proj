I had an icon that glowed in the dark
With psychotropic eyes and a plastic heart
I had a guru, one vision, one dream
I saw the ides of March and they were looking back at me

Give me unto love
Give me unto truth
Give me unto love
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
The saint of the sonic groove

I have prayed to the invisible man
Hoping for a stake in the promised land
I kissed the feet of blessed Mary Magdalene
Wishing all the time that she would set me free

Give me unto love
Give me unto truth
Give me unto love
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
The saint of the sonic groove

I have flown through the cosmic pale
I found the sound that was my holy grail
I rode the beat; I rode the drone
'Cause I am your pilgrim and I'm coming home

Give me unto love
Give me unto truth
Give me unto love
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
I'm praying to the saint
The saint of the sonic groove
