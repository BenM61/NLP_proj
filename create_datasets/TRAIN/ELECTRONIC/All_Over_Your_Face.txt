Call,

Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Is it all over my face?
You've caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Passed out in a shady hotel room
With a hooker faced down in the restroom
The cockroaches in hypnosis
Sippin' what's left of spilled mimosas

That hotel was so cheap
I should've brought my own sheets
He wanted it and I wanted to
What's left to do I paid for the room

I'm greasy, grimey, two-timey
Butt-sniffing animal
And if I want it I get it
I'll eat that ass like a cannibal

I don't care If you think I'm dirty
I am dirty, learn me
I masturbated till my KY faded
Unh, I'm exhausticated

It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste
Go to town now

It's all over your face
Tell me baby how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste

Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Is it all over my face?
You've caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Baby, its all over your face
Looks like you've been eating paste
I came too close in your direction
DNA on your complexion

I don't care if you scream
My neighbors are all asleep
My thong on the floor
When I close the door
But I left open the screen

Your exact words were rock me
And so I did some bukkake, don't stop me
Lock your legs in that position
Ducktape on your mouth so listen

Ease on out and then I want in
If you didn't why'd you call me
You got me under you skin
On your skin I could come again

It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste
Put it down now

It's all over your face
Tell me baby how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste

Is it all over my face? (it's all over your face)
I'm in love dancing
Is it all over my face? (tell me how does it taste)
I'm in love dancing

Is it all over my face? (it's all over your face)
You've caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face? (tell me how does it taste)
I'm in love dancing

Call, my face, why'd you call me,
My face, it's all over my face
Call, my face, my face.
