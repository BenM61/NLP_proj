They held their heads with laughs of pain
They learned from men who'd just refrain
From glancing at a mirror's face

Seven screaming diz-busters
Who lurked behind the rose
Cast iron for a bloodstream
And ice behind their eyes

On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer the light, the light

They're long so long this time of year
When stars be crossed by twirling fear
You don't suppose I'd prove surprised

Well seven screaming diz-busters
Should go the route and die
Without warmth they've learned to crave
With hardened smiles and evil signs

Bury me near the secret cave
So they'll not know the way
Bury me there behind the rose
So they'll not rile my grave
I'll not reveal whose name's still lost

Well their laughs of pain, ah, ha, ha, ha!
And their harder smiles
And their rigid arms
And their evil signs
The longer days and the longer nights
Yeah the longer
They're longer still

On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer the light

Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
I can't stand the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light (one)
Lucifer the light (two)
Lucifer the light (three)
Lucifer the light (four)
Lucifer the light (five)
Lucifer the light (six)
Lucifer the light (and seven)
