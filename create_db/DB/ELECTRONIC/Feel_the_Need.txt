See how I'm walking 
See how I'm talking 
Notice everything in me 
Feel the need 
Oh feel, feel the need in me 
I need you by my side 
To be my guide 
Can't you see my arms are open wide 
Feel the need 
Oh feel, feel the need in me 

I need your love 
Everyday I need 
Love 
Everyday I want 
Love 
Without your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die 
I need your love 
I need it constantly 
Love 
Your love takes care of me 
Love 
Your love is better to me than apple pie 

Just put your hand in mine 
Love me all the time 
The proof you will plainly see 
Feel the need 
Oh feel, feel the need in me 
I need your only kiss 
To my heart in bliss 
You make me what I need to be 
Feel the need 
Oh feel, feel the need in me 

I need you by my side 
To be my guide 
Can't you see my arms are open wide 
Feel the need 
Oh feel, feel the need in me 

I need your love 
Everyday I need 
Love 
Everyday I want 
Love 
With out your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die 
I need your love 
I need it constantly 
Love 
Your love takes care of me 
Love 
Your love is better to me than cherry pie 

See how I'm walking 
See how I'm talking 
Notice everything in me 
Feel the need 
Oh feel, feel the need in me
