Elysium 
Is everyone chipping at your cordiality?
Elysium
You stand ice bound to the wind a casualty
(Eternity)
Elysium
Is everyone nagging at your reason to believe?
Elysium
You stare down from a mound with such hostility

Listen to me now wipe your eyes
Relax your hand and come inside
Lift back your head and swallow your pride
Don't be ashamed in me confide

Oh, I've seen you pretend
The happy go lucky, everything's funky
But in the end
Your manic obsession turns to depression

Elysium
Is everyone chipping at your cordiality?
Elysium
You stand ice bound to the wind a casualty

Stand back and watch the bright spark fly
To catch a glimpse don't blink an eye
The touchpaper wrapped around your soul has been lit
Let's go with the flow

Heaven
I'm in heaven
Heaven

Elysium
(Such a memory holds me)
Is everyone tugging at your idea to be free?
(Let me be)
Elysium
Do they cry out for your sensibility?
(Eternity)
Elysium
Is everyone chipping at your cordiality?
Elysium
You stand ice bound

To the wind a casualty 
To the wind a casualty 
To the wind a casualty 
To the wind a casualty 
To the wind a casualty
