Don't call me a zero
I'm going to be a hero
Like Phil Esposito or the Kennedy's
I'll be incorporated and I'll be imitated
And overrated but that doesn't bother me
All the jaws with drop
All the girls will scream
And there will commotion when I show up on the scene
All that you will see is a celebrity
All that you will see is a celebrity

When I'm riding in my limo
I won't look out the window
Might make me homesick for humanity
There's nowhere I can't go
And there's nobody I don't know
And there's an emptiness that's eating me
All the clocks will stop
And all the jeans will cream
It has always been my one and only dream
All that's left of me is my celebrity
All that's left of me is my celebrity

Leave your heart
Lay down your art
You're here for the party
Smile and wave
Try to behave
Be happy they've 
Made you a celebrity

I could disappear into the great unknown
And it would wear my face as if it were its own
And all that you will see is a celebrity
I will get in first and I will get in free
All that's left of me is my celebrity
