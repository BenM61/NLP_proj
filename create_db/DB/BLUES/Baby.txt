"Baby" is what he calls me
When we are all alone
"Baby" is what he calls me
'Cause he's mine, my own

"Baby" is what he calls me
When he is feelin' gay
"Baby", what he'll call me
Now and forever, I pray!

"Darling", "Dear" and "Honey"
May be alright with you
But to me this sounds so funny
Funny through and through!

"Baby" is what he calls me
When all the lights are low
"Baby", he will whisper
"I love you so!"

"Baby" is what he calls me
When all the lights are low
