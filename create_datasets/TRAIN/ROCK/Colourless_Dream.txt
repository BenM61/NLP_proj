I'm feeling in a shaky frame of mind
The look on my face, this is like a new beginning
Believing if I get it wrong this time
Floating in space I'll see the pieces spinning to the ground

When I dreamt a careless dream
There was nothing there to stop me
Now I see it on a screen
Such a careless (?) has shot me to the ground

On a screen I can see it now
A thousand pieces
I can see them falling down
