Midnight's calling 
Are you close behind? 
Midnight's calling 
Are you close behind? 

Trees without leaves an' notes that don't ring 
Wine left to rot an' a voice that can't sing 
An' hours of making love inside 
An a light that won't shine in the darkness 

Could I be any clearer? 
Could I speak any plainer?- I need you here 
Just to lead my way 
An' fall, fall, fall 

She'd scolded me for my sinful and wicked ways 
Towered above me, do you follow? 
And watched with concealed pleasure 
As I've ripped out my heart and said 
I'm bad, I just can't help it 
But I tr-tr-try to be good 

And trees without leaves an' notes that don't ring 
Wine left to rot an' a voice that can't sing 
An' hours of making love inside 
An a light that won't shine in the darkness 

Could I be any clearer? 
Could I speak any plainer? I need you here 
Just to lead my way 
An' fall, fall, fall 

There's people making lonely 
There's people making lonely sometime
