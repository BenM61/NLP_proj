See saw, up and down, around and round we go
Too late, we're out on the brink
Our love's in the sink washed up
And when I'm walking down a rainy street
I think I hear you calling out to me
But it's just an echo I've arranged to meet

Free fall we're out of control
We never will know what went wrong

Too bad what we had for a while
Has gone out of style this year

Your friends told me you moved out of town
I got your address and I wrote it down
I used the pen that you bought for my birthday
And every stroke, you know, reminded me of you
I realize that we'll never be together again

Wait a while reclaim your loss
But it costs a lot you'll learn
Take five it heals in time
You'll feel just fine they say but I feel it

See saw in a way I'm glad
Though I still feel sad about you

I know it's too late for changing minds
And I'm still not sure, I want to change mine
It's just a tiny part that says that this ain't right

See saw, up and down, around and round
They say it heals in time they say you'll feel just fine
In a way, I'm glad though I still feel sad about losing you
'Bout losing you, 'bout losing you once more
