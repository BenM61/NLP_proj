I know, I know, I'm a player
I stay with a pocket full of money
I'm a pro at getting paper so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I know U want that, I know U want that
I know U want that, get that money with me
I know U want that so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I'm swimming in cheddar, Gucci's all leaning on leather
Flying wherever, buying whatever, whenever
I'm the absolute truth, the bank account's the absolute proof
I'm skating on fools, you should see up under my roof

I'm the money go-getter, diamonds got the chains all lit up
When that G4 get up, land make the whole city shake up
Big Tuck's up in here, get buck up in here
Let me tell you something real, every stone VVS clear

Don't have time for them fakers, I been grinding for paper
I'm shining on haters, ten acres up in Jamaica
I'm a fool pimping, a animal for the dough
Professional with it, player, I already know

I know, I know, I'm a player
I stay with a pocket full of money
I'm a pro at getting paper so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I know U want that, I know U want that
I know U want that, get that money with me
I know U want that so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

Main squeeze, caramel, pretty face, track legs
Big crib, couple cars, several for chains, big bread
Blue slab, blue spokes, blueberry blue smoke
D-Town yep, yep, I rep that already bro

Play-N-Skillz, T-Town, T.P.G., D.S.R.
You ain't ever seen, now you looking at a Dallas star
Screens on bang on, top drop shag shown
Candy drip-drip-drip-drip, we get our money on

Thanks to Algierz, Red Monkeys, yeah, I'm strapped up
We ball for real bro, go ahead and get your stats up
Come on gal, shake that, big money make that
'Zilla on the big screen, I know them haters hate that

I know, I know, I'm a player
I stay with a pocket full of money
I'm a pro at getting paper so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I know U want that, I know U want that
I know U want that, get that money with me
I know U want that so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I'm seriously moving, the McLaren is cruising
I cannot be losing, supermodels I'm choosing
Let me tell you what's happening, ain't no faking or capping
When the music is slacking, I'm going back to that trapping

I'm all gorilla, keep fifth flawless glitter
The freeway splitter, inside all chinchilla
In the life of a winner, eat steak and lobster for dinner
Pulling up on some spinners, I make one hell of a contender

I'm so-so focused, no clowning on vocals
Look good on my posters, the yacht is the dopest
Getting money is sent to, better check my credentials
Overseas account, I'm presidential

I know, I know, I'm a player
I stay with a pocket full of money
I'm a pro at getting paper so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I know U want that, I know U want that
I know U want that, get that money with me
I know U want that so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I know, I know, I'm a player
I stay with a pocket full of money
I'm a pro at getting paper so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me

I know U want that, I know U want that
I know U want that, get that money with me
I know U want that so if you about your money
You should come and get that money with me
