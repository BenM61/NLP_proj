Sometimes I get a good feeling
I get a feeling that I never, never had before
And I got to tell you right now
I believe, I really do believe that

Something's got a hold on me
(Oh, it must be love)
Something's got a hold on me right now child
(Yeah, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I believe I'd die if I only could
I sure feel strange, but I sure feel good
I said, oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
Something's got a hold on me
(Oh, it must be love)
Something's got a hold on me right now child
(Yeah, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
I said, oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me
My heart was heavy when in misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me

I said oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)
Yeah he walks kike love
(Yeah he walks like love)
And he talks like love
(And he talks like love)
Makes me feel alright
(Makes me feel alright)
In the middle of the night
(In the middle of the night)
Na na na na!
