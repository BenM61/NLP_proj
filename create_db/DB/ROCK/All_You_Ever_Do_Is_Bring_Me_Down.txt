I can't sleep a wink anymore
Ever since you first walked out the door
Then I just started drinkin' to forget
But I don't think the worst has happened yet

All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's ?cause honey all you do is bring me down

It's funny how my whole world fell apart
I think I saw it coming from the start
I tried to tell myself that you'd be true
But I expected way too much of you
