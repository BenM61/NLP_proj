Your socks they smell, 
your feet they stink, 
You never take a bath. 
Your nose it runs, 
you bust your buns, 
You always finish last. 

Sick! (Sick) 
Of! (Of)
You. 
I'm so sick, so sick of you. 

Your face is gross, 
you eat white toast, 
You don't know what to do.
It's just your luck, 
you really suck, 
That's all 
I'm sick of you 

Sick! (Sick) 
Of! (Of)
You. 
I'm so sick, so sick of you. 

(Bring it down, I said bring it down! Thank you)
 Don't ya know? 
So sick of you. 
Things you say, and all the things you do. 
Things you say, and all the things you do. 
Things you say, and all the things you do. 
Things you say, and all the things you do. 
Things you say, and all the things you do. 
Things you say, and all the things you do. 

Sick! (Sick) 
Of! (Of)
You. 
I'm so sick, so sick of you. 

Sick! (Sick) 
Of! (Of)
You. 
I'm so sick, so sick of you. 

Sick! (Sick) 
Of! (Of)
You. 
I'm so sick, so sick of you. 

Human filth... Sick!
