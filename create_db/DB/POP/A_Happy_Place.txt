I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy place

Seven thousand eyes are watching
Marching home and no one’s touching
Army of the city workers
Secretaries, lawyers, brokers
Heading for a London station
Heading for a quick salvation
Oblivious to cherry cola
Trying to sell to every stranger

Stuck here it’s cold I’m standing
Hoping for some understanding
Only way to go is inside

I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy place

Seven thousand light years travel
Let my sense of time unravel
Trapped feelings are never ending
Send those weaknesses descending
Towards the earth’s red center
Let the fire rise and enter
Tap into the primal power
Rising like a giant tower

The energy receiving
Cut a hole right through the ceiling
People getting smaller as you fly

I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy
I’m going to find a happy place

(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy Place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place

Find a star, send down a beam to where you are
An elevator of light taking you somewhere
Where you’ll always be loved

I have found that stress and nonsense
Puts me in zone of avoidance
Could my mind be moving faster
Pulling like a super cluster
Can be hard to trust a feeling
But believing ends in seeing

We’re going to find a happy
We’re going to find a happy
We’re going to find a happy place

(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place
(I’m gonna find a happy place) A happy place
