It's a little to easy to live and learn,
But those breaks are scarce,
So take some time out,
To look back and see how you faired.

The right is always the wrong,
And the short's always the long,
The hardest thing about refrain,
Is now I can only save face.

To deny yourself is so true to form,
You spend most of your days wishing you were never born,
To deny yourself is so true to form,
You spend most of your days wishing you were never born.

face down in what you know,
Never come up for air,
Close the door,
I've had about as much as I can bare.

The right is always the wrong,
And the short's always the long,
The hardest thing about refrain,
Is now I can only save face.

To deny yourself is so true to form,
You spend most of your days wishing you were never born,
To deny yourself is so true to form,
You spend most of your days wishing you were never born.
