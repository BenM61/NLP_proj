Goodbye, I hate to see you go
But have a good time
So long, I'll miss you, dear I know
But have a good time

Have your flame began with your new love?
I'm setting you free
Dance and sing
Pretend that it's true love

Don't worry about me
I know the tears would only drive you farther away
Just go, forget that I'm alive
It's your holiday

When you're tired of being reckless and carefree
Remember that I'm waiting to welcome you home
So, you have a good time
