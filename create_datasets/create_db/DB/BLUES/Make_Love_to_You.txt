How could I explain
This feeling that's true
Honey I can hardly stand it
I want to make love to you

When the stars fall from the heavens
And the rivers have stopped to flow
If you just stop and talk to me
Honey that's when I know

I ain't gonna try and tell ya
How it's made me so blue
Sitting alone and wondering
I want to make love to you

Please stop and tell me
Tell me you want me too
Oh come on baby
I want to make love to you

I want to make love to you
I want to make love to you
I want to make love to you
I want to make love to you

When the stars fall from the heavens
And the rivers have stopped to flow
If you just stop and talk to me
Honey that's when I'd know

I want to make love to you
I want to make love to you
I want to make love to you
I want to make love to you

I want to make love to you
Uh come on baby
I want to make love to you
I want to make love to you
I can't stand it baby
Make love to you
I want to make love to you
Uh talk to me
I want to make love to you
