We call on Him whenever storm clouds gather
We call on Him to light our darkest day
Why must it be that only when we're lonely
And hopes are dim, we call on Him

Why don't we call on Him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank Him while we may

We call on Him when no one else will answer
We ask of Him a reason to go on
When our cup of joy becomes a cup of sorrow
Filled to the brim, we call on Him

Why don't we call on Him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank Him while we may
