Out of control 
Out of control 
Out of control 

Sometimes I fell that I misunderstood 
The rivers run and deep right through my thought 
Your naked body lying on the ground 
You always get me up when I'm down 

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time, 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
Out of control 

Maybe I'm just scared of losin' you 
Or maybe it's the things you make me do 
It seems to me we both should hang around 
And raise the population of this town 

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time, 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

But it doesn't mean we're too far down the line 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

The record player keeps on turning round 
It could be stuck or maybe it's a sound 
All the time I should be there with you 
But maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth 
Or maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth 

And it always seems we're running out of time. 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

But it doesn't mean we're too far down the line 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

Could be that I'm just losing my touch 
Or maybe you think my mustache is too much 
Satellite is out of control 
But you and I are brothers of the soul 
And you and I will come in from the cold 

Out of control, out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control
