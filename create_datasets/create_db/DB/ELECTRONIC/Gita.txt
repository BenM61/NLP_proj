While we're staying
When I run out on you

I saw you falling
And burst like porcelain
Fragile and precious
Nothing broke a shard
We blew it all
We blew it all
We blew it all

While we're staying
When I run out on you

I saw you falling
And burst like porcelain
Fragile and precious
Nothing broke a shard
We blew it all
We blew it all
We blew it all
