(MH) 
I'm fresh as a daisy, hard as a rock 
Fit as a fiddle, proud as a cock 
Bright as a button, sly as a fox 
Shy as a violet and strong as an ox, 
Light as a feather, blind as a bat 
Mad as a hatter and nervous as a cat 
Sweet as a cookie, pure as a dove 
That means, Mister, I'm in love...! 

(JL)
I'm fresh as a daisy, tough as a stake 
Mean as a miser, low as a snake 
Scared as a rabbit, small as a might 
Gay as a meadowlark, high as a kite 
Wild as a tiger, drunk as a fool 
Sour as a lemon and stubborn as a mule 
Sharp as a razor, smooth as a glove 
That means, Mister, I'm in love...! 

(TB) 
I'm fresh as a daisy, quick as a flash 
Slow as a tortoise, mixed as a hash 
Fierce as a lion, meek as a lamb 
Hot as a poker and cold as a clam 
Dead as a doornail, dumb as a dolt 
Spry as a kitten, and frisky as a colt 
Good as an angel in heaven above 
That means, partner, I'm in love...! 

(MH) 
I'm fresh as a daisy, red as a beet 

(JL) 
Green as a golf course, white as a sheet 

(TB) 
Raw as an oyster, swung as a gait 

(MH)
Mild as a cigarette, it sure tastes great! 

(JL)
Foggy as London, rough as a buss 

(TB) 
Solid as a stonewall and ornery as a cuss 

(MH) 
Blue as the sky in the heaven up above 
That means, Mister, 

(JL) 
that's all, brother, 

(TB)
That's right, partner, 

(Altogether)
We're in love!
