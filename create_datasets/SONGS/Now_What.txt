When I left and I said goodbye
Did you know that I meant it that time?
I guess that I didn't quite realize
What I was saying goodbye to just yet

The only asphalt
To pave my away
That was you

And damn it if I didn't try to do everything that I was supposed to
And now what do I do now?
I don't know
Cause I'm still leaving
Now who's gonna save me next time?
Oh, not you for the first time

The road to get to the other side of your rainbow
It wasn't for me, I guess
I couldn't live, not according to your path
Not happily, at least

And damn it if I didn't try to do everything that I was supposed to
And now what do I do now?
I don't know
Cause I'm still leaving
Now who's gonna save me next time?
Oh, not you for the first time

Somehow I'll be alright
Somehow I'll be alright
