What ever have I done 
My only crime was love 
I'm banished into darkness 
Oh I'm afraid bewildered and amazed 

Where ever will I go 
How ever will I know 
Lost and gone for ever 
Oh I Feel so sad 
This feeling huting bad 

To all I've left behind 
I din't mean to be unkind 
I'm sorry 

Falling, falling into space 
Falling into space 
Falling into time 

Falling, falling into space 
Falling into space 
Falling into time 

I've got to say good-bye 
Before I break and cry 
I'll miss you all so badly 
I've never been alone 
I wish that I were home 

Falling, falling into space 
Falling into space 
Falling into time
