These arms of mine, they are lonely
Lonely and feeling blue

These arms of mine, they are yearning
Yearning from wanting you

And if you would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I will be

These arms of mine, they are burning
Burning from wanting you

These arms of mine, they are wanting
Wanting to hold you

And if you would let them hold you
Oh how grateful I will be

Come on, come on baby
Just be my little woman
Just be my lover, oh

I need me somebody, somebody to treat me right, oh
I need your arms, loving arms to hold me tight

And I, I, I need your, I need your tender lips, to hold me
Together when I'm right with you
