I'm going back to see my girl
I hope it's all the same as then

I'm going back to see my girl
I hope it's all the same as then

Confusion, pardon the intrusion
This must not be the room I was in the other night
Confusion, an optical illusion, you see, you see
The number's the same as then
The color's the same as then
But something just isn't really right

Retrace your steps and see what happens, happens
Right from the doorway to your home
Back to your lonely room with
Only confusion
Was that her (yes, yes it was)
Was that him (yeah, yeah it was)
The girl was familiar but he wasn't me, no

Confusion, you think you know where you stand
But you're not even standing, you're flat on shaky ground
No clue then, and everything you knew then
Was only true in specialized cases, yes, in specialized cases
But in your case it wasn't true at all

Retrace your steps and see what happens, happens
Back to the day when you were born
Father and mother were just pictures, photos
The color was (the same as yours)
The surname (same as yours)
But you got the feeling, the feeling,
The feeling

Confusion, la tati
Confusion, oh pardon me
Confusion, la tati

It's lovely sitting next to you
There's no one within miles of you
It's lovely sitting next to you
There's no one within miles of you

Confusion, you think you know where you stand
But you're not even standing, you're flat on shaky ground
No clue then, and everything you knew then
Was only true in specialized cases, yes,
In specialized cases
But in your case, in your case
It wasn't the case, not at all
