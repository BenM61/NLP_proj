I can't believe you're leaving
I can't believe it's true
Surely you can give me a reason
Was it something that I said to you?

Well, that's okay, if that's the way you want
There's no way I can make you stay
Any time, any place, you're always gonna hear me say

I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
Shadow, shadow

If you could just remember
The times we had fun
You left me all alone to wonder
The reason that you chose to go

Well, that's all right, do anything you need
Just call me on the telephone
Any time, any place, you're always gonna find me home

I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
Shadow, shadow

So where do we go from here?
And I really wonder
Why are you now concerned?
'Cause I'm livin' in a love shadow
With no time for conversation
Why didn't we take that time?
You left me standing in the darkness
Surely that's the way you want me
I'm livin' in a love shadow
Shadow

I can't believe you're leaving
I can't believe it's true
Surely you can give me a reason
Was it something that I said to you?

Well, that's okay, if that's the way you want
There's no way I can make you stay
Any time, any place, I'm always gonna hear you say

I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
Shadow, shadow

I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
I'm livin' in a love shadow
Shadow, shadow
