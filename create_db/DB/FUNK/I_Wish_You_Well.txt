I wish you flowers sunshine and smiles
I wish you children that grow to make you proud
I wish you pretty things to wear
Sweet things to smell

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you good friends that always treat you fair
Wanna wish you ribbons to tie around your hair
I wish you truckloads of cheer and many happy years

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Wanna wish you freedom to do the things you love
Wanna wish you blessings and kindness from above
Wanna wish you sunlight through the clouds
Hope you laugh out loud

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I wish you well
