I bet you're wonderin' how I knew, baby, baby, baby
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other girl you knew before 
Between the two of us girls 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about, just about, just about to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am, oh yes, I am, oh yes, I am

Baby won't you listen to me

Boy take a good look at these tears of mine
Baby, baby these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could've told me yourself
That you love somebody else 

Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it, yes, I heard it (heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, just about, just about, just about, to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am, oh yes, I am, oh yes, I am

Gooo, go
Go, I gotta go
Go, go
You gotta let me go
Go, go, go
I gotta go whoa, whoa, whoa

Say believe half of what you see
Oh, ho, and none of what you hear

Baby baby, but I just can't help bein' confused
If it's true please baby, won't ya tell me dear
Oh, do you plan to let me go
For the other girl you loved before? 
Don't ya know that I heard through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Don't ya know that I heard it, yes I heard it
