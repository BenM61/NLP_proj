Here comes the daylight, it's makin' me sad
Here comes the sunlight, makin' me sad
Had a good time last night, best I ever had
Here come the sunshine that's makin' me sad
So sad, so sad, so sad, so sad

Here come the daybreak, it's bringin' me pain
It's causin' me heartache, I wish it would rain
Had a good time last night, just me and my friends
But here come the daylight and now it's the end
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Here come the daylight, it's bringin' me down
Causin' me heartache, it's spinnin' my head around, yeah
Here come the daylight, it's bringin' me pain
It's causin' me heartache, I wish it would rain
Had a good time last night, just me and my friends
But here come the daylight and now it's the end
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no (oh no, oh no, oh no)

Here come the sunlight, it's bringin' me down
It's causin' me heartache, it's spinnin' my head around, yeah
Here come the daybreak, it's makin' me cough
It's causin' me sunburn, it's pissin' me off
Had a good time last night in the moon's glimpse
Now all that'll save me is a total eclipse
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
