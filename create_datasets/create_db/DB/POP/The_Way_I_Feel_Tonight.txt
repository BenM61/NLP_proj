Turn the music way down low
Let me see you in the glow
In the fire light you are shining
Though it's much too soon to know
If this love I feel will grow
Let's take tonight to start out finding

'Cause the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
I will keep your candle burning
Oh yes the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
And the way I feel tonight, 
I love you

Close the door and turn the key
Open up your heart to me
I can see your love light glowing
Let your body melt to mine
Let us taste each other's wine
Till the cup is overflowing
'Cause the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
I will keep your candle burning
Oh yes the way I feel tonight
Everything will be alright
And the way I feel tonight, 
I love you
