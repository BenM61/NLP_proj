I don't mind spending some time
Just hanging here with you
'Cause I don't find
Too many guys
That treat me like you do

Those other guys
They wanna take me for a ride
But when I walk, their talk is suicide
Some people never get beyond their stupid pride
But you can see the real me inside
And I'm satisfied
Oh no, oh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine
I can make you nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel, too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

I could be your confidant
Just one of your girlfriends
But I know that's not what you want
If tomorrow, the world ends
Why shouldn't we be with
The one we really love
Now tell me who have you been dreaming of?
I and I alone
Oh no, oh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine
I can make you nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel, too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Excuse me for feeling
This moment is critical
And might be we feeling
We could get physical
Oh no, no, no

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine
I can make you nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel, too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love baby
I'll show you mine
I can make you nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel, too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you
