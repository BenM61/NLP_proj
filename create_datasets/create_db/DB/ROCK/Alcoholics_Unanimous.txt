Slept on my face, and woke up confused
A bit concerned about what I've been up to
There's so many people I might have upset
I apologise to them all with the same pretext

Bring me tea!
Bring me coffee!

I was up all night
(He's been up all night)
I've been making mistakes
(Lots of mistakes)
I'm hiding it well
(Not very well)
But I don't feel great

I'm trying to deal with it quietly
But something's gone very wrong with me
I don't know how long I can keep it hid
I'm having trouble forming sentences

Bring me tea!
(That looks like it really hurts)
Bring me coffee!
(Should have taken the day off work)
