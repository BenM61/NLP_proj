Oh me oh my oh you
Whatever shall I do?
Hallelujah,
The question is peculiar
I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no?

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar,
Just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing:

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
on the bedpost overnight?

Now the nation rise as one
To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent
The bonny burning question,
What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom boom

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?
If your mother says don't chew it,
Do you swallow it in spite?
Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?
Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bedpost overnight?

On the bedpost overnight
Hello there,
I love you and
The one who holds you tight!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Sat'day night
On the bedpost overnight
A dollar is a dollar & a dime is a dime!
He'd sing another chorus
But he hasn't got the time
On the bedpost overnight, yeah!
