What fate can bring you and the things that it can do
Funny
How life will change you when you least expect it to

I wasn't into anyone
I danced in a sea of faces
I wasn't into anything
But baby
You know
Together we're so right
The touch that I get from you's incredible
So right; the touch that I get when I look at you

Maybe the touch you give me is the look I get from you
Maybe the spell it's weaving is the way you feel it too
Maybe you'll stop and walk away
Don't look at me to follow
I wouldn't run for anyone
But baby
You know

Together we're so right
The touch that I get from you's incredible
So right; the touch that I get
That I get from you

Whatever it is we've got
Well
Maybe we could find out more about it
Baby
We'll create this feeling
Anytime
Anytime

I wasn't into anyone
I danced in a sea of faces
I wasn't into anything
But baby
You know
Together we're so right
The touch that I get from you's incredible...
So right
So right
Together we're Iso right
