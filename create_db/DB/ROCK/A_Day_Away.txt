So the world is waiting
As you headed on out the door
Just to trip you up and spit you out
Well I can tell just what your thinking
I'll be there to catch you, falling out your tree tonight

Relax your mind, let it slowly float away tonight
Forget about the day

The world sits on your shoulders
Looks like an ugly weight to bear
Almost lost you underneath there
Well I can tell just what you're feeling
You should let it go 'cause we can start again tonight

Relax your mind, let it slowly float away tonight
Forget about it, it's a day away
