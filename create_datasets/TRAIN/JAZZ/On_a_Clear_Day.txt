On a clear day, rise and look around you
And you'll see who you are
On a clear day how it will astound you
That the glow of your being outshines every star

You'll feel part of ev'ry mountain, sea, and shore
You can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before

And on a clear day, on that clear day
You can see forever and ever more

You can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before

And on that clear day, on that clear day
You can see forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and evermore!
