Can you understand me now
I'll get through somehow
You won't ever get me down
Won't see me hanging around

Can you dig it, oh yeah
Can you dig it, oh yeah
Can you dig it, oh yeah
Can you dig it what I'm saying
One little kiss isn't anything
I won't be sad

Someone turned a light on
See how big and strong I've grown
I'm standing on my own

Can you dig it, oh yeah
Can you dig it, oh yeah
Can you dig it, oh yeah
Can you dig it what I'm saying
One little kiss isn't anything
You keep insisting on everything
I won't be sad
