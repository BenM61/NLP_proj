All these places part of me
It fills me up and swallows me
My emotions wrapped in vines
Are reaching for the sun that shines

Oh, I must say I adore you
But sometimes I seem to ignore you
That's because I don't deserve
To have your love for me ever

All this time, I wanted you to know
That if you're ever, ever feeling low
You can always count on, on me
To be there whenever you need

Since you took my breath again
Would you share your oxygen?
I can breathe one breath of air
Intoxicated by your stare

Standing in the middle of the street
Oh, please don't run over me
I been trying, trying to finally
Reach for a sun that shines

All this time, I wanted you to know
That if you're ever, ever, ever feeling low
You can always count on, on me
To be there whenever you need

Oh, I love you so much, baby
You are my, you are my rising sun
Oh, I love you so much, baby
You are my, you are my setting sun

You are my rising sun
You are my setting sun
You are my rising sun
You are my setting sun
