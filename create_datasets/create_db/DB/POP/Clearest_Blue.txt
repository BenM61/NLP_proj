Light, it's all over us
Like it always was
Like it always was

Shape by the clearest blue
But it's not enough
It's not enough, not enough

Just another time we're caught inside
Every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides
Never quite learning why
You'll meet me, you'll meet me
You'll meet me halfway

Whenever I feel it coming on
You can be well aware
If ever I try to push you away
You can just keep me there
So please say you'll meet me
Meet me halfway

Tied to the shifting ground
Like I always was
Like I always was

You, were the perfect star
But it's not enough, it's not enough
Not enough, not enough

Just another time that I go down
But you were keeping up
Holding to a hope you undermined
Never to be reversed

Just another time we're caught inside
Every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides
Never quite learning why

Whenever I feel it coming on
You can be well aware
If ever I try to push you away
You can just keep me tell me

Tell me tell me, you'll meet me
Tell me tell me, you'll keep me
Tell me tell me, you'll meet me
Will you meet me more than halfway

Shape by the clearest blue
Shape by the clearest blue
Shape by the clearest blue (will you meet me more than halfway)
Shape by the clearest blue (will you meet me more than halfway)
