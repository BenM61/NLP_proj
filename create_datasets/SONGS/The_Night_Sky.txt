One day I will be back in our old street
Safe from the noise that's falling around me

And we'll release this town from the people
Who are trying to knock it down
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky
And there will be no sound

Open the bars and open the markets
Open the banks and open the churches

And we'll release this town from the people
Who are trying to knock it down
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky
And there will be no sound

We've been cowering so long
Oh, what I would give, I ask so little
Oh, what I would give to stand at the bus stop
Or browse in a bookshop to sleep and always be still

And we'll release this town from the people
Who are trying to knock it down
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky

And I will be set free from the people
Who are trying to bury me
And then only fireworks will light the sky at night
For all the world can see
