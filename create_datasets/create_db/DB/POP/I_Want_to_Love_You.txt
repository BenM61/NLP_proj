How'd I get here, baby
How'd I get here in your arms
Why do you make me crazy
Why do I love a perfect storm

I could look at you all night
Stare into love and know that I

I wanna feel your face in my hands
I wanna see your eyes take me in
I wanna say again and again
I want to love you

I wanna let the kiss take it's time
I wanna go where your soul meets mine
And let you know that deep down inside
I want to love you

I'm so lost in you now
I'm so lost, I can't be found
My heart's goin' under
Don't save me, baby, let me drown

I want your skin on my skin
I wanna be someone I've never been

I wanna feel your face in my hands
I wanna see your eyes take me in
I wanna say again and again
I want to love you

I wanna let the kiss take it's time
I wanna go where your soul meets mine
And let you know that deep down inside
I want to love you

I wanna love you
I wanna love you
I, I wanna love you

I wanna feel your face in my hands
Wanna see your eyes take me in
I wanna say again and again
And I want to love you

I wanna let the kiss take it's time
I wanna go where your soul meets mine
And let you know that deep down inside
I want to love you

I wanna love you
I want to love you
