(PJ Harvey:)
I was lost in love
I was lost inside
'Till he said to me
You've got a lovely smile

And I'm saved
Saved
And I'm saved
And I'm saved

Heal me with his hands
Heal me with his heart
When he said to me
No no we never part

(PJ Harvey:)
Heal me with his hands

J. Parish: 
Well, she feels though she had my paradise

PJ Harvey:
Heal with his heart

J. Parish: 
She was a hula girl, she got her hair done nice

PJ Harvey:
When he said to me

J. Parish: 
She said "I'll give it all I got to my heela man

PJ Harvey:
No no we never part

J. Parish: 
He put his hands on me, showed me what I am

PJ Harvey & J. Parish: 
And I'm saved

When I got that heela by my side
And I push him daylight, push him night
