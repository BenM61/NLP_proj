Look, you don't have to take this
You can come with me 

Na na na, na na na (oh yeah) 
(Yeah) na na na, na na na na (ooh ah ooh) 

So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone 
I know babe you can come with me though 
So hard to be strong cause she left you alone, all alone 
I know babe you can come with me though 
(I know) I know your alone, you can come with me though 
(I know) I know you feel pain, you can come with me though 
(I know) I know you feel hurt, you can come with me though 
(It won't) it wouldn't the same if you come with me though 

I just wouldn't believe, believe it baby 
She would go and treat you that way 
Especially after all the craziness you took 
It just ain't necessary 
I feel the tears that you cry at night 
Cause I know what love is suppose to be like 
Every little kiss and hug that she put aside 
Baby, if you want to I can make it right 

So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone 
I know baby, you can come with me though (come with me) 
So hard to be stong cause she left you alone, all alone 
I know baby you can come with me though 
(I know) I know your alone, you can come with me though (ooh) 
(I know) I know you feel pain, you can come with me though

(It won't) it wouldn't the same if you come with me though 

Na na na's 

Never could find the words to tell you, babe 
How I felt so deep inside 
Didn't want to be to bold
Didn't want to hate on your girl but know I
Can't let you know what's wrong, what you're goin' through 
You deserve the same love as seeing you 
Given back a hundred though, baby I would do 
Show your love you never seen or never known 

So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone

(I know) I know you feel hurt, you can come with me though 
(It won't) it wouldn't the same if you come with me though 

It won't be the same 
If you come with me (if you come with me) 
If you come with me (if you come with me) 
If you come with me (if you come with me) 
You won't feel no pain 
If you come with me (if you come with me) 
If you come with me (if you come with me) 
If you come with me (if you come with me)
