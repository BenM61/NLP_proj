Who cares I'm messing around?
Who cares I'm cracking up?
Who cares I'm out of my mind?
Who cares I'm right or wrong?

What makes me tease myself?
What makes me spoil myself?
What makes me complicated?
What makes me destructive?

Who cares I'm messing around?
Who cares I'm cracking up?
Who cares I'm out of my mind?
Who cares I'm right or wrong?

What makes me tease myself?
What makes me spoil myself?
What makes me complicated?
What makes me destructive?

What makes me think so what?

(the booklet only has this last part of the song)
