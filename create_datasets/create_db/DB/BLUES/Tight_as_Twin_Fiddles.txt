I grew up on western swing
Bob Wills had me hooked early in my teens
A fiddle was the only thing I put my fingers on
Faded love was my love till you came along

Oh, now we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
The fiddle we play with came straight from the man
We fiddled around oh, but we both understand
That we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band

Here's to the fiddler playin' at my side
Now don't tell me Bob Wills sound ain't alive
[Incomprehensible] twin fiddles let it flow
Her harmony's on right or wrong lets me know

Oh, that we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
The fiddle we play with came straight from the man
We fiddle around oh, but we both understand
That we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
We're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
