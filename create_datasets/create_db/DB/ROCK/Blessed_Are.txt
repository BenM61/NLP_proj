BLESSED ARE THE ONE-WAY TICKET
HOLDERS ON THE ONE-WAY STREET
BLESSED ARE THE MIDNIGHT RIDERS
WHO IN THE SHADOW OF GOD THEY SLEEP
BLESSED ARE THE HOT OLD HIKERS
STARING OUT AT FALLING RAIN
WON'DRING AT THE RETRIBUTION
IN THEIR PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH PAIN
BLESSED ARE THE BLOOD RELATIONS
OF THE YOUNG ONES WHO HAVE DIED
WHO HAD NOT THE TIME OR PATIENCE
TO CARRY ON THIS EARTHLY LIFE
RAIN WILL COME AND WINDS WILL BLOW,
WILD DEER IN THE MOUNTAIN SNOW.
BIRDS WILL BEAT AT HEAVEN'S WALL,
WHAT COMES TO ONE MUST COME TO US ALL.
WELL, YOU AND I ARE ON THE ONE-WAY TICKET
HOLDERS ON THAT ONE-WAY STREET
WHICH LLIES ACROSS A GOLDEN VALLEY
WHERE THE WATER OF JOY AND HOPE RUN DEEP
SO IF YOU PASS THE PARENTS WEEPING
OF THE YOUNG ONES WHO HAVE DIED
TAKE THEM TO YOUR WARMTH AND KEEPING
FOR BLESSED ARE THE TEARS THEY CRIED
AND MANY WERE THE TEARS THEY CRIED
TAKE THEM TO THE VALLEY WIDE
AND LET THEIR SOULS BE PACIFIED
