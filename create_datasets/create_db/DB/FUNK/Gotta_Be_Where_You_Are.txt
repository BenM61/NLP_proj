Tell me if it's so
It's seems as though you feel you're losing me
If that's on your mind that should not be
You're my one desire, you're my eternal fire

Gotta be where you are
Gotta be where you are
You see I'm not (Incomprehensible) take you there
No, just gotta be where you are

There's no one else but you
Sometimes when you're away, I find myself so blue
And deep within my heart I know that's okay too
There's so much joy in knowing, my love for you is growing

Gotta be where you are
I gotta be where you are
You see I'm (Incomprehensible) take you there
No, just gotta be where you are

Baby, can't you see it's only you and me
And that's the way that it was always meant to be

Oh baby, if ever you see
You're my one desire, you're my eternal fire

Gotta be where you are
I gotta be where you are
You see I'm not (Incomprehensible) take you there
No, just gotta be where you are

Oh, gotta be where you are
I just gotta be where you are
You see I'm not (Incomprehensible) take you there
No, just gotta be where you are

Oh, gotta be where you are
Gotta be where you are
You see I'm not (Incomprehensible) take you there
No, just gotta be where you are

Oh, gotta be where you are
Gotta be where you are
