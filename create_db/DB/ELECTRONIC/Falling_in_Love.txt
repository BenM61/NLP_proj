From the moment I met you
I just couldn't forget you
Something in your eyes
You could not hide from me baby

I hear the thunder
I see the lightning
Your love is so inviting
I must confess
My heart you possess

[Chorus]
Now I'm falling, falling in love with you
And there's nothing that I can do
'Cause I'm falling in love
Falling in love 
Falling in love with you
Now I'm falling, falling in love it's true
And there's nothing that I can do
'Cause I'm falling in love
Falling in love 
Falling in love with you

Now you've been deceiving
Boy I know what you're dreaming of
Something from the start
Something in my heart so true babe

I hear the thunder
I see the lightning
All I can say
This love will have it's way
