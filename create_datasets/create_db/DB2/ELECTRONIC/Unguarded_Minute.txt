Maybe I speak too soon
Maybe I play too hard
And I listen to major worries
In a minor way

You sent your message to me
You made a move that I'd understand
When you moved from a ticket in line
To a room in L.A.

There was a time split second
I could have said please
The fool around and my guard
Was down by a few degrees

An unguarded minute, watch out
Has an accident in it
An unguarded minute, watch out
Has an accident in it

I guess I should have tried a little bit
Yeah, I could have changed
I could be anything that you want
But it wouldn't be me

Do anything that you say
Use any thought to armor the way
So do you love the man that I am
Or what you want me to be?

I wanna hold you now
But I can't let you go
So anytime that you can do better
Just let me know

An unguarded minute, watch out
Has an accident in it
An unguarded minute, watch out
Has an accident in it

Unguarded minute
I wanna hold you tight
Accident in it
Unguarded minute
I wanna hold you tight
Has an accident in it

I'm gonna hold you now
Or I can't let you go
So anytime that you can do better
Just let me know

An unguarded minute, watch out
Has an accident in it
An unguarded minute, watch out
Has an accident in it

I wanna hold you tight, watch out
Please let me hold you tight
I wanna hold you tight, watch out
Please let me hold you tight

You can do better than me, watch out
Why don't you try it?
(Unguarded minute)

And you can do better than me
(Unguarded minute)
You better buddy
(Unguarded minute)

An unguarded minute, watch out
It has an accident in it
Unguarded minute
