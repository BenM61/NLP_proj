Hey, look who's here
This place is not my home
A change has got to come
Face hot with tears
How was I suppose to know?
The ABC's of love

Salvation lies within
Don't ask me what I did
When God made her he threw away the formula

Fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman

Get in, get out
No time for poetry
You can't change people's minds
I'll meet you there
Your walls are painted green
Our vines have intertwined

Was this your parting gift?
Black eye and bloody lip
Ten years from now I'll still remember every word

Fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman

I still believe your beautiful lies
You don't have to die
Go to Heaven
I still believe your beautiful lies
It almost makes me feel young again

Fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman

All I want is to reach my weekend woman
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
