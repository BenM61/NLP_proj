Just to think about it,
I would do things that I would regret (trying to get you to)
To understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard time and time again but I
Didn't know my love wouldn't grow, I should of just let it go
But I, stayed around thinking you would learn to love

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should of let you go
Should of let you go
I should of let you go
You know I should of let you go

Couldn't do without it, I felt I needed you in my world (to get me by, by)
More and more I looked out for you, you tried to play me like a fool so I
Didn't care that love wasn't there, had to just let it go
Couldn't stay around, thinking you would learn to love

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should of let you go
Should of let you go
I should of let you go
You know I should of let you go

And now I'm gone, plus I'd rather be alone
We both grown, lower your tone over the phone, alright
I should of known, damn I should of known
This wouldn't last long, when you didn't come home some nights
And now I'm on, in the zone, handle business on my own
So respect the queen on the throne, alright
Here's some strong advice, move on, that's life
You wrong I'm right, and I'm glad I let you go

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should of let you go
Should of let you go
I should of let you go
You know I should of let you go

Don't know why you would ever lie to me so,
But I should of let you
Don't know why I could never let you go
Could of, should of, let you
Don't know why would ever lie to me so,
But I should of let you
Don't know why I could never let you go
Could of, should of, let you
Don't know why you would ever lie to me so,
But I should of let you
Don't know why I could never let you go
Could of, should of, let you
