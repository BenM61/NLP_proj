It is late September and it's getting cold
We're putting on our winter clothes
And winter smiles

And I knew that I missed you
And I don't know why
That I never told you
Your world collided with mine

You got me talking in the sleep
And not wanting to eat
Faking smiles all the time

And I know that I promised you the earth
For all its worth
Can't get away from it
It's all a lie

It is late September and it's getting cold
Your birthday's coming and I miss you so
Got to give you time

And I got you a present, it is only small
But if you only saw it
It would give you hope
I miss your winter smile

You got me talking in my sleep
Not wanting to eat
Faking smiles all the time

And I know that I promised you the earth
For all its worth
Can't get away from it
It's all a lie

Lonely late September
I said, "A lonely late September"
