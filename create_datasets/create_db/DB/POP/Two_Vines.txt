We got the best years ahead we know we do
We reach for love it meets us on the headway
Blind to the on coming eye caught in the phosphorous
Right in the prime of your life struck by the force of us

And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your hands show me
All the light that lives in your head tonight
Two vines two vines

We're going out tonight won't you come along
We'll make the dark night replay a memory
Wide to the sky up above born into all of us
Right in the prime of our lives struck by the course of love

And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your hands show me
All the light that lives in your head tonight
Two vines two vines

I wonder what is right (slowly growing right into your hands)
There's only one way tonight (so I can see, so I can see the light, high time)

I wonder every time

We're going to a place that no one's every been before
There's only one ocean and an open door
No reason to rush it's taking us home
All the universe is humming with me

And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your hands show me
All the light that lives in your head tonight
Two vines
Slowly growing right into your hands show me
All the light that lives in your head tonight
Two vines
