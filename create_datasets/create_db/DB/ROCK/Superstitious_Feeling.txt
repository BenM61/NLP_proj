Somewhere in the night turning to the right
Something clicks inside of your head
A taste of mystery creepin' over me
Shadows of an unknown dread
Superstitious feelin', superstitious feelin'

The flashing of a light slashes through the night
Changing colours in the haze
You meet a strangers eyes gripping like a vice
Noises sounding out of place

Superstitious feelin' runnin' all around my head
Superstitious feelin' I don't know why but I think that I'd be better off dead, oh yeah

There's trouble up ahead, my mind is flashing red
And evil's just around the bend
You're in a cold embrace lost without a trace
It's gettin' very near the end

Superstitious feelin' runnin' all around my head
Superstitious feelin' I don't know why, I think I'm goin' out of my head

Superstitious feelin' runnin' all around my head
Superstitious feelin' don't know why
Superstitious feelin' runnin' all around my head
Superstitious feelin' I don't know why I think that I'd be better off
(Superstitious) superstitious
(Superstitious) feelin'
(Superstitious) goin' round and around my
(Superstitious) superstitious
(Superstitious) feelin'
(Superstitious) goin' round and around my head
(Superstitious) said I might be
(Superstitious) yes I might be
(Superstitious) better off if I were dead
