You say you're hurting oh cos 
They say I'm flirting oh no 
You just can't take it anymore 
Your friends say I'm no good for you 
But in my heart I'm so true 
A partner for life we can be sure 
You've asked me for some time to clear you mind 
I stayed away it hurt so much 
Without your touch 
Now I'm back and you say 

Chorus: 
Just a little bit longer baby 
'Cause my love keeps growing stronger 
A little more time to say 
But in my head a love song plays 
For you and me 

We played in the rain together 
That feeling lives on forever 
Memories that bring tears of joy 
We've had our share of bad times too 
Hurting each other me and you 
It's brought us much closer in the end 
Just too much we've both fought for 
To put it all down the drain 
I've stayed away just for a while 
But now you're driving me insane 

(Chorus) 

I said all there is to say now 
Hoping that you'll make me stay 
Believe me I'm yearning for you girl 
Hope there's a place in your heart 
That remembers the good from the start 
Just put me back where I belong 
You asked me for some time to clear your mind 
I stayed away it hurt so much 
Without your touch now I'm back and you say 

(Chorus)
