People: white is white
What's black ain't clover

Together we'll be
When the war is over.
You see the Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys

They ain't gonna fight no wars
Oh
now.

Cool is school
But the teachers beat yer

When they see
That they can't reach yer.
You see the Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys

They ain't gonna fight no wars
Oh
now.

They ain't got no country
They ain't got no creed
People won't be black or white
The world will be half-breed.
The world will be half-breed.
The world will be half-breed.
You see the Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys

they ain't gonna fight no doggone wars.
They ain't got no country...
It's a brand new day
With brand new people
In one big world
We're just one people.
You see the Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys

They ain't gonna fight no wars. Oh
now.
Baby
you know that we hate fighting.
