Long were the days I've spent within these walls 
And long were nights of aloneness. 
How often have you sailed in my dreams 
And now in my awakening? 
Here I am - ready to go 
Into the seasonless world where we shall reap and love 

In the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets 
And my spirit has entered your heart. 
And in your sleep your dreams were MY dreams 
And your breath was upon my face. 

Ohhh to know the pain of too much tenderness. 
You are not trapped or tamed. 
Without a care and without grief. You shall be free... 

Give up the fight and learn to surrender 
All you've gotta do is 
Give up the fight and learn to surrender 
You know there's nothing to it 

Let this be the start of something - the start of something true 
Don't want to keep this heart imprisoned 
Let me fly away with you 
You don't always need a reason for all the things you do 
When you've got something to believe in you know there's no turning back 

Give up the fight and learn to surrender 
All you've gotta do is 
Give up the fight and learn to surrender 
You know there's nothing to it 
theres nothing to it. 

Let there be no scales 
To weigh your unknown treasure 
It is when you give of yourself 
That you truly give. 

Oh to know the pain of too much tenderness 
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams 

Give up the fight and learn to surrender 
All you've gotta do is 
Give up the fight and learn to surrender 
All you've gotta do is
