Moonlight and shadows, and you in my arms,
And the melody in the bamboo tree, my sweet.
Even in shadows, I feel no alarms
While you hold me tight in the jungle light, my sweet.

Close to my heart you will always be,
Never, never, never to part from me.
Moonlight and shadows, and you in my arms,
I belong to you, you belong to me, my sweet.

Close to my heart you will always be,
Never, never, never to part from me.
Moonlight and shadows, and you in my arms,
I belong to you, you belong to me, my sweet.
