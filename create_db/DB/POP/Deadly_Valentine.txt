Hey! If a man can show just cause why they
May not lawfully be together
Let him now speak or hereafter
For ever let him hold his piece
As it says I am my beloved
That of my beloved is mine

To love and to cherish according to God's holy ordinance
You have declared your concern, may the Lord fill you both with blessings
From this day forward, for better, for worse, until death do us part

Damn!
Can't even remember my name
You are my thing, I'm my own shadow
You are my little hurricane
Pictures are gently left behind me
Somewhere a face that I can't find
You are my deadly valentine

With this ring I thee wed with all my worldly goods I thee endow
To love and to cherish according to God's holy ordinance
You have declared your concern, may the Lord fill you both with blessings
From this day forward, for better, for worse, until death do us part
