A race of angels 
Bound with one another 
A dish of dollars 
Laid out for all to see 
A tower room at Eden Rock 
His golf at noon for free 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 

His lady's aching 
To bring a body down 
She daily preaches 
On where she wants to be 
An evening with a movie queen 
A face we all have seen 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 

A case of aces 
Done up loose for dealing 
A piece of island cooling in the sea 
The whole of time we gain or lose 
And power enough to choose 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me
