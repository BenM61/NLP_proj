A ring in a box but not your dream
It's not a diamond, it's aquamarine
Your shocking look of self defeat
So desperate
I think of the place where you fooled me
Beside the tarmac you never came clean
I'm driving past the gruesome scene
I'll never forget this

I told you I wished that I was dead
My eyes wouldn't open up again
I can't believe I wasn't joking
Salt and lime I taste
The sickest thoughts I can't erase
These images won't stop provoking

You know you could
I wish you would

Fall on your knees and remove the sorrow
Return the piece of my heart you borrowed
Things you used to say
Could take the pain away
But now you're gone and we're falling faster
We're forgetting things that we used to master
Games we used to play
Could take the pain away

You packed your shit and went ahead
My mind and my soul were left for dead
I can't believe you weren't joking
Sweat rolls down my face
My bloody knuckles mark the stains
My throat is closing up, I'm choking

You know you could
(You know you could)
I wish you would
(I wish you)

Fall on your knees and remove the sorrow
Return the piece of my heart you borrowed
Things you used to say
Could take the pain away
But now you're gone and we're falling faster
We're forgetting things that we used to master
Games we used to play
Could take the pain away

Same bed, we take no precautions
Emotions, regrets and revenge
The last step in killing the karma
It makes sense from where we've been
The same car same songs same motions
We hold hands, relive how we met
But no talk, no reconciliation
This train's already left
Did you think next April
You'd be even further away
Did you keep him faithful
How many nights did you lay awake
And even six years later
The dialogue, it stays the same
You're 2000 miles away
Betrayers never change
 
A ring in a box but not from me
It's still no diamond, it's aquamarine
You'll never find your place of peace
You'll always regret this

Fall on your knees and remove the sorrow
Return the piece of my heart you borrowed
Things you used to say
Could take the pain away
But now you're gone and we're falling faster
We're forgetting things that we used to master
Games we used to play
Could take the pain away
