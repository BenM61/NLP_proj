Don't fret precious, I'm here
Step away from the window, go back to sleep
Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils
See, they don't give a f*ck about you like I do

Count lies like sheep, like sheep, like sheep, like sheep, like sheep, like sheep
Count lies like sheeps, like sheeps, like sheeps, like sheeps, like sheeps, like sheeps

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow

Count bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums

Count bodies like sheep, like sheep, like sheep, like sheep, like sheep, like sheep

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Go back to sleep

I'll be the one to protect you from your enemies and all your demons
I'll be the one to protect you from a will to survive and a voice of reason
I'll be the one to protect you from your enemies and your choices, son
They're one in the same
I must isolate you
Isolate and save you from yourself
