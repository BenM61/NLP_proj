Picking up the pieces up off the floor
How was I to know there was gonna be a war
Words of sorrow and words of spite
Ringing in my head right through the night

[Chorus]
And don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame
When you've got yourself to blame
Don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame

Woke up this morning, it's a raining again
Starting to wonder if it's something I said
Words of sorrow and words of spite
Ringing in my head right through the night

[Chorus]

You've got yourself to blame

Cry, cry, why, cry-why, cry-yin' shame
Cry, cry, why, why, why, why, why, why

Cry, cry, why, cry, why, crying shame
Cry, cry, why, cry, why, why, crying shame

Up all night with a conscience fight
I just can't sleep so I put on the light
The sheets are wet with anxiety sweat
Mornings gonna come but it ain't here yet

[Chorus]

You've got yourself

Don't you know it's a crying shame (it's a crying shame)
When you've got yourself to blame (don't you know)
Don't you know it's a crying shame
You've got yourself to blame [Repeat: x5]

I'm to blame, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
