Every little word you say
Every little breath you steal
Every one just drives me crazy
Baby, it's the way I feel
I'll do anything you ask me
Everything I'll do for you
'Cause darlin' you're my main attraction
You give me such tenderness
I think I love you
Spend my nights just dreamin' of you
Don't you want me
Say you need me baby
Take my hand
1st chorus
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I'll be there for you baby
I can't stop wanting you
Every little hurt you're hiding
Every single one you hold
Every little tear you're crying
Resting in your eyes like gold
Everything's a stimulation
Every little thing you touch
Ooh, you're so intoxicating
You give me such tenderness
I think I love you
Spend my nights just dreamin' of you
Don't you want me
Say you need me baby
Take my hand
2nd chorus
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I'll be there for you baby
I can't stop wanting you
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I love you too much baby
And I'd rather be there with you
Think about it
You could have everything
Think about it
Can't you see what love can bring
Think about it
Turn around don't walk away
Think about it
I can't stop wanting you
repeat 2nd chorus
repeat 2nd chorus
