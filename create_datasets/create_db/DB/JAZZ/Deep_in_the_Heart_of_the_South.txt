Oh, cover me with Dixie skies
While the wind is crooning lullabies
Tuck me into paradise
Somewhere deep in the heart of the south

Yellow moon is hangin' low
Over fields of cotton white as snow
My heart longs to turn in hope
Somewhere deep in the heart of the south

Laughter fills the afternoon, and every evening
Lovers linger on the Swanee shore
I can see magnolias bloom around a cabin door
And that's where I'm goin', sure as you're born

I'm a weary rollin' stone
Made my mind up and I'm rollin' home
Come on, feet, and start to roam
Somewhere deep in the heart of the south

Laughter fills the afternoon, and every evening
Lovers linger on the Swanee shore
I can see magnolias bloom around a cabin door
And that's where I'm goin', sure as you're born

I'm a weary rollin' stone
Made my mind up and I'm rollin' home
Come on, feet, and start to roam
Somewhere deep in the heart of the south

Say come on, feet, and do your stuff
The way is long and the road is rough
Somewhere deep in the heart of the south
