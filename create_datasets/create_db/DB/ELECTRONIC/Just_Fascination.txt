Slipping into new disguise,
Your eyes know, your body lies.
This fascination. This fascination. This, fascination.

Your thoughts, closed off.
But it's no concern, concern of yours.
Just fascination. Just fascination. Just private, fascination.

Hide away in secrecy,
You chop away this fantasy.
This private fascination. This private, fascination.

But if they knew, you'd shoot yourself.
A beast, you'd shoot yourself.
This private, fascination.
Just fascination. This fascination. This private fascination.

Glances back, slip in the way, swift.
You've found another way of,
Slipping into your disguise,
Your eyes know, your body lies.
This fascination. This fascination.
Just fascination. Just fascination. Just private, fascination.
This private, fascination.

Drive away in privacy,
You chop away this fantasy.
Your thoughts, closed off.
But it's no concern, concern of yours.
Just fascination. Just fascination. Just fascination.
Just private, fascination. Just private, fascination.

A glance back, slipping away, the slip.
You pack another way.
But if they knew, you'd shoot yourself.
A beast, you'd shoot yourself.
This private fascination. This fascination. This fascination.
This private fascination.

This fascination. This fascination. This fascination.
This private, fascination. This private, fascination.
