Slow down, you know you're leaving me behind
You seem to think that you can read my mind
You think I'm rich, you think I'm free
You wanna change your place with me
Be a leader then the blind can lead the blind
Happens all the time

Can't you understand . . .
Enough is not enough, it's not enough . . .
It's not enough

I've been filled with culture, I've been filled with lies
And compliments from people I despise
Shake my hand and sing along
Always getting one line wrong
Shout for more when I know I just died
Died . . .

Can't you understand . . .
Enough is not enough, it's not enough . . .
It's not enough

So - when I think I know my way around
I'm gonna take a bus to the other side of town
I'm gonna stay out all night long
Gonna sing some strange new song
Lose myself and hope I don't get found
Don't ask me how

Can't you understand . . .
Enough is not enough, it's not enough . . .
It's not enough
