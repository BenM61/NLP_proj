Sci-fi Steven, a secret vampire by night.
Ears and eyes always on the lookout for conspiracies against the teen-c nation.
Lives by the ethic, 'keep yr friends close but yr enemies closer.'

Manda rin, seeker of the truth.
Hair clips and screams used as deadly weapons.
Childlike appearance used as decoy.
A warning to all saboteurs, 'be fooled and be dead'.

John disco, all hail the disco king.
Gaze in wonderment at his skanking ability, but don't stare too long.
His disco feet can hypnotize.
Hear him say, 'travolta ain't got nothin' on me'.

And now coming through the airwaves into yr home.
Introducing the new transistor heroes.

Tell it to the kids, tell it to the kids.

Hey you! fascist man, working on yr master plan.
We know what we saw, won't let you do more.
Hey you! homophobes, life without yr frontal lobe.
Yr prejudice lies while innocent die.

Hey you! it's the sound, in yr head goes round and round
You want it some more, yr life is a bore.
Hey you! don't be scared, bis are here and we don't care.
We'll expose the lies. it's the defense for the kids.

No use running now, we know what you did
We're gonna tell it to the kids, tell it to the kids
Gonna get you now, 'cause that's now it is
We're gonna tell it to the kids, tell it to the kids

Hey you! poison pen, no use trying to pretend.
You think yr the best, now here's the prole press.
Hey you! businessman, getting as much as you can
We wanted the truth, we still want our youth

Hey you! backstabber, we know who and where you are
You let down the kids, yes that's what you did
Hey you! listen out, teen-c nation gives the shout
Retain the youth. it's the defense for the kids!

No use running...

Oh, oh, oh, oh fighting for the nation's youth
So, so, so, so, we can find out all the truth
No, no, no, no, no use hiding what you did.
