You've got the magic touch
It makes me glow so much
It casts a spell, it rings a bell
The magic touch

Oh when I feel your charm
It's like a fourth alarm
You make me thrill so much
You've got the magic touch

If I go reeling, uh-oh, I'm feeling the glow (Uh-oh)
But where can I go from you

I didn't know too much
And then I felt your touch
And now I've learned I can return
Magic touch

If I go reeling, uh-oh, I'm feeling the glow (Uh-oh)
But where can I go from you

I didn't know too much
And then I felt your touch
And now I've learned I can return
The magic touch
