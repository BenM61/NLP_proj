Twenty-five pounds of pure cane sugar
In each and every kiss
You wouldn't know what I'm talking about
If you never had lovin' like this
I don't mean to be brash
Tell y'all it's a natural fact
Good things come in small packages
You'll have to agree to that, tell you now, I'm

Ninety-nine pounds of natural-born goodness, y'all
Nintey-nine pounds of soul
Tell you now, I'm ninety-nine pounds of natural-born goodness, y'all
Ninety-nine pounds of soul

Twenty-five pounds of tenderness
In each and every touch
Twenty-five pounds of understanding my man
And I don't want me to worry too much
Twenty-four pounds of something, y'all
That I can't even name
And it all adds up to ninety-nine pounds
Well put-together in a fine wire frame

And I'm ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness, y'all
Ninety-nine pounds of soul, let me tell you now
I'm ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness, y'all
Ninety-nine pounds of soul
Ninety-nine, y'all, oh it sure is fine...
