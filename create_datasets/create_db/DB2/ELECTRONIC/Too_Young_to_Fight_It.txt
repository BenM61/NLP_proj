Take a dare
Don't tell the truth
Keep this between me and you
Whispers become loud
When word of this gets out
Will the message
Cause a motion
We won't know till we get there
When the suns down
Lights come up
Friends and enemies come together

Summer nights hitting
It so hard we were blisterin'
Can't keep from moving
The season is righting
We're too young to fight it
We stand united
Summer nights hitting
It so hard we're blistering
Can't stop to sleep it off

Hearts are beating to the sound
Kids are living underground

Rumors get so loud
We want to scream and shout
It's taking over now
You can't control it
You're shaking soaking wet
In the middle of the night again

Will the message
Cause a motion
We won't know till we get there
When the suns down
Lights come up
Friends and enemies come together!

Summer nights hitting
It so hard we were blisterin'
Can't keep from moving
The season is righting
We're too young to fight it
We stand united
Summer nights hitting
It so hard we're blistering
Can't stop to sleep it off
