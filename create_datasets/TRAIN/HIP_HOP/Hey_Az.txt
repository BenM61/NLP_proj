What's the deal son?

It's the world famous AZ Show 
For the world (AZ Show) 
(AZ) 
No doubt, time to mellow out 
Party at the yellow house, yell it out 
Invites only, don't tell no slouch 
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill 
Laidback with the Alize, merely's conceal 
Conversatin' like some whore pimps caught in the mix 
Wasn't taught shit stressed out supportin' your bitch 
Let the eyes shine, easing my mind with white wine 
It's your lifeline, sqeezing my nine the right time 
'K imma floss life, feds almost bagged the guard twice 
Bizare nights move on the grace of a lost light 
All them horney whites feeling like Christ with the army 
Tight cons be writing all my life 
It's based upon on how you burning incense 
With intents to school the infants 
The rules are different so for those that chose to listen 
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change 
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains 
(SWV) 
Hey AZ won't you play that song 
Keep me fucked up (fucked up) 
All night (all night) 
Hey AZ won't you play that song 
Keep me fucked up (fucked up) 
All night (all night) 
Long (fucked up, all night)

So many deaf and blind got caught up or left behind 
I guess bacardi lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine 
Next in line, slow G-ing, low key-ing 
Me and the crew win the gold B.M. O.D-ing, top speed 
Blowing through the sweet night breeze where ever life leads 
Anything's better besides a tight squeeze, sliced cheese 
Even my pieces put your nice V's dress precisely 
Hoping soon will be the wifey, it's working well 
Process words up in the pro's you sell, a urban hell 
Playing park benches, burning L's 
It's all basics, probation, open cases 
We ill natured, being trained young from hatred 
Trapped in the arms of satan, congregatin' 
Conversatin', trying to map ways of escaping 
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere 
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels and souvenirs

AZ, knock me off my dog gone shoes 
(AZ) 
For the world, no more case pending 
It's all a brand new beginning 
AZ I'm back winning, dressed in black linen 
Attract women, low fade ways later spending this 
State paid four different ways 
Put my bid in, no sleep, be playing with time 
My mind goes deep these cold streets rock a diamond chip, goutee 
Trying to stay sane, amoungst the madness and maintain 
Though the game changed, the message evolved or made plain 
Poor advice given, we'll strive for nice livin' 
Inside some pay the price or we'll spend nights in prison 
Plea bargain, hopin' my peoples speak the problem 
We each disolving trying to make moves to keep from starving
