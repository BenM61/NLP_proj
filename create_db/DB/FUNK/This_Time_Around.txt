So many times I let you down 
When you needed me I was not around 
You've forgiven me time and time again 
You believed that you could change me.

Although I've been around the best 
Darling I must confess 
No one compares to you

[Chorus:] 
This time around, no more tears 
This time around I swear 
That together we'll be better than before. 

This time around no more tears 
This time around I'll make it clear 
I'll love you more and more

You gave me all a girl could give 
You saved me, of this I'm positive. 
It took a little while 'til I could see. 
There could be no one else for me.

Although all over the world I've been 
Of all the girls I've seen 
No one compares to you. 

[Repeat Chorus] 
You always believed I'd be the Man of all your dreams 
This time around girl, you can count on me
