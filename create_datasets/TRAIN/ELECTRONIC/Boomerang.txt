Reach me, come closer 
Running back home 
Tell me like always 
Reach me, come closer
Running back home
Tell me like always
How you are lost

Watch me, I'm weightless though I'm on the ground
See me, I'm flying
No longer around my boomerang, my boomerang

I discovered how many lies
You can't walk over me
Won't you uncover all you hide
To lend your strength in this night?

Come closer, come closer, come closer

Watch me, I'm weightless though I'm on the ground
See me, I'm flying
No longer around my boomerang, my boomerang

I discovered how many lies
'Cause you can't walk over me

Watch me, I'm weightless though I'm on the ground
See me, I'm flying
No longer around my boomerang, my boomerang

I discovered how many lies
'Cause you can't walk over me

Watch me, I'm weightless
Watch me, I'm weightless
Watch me, I'm weightless
Watch me, I'm weightless
