We've been through a lot together 
We've seen what some will never see, you and me 
Prayer after prayer's been answered 
We can't go on without belief, can't you see? 

We just gotta be strong 
Keep the fire burning 
Gotta move on, keep our hearts from turning 
Gotta hold on, onto what you're learning now 
And never let go 

Nothing can stop us now 
We're growing stronger every day in every way 
Spreading the word together 
It doesn't matter what they say, no way! 

We've been through a lot together 
We've seen what some will never see, you and me 
Prayer after prayer's been answered 
We can't go on without belief, can't you see?
