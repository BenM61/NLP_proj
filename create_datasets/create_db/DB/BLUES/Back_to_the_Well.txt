Got to get back to the well
Drink that livin' water
Dive deep in myself
Start feelin' like I oughta

Gonna get real still
Gonna get my fill
It's been a long, dry spell
And I got to get back
I got to get back to the well

Feelin' empty for so long
Wonderin' where my faith has gone
I think about how lost I've been
In a search that never ends
And I've got to keep movin' on

Got to get back to the well
Drink that livin' water
Dive deep in myself
Start feelin' like I oughta

Gonna get real still
Gonna get my fill
It's been a long, dry spell
And I got to get back
I got to get back to the well

This life can be a great wasteland
You got to do everything you can
Only way to quench my thirst
Is start puttin' first things first

It's gonna make me a better man
Oh, baby
I got to get back to the well

Got to get back to the well
Drink that livin' water
Dive deep in myself
Start feelin' like I oughta

Gonna get real still
Gonna get my fill
It's been a long, dry spell
And I got to get back
I got to get back to the well

It's been a long, dry spell
And I got to get back
Got to get back to the well
Got to get back to the well
Been a long, dry spell
