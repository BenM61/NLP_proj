It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man, it's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
All of this I'll soon forget with my man

He's not much for looks 
He's no hero out of books 
But I love him, yes I love him
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him
 
I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, when I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
