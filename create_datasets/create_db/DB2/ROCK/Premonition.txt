I got a feelin' way down inside
I can't shake it, no matter how I try
You can't touch it, you just know
The earth is gonna shake 
And the wind is gonna blow
Well that's all right
This premonition is killin' me
But that's all right
I must be crazy, 
I must be seein' things

Out on the highway pickin' up clues
So much is mis-seen , so much to lose

You must be different, been rearranged
Can't pin it down but 
I know it's not the same
Well that's all right
This premonition is killin' me
But that's all right
I must be crazy, 
I must be seein' things
(Hit me!)

I can't eat, I can't sleep
All of a sudden I got witches in my feet
It's like waitin' for, the shoe to drop
I know it's comin' but 
I don't know where to stop
Well that's all right
This premonition is killin' me
But it's all right
I must be crazy, 
I must be seein' things

Well that's all right
This premonition is killin' me
But it's all right
I must be crazy, 
I must be seein' things
