Home's all right
I believe, I believe you have your instinct to expect that I'll change
The decision is yours, trust yourself
Oh, to keep with this ease history
The decision is yours, trust yourself
We'll take it as it comes
You carry me on

What if the sun is right?
You can't change that source in a day
What if desire is truth?
You can't change that source in a day
What have we sought to learn?
What more could you ask for?
What about service fares?
You can't change that source in a day
What if that star was right?
What else could you ask for?

Hold this night
I can see, I can see how it poured once before
The decision is yours, trust yourself
The thoughts form on call

What if the sun is right?
You can't change that source in a day
What if desire is truth?
You can't change that source in a day
What have we sought to learn?
What more could you ask for?
What about service fares?
You can't change that source in a day
What if that star was right?

Could you tell me what it means to plan?
Have you chosen me to be your jointed hands?

Put in your stakes and be glad 
That this is something static and solemnly invincible
I've waited for you
Ascending a stage at a time, admiring all the way 
As we push and pull and take and give
You waited for me

I trust into the order of things this once, this once
Love to be you
I could be you
I stand

C'mon everybody and show how to stand
C'mon everybody and prove what a stand
C'mon everybody and show how to stand
C'mon everybody and stand
