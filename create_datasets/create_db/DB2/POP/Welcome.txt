Welcome to the carnival
To the greatest show on earth
Welcome to my freak show from around the universe
I've travelled all four corners
And I've sailed all seven seas
To find a new sensation for this brand new century

Welcome to the carnival
Welcome to my freak show yeah, yeah

Step inside, step inside
Let the revelerys begin
Step inside, step inside
Move along right on in
We've got the tallest, and the smallest 
And the baddest in the land
To feed the curiosities of each and every man

Welcome to the carnival
Welcome to my freak show yeah, yeah

Le freak, so chique

Welcome to the carnival
Welcome to my freak show yeah, yeah

Welcome to the carnival
Welcome to my freak show yeah, yeah

Welcome!
