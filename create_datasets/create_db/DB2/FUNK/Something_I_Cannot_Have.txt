I dream about you baby every night
It feels so good
Yeah it seems so right
I dream about you baby
You know it drives me crazy
No way to stop what I'm feelin' inside
Every moment that I'm with you
It gets harder to hide
I've gotta find a way 
To make you mine someday

Saw you at a party the other night
Last place I thought you'd be
She was holding on to you so tight
I felt like it was choking me
See I never wanted nothing
That belonged to someone else
But I want you so bad 
I want you all for myself

I want to be your lover 
Wish I could tell you so
But I'll keep it close to my heart
Until she lets you go

I want something that I cannot have
Something beautiful
Something just out of my grasp
I want something that I cannot have
I want you babe
I want you so bad

I see you everyday but you'd never know
The way I feel inside
I have no right to tell you so
This is a love that I've got to hide
But I can't help wonder
If you ever know
Would you feel the same way baby that I do

I want to be your lover 
Wish I could tell you so
But I'll keep it close to my heart
Until she lets you go

I want something that I cannot have
Something beautiful
Something just out of my grasp
I want something that I cannot have
I want you babe
I want you so bad

It lives forever in the back of my mind
Thinking how I'm gonna love you baby
All of the time
I think about it baby
You know it drives me crazy
Another heart has been lost
Their cards have been dealt
Yeah the dice have been tossed 
I've gotta find a way
To make you mine someday

I want to be your lover
Wish I could tell you so
But I'll keep it close to my heart
Until you let her go

I want something that I cannot have
Something beautiful
Something just out of my grasp
I want something that I cannot have
I want you babe 
I want you so bad
