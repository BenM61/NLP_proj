In every beat of my heart
There's a beat for you
In every toast of wine
There's a toast for you, oh, yes, it is

In all of my, my conversation
You're my, my inspiration
And everything I do
I do for you

Although we're, we're so far apart
My, my love is true, so true, true
In every, every beat of my heart
There's a beat for you

(In every beat of my heart)
Heart
