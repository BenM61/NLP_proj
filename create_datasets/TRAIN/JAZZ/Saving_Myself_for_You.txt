I've been saving myself for you, just you, 
No one but you
I've saved my heart in your name
It's for you to claim some day
Been behaving myself for you, just you, 
No one but you
Because you'd never forgive
A kiss I might give away
I'll keep myself to myself
And in the long run I'll win
I'll keep myself to myself
Because I know that you've been
Saving your love for me, just me, 
And come what may
Until we're together
I'm saving myself for you
