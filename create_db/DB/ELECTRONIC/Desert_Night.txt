Your touch is taking me away from here
I'm alright, with no direction, hey
Too much, you're making me forget myself
Let's take a ride across the desert night

And when the sun comes out
In the morning light
I can feel you there
Oh, look at me now
Look at me now
I'm right here

And as the light spills out
In the sleepless air
You will see me there
Don't go anywhere, go anywhere
Wait right here

I'm alright
Oh, look at me now
I'm alright
Oh, look at me now

And when the sun comes up
In the morning light
I can feel you there
And when the sun comes up
In the morning light

You said, I'm looking for my happiness
I want to try to feel connected, hey
And the rush of falling into emptiness
I want to drive under the street light

(And when the sun)

Oh, look at me now
Look at me now
I'm right here

And as the light spills out
Of the sleepless air
You will see me there
Don't go anywhere, go anywhere
Wait right here

I'm alright
Oh, look at me now
I'm alright
Oh, look at me now

And when the sun comes up
In the morning light
I can feel you there
And when the sun comes up
In the morning light

I'm alright
I'm alright
