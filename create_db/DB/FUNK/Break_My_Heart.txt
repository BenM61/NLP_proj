[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

Tailor made black linen
Escalade with a made man in it
Rose gold shades with the rozay lenses
Pink champagne and the flow so endless
All I seek is perfection
Ain't no secrets I'ma eat that for breakfast
Keep her close to me like lyrics
She spoke to me in the middle of the winter
So I'ma let her close to me

All these stars out
And these people know my name
I can be so pretentious
But he likes, all the same
And these lights are glowing
But he don't want none
He rather chill and hug me
Baby, he could be the one

[Chorus]

You want me to trust you
But how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions
And I don't wanna listen
Messing with my heart and I just got it back

I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

I've been here before
I don't know if you're the type
Who's gonna be keep me sure
When the dark creeps in my mind
Will you be there baby?
Or will you let me go?
Can you stand the pressure?
This is what I need to know

[Chorus]

You want me to trust you
But how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions
There's so many lessons
And I need for you to have my back
I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

All white in the winter
Green in the summer
Painted the Lamborghini same color marijuana
Floating in the six til I made her seasick
Wetting these niggas up with this amg kit
Earned a reputation repping up and down the boulevard
Me and baby Bonnie and Clyde off in the rental cars
Propositions through politicians are common now
My money tall we can never be on common ground
Peel the top back getting higher than the higher power
Making love in the penthouse then it's cianara
Fell in love with shawty blame it on the chemistry
Tools on the low fools really envy me
Money multiply s600 Benz
Me and my shawty lie we a team to the end
Monopoly shopping sprees imagine what we can spend
Me and my shawty live we gonna do this shit again

[Bridge]

Don't break it
Please, don't break my heart
No, don't break it
Please, don't baby
I just wanna love you, baby
I know it from the very start
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

You got me living on a prayer
You could be a millionaire or broke
We won't pretend
You know you're more than a friend
Just because you love me
Imma love you 'til the end
I got you
You got me
I like you
You like me
And we could do everything
I wanna love you, oh, baby, baby, baby

Don't break it
Please, don't break my heart
No, don't break it
Please, don't baby

'Cause I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart
