Slipping through the sand and the sand through your fingertips 
Silence was the fear and the fear knew me all too well 
Waiting at the edge of the sea 
Gazing at horizons quite naturally 

There's something in the air but I know it can't carry me 
You know I won't believe you 
You know I won't believe in time for now 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 

The grains of sand which grace the land, warm against the sun 
The calming sea holds mystery 
Pushing down and down 
Riding with the tide 
The sun ? me 

There's something in the air but I know it can't carry me 
You know I won't believe you 
You know I won't believe in time for now 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 

Carry me down 
Carry me down 

Questions left unsaid but instead turn their backs on me 
Silence was the key and the sea learned its lesson well 
Waiting on the edge of time 
The world is on my doorstep 

There's something in the air but I know it can't carry me 
You know I won't believe you 
You know I won't believe in time for now 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
There's something in the air but I know it can't carry me 
You know I won't believe you 
You know I won't believe in time for now 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 

There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
(You know I can't I won't I can't I won't) 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
(You know I can't believe it) 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
(You know I can't I won't I can't I won't) 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
(You know I can't believe it) 
There's something in the air but I know it won't carry me down 
(You know I can't I won't I can't I won't)
