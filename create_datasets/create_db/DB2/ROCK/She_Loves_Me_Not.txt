When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that she can see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation is to agitation
If she cut me off
Would this be an amputation?

I don't know, if I care
I'm a jerk, life's not fair
Fighting all the time,this is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize I will compromise
She loves me not

Loves me not

Over the past five years,I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers
And watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But its sad to say
Sometimes she says she loves me not
But I hesitate, to tell her I hate,
This relationship, I want out today,this is over

I don't know, if I care
I'm a jerk, life's not fair
Fighting all the time,this is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize I will compromise
She loves me not

Life's not fair, I'm a jerk
Line for line, rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fightin' all the goddamn time
Its makin' me sick
Relationship,is gettin' ill
Piss drunk stupid, mad on the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl?
We're tearing up each others world
We should be in harmony, boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
Its alright baby,we can scream and shout

I don't know, if I care
I'm a jerk, life's not fair
Fighting all the time,this is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize I will compromise
She loves me not

Loves me not
Life's not fair, life's not fair, life's not fair
I'm s jerk, life's not fair
She loves me not, loves me not
