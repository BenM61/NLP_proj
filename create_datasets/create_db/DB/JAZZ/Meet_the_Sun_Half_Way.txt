Stop hiding behind a pillow whenever the dawn looks gray,
Get out, get out, and meet the sun half-way!
There may be a fortune waiting, or maybe an egg souffle,
Get out, get out, and meet the sun half-way!

Get into the tub,
And as you begin to scrub and rub,
Give out with your version of "The Road To Mandalay".
Don't ever expect the bright side served up to you on a tray,
Get out, get out, and meet the sun half-way!
