From the minute that you got my attention
I was taken and I have to mention
I was tryin' not to let it show
But I knew that I wasn't gonna let you go

From the way that you came right to me
Lookin' all hot with the style that threw me
No one would've ever known it
You would be the one who take this heart and hold it

You got that extraordinary way
Got to be next to ya every single day
You do somethin' that I just can't explain
I wanna take a chance and tell you you're the one for me

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah, do you know that?

Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

You can say anythin' you want to
No stress 'cause I understand you
We got a vibe you can't define
Want everyone know that boy is mine

We won't fight and we stop and stare
At the way you hold me when you take me there
At times I feel I lose control
I forget everyone but the hand I'm holdin'

You got that extraordinary way
Got to be next to ya every single day
You do somethin' that I just can't explain
I wanna take a chance and tell you you're the one for me

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah, can you feel me?

Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

Please know this, I'll always be right here
And you don't have to look nowhere else, babe
Don't think for a minute this love will change
Oh, you should know that

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah, can you feel me?

Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

Boy, I love you so
Just look in my eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah, can you feel me?

Boy, I love you so
Look in these eyes
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know
