Here we come yo, here we come

I'm just a brotherman, descendant of the motherland
I f*ck with blackberries and dimes and butter tens
Good on my right and trouble on my other hand
Life is a tight rope I'm dyin' the balance in
And by the end hopefully I be the balance-man
A simple dude who can exude the talents and
I am the captain of the hot blooded caravan
Spread in a different look to charred and battered lands
It's outta function I see girls that can top it off
I hold mines while these cowboys pop it off
You just a movie-dude claimin' that you pop-soft
This shit's like cold grits without the hot sauce
This government seems to me like it's off course

Come on come on
Let's move and get down
(Like it's off course)
Come on come on
Let's move (this government) and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
(Ride with me, come on)
Come on come on
Let's move and get down

Your dubious style may rock for right now
But in the long run, you really lost one
Jamaica, Queens-man land of the tossed gun
It's never easy police nah sees we
Go through the checkpoints birds flip to po nine
I got a bad bird nicknamed her sunshine
I treats her so kind sweetening her at nighttime
Into the right tunes we hit the right rhymes
I dig her fashion smash into my memory
And in the club shorty stays real into me
A humble dude and never will pretend to be
The type of artist that's desired for the industry
Came in this fucka me and I'm a leave me
And in the end B you would believe me that I'm a leave me
So what's a industry if the listeners will always stand beside me?

Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down

Here we come yo, here we come

Gather around, the Renissance man has finally appeared
And I'm astonishing rap characters are cause of the tears
Quasimodo and the quotables excrete from my mouth
And no doubt, we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the opposition's Abstract, bless your soul
They are the reason MCs but none on the level
Other you're the vocalist, precious like metal
Makin all my rounds through the towns like physician
I be curing inpure emcees, plagued with disease
So take a spoonful of Poet Penicillin and
Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance

Rap, Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance

So here we go, now
It is the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill, so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, niggas would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me, Big, Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher, I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit, Renaissance won't quit
We gon' baptize y'all for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr. Strange
Making cultures move, if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin, it won't bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we don't see it as one
We don't quit, bullshit, and we never lost, son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearing's impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it, it's like dynamite
And it's the Renaissance, rap

Uh, uh, it's the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uh, cause it's the Renaissance
It's the Renaissance, rap
It is the Renaissance rap

Now lookin at ya clock, you know that it's time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the T-O-P
That be G-O-D, and I be T-I-P
The promoter of the flyness, witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came, but I'm the royal highness
Don't'cha ever forget, who put the pep in ya step
We made it cool to wear medallions and say hotep
And this beat is suh'thin that you can't recover up from
You better a-joinin the force because we can't be done
Listen, we on this mission and it's a go
So welcome to the Renaissance in stereo
It's the Renaissance
