Well, we're all searching for peace of mind 
Love in this world is hard to find 
Come close to me, hold my hand 
And warm your heart 

Only a true love can satisfy 
Open your arms and close your eyes 
Walk with me, hold my hand 
And warm your heart 

Well, you're the reason for the way I'm feeling 
Cause I've never felt this way before 
I want to make you oh, so happy 
That's all I'm living for 

Just sorrow, yes, you should know 
We need each other 
When lights are low 
Stay with me, hold my hand 
And warm your heart 

Well, you're the reason for the way I'm feeling 
Cause I've never felt this way before 
I want to make you oh, so happy 
That's all I'm living for 

So come to me and make things right 
I'll keep you happy both day and night 
Stay with me, hold my hand 
And warm your heart
