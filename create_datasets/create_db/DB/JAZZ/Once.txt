Once, and only once
The one and only comes along
Once you took my hand
I felt your touch and I was strong
No wonder other simple love
Was not too clear to me
Though you were dear to me
I walked away

Who knew that once I knew your arms
Your arms would bind me to the past
I, who used to say
That nothing in the world could last
We live but once
And now I know my once was then
Please take me back
And love me once again

We live but once
And now I know my once was then
Please take me back
And love me once again
