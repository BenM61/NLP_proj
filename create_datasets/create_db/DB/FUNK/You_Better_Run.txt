What you tryin do to my heart
What you tryin do to my heart
You go around tellin lies
You foolin round with the other guy's
What you tryin do to my heart

You better run you better hide you better leave my side

What you tryin do to my soul
What you tryin do to my soul
Everythin I had was yours and no I'm closing all the doors
What you tryin do to my soul

You better run you better hide you better leave my side

I love you girl I love you so Can't you see it don't you know
I can't stand you alibi your tellin lies tell me why

What you tryin do to my head
What you tryin do to my head
Now I got my jaw outta line you're not gonna take my mind
Whata you tryin do to my head

You better run you better hide you better leave my side
