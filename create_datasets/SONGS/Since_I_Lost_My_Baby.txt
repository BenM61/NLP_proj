The sun  is shining, there's plenty of life
A new day is dawning sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night the sun is cold
And the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby, oh since I lost my baby

Look all the birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore and with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby), since I lost my baby (my baby)

Next time I'll be kinder, won't you please help me find her? 
Someone just remind her (someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her
'Til I find her I'll be tryin' now ('til I find her I'll be tryin' now)
Ev'ry day I'm more inclined to find her
Try to incline to find her
Every time to find my baby
I've been a-looking ev'rywhere, baby
I really, really care

I care, I care, my determination is fading fast 
Exploration is a thing of the past
I can't see my, my hope's gonna last
The good things are bad and what's happy it is sad, so sad, so sda, I'm sad

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)
Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)
I feel so bad, ooh, I'll feel so sad, 'cause everything is a-wrong
(Since I lost my baby)
I know it's not true
What's gonna happen to me
(Since I lost my baby)
What's gonna happen to me
Don't know, I don't know, I don't know 
I don't know, since I lost my baby
I don't know, I don't know what to do without my girl, my girl, my girl
I don't know, since I lost my baby
I can't find her nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere oh no
(I don't know, since I lost my baby)
I can't find her nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere 
(I don't know, since I lost my baby)
I can't find her nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere oh no
(I don't know, since I lost my baby)
