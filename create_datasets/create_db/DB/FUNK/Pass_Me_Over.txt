Another day
Chance to make another chance
A fragile place
Running on empty
A smile so faint
Barely even breaks the space
World's on shoulders now

Don't be afraid
He who knows will make a way
His word alone is what has kept me
Born the Son, King of eternal peace
Lay your burdens down

If you catch me dreaming
Please don't wake me till I'm done
Just leave me sleeping
Until the morning comes
Just pass me over
Make believe that I'm not there
Just leave me be
Until the Savior comes

Another night
Makes a way to the morn
Sleep in peace, joy come early
A covered child, steps away victorious
Salvation holds joy for all of us

If you catch me dreaming
Please don't wake me till I'm done
Just leave me sleeping
Until the morning comes
Just pass me over
Make believe that I'm not there
Just leave me be
Until the Savior comes

If you catch me dreaming
Please don't wake me till I'm done
Just leave me sleeping
Until the morning comes
Just pass me over
Make believe that I'm not there
Just leave me be
Until the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes

Pass me over
Pass me over
Pass me over
Till the Savior comes
