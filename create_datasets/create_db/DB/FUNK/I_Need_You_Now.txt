Not a second
Or another minute
Not an hour or another day
But at this moment with my arms out stretched
I need you to make a way
As you have done so many times before
Through  window or an open door
I stretch my hands to thee
Come rescue me
I need you right away

I need you now
I need you now
I need you now
I need you now

Not another second or another minute
Not an hour or another day
But Lord I need you right away

If I never needed you before
To show up and restore
All of the faith that I let slip
While I was yet searching the world for more
The truest friend I have indeed
You are my best friend I know in me
I stretch my hands to thee
Come rescue me
I need you right away

The agony of being alone
Fear of doing things on my own
The test and trials that come to make me strong
The feelings of guilt, hurt, shame and defeat
The waves of trials that beat upon me
But to know, Lord, that in you I've got victory

I need you now, Lord
I need you now, oh
I need you right now, right now, right now
I need you now

Oh, not another second
Not another minute, Lord
Can't wait another day, Lord
Oh no
Please make a way
Oh Lord
