This stoop is my throne, this hood is my home
And the sky's always blue by the brownstones
We in Brooklyn, it ain't no Beverly Hills
Basically we pay bills, then chill

It's like east coast bliss, it's like west coast diss
We do it like this and you seal it with a kiss
And a pound, that's just how it go down
It's the protocol, do you feel me all?

Saturday afternoon is all about the 9 to 4
And tonight we're gonna do it some more
Sunday mornin' hear the bands in the church play
All day long, every block there's a new song

Sittin' on the stoop in Bed-Stuy
Always sayin' hi when the brothers walk by
Just got the etiquette, sittin' on the top step
With a bag of chips, sit back, relax, enjoy the trip

We got a neighborly philosophy
I don't mess with you, you don't mess with me
It is what it is, it ain't all hard up in the hood
Sittin' on my front stoop and it's all good

Boys in white beaters and corn rolls
Wear their pants down low so their briefs can show
Girls be always dressed up, givin' their best stuff
Workin' that hairdo, boys are gonna bless you

Always some commotion at the corner store
That the corner cops chose to ignore
Everybody write tune to a different song
When they pass by I bob my head along

I can't (Incomprehensible) but don't mind the aroma
If the deli out of (Incomprehensible) then I settle for corona
And I claim my spot for the evenin'
Let the part begin, we gonna do it again

Sittin' on the stoop in Bed-Stuy
Always sayin' hi when the brothers walk by
Just got the etiquette, sittin' on the top step
With a bag of chips, sit back, relax, enjoy the trip

We got a neighborly philosophy
I don't mess with you, you don't mess with me
It is what it is, it ain't all hard up in the hood
Sittin' on my front stoop and it's all good

It's all good, it's all good
'Cause I love my hood, love my hood
It's all good, it's all good
?Cause I love my hood, love my hood

Sittin' on the stoop in Bed-Stuy
Always sayin' hi when the brothers walk by
Just got the etiquette, sittin' on the top step
With a bag of chips, sit back, relax, enjoy the trip

We got a neighborly philosophy
I don't mess with you, you don't mess with me
It is what it is, it ain't all hard up in the hood
Sittin' on my front stoop and it's all good
