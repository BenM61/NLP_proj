It's easy to laugh at my desire 
(To laugh at my desire) 
Too easy to catch my heart on fire 
(Fire, fire, fire)...

When you're looking so divine 
My heart's in motion 
When you slip your hand in mine 
I'm in commotion...

Just how I lost my head for you again 
I'm not sure, I could tell you 
But now you've got me down your road again 
I've lost all track of time...

When you're near I'm on my knees 
In blind devotion 
When you're gone I don't know where 
I've got this notion...

And now I'm feeling like a fool again 
I'm drowning in desire 
I know you're laughing at the state I'm in 
You know it drives me wild...
