Do you not hear me anymore 
I know it's not your thing to care 
I know it's cool to be so bored 
I sucks me in 
When you're aloof 
It sucks me in, it sucks it works 
I guess it's cool to be alone 

Will you never rest 
Fighting the battle of who could care less 
Everyday you wake up late 
Sometimes I wish I was 
That way 

And you think Rockford Files is cool 
But there are some things 
That you would change 
If it were up to you 
So think about your masterpiece (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Watch the Rockford Files 
And call to see if Paul can score some weed. 

Do you never rest 
Fighting the battle of who could care less 
Unearned unhappiness 
That's all right I guess

I've got this great idea 
Why don't we pitch it to the Franklin Fucking Mint 
Fine pewter portraits of 
General apathy and major boredom singing
Whatever and ever Amen 

Oh well maybe not I'll try again 
This should cheer you up for sure 
See I've got your old I.D. 
And you're all dressed up like the Cure 

You never rest 
Fighting the battle 
Of who could care less 
Unearned unhappiness 
You're my hero I confess
