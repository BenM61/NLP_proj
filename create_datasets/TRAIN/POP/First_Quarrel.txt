Both We had our first quarrel today 
Paula I threw your picture away 
Paul Im sorry I made you cry 
Paula Forgive me, so am I 
Both We had our first quarrel today 

Paul I thought I saw you with Jim 
Paula I was just talking with him 
Paul Well, I guess I had it wrong 
Paula I should have been at home 
Both We had our first quarrel today 

What may seem wrong at the time isnt always true 
Our love will go on as long as theres me and you 

Paul What was it all about? 
Paula I dont remember now 
Both We had our first quarrel today 

What may seem wrong at the time isnt always true 
Our love will go on as long as theres me and you 

Paul What was it all about? 
Paula I dont remember now 
Both We had our first quarrel today
