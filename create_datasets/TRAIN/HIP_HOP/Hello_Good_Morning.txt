Yeah, yeah

Hello, good morning
Lets go, lets ride,
Hello, good morning
Hello, good morning
Know you've been wait-in' for it
Cause I seen you watchin'
So lets go
Lets get it poppin'

Cause I've been leaning on the bar
Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads wont give me my props
Twenty five on the bank I be stunting on there ass
And they mad cause the bitch won't stop
Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
Stuntin' like you looking like a movie
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
And everybody know who the truth be
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
I blow cause I'm blowing on the ooh wee
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
Hello

Hello, good morning, how you doing? What the move is?
Welcome to the future I'm the captain of the cool kids
The revolutions never been televised
Great booty better thighs I ain't wanna tell her bye
First, I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell her lie the night you couldn't find a better guy
King shit fly to anywhere you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of them, honey feel free to bring with
G-5 waiting, fly away at my convenience
You seen Tip checking in a 5 star suite with some 5 star freaks
Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V
I was in the back when y'all sleep
In a fast car super bad broad back seat
That's me, see I'm nothing nice, f*ck a couple nights
See the moon say goodbye and the sun greeting us like

Hello, Good morning
Lets go, lets ride,
Hello, good morning
Hello, good evening
You blow, you feindin'
Cause you know that your really needed
And I'm the one that you wanna be with
But right now baby you dreaming
Wake up and turn the lights off

Cause I've been leaning on the bar
Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads wont give me my props
Twenty five on the bank I be stunting on there ass
And they mad cause the bitch won't stop
Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
Stuntin' like you looking like a movie
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
And everybody know who the truth be
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
I blow cause I'm blowing on the ooh wee
(you know, you know, you know, we on that)
