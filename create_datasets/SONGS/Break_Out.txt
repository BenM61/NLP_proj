Aw hey, I'm sick and tired of everybody just pushin' us around
Yeah, treatin' us like we're nothin and always puttin' us down

Say, I ain't no fool and I ain't gonna let them treat us this way
I ain't gonna stop until I reach the top someday

They're gonna respect us baby
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Breakout now, gotta breakout now
Breakout now, gotta breakout now

Packin' all my bags, I'm movin' on
I won't hear that small talk when I'm gone

Hey, you know what?
Our lives are gonna waste away in this rut we're in
Sneakin' from place to place, baby, and feelin' like it's all a sin
Oh, I ain't gonna run no more and I ain't gonna hide
I ain't gonna stop until I reach the top of time

It ain't no good this way baby
No, No, No, No

Breakout now, gotta breakout now
Oooohhh yeah, Breakout now, we gotta breakout now
Breakout, Breakout

Come on baby
Let's start to, let's start to feel it now
Wanna, want you to come with me

Oooohhh yeah, breakout now, we gotta breakout now
I cain't, I cain't, I cain't a stop it now
We gotta, we gotta breakout now
