Never trust your own emotions
They'll always let you down
And the one that's closest to you
May not always be around

I never questioned
The promises you made
Every time I gave my heart
I was betrayed

What a fool
That I should ever believe
In love, truth and honesty
All the time
You just keep on hurting me

Maybe everyone's a stranger
I watch them come and go
But I think everyone's in danger
If they let their feelings show

There's a lesson
And a price you have to pay
If you give your heart
Dont let it be betrayed

What a fool
That I should ever believe
In love, truth and honesty
All the time
You just keep on hurting me

What a fool
Every time I find I'm deceived
Where is the love, truth and honesty
If you see it
Won't you bring it on home to me

There's a lesson
And a price you have to pay
If you give your heart
Dont let it be betrayed

What a fool
That I should ever believe
In love, truth and honesty
All the time
You just keep on hurting me

What a fool
Every time I find I'm deceived
Where is the love, truth and honesty
If you see it
Won't you bring it on home to me
