Darlin' don't you go and cut your hair
Do you think it's gonna make him change?
"I'm just a boy with a new haircut"
And that's a pretty nice haircut
Charge it like a puzzle,
Hit me wearin' muzzles
Hesitate to die, look around, around,
The second drummer's drowned
His telephone is found

Music scene is crazy,
Bands start up each and every day
I saw another one just the other day
A special new band
I remember lying
I don't remember lies
I don't remember what

But I don't care,
I care,
I really don't care
Did you see the drummer's hair?

Advertising looks and chops a must
No big hair!
Songs mean a lot
When songs are bought
And so are you
Bitch, rant down to the practice room
Attention and fame so
Career, career, career
