Broadway, broadway
Everybody's happy and gay
Where the night is brighter than day
Up along broadway

Sweethearts and beaus
Dressed up in their sunday best cloths
On their way to movies and shows
Up along broadway

Out of town, I'm low down
When I walk along the main street
Anywhere I don't care
I always find a main street just another plain street

Broadway
Take a little time out to play
Where the joy of living holds way
Up along broadway
