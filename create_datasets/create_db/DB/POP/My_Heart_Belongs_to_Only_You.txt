My heart belongs to only you
I've never loved as I love you
You've set a flame within me burning
A flame to stay within me yearning
It's just for you I want to live
It's just to you my heart I give
I'll always be your slave my darling
Through the coming years

There were sometimes when I was doubtful
Of this new love affair
But now my mind is no more doubtful
I've found my heaven with the help of a prayer

You are the song within my soul
A melody that can't grow old
I've known for long
My heart belongs to only you

You are the song within my soul
A melody that can't grow old
I've known for long
My heart belongs to only you
