Your booty might be bigga
But I still can pull your nigga
But I don't want him
Ya got sugar on your pita
But ya nigga thinks I'm sweeter
But I don't want him
Ya know the whole encyclopedia
But ya nigga thinks I'm deeper
But I don't want him
Got a whole lot a junk off in ya trunk
But ya nigga think I'm live and I keep him crunk
I don't want him

Hey, hey, hey
I don't want him cause of what he doin to you
And you don't need him
Cause he ain't ready
See I don't want him
If he ain't made no arrangement with you
I hope you would've done the same thing for me too

Your kisses might be wetter
But your nigga likes mine better
But I don't want him
Ya got the beans and rice and the hot ho cakes
But ya nigga still over here in my plate
I don't want him
Ya got a PHD, Magna Cum Laude
But ya nigga love me with a GED
I don't want him
You the one with all the money
And he knows my money's funny
But I don't want him

Hey, hey, hey
I don't want him
Cause of what he's done to you
And you don't need him
Cause the boy ain't ready

Got ya pad all decked out fa sho
But ya niggas at my door, though
I don't want him
Well you can do the butterfly and the tootsie roll 
But ya nigga straight sprung off the way I stroll
I don't want him
Ya know the whole 120 and a plus degree
But you can't keep ya guy up off his knees
I don't want him
Got a 9-5 and a 6-10 
But ya nigga told me not to work again 
I don't want him

Hey, hey, hey
I don't want him
Cause of what he doin' to you
And you don't need him
Cause he ain't ready
See I don't want him
If he ain't made no arrangement with you
I hope you would've done the same thing for me too
