Half The Way
Crystal Gayle
(Bobby Wood & Ralph Murphy)

Half of your love is just not what I'm after
Part of your world is just not what I need
Some of your time is like one glass of water
Just leaves me thirsty for wine

So fill me up to the top
Wo don't you stop till I'm over-flowing
Love is the seed and, babe, I need you
To keep it growing
Stronger every day; Oh, no
Don't take me half the way
Don't take me half the way.

Never before have I settled for second
All of my life I have hungered for more
Now I can see where your sweet love can lead me
This is what I've waited for

Half of your love is just not what I'm after
Part of your world is just not what I need
Now I can see where your sweet love can lead me
This is what I've waited for
