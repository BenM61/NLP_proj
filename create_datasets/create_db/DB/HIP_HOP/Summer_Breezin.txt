Brand new one on the radio
Just play mi inna stereo
Ha-ha

Summer breezin'
Yeh, mon, summertime
Summer breezin'
Uh-uh

So I call Michelle up on the cell
Bring your Nike bikini and nothing else
We're goin' to the beach, take the top off the jeep
And bring Chantel as well

And the boys upstairs want to come
But they remind me of Dumber and Dumb
Oh, Lord brought the heat, so turn the car key
Gonna have a little fun in the sun, yeh-yeh-yeh

Summer breezin'
Mmm, everywhere I go everybody I know
Is kissing on the beach and flossing on the streets
And lookin' for a love so sweet

Summer breezin'
Mmm, I'm just chilling in the sun with mi chocolate
Bun
Ooh, I got a lover, but I might find another
If I drink enough of tequila

Everywhere, everyone
Everywhere

Bounty Killer is blarin', everybody's staring
Checking out the bling-bling-bling we're wearing
Strolling down the boardwalk, licking all the boy talk,
Well
I feel like that song by Bobby McFerrin

No worries 'cause everything cool
No school, no rules, just jump in the pool
G-strings and jerk chicken wings
These are the things that summertime brings

Summer breezin'
Mm, everywhere I go everybody I know
Is kissing on the beach and flossing on the streets
And lookin' for a love so sweet

Summer breezin'
Mm, I'm just chilling in the sun with mi chocolate
Bun
Ooh, I got a lover, but I might find another
If I drink enough of tequila

Everyone, everywhere
Everyone, everywhere (Mm, hm)

Summer breezin'
See, I've been watching you all day
Meet me later at the News Cafe
And if everything feels right
We'll go skinny dipping in the warm moonlight, yeah
Warm moonlight, warm moonlight

Shoot, what time is it
Oops

Six, forty five and sun is arisin'
Me and Michelle and Chantel feel like hell
I'm gonna sleep till two and call up my crew
And do it all over again

Summer breezin'
Mm, everywhere I go everybody I know
Is kissing on the beach and flossing on the streets
And lookin' for a love so sweet

Summer breezin'
Mmm, I'm just chilling in the sun with mi chocolate
Bun
Ooh, I got a lover, but I might find another
If I drink enough of tequila

Summer breezin'
Mm, everywhere I go everybody I know
Kissing on the beach and flossing on the streets
And lookin' for a love so sweet

Summer breezin'
Mm, I'm just chilling in the sun with mi chocolate
Bun
Ooh, I got a lover, but I might find another
