Through our love there runs a century spring
What we've got is all we'll ever need
And I will love you like wind blows through the trees
And sing about how good it feels to love you, amy

Who we are is who we've always been
Through our love we've learned to live again
And I will love you, my dear, you've set me free
I promise you a love para siempre, amy
