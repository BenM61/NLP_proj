Now I wanna tell ya of a great love, oh
It will light up
It will surely light up darkened worlds
If you just believe

Stoned love
Stoned love
Stoned love
Oh yeah

A love for each other will bring fighting to an end
Forgiving one another, time after time doubt creeps in
But like the sun lights up the sky with a message from above
Oh yeah, I find no other greater symbol of love

Yeah, don't ya hear the wind blowing
Stoned love
Oh yeah, I tell ya I ain't got no other
Stoned love
Oh yeah

And life is so short, put the present time at hand
Oh yeah, and if you're young at heart, rise up and take your stand
And to the man on whose shoulder the world must depend
I pray for peace and love, amen

Oh, can't ya feel it
Stoned love
I tell ya I ain't got no other
Stoned love
Oh yeah

If the war 'tween our nations passed, oh yeah
Will the love 'tween our brothers and sisters last?
On and on and on and on and

Stoned love
Oh yeah
I tell ya I ain't got no other
Stoned love

Can't ya, can't ya, can't ya, can't ya, can't ya feel it
Stoned love
Oh yeah stoned, stoned, stoned, stoned

Stoned love
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stoned love
Oh yeah, yeah
Stoned love
