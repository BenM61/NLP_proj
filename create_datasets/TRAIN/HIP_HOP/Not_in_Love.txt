You're always drunk when yo come around
I know you think that you got me down
Funny 'cause you couldn't be more wrong

I'll be right back, I bet you hate that

I'm done tryna talk with your speakers loud
You don't give me none, you give me nothing
And it feels so good as I'm walking out
Out of your house, I'll be screaming

I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you, in love with you

Here we go, another six missed calls
I'll be a hypocrite and miss them all
I gave you me, but you pay me no time, no time
No love line, now you wanna turn tides
So I hope you have, have a lovely night
With your video games and your excuses
Boy, it feels so good as I'm walking out
And slam the door, 'cause I need it

I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you, in love with you

Stop letting your girls get in the middle of things
You act like staying's a decision-al thang
Every time you record when we doing our thing
I'm like, "girl, put that away, why you playin' them video games?"
I can see your halo and a physical thing
Just came back from nowhere, but here we go again
Conversation been going for too long
This time, we gon' see who the fool on
You told me you get cold feet
That's why we had to go out and get our shoes on

I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you, in love with you

I'm not in love, not in love, not in love with you
I'm not in love, not in love, not in love with you
You'll be my date and no one in the morning
I'm not in love, not in love, not in love with you
