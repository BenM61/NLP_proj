Yeah!

If I had your number I'd call you on the phone 
I'd breathe real heavy, if that didn't work 
Maybe I'll start to groan 
I don't love you, I'm just a horny toad

I don't want your money 'cause I got all I need 
All I want is to rub your body 
Until you start to bleed 
I don't love you, I'm just a horny toad

Ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
If I had your address I'd come right to your door 
I'd knock all day till you let me in 
And then I'd knock some more 
I ain't crazy, I'm just a horny toad

If you think I'm nasty, you ain't seen nothin' yet 
You see, I'm the kinda brother that the more you scream 
The nastier I get 
I can't help it, I'm just a horny toad

Now watch me dance

Run, go tell your boyfriend his lovin' has got too old 
He might as well pack his things 
And get his dead ass on the road 
Tell him you live on a lily pad
With a horny toad, whoa, yeah!
