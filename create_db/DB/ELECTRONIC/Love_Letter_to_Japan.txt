From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet

My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me

Dearest one, I had a dream
I mouthed the words
The sound came out
I spoke to you in Japanese
Oh, my love I cannot see, I heard your name
I know at once there was no place I'd rather be
All at once there was no place that I would rather be

From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet

My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace,
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me

I packed my bag, I'm on my way
I am prepared for any season
I am prepared to stay
Here is my heart, my beating heart
Oh, how I'm longing for this love affair to start
How I'm longing for this love affair to finally start

From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet

My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me

From the west to the east I have flown to be near you
I have come all this way to be close, to be here with you
And now, all my heart I will lay down precisely at your feet

My beloved, oh my sweet
All the gifts you have given me
The patience and the peace,
Cherry blossoms and the candy
I am yours, I am yours
For as long, for as long as you will have me
