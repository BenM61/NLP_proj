I go round moping, and I go around blue
I made you cry cause I had been untrue
And now I cry for you

[[Chorus]]:
Won't you come back silly girl
come back to me
Come back silly girl can't you see
I'm in love
Your mother tells me that you're not at home
Each time I call you on the telephone
Oh I'm so lost and alone

[Chorus]
Come back, my love
Come back, my love
Don't know how long I can go on this way
I think of you most every day
I only hope and pray

[Chorus]
Come back silly girl can't you see I'm in love
Come back silly girl can't you see I'm in love
Come back silly girl can't you see I'm in love
