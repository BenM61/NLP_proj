Coming from the stars
Into that space
No healing
When a lonely heart's displaced
Left behind
In a foreign land
So should he dare
To reach out his small hand

He's a foreigner
He will never be same
A foreigner
Wants to be from where he came

Coming from the stars
Into that world
So far away
From what he calls his home
A begging to be free
To let him go
A groaning scream
Surrounding any soul

He's a foreigner
He will never be same
A foreigner
Wants to be from where he came

He's a foreigner
