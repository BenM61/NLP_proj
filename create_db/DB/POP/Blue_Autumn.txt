Blue autumn,
Falling leaves of red and gold,
Pretty colors, I am told,
But I see only shades of blue,
Because I'm losing you

Blue autumn,
There's a rainbow in the sky,
But no matter how I try,
I still see only shades of blue,
Because I'm losing you

Such pretty colors I am told,
There for all to see,
But falling leaves of red and gold have autumn blue to me

Blue autumn,
A love like yours I'll never know,
Other girls may come and go,
But I'll see only shades of you,
And all my autumns will be blue
