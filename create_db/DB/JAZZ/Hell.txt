In the afterlife 
You could be headed for the serious strife 
Now you make the scene all day 
But tomorrow there'll be Hell to pay 

People listen attentively 
I mean about future calamity 
I used to think the idea was obsolete 
Until I heard the old man stamping his feet. 

This is a place where eternally 
Fire is applied to the body 
Teeth are extruded and bones are ground 
Then baked into cakes which are passed around. 

Beauty, talent, fame, money, refinement 
Top skill and brain 
But all the things you try to hide 
Will be revealed on the other side. 

Now the D and the A and the M 
And the N and the A 
And the T and the I-O-N 
Lose your face, lose your name 
Then get fitted for a suit of flame
