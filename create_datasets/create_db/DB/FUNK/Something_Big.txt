Hey hey hey hey everybody
I got something to say
I met this man named Jesus
And I ain't never been the same
You know my heart's been changed
My mind's been changed
I'm nothing like I was
'Cause I was stuck on stupid
But now I'm filled with love

You know something big done happened to me
(Something big done happened to me)
And I gotta tell the world about it
(I gotta tell the world about it)
'Cause if I keep it to myself
(If I keep it to myself)
How you gon' find out about it
(How you gon' find out about it)
Jesus took the worst of me
(Jesus took the worst of me)
And helped me get myself together
(And helped me get myself together)
Greatest man in history
(Greatest man in history)
And can't nobody do it better
(Can't nobody do it better)

Oh no
If your soul is sinking
And feeling like your lost
Don't know who to turn to
Then let's go to the cross
But Jesus bled, and Jesus died
And Jesus took the fall
But all your wrong
And all my wrong
Jesus pitied all

You know something big done happened to me
(Something big done happened to me)
And I gotta tell the world about it
(I gotta tell the world about it)
'Cause if I keep it to myself
(If I keep it to myself)
How you gon' find out about it

And helped me get myself together

Can't nobody do it better
