Metal beat
Metal beat
Metal beat
Metal beat

Jim Suit
Black hair
Dim skin
Gold teeth

A trickle voice like a silver sheet

The pulling of the lights
Reflecting in my eyes
Pick up a flip-top box from the vinyl seat

Metal beat

Drift in
Drift out
We're gone
I'm here

Click on
Click off
No-no
Don't get too near

Name on the shatterproof glass
Melt into a mass
Let's slide across me in this heat

Metal beat
