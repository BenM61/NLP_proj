You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm  you know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 

Now you know where I've been 
As you sleep  shine I am 
Waiting down patiently 
Born of love 

You know I'm  you know I'm not dead 
I'm just living in my head 
Forever waiting on the ways of your desire 
You always find your way 

And through it all  into us all you move 
Forgotten touch, forbidden thought 
We can never, ever know 

You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm, you know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 

Down below the creatures scream 
Strangehold of God's machines 
Begging to tear us out 
Torn is hope 

You know I'm, you know I'm not dead 
I'm just the tears inside your head 
Forever waiting on the ways of your desire 
You always find a way 

And through it all, into us all you move 
Forgotten touch, forbidden thought 
We can never, ever know 
You know I'm not dead 

We all want to hold in the everlasting gaze 
Enchanted in the rapture of his sentimental sway 
But underneath the wheels lie the skulls of every cog 
The fickle fascination of an everlasting God 

You know I'm not dead 
I'm just living in my head 

Forever waiting, forever waiting a cruel death 

You know I'm not dead 
I'm just living for myself 
Forever waiting 

You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead 
You know I'm not dead
