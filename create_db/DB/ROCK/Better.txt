If I kiss you where it's sore
If I kiss you where it's sore
Will you feel better, better, better?
Will you feel anything at all?
Will you feel better, better, better?
Will you feel anything at all?

Born like sisters to this world
In a town where blood ties are only blood
If you never say your name out loud to anyone
They can never ever call you by it

If I kiss you where it's sore
If I kiss you where it's sore
Will you feel better, better, better?
Will you feel anything at all?
Will you feel better, better, better?
Will you feel anything at all?

You're getting sadder, getting sadder, getting sadder, getting sadder
And I don't understand, and I don't understand
But if I kiss you where it's sore
If I kiss you where it's sore
Will you feel better, better, better?
Will you feel anything at all?
Will you feel better, better, better?
Will you feel anything at all
Will you feel anything at all
Anything at all?
Will you feel anything at all
Anything at all?
Will you feel anything at all
Anything at all?
Will you feel anything at all
Anything at all?
Will you feel anything at all
