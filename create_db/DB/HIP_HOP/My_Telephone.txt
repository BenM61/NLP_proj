Telephone, got me hangin' on the line
Telephone, wastin' all my time
Ooh, I can live without my telephone

Telephone, can't you leave it till I'm through
Telephone, we've got better things to do
Ooh, I can live without my telephone

Telephone, got me hangin' on the line
Telephone, wastin' all my time
Ooh, I can live without my telephone

Ooh, I can live without my telephone
My telephone

It don't matter where I am, telephones are in a jam
Can't finish anything, the telephone is always ringin'
Got no job, got no pay, don't let them take my phone away
In my car or in my home

Everybody's gettin' it on the phone
Everybody's gettin' it on the telephone
Everybody's gettin' it on the phone
Everybody's gettin' it on the telephone

Telephone, got me hangin' on the line
Telephone, wastin' all my time
Ooh, I can live without my telephone

Telephone, always ringin' in my head
Telephone, always get me out of bed
Ooh, I can live without my telephone

Ooh, I can live without my telephone
Telephone
