You sit and wait
For my precious heart to break
You promised me forever
Why did you tear us apart?
At the end of the rainbow
I found my broken heart
I was a dreamer
And you were my dream
Why did you leave?
Welcome home to my Broken Promise Land
Where the sun don't shine
And the cold wind whines
Welcome home to my Never Ending Land
Where the skies are grey
There's no star to lead my way
You said you'd never walk away
You promised me forever
But I didn't realize
You never meant to keep me
All you promises were lies
I was a dreamer...
Welcome home to my Broken Promise Land
Where the sun don't shine
And the cold wind whines
Welcome home to my Never Ending Land
Where the skies are grey
There's no star to lead my way
You said you'd never walk away
You made me cry
You made me want to die
Why, baby why?
Why did you lie?
Welcome home to my Broken Promise Land
Where the sun don't shine
And the cold wind whines
Welcome home to my Never Ending Land
Where the skies are grey
There's no star to lead my way
You said you'd never walk away
