Time stands still in my heart
I don't know where you are
Longing for what I deny
Can we just turn it around tonight?

[Chorus: x2]
And do you know (without you I just go crazy?)
And do you know (that all I think about is where you are?)
And do you know (that only you can save me baby?)
From going through this life all alone

When will missing you stop
Seems we lost before the start
Holding back what was inside
Can we just let it all out tonight?

And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?

[Chorus: x2]
Do you know
Don't look back on yesterday
I believe we can find a way
Don't let hopes and dreams fade
Don't hesitate it's not too late

I go crazy
I go crazy

And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?

[Chorus: x2]
