Amy woulda died for me 
She would've had my baby 
If I needed a favor 
It was yes, she never said maybe 

And all the time that we walked barefoot in the sand 
Somehow we never felt the rain 
Now I got nothin but time 
Nothing but mine 

I could walk off the hurt 
Run through the pain 
Wipe all the tears pouring down my face 
Deny the dream, that just never was 

Oh girl 
I just can't walk off the buzz 
Amy used to call me all the time 
But she hasn't lately 

I wonder if she goes out at all 
And if she's dating 
And every time I walk alone along the beach somehow 
I always feel the rain 

So many times I wished for my space 
Now I wish I didn't feel so outta place 
I could walk off the fear 
Crawl through the hate 

Beg you to forgive, my every mistake 
Pretend you and I, it just never was 
Oh girl 
I just can't walk off the buzz 

And now that I'm lonely 
I see you were the only one 
Who ever knew me and could 
See right through me 

I could walk off the hurt 
Run through the pain 
Wipe all the tears pouring down my face 
Deny the dream, that just never was 

Oh girl 
I just can't walk off the buzz 
I just can't walk off the buzz 
I just can't walk off the buzz
