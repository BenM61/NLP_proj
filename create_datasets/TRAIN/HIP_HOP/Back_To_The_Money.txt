I apologize to the streets, my bad (my bad)
For taking so long
You know I don't do it like that
Real niggas understand (uh)
Now let's get back to it (too hood to be Hollywood)
Let's get this money uh uh uh

Yeah, yeah, let's get it (let's get it)
This money
Let's get it, let's get it
Ya ready, look (yay yay yah)

It's back to the money (money), back to the block (block)
Back on the charts (charts), straight to the top (top)
Me I'm a hustla I can't stop won't stop
If I ain't on the route I'm in the one stop shop (yeah)
Everywhere I go they ask me 'Geezy where ya been?'
You ain't been looking hard enough I tell em look again (look again)
I hit the sit back, clock plan strategize
I look in the mirror and all I see is dollar signs (signs)
I can't lie, I had started to feel the recession
I signed my deal but I really wasn't feeling progression
But I'm a go getta, by all means I'm a get it
I'm a executer if I started then I'm a finish

(Hook: Magnolia Chop)
You know you ain't seen me in so long
But if you thinking I been gone, ya dead wrong
Cause I was getting back to the money, back to the money
Back to the money, back to the money
If you know about me
You know that I be in them streets, I can't sleep
I gotta get back to the money, back to the money (yeah)
Back to the money, back to the money (back to it)

(Verse 2: B.G.)
No bullshit, no frontin' no stunnin' (stunnin
All on my money is getting back to the money (money)
Back to the cheese (cheese) back to the cheddar (cheddar)
Back to the green (green) and for that it's whatever (whatever)
Know when you on the hustle (hustle) nigga it's no sleep (sleep)
You know when you on the grind ya gets no seeds (no seeds)
It's all work no play with the young thug
I bust a snitch that I lost my number one thug (f*ck em)
But I ain't trippin' cause I keep a line on that yay (yay)
And everyday it's all work and no play (play)
I been on the low (low) I been in the cut (cut)
But if you really know me you know I been on one

(Hook: Magnolia Chop)
You know you ain't seen me in so long
But if you thinking I been gone, ya dead wrong
Cause I was getting back to the money, back to the money
Back to the money, back to the money
If you know about me
You know that I be in them streets, I can't sleep
I gotta get back to the money, back to the money
Back to the money, back to the money

(Verse 3: B.G.)
Yeah, it's back to the streets (streets) back to the block (block)
Back to the same spot where I made it hot (hah hah)
Back to VL, where I sold my first rock (rock)
And it's uptown where I bust my first glock (blah, blah)
I'm a real nigga and that's everything you not (not)
I like to have things so I got everything you ain't got (got)
Disrespecting me in mind, you goin get shot
I got a firehead looking down to the top

(Hook x2: Magnolia Chop)
You know you ain't seen me in so long
But if you thinking I been gone, ya dead wrong
Cause I was getting back to the money, back to the money
Back to the money, back to the money
If you know about me
You know that I be in them streets, I can't sleep
I gotta get back to the money, back to the money
Back to the money, back to the money
