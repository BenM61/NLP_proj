We are water of tears you're watching go
Even seen in the years, they come and go
We remember the world that's in our mind
So then everything you had ever seen
Every color of memory, that's end
Everyone of ahead is opponent

We come in a star shine and arise
Within the pictures of the other side
I know we slide
We come in the best fly over here
Gala's between the blue skies there to raining sends
We can fly

If you tired of listen close your mind
You cough me on your reason far behind
We spoke in the silence as before
We are everything all you have to do
Is think of me, as in to you
We deliver messages of "put me up"

We come in a star shine and arise
Within the pictures of the other side
I know we slide
We come in the best fly over here
Gala's between the blue skies there to raining sends
We can fly
We come in a star shine and arise
Within the pictures of the other side
I know we slide
We come in the best fly over here
Gala's between the blue skies there to raining sends
We can fly
Fly away

Oh, we can fly! Oh

If you coming closer, take my hand
There's no limit around me, understand
We going far
We are everything all you have to do
Is think of me, as in to you
We deliver messages of "put me up"

We come in a star shine and arise
Within the pictures of the other side
I know we slide
We come in the best fly over here
Gala's between the blue skies there to raining sends
We can fly
We come in a star shine and arise
Within the pictures of the other side
I know we slide
We come in the best fly over here
Gala's between the blue skies there to raining sends
We can fly

We come in a star shine and arise
We can fly, oh oh, woh
We come in a star shine we can fly, we can fly
