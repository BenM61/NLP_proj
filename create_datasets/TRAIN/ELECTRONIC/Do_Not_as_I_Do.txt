She was haunted by the dead but friendly ghosts
As her helpers, they stayed as her hosts
But the reason why she kept on was a fear for herself
Yes, she was dangerous, she might
Drink some wine
Sing all night
Mess up the yard
Steal a man, rape his love
Then throw it away
And she became what she tried to avoid, she said

Do now as I say, darling
Not as I do
See the way I play, kid
Now do as I do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do not as I do
Or you'll feel blue

That which no one knew was that her love was gone
Stolen from her dead man long ago
Their son was treated bad my her ego and selfish thoughts
She cared less 'bout him than 'bout her own
He was soft, now he's hard
Seemingly strong
All he'd get was empty looks, no confirmation
All he was taught was through her, and keep quiet, see

Do now as I say, darling
Not as I do
See the way I play, kid
Now do as I do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do not as I do
Or you'll feel blue

It's not possible to teach a kid
By preaching
When you the opposite

Do now as I say, darling
Not as I do
See the way I play, kid
Now do as I do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do not as I do
Or you'll feel blue

Do now as I say, darling
Not as I do
See the way I play, kid
Now do as I do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do not as I do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, or you'll feel blue
Or you'll feel blue
