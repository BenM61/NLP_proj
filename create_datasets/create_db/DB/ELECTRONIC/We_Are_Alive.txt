Have you seen a movie? 
Kisses and goodbye. 
Have you seen a dark cloud? 
Fades into night. 
Have you seen a new one? 
Telling me the lights. 

Causes like a boomerang 
A feeling deep inside. 

Ain't not know 
Ain't about you. 
You don't know 
That about me. 
I don't know 
That about you. 
But if we really feel

We are alive
Take a breath 
We are alive
Take a deep breath 
We are alive
Take a breath 
We are alive 
Take a deep breath 

We're in a movie 
As fly up to the sky 
Help me, love will be 
The foolest game to get me high. 
Let's drive out this highway, 
Feel my future vain. 
Let this twist and want to love you so, 
Here we go. 

You don't know 
That about me. 
I don't know 
That about you. 
You don't know 
That about me. 

But let's enjoy with you 

We are alive 
Take a breath 
We are alive 
Take a deep breath 
We are alive 
Take a breath 
We are alive
Take a deep breath 

Don't take yourself too seriously. 
The night when we sing
We may wear different cloakes, 
Pray to God, different vogues. 

But we're not alone. 
We are alive

We are alive
Take a breath 
We are alive 
Take a deep breath 
We are alive
We are alive, we're alive 
We are alive 
We are alive 
We are alive 
Take a deep breath 
Take a deep breath 
Take a deep breath 
Take a deep breath
