Well hung, friend of mine
He's size 8 -I'm size 9
Sucks my dick
I'm gonna get a lick from you

One thing, one thing too, one thing to remember
That I could have, yes I could have, ooh
Yes I could have, I could have stood you up
But I did, did, didn't yeah yeah

Short fuse, lights blew out
Power came back - hear them shout
Sucks my dick
Gotta get a lick from you

One thing, one thing too, one thing to remember
That I could have, yes I could have, ooh
Yes I could have, I could have stood you up
But I did, did, didn't yeah yeah

My shoes, walk down the street
Only trouble is they ain't on my feet
Dig them kicks, they belong to me

One thing, one thing too, one thing to remember
That I could have, yes I could have, ooh
Yes I could have, I could have stood you up
But I did, did, didn't yeah yeah

Rip it up, rip it down
Change the shape of the whole damn town,
Sucks my dick
I'm gonna get a lick from you

One thing, one thing too, one thing to remember
That I could have, yes I could have, ooh
Yes I could have, I could have stood you up
But I did, did, didn't yeah yeah
