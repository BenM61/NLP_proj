After he hurt you, you said you were leaving
You got up to walk out the door
The story he's telling you, you weren't believin'
You've certainly heard it before

And I can't stand it, you're feeling so sad
I can't take it, it's makin' me mad
Say the word and I will rescue you
(Say the word, say the word)
Say the word and I will come to rescue you.
I could be wrong, but unless I'm mistaken, it's only a matter of time.
And I know you're giving him more than you've taken;
You've come to the end of the line.
And I can't stand it, you're feeling so sad.
I can't take it, it's makin' me mad.
Say the word and I will rescue you.
(Say the word, say the word)
Say the word and I will come to rescue you.
(Say the word, say the word)
Something missing in your life; tell you what I say;
Blues are on the run and help is on the way.
Something missing in your life; tell you what I'll do.
Just like in a fairy tale, I'll rescue you. I'm gonna rescue you.
I just can't take it when your feeling so sad.
I can't take it, it's making me mad.
Something missing in your life; tell you what I say;
Blues are on the run and help is on the way.
Something missing in your life; tell you what I'll do.
Just like in a fairy tale, I'll rescue you. I'm gonna rescue you.
Say the word and I will rescue you.
(Say the word, say the word)
Say the word and I will come to rescue you.
(You know that help is on the way)
