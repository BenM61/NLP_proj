You pace a rhythm for
Love to evolve
It takes the clock off my heart
A strange vibration
That purifys my soul

dreamy days in my room
By your side as we bloom
Colors blend and fade
In cherished moments like these
The key to all the love I feel
Is in me
I can see
It is you
You give me everything I need
To believe
To be real
Flaming June

the summer winds have gotten hold of me
Like sugar cane 'round my heart
It touches sweet and tastes of softness I never had

dreamy days in my room
By your side as we bloom
Colors blend and fade
In cherished moments like these
The key to all the love I feel
Is in me
I can see
It is you
You give me everything I need
To believe
To be real
Flaming June
