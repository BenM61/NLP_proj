Last night when you spoke to me
Emotion in your voice
You said that you gave to me
A very simple choice
I could leave you...
And go wandering on my own
Or believe in you...
Never leave you all alone

Weave your spell for one more day
You enchanted me to stay

When you met me I was wild
"The Spider and the Fly"
Your affections made me smile
I didn't have to try

But then you tamed me...
never blamed me for my pride
And you aimed to...
Find the real me deep inside

Weave your spell for one more day
You enchanted me to stay

Now I'm feeling like a change
You say that I don't care
But when I look across the way
It's always greener there

If I leave you...
I may never have the choice
To come back to...
All the loving that you gave unceasingly

Weave your spell for one more day
You enchanted me to stay
