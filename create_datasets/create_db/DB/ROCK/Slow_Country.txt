City life
Calling me all the time
Me and my soul
Geared to attack
Never get another chance
So what you doing
Gotta get money
Keeping me real

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness

Shit night life
Been trying not to laugh though
You won't get money
From doing what you loving
I'm moving out of city
Victor of a second chance
Get a lot of problems
We kicked a lot of them

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
