If it takes away the pain, it's all right
We're living so hard you might not make it through tonight
Follow the bright lights
They might change you
If you get lost along the way, it's all right

We'll find another way to dance
We'll find another way to dance
If you get the chance
You must dance, dance, dance
You must dance, dance, dance

If you get caught out in the storm, it's all right
You're livin' so hard you can't stay dry when you're out tonight
Stare at the bright lights
They might blind you
Look at them too long and you might see it's all right

We'll find another way to dance
We'll find another way to dance
If you get the chance
You must dance, dance, dance
You must dance, dance, dance

Be what you believe
Stand up, break free
Be what you believe
Bright lights can you see
Bright lights can you see

We'll find another way to dance
We'll find another way to dance
If you get the chance
You must dance, dance, dance
You must dance, dance, dance
