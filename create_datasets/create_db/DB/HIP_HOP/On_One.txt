I'm like girl, you ain't my baby mama (no), you ain't my girlfriend (no)
All up in the club, niggas tryna f*ck
Holdin' bottles up, get you caught up in that whorlwhind
I text her like "King what you doing?"

I'm in the club feeling nice, I'm on one
(I hate that I ever met you, I hate that I ever met you)
Boy when I drink with you, I'm on one
Damn it boy I hate you so much

You can blame yourself, for doing it to me
Damn I hate you so much, got me feeling like Kelis

Found out she ain't the only girl
