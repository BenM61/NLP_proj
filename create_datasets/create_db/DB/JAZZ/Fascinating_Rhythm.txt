Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-apats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.

Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say

Fascinating Rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm, 
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.
Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
O find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!
Fascinating Rhythm,
Oh, won't you stop picking on me?
