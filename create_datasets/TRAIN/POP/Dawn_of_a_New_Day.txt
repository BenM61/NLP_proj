2 a.m., dashboard lights
Oh God, it seems I've been on the road all night
Got momma?s picture on the seat beside me
Oh, how I love what I left behind me
But I'm ready to face the dawn of a new day

Gotta keep on rollin?, keep on going
Keep on movin? like a runaway train
My heart's wide open and I ain't slowing down
Till the sun hits my face in the dawn of a new day

This old truck and one suitcase
Guitar in the bed, I hope it doesn't rain
Got a pocket full of dreams I've been saving
Paid my dues, done some praying
Now I'm on my way to the dawn of a new day

Yeah, gotta keep on rollin?, keep on going
Keep on movin? like a runaway train
My hearts wide open and I ain't slowing down
Till the sun hits my face in the dawn of a new day

The wind is at my back
That horizons calling me

Gotta keep on rollin?, keep on going
Keep on movin? like a runaway train
My hearts wide open and I ain't slowing down
Till the sun hits my face in the dawn of a new day
Dawn of a new day
