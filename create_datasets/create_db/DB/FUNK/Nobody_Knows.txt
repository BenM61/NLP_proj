Johnny's got high expectations 
He's gonna rise 
Everyone knows that Johnny is ready 
He's ready to fly 
Up on the rooftop he turns to the crowd 
No one is waiting 
No one is there 

Nobody knows why Elvis threw it all away  
Nobody knows what Ruby had to hide 
Nobody knows why some of us get broken hearts 
And some of us find a world that's clear and bright 

You could be packed up and ready 
Knowing exactly where to go 
How come you miss the connection? 
No use in asking, the answer is nobody knows 
No use in asking, the answer is nobody knows 

Johnny will keep his illusions 
What else can he do? 
And you can pretend that it would be different 
If it happened to you 
But up on the rooftop, it's a whole other world 
And who could see heaven 
And not want to stay? 

Nobody knows why Elvis threw it all away  
Nobody knows what Ruby had to hide 
Nobody knows why some of us get broken hearts 
And some of us find a world that's clear and bright
