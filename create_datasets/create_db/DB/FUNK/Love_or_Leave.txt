When you have tried to give your all
You try to stand and then you fall
There is no crutch for love that's lame
When you find out, it's all a game

(Then you came along)
Behind all the pretty trimmings
(Don't wanna do wrong)
But with you there ain't no limit

So love or leave
Get yourself together, baby
(Love or leave)
You may never get another chance

(Love me or leave me)
Oh babe
(Love me or leave me)
Love me or leave me, baby
(Love me or leave me)
That's what it's all about
(Love me or leave me)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Love has it's ways of breaking through
You must decide if I'm for you
Then when the way began to die
Keep walking fast, don't break your stride

When darkness has come
We're laying in a daydream
(Said it's no fun)
And you give your partner everything

(Love or leave)
Get it, get it together, girl
(Love or leave)
You may never get another chance

(Love me or leave me)
I gotta find out
(Love me or leave me)
Oh babe
(Love me or leave me)
Our love won't have a doubt, no, no, no
(Love me or leave me)
Just love me, baby, love me

(Love me or leave me)
Baby, if you stay, here's what I'll do
(Love me or leave me)
Try my best to make you my girl
(Love me or leave me)
Try to pass on you
Hey, baby, wanna talk to you, girl

(Love me or leave me)
There's no limit to what I'll do
(Love me or leave me)
(Love me or leave me)

(Love me or leave me)
I got to work out, I got to work out
(Love me or leave me)
We can be happy, baby

(Love me or leave me)
All you got to do, hey, hey
All you got to do is love me, baby
(Love me or leave me)
Stay by my side

(Love me or leave me)
That's all it takes to keep us satisfied
(Love me or leave me)
Did I hear you say you don't believe me?

(Love me or leave me)
[Incomprehensible]
(Love me or leave me)
Try to do what a good man should
(Love me or leave me)
Hey, Lord, I know I did not [Incomprehensible]

(Love me or leave me)
I tried to build you up when you were sinking down
(Love me or leave me)
Turned your life around, I put a smile on your face
(Love me or leave me)
Where there was a frown

Let's get it together
(Love me or leave me)
Let's see if you and I
Can turn the world around with love

(Love me or leave me)
Why don't you stay, baby?
(Love me or leave me)
Better get yourself together

(Love me or leave me)
If you need me, if you want me
(Love me or leave me)
(Love me or leave me)
(Love me or leave me)

(Love me or leave me)
Working, working on my heart, baby
(Love me or leave me)
I got my heart on
Saying I'm in love with you

(Love me or leave me)
Here you come trying to do
Some things you do
Gon', gon', gonna get it
(Love me or leave me)

(Love me or leave me)
I don't care, I done my best
(Love me or leave me)
Say you gonna stay
Then we gotta do it my way

(Love me or leave me)
Baby, sit down
Let me talk to you, baby
(Love me or leave me)

(Love me or leave me)
Hey, you better have to do your thang
(Love me or leave me)
Baby, hey, baby

Tell me, why don't you stay
Stay for a brighter day
Why don't you hang around?
While we get back down
