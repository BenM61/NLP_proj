Can you hear me out there?
I send this message to you
Transmitting out through the air
Signals into the blue
It's earthboy calling on frequency ten
All far out galaxies
I'm beaming love out to my one special friend...
...are you receiving me?

Outerspace girl
I'm sending out a message to you...
...are you receiving me?

Well are you grooving up there
On your mission of love?
Whizzing onwards at warp factor nine
Several light years above

Well if you ever come back down
To this planet safe and sound
I will be there as you touch down
So that your feet don't touch the ground

Or if you'd rather stay up there
Just hanging out in deeper space
I'll send more messages of love
To keep a smile upon your face
