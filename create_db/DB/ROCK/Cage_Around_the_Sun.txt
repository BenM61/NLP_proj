I had an urge to build a cage around the sun
I couldn't find a way to say no
I took a check on all the meters in my room
I kicked the dog and said let's go
The clouds were hanging low above the path
I had my arm around a sundown
I pinned my baby into yanking Satan's crank
Bum deals with a thin smile, oh yeah

Pushin' up and pushin' down against the sky
Like there's muscles 'round my torso
Fourth dimension of smiles, strokes and knives
This little pig has gotta go go
To live and blow all of that piss into your heart
You got veins of iron, baby
Oh man this egg is way too hot
Lay on a rock and split open, oh yeah

And all the lies that you tell me
All the lies I tell myself
There are ? coming on now
Like it's screwed itself in hell
You gotta go where this is headed
Kiss the sun to be alive
I'm a king ?
? burn my eyes

So in the end I had a cage around the sun
Looked pretty horny if I do say
The dog is dead and the sacrifice is done
All in all a pretty good day
The ocean parts and the meteors come down
Laid out in amber baby
Fate c'mon and slap me in the head
Punch the switch arrive derci

Whoa
