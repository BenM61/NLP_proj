All is calm on the western front
Civilian dreams fill the morning breeze
Listen closely, hear the prophecy
Pretenders preaching, it's time to flee!

Hypnotic sermon striking naive minds
A congregation awaits command 
The mask unveiled now they realize
Armageddon has seized the land!

October twilight setting in
Reborn into a new reality

Deceiver of beliefs
Believer of deceits
Beware the heavens 

Nothing remains of the western front
Civilian dreams vanished over night
The mask unveiled now they realize 
Armageddon has seized the land!

October twilight setting in
Reborn into a new reality

Deceiver of beliefs
Believer of deceits
Beware the heavens
