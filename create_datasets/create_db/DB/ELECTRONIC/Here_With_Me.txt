Your the one that tells me your,
'Been waiting for you' was so long
Can't believe that you are here with me

Your the one that tells me your,
With someone else it feels so wrong
Feels like you've been gone an eternity

I want to start a new
Never seen it on with you
It would be over again with your loving taunt
I want to start a new
We were never really through
Can't believe that you are here with me
