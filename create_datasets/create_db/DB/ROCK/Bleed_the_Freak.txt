My cup runneth over 
Like blood from a stone 
These stand for me 
Name your god and bleed the freak 
I'd like to see 
How you all would bleed for me 

When the pig runs slower (slower)
Let the arrow fly 
When the sin lies bolder (bolder)
I'll pluck out thine eye (I'll pluck out thine eye)
These stand for me 
Name your god and bleed the freak 
I like to see 
How you all would bleed for me 

If you scorn my lover (lover)
Satan got your thigh (thigh)
If you steal in hunger (hunger)
I will kick you when you try 
These stand for me 
Name your god and bleed the freak 
I'd like to see 
How you all would bleed for me 

Ah
All these things that you've done for me
Have left me so fucking tired 
Oh
I'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good
But if there's one thing you can do
You can bleed for me, bleed for me

Please stand for me 
Name your god and bleed the freak 
I'd like to see 
How you all would bleed for me 
These stand for me 
Name your god and bleed the freak 
I'd like to see 
How you all would bleed for me
