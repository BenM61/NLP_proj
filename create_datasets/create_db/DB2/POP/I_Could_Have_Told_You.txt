I could have told you, she'd hurt you, she'd love you a while, then desert you
If only you asked, I could have told you so
I could have saved you some crying, yes I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love and didn't want to know

I hear her now as I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now, making promises she'll never keep
And soon it's over and done with, she'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears, I could have told you so

I hear her now, as I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now making promises she'll never keep
And soon it's over, and done with, she'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears, I could have told you so
