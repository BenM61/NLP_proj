The bell is ringing
Can't you feel it, baby?
Can't you feel it baby?

Come on, come on
Can't you feel it, baby?

In my new life 
I met plenty of girls
But none that make me wanna do
The things you make me do, said that

I wanna learn
What makes you feel good
See Lord knows I tried to keep you satisfied 
The best way I could, baby

See no woman 
Has laid love down on me
The way that you laid it on me

Keep on laying it on me, baby
And I wanna learn all the things
To keep you occupied
I wanna give you my time, baby

Won't you teach me, baby
Show me, baby

I'll take notes 
So I can remember
All the things that I do to make you scream (scream)
Tell me what you like 
'Cause I'm willing and able
I can fulfill your every dream, baby

See no woman 
Has ever made me wanna break down
And give her everything I have to offer and even more

See you're the kind of girl 
That'll make a man wanna give all this money
Give up his cars, all of his dreams
So baby, why don't you show me, said
