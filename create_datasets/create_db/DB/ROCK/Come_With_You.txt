They say: I can't, but I do what I want to
They say: I can't, but I do what I want to
They say: I can't, but I do what I want to
They say: I can't, but I do what I want to

When the sun comes up
You can wake me up
I'll come with you
And I'll know

Can you tell me what
What you know about
About the stars tonight
And the sin

Will you dance for me
Can you freak with me
Let your mind be free
Tonight

Can you tell me what
What you know about
About the stars tonight
And the sin

Can you pick me up
I will bring the fire
And I'll burn us down
Tonight
