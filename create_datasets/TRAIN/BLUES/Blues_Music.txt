Me and my band
All must agree we like to get groovy
With the sounds of the old time
We like to jam cause man
Sounds from the Bandstand
Hand for the cause man
Hang from the old ones
The tones the gear the props and the ride very much in
Chilling outside
Going way back 
From where music really started
I'm a child of the eighties
From where I departed since then I started
A collection of the people
Who started it all
I reckon
I kept them
In my sock like money
Blues music
It's all about rocking the van not rock to roll
Sway to sway
Shocks work out I play
What that fly girl Sabine say
About eight miles to the gallon that's some
Highway sailing
Cool cool lounging
Atlantic City bounding
1920's to the 1970's a stream
Pool solid steady
Getting ready real cool
The earth amp sock hat hi-hat dope
Dobro D'Addario strings for my things
The bass wail sings
Let the rhyme bring
The tense of the time
The old time
Blues music
Blind Lemon Jefferson and juice
B.M.W's the proof frosty Albert Collins bukkha white
Booker T James Brown
Jimmy smith at the console
The soul with the girls Aretha
Chakka Khan the show Solid Gold
Cisco and Sonny Lead Belly too
Peoples that rode with Woody and you Bob Dylan
A million Sears Silvertone guitars
Heard the licks no need to take them nowhere
Blues music
It's like chewing gum with your headphones on
Drinking lemonade
Chilling on the front porch after running ball
Like you lost a twenty dollar bill
You got a free ticket from the scratch and win
Its like the swimsuit issue
Could I get a tissue?
It's like you and your baby got nasty cut off and left alone now making eyes
On the city bus again grandma cooks blueberry pie
Little sister got a boyfriend
It's like smoking the ride
The final right
The vinyl rides
Blues music
