Detroit City
It was the finest in this world
Yes, Detroit City
It was the finest in this world
I'm crazy 'bout that city
And I love its pretty girls

When you leave that city
And you feel this kind of love
When you leave that city
And you feel this kind of love
Just one goes out hasty
And you find a good place to go

You don't need a lot of money
To have a real good time
You don't need a lot of money
To have a real good time
Just be a real good sport
And everything will turn out fine
