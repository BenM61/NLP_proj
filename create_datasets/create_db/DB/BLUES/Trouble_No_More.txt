Don't care how long you gone
I don't care how long you staying
But, good kind treatment
Gonna bring you home someday
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble poor me anymore

You just keep on betting
That the dice won't pass
Well you know, darling
You are living too fast
But someday, baby
You ain't gonna trouble poor me anymore

I'm gonna tell everybody
In your neighborhood
That you's a sweet little girl
But, you don't mean me no good
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble poor me anymore

Well, I know you're leavin
Well, you call that gone
Well, without love
You can't stay long
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble poor me anymore

Well, goodbye baby
Come on, shake my hand
I don't want no woman
You can have a man
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble poor me anymore
