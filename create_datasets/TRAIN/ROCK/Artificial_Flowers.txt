Alone in the world was poor little Anne
As sweet a young child as you'd find
Her parents had gone to their final reward
Leavin' their baby behind

(Did you hear?)
This poor little child was only nine years of age
When mother and dad went away
Still she bravely worked
At the one thing she knew
To earn her few pennies a day

She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers you know those artificial flowers
Fashions from Annie's despair

With paper and shears with some wire and wax
She made up each tulip and mum
As snowflakes drifted into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

From makin' artificial flowers those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers artificial flowers
Made from Annie's despair

They found little Annie all covered in ice
Still clutchin' her poor frozen shears
Amidst all the blossoms she had fashioned by hand
And watered with all her young tears

There must be a heaven where little Annie can play
In heavenly gardens and bowers
And instea-a-ad of a halo she'll wear 'round her head
A garland of genuine flowers

No more artificial flowers
Throw away those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of society to wear
Throw away those artificial flowers
Those dumb-dumb flowers
Fashioned from Annie's
Fashioned from A-a-a-annie's des-pa-a-a-air
(Give her the real thing)
