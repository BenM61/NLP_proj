All of his friends have been wondering
Why he spent so long with her
He's so dark and moody
She is his sunshine girl

In the bed where they make love
She's in a film on the sheets
He shows dreams like a movie
She's the softness of cinema seats

He sees all of the girls
Like Demi Moore as she sighs
Dreams come true as he holds her
'Til the X's come up in her eyes

Like roses grow in a churchyard
Her skin white as the milk
Just like a Sherpa Tensing
Under a Manilla silk
