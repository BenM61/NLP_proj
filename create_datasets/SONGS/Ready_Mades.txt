Wendy Wetlip stares from a poster
Ignoring the drawing adorning her smile 
Her lover has shuffled away 
Looking the other way 

Ronnie the Raincoat hangs out in a book store 
He's never seen his own wife in the nude 
Somebody called him depraved 
But think of the money he saved 

Dwarf on a moped speeds through the park 
To Killroy's Renaissance the Temple of Art 
Signs with a flourish and makes it his own 
Pockets his pencil and slyly rides home 

Annual cultural African dancers 
Bereft Isabella in rubber thigh boots 
A man was arrested today 
For something he put on display
