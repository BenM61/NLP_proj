A million miles from nowhere
A million miles from you
A million miles from nowhere
Alone, broken hearted and blue.

Memories of you
And the love you once knew
How they linger in my heart
Though we are a million, a million miles apart.

A million miles from happiness
A million miles of loneliness
The world of wilderness
Oh, how I can go on like this?

A million miles from nowhere
A million miles from you
A million miles from nowhere
Alone, broken hearted and blue.

Alone, broken hearted and blue.
Alone broken hearted and blue...
