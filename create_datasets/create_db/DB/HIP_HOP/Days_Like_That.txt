Do you remember when days were like that? (Do you)
Now that I think about it, there are some things I regret

Do you remember when days were like that?
I was loving you, in return, you loved back
And now you're telling me that you miss that
Bet you feel lonely, but you lost me (Bet you feel lonely)

Now that you think about it
How do you feel about it? (How do you feel about it?)
You've had some time to live with
The mistake that you made
Not try'na say I'm perfect
Push comes to shove, I'm worth it
There were things you had to deal with
But it's alright, 'cause we're still tight

I can't believe you're back again
After all you put me through
Even though I'm still your friend
I don't want to be with you

Now that I think about it
There are some things I regret
I shoulda' never just let
You walk away and not explain
But I'm not bitter 'bout it
I had to get over it
It made me stronger within
There's a lesson here, hope you learn from it

I can't believe you're back again
After all you put me through
Even though I'm still your friend
I don't want to be with you

We can be friends but not lovers (You know)
Gotta be one or the other (Ah, ooh)
Mmm...
