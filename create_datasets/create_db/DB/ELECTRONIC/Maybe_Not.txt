Aaoh ha-a-aow... 
Haow... 
Aaoh aaoh 

Aaoh ha-a-aow... 
Haow 

I want to reach the one 
I want to quit and run 
I want to face the ground 
Still want to see the sun 

Pain is a minute old 
I want to be untold 
I'm gonna let it die 
Still want to see it grow 

I'm gonna go to there all dressed 
Wake up reborn and go to flesh 

I!, I'm gonna scream out loud 
I want to make no sound 
Want to know what I love 
I want it, maybe not 
I'm gonna face my fears 
I want to hold my tears 
Want to know what I love 
I want it, maybe not 

That is to slow to fast you see 
That doesn't mean a thing to me 
I'm gonna prove I'm tough 
I hope no one says enough 
I want to be alone 
I want to be with ya'll 
I want to be like me 
Want to be T are P 

I'm gonna go to there all dressed 
Wake up reborn and go to flesh 

I!, I'm gonna scream out loud 
I want to make no sound 
Want to know what I love 
I want it, maybe not 
I'm gonna face my fears 
I want to hold my tears 
Want to know what I love 
I want it, maybe not 

Now I'm gonna tell 
All this makes my day a hell 
I don't even know, 
But sometimes I change my way 
See my own delay (delay dela, delay) 
Now I don't even know, 
But sometimes I change my way 
Just see my own delay, dela, delay, de dela-dela-de 

I!, I'm gonna scream out loud 
I want to make no sound 
Want to know what I love 
I want it, maybe not 
I'm gonna face my fears 
I want to hold my tears 
Want to know what I love 
I want it, maybe not 

Aaoh ha-a-aow... 
I want it, maybe not 
Aaoh ha-a-aow... 
Want to know what I love 
I want it, maybe not
