Today is just another day, tomorrow is a guess
But yesterday, oh, what I'd give for yesterday
To relive one yesterday and its happiness

When Joanna loved me
Every town was Paris
Every day was Sunday
Every month was May

When Joanna loved me
Every sound was music
Music made of laughter
Laughter that was bright and gay

But when Joanna left me
May became December
But, even in December, I remember
Her touch, her smile, and for a little while

She loves me
And once again it's Paris
Paris on a Sunday
And the month is May
