I took a walk today
To where the ocean meets the sky
I thought about the way
They always say love never dies
And as the sun went down
I saw a lovers silhouette

A woman and a man
In a dance I envied them
I thought of you
I loved you so
I don't know why
I let you go
A woman and a man
A love so close
Walk hand in hand
While I'm alone

A woman and a man
A love embrace
He turned his head
I saw his face
Could it be you
Yes, it was you
A woman and a man
I had to turn away
I hoped you wouldn't see me there
I thought about the way

You used to say I didn't care
And as you walked on by
I pulled my scarf across my face
And I began to cry
For all the love I'd thrown away
But there you were
Like in a dream
You were with her
And not with me

A woman and a man
A love so close
Walk hand in hand
While I'm alone
A woman and a man
A love embrace
He turned his head
I saw his face
Could it be you
Yes, it was you

A woman and a man
A woman and a man
A woman and a man
A woman and a man
We were so close. baby
Guess you never know
Just how precious love is
'Til you've had it and held it
And let it go

A woman and a man
A love so close
Walk hand in hand
While I'm alone
A woman and a man
A love embrace
He turned his head
I saw his face
Could it be you
Yes, it was you

A woman and a man
A woman and a man
A woman and a man
A woman and a man
