Here we are again, all alone
Passion is yearning, a burning fire of pure desire
It's so right, really special tonight
And I find that I'm needing more and more
And more and more

I need more of the night to hold you
Give me more of the night to love you
Give me more of the night to hold you
In my arms, in my arms

You feel so good just the way love should
Every moment is pleasure, what pleasure I found in you
It's time to know, girl, it's time for love to grow
And I want you and you more and more
And more and more

I need more of the night to hold you
Give me more of the night to love you
Give me more of the night to hold you
In my arms

Oh oh, give me more of the night just to hold you
More of the night to love you
I need more of the night to hold you
In my arms, in my arms

I need more of the night to love you
Give me more of the night to squeeze you
I need more of the night to make love to you
And I wanna squeeze, I wanna squeeze you all night long, yeah
And I wanna love you, love you, love to the break of dawn, whoa
