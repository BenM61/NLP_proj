All us angels wearing studs
Yeah, plastic mouth melts in the sun
Oh, running colors everyone
Cause we're all in prison having fun

Oh, perfect pictures hang around
Well, delusions swing you up and down
Well fall out windows climb up trees
I'm lookin' for tranquillity

Hmm, got your, o locks and chains
Well, still gonna blow your brains out
Those locks and chains

No, nah, never felt like a dream like you before
(Ahh,ahh, ahh, ahh)
Even knocking door to door
Oo yeah, I never felt like a dream like you before
(Ahh,ahh, ahh, ahh)
Even knocking door to door

Oh, yeah you got your herds of people choosing arms
Gonna keep us all in mass alarm
Oh, murder movies make your day
Ah, ah, living in the USA

Cracked up people on the edge
They got no heroes got no bread
Oh, get the jitters get the shakes
Lookin' like ? the final take

Ooh, well locks and chains
Gonna protect you
Well locks and chains
Don't feel no more

Never felt a dream like you before
(Ahh,ahh, ahh, ahh)
Even knocking door to door
Oh, never felt a dream like you before
(Ahh,ahh, ahh, ahh)
Even knocking door to door

Well gonna blow your brains out?

Can't feel no more

Never felt a dream like you before
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
Even knocking door to door

Oh, even knocking door to door

Oh, livin' in a dream is all the same
Ah, yeah livin' in a dream is a-all the same
Oh never felt a dream like you before
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
Even knocking door to door (door)
