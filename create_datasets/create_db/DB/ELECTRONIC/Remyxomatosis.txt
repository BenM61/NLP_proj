The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said "I been where I liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
And screwed me in a vice

And now I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied"

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

"I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied

Don't know why
I feel so skinned alive."

My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

"now no one likes a smart arse but we all like stars"
That wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

"I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied"
