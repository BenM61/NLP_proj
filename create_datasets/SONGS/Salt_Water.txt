Wave upon wave
Roll upon roll
Tiny it shrinks
Then huge it blows

Gotta be sharp
Gotta be strong
Things get w-w-weird
Before they go wrong

And he knows that once he starts
He just can't stop
Next life he's coming back as a dog

Blindin' his eyes
Rushin' through his veins
Tricklin' down thighs
Again

Blindin' his eyes
Rushin' through his veins
Tricklin' down thighs
Again

Salt water
Salt water
Salt water
Salt water
Salt water

Salt water
Salt water
Salt water
Salt water
Salt water
