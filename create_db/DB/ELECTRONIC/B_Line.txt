It's in your eyes
And the way you move
You've got music in your step
A kind of glow
Like you walk with the heat turned up
So brightly you burn

Suddenly I see
I go ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap
Every time you walk in the room
No escape for me
I go ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap
Every time you're close to me

If I could just
Compose myself
I'd radiate
Just the right amount of cool and heat
So you'd never know
How I tremble to touch you

Suddenly I see
I go ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap
Every time you walk in the room
No escape for me
I go ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap, ba-dap
Every time you're close to me
