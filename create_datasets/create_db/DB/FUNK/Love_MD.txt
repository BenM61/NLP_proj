Feels like my last name is motherfucker, first name is you
Wanna love you while we f*ck to show you I'm the truth
But you filled with despair and your heart don't care
If I died today you'd probably leave me right here
Oh girl, I ain't the one to f*ck with
Oh girl, I ain't leavin' till you say you quit
Oh girl, I know we're gonna survive
No matter how much money it takes we're gonna get by

I'm just surviving her
She's just surviving me
We can meet up in the middle

Until we both agree

Need an opinion, unbiased, someone to talk to
An outsider who understands what we're going through
Lack of communication's breeding the separation
And I don't want to lose you
Baby it looks like we gone need me some therapy
To get us back on track the way that we used to be
My heart is crying out but baby it's killin' me
That's why every night you see me down on bended knee

I'm just surviving her
She's just surviving me
We can meet up in the middle
Find the answer to this riddle
Until we both agree
