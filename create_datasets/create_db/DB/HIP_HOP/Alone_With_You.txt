Close your eyes
Baby, take my hand
May be hard for you
To understand
All the crazy things you make me do
Just lay with me
Until the morning comes to you
On my mind all the time
Baby, you give to me
Something so good
And if you knew
What I want to do

[Chorus]
It was dark, it was night
Except for the moon
Put some light in your eyes
Girl, I was in tune
Night turned to day
Day turned to night
Feels so right
Hold on tight
With all of your might
I'm gonna take you for the ride of
Your life
Do you think you can give to me
Every day fulfill my need?
I can't remember
Feeling this good
Every moment
Leaves me wanting more and more
The special things, every word you say
I find myself wanting you
Every single day, oh
On my mind all the time
Baby, you give to me
Something so good
And if you knew
What I want to do
[Chorus]
I want to be
I want to be
I want to be
Alone with you
I want to be
I want to be
I want to be
Alone with you
[Chorus x 2]
