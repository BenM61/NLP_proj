Your sex is got it goin' on
Your sex is got it goin' on, here we go
Your sex is got it goin' on, don't you know
Your sex is got it goin' on, I told you so

I want your body, tell me you want mine too
There's so many nasty things I wanna do to you
Lick you up and down and a runnin' around
But a lovely mind could never ever be found

Now you see me and baby, now you don't
Come fast upon me girl
Just give me what I want
Lick you real good till the very last drop
Ah, no, no, no, no, honey, don't you ever, ever, stop

Happy days are here again
Looks like this love of ours will never ever end
Happy days are here again
Looks like this love of ours will never ever end

Hold me tight, baby, don't you let me go
Oh, come on, sugar, you know I love you so
Make you feel like you never did me wrong
Here's the key, baby, now open up the door

Now you see me and baby, now you don't
Come on, honey, just give me what I want
I love you, tell you, I feel so good inside
You may try to run but you just can't hide

Happy days are here again
I don't think they'll help me, baby
I don't think they'll help me see, ah come on
Happy days are here again
Baby, looks like this love of ours will never ever end

Happy days are here again
Come on, baby, come on, sugar
Happy days are here again
Come on, honey

Another jam, happy days when it's too dull
Lookin' a makin' a takin' a time to see what you women are all about
I still don't get it, slap it and grab it
Makin' life worth it 'cause a bitch gotta have it

Soon can make you sweat
When you're alone in your home
'Cause her back is pretty strong
And your sex got it goin' on
My man, Will, can make the groove sweat
Your big G and little G
Hey, I'll give you nothing but happy days

Happy days are here again
Come on, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

Happy days are here again
Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

Happy days are here again
Why won't you let me
Come on, give it to me, baby
Put it right in, put it right in for me, baby

Happy days are here again
I'll lick it real good, yeah
I'll lick it real good
I'll lick it real good, you, you, you, baby

Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Come on, baby, I want your love
You gonna give it to me, no

Happy days are here again
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, baby

Happy days are here again
Feel real good, it feels real good
Feel real good

Happy days are here again
Happy days are here again
Happy days are here again
