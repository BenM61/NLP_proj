When the working day is gone 
I refuse to belong to anyone. 
And at night when I try to sleep 
I hear the house of commerce in my dreams... 

Somehow, someone, somewhere 
owns everything I do. 
Somehow, someone, somewhere 
owns all of me and owns all of you. 

There's no charge, 
there's no crime, 
but we're all doing time. 
To be honest there's not much I can do 
but to sing a bad ballad for you. 
I could suggest sabotage, 
but success might prove a mirage. 

'cause Somehow, someone, somewhere 
owns everything I do. 
Somehow, someone, somewhere 
owns all of me and owns all of you.
