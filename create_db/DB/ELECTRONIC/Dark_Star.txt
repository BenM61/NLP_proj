I've looked a long time to find you
I drifted through the universe, just to lay
Beside you
Anywhere you want me to take you, I'll go
Yeah
But there's things about me that you just don't know

If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star,
Oh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star
Oh

Ah, ah ah
Oh whoah

My heart was born out of the fire
I lost love a thousand years ago
And still, I can't find her
Now I don't love like I used to
Oh but I've got stories I could tell you, if I want to

If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star,
Oh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star
Oh

Oh
Oh
Ooh, oh oh

If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star,
Oh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star
Oh

'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star,
Oh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star
Oh
