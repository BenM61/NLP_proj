My mind is cracked, I stand alone
And my way is dark as night
Back on the hill, the wind it moans
And big black clouds fly by

The rain fell down, it drowned my heart
It raged inside my soul
The pain that tore the skies apart
The twisted night unfolds

Oh, I'm burning up
Oh, I'm burning up
Ooh, I'm burning up
Oh oh oh

This lovely road that I must walk
All these tears that burn my eyes
In emptiness, my torment roars
In my silent loveless life

Oh oh,I'm burning up
Ah, I'm burning up
Ah, I'm burning up
Ohhh

Oh oh, can you hear me, hear me calling
Across a thousand years
Oh! Oh! Would you love me, if I die die
A thousand times

Like a volcano
Oh, I'm burning up

Like a volcano
I'm burning up

Like a volcano
Oh, I'm burning up

Like a volcano
Yeah, I'm burning up

Like a volcano
Like a volcano
oh oh oh, no yeah

Like a volcano
no yeah no yeah

Like a volcano
Like a volcano
Burn burn burn burn burn

Like a volcano
burn burn burn, ohhh
