When all the twelve Apostles try to ring me on the phone
Take a message but I won't return their call
For I have no eyes to see him and I thought I lost my way
And I know I've lost the keys to your door

And I climbed the highest mountain and I looked down on the sea
And I saw a ship a-sail to the shore
I took a passage to the East and I journeyed to the West
I made love from Battambang to Baltimore

I said, oh, am I running in a race
I said, oh, am I getting anyplace
I said, oh, can I make it

I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, yes I am a restless soul
I'm a wandering spirit, there's no place that I can call my own

I was a glutton at the banquet and I spilt the finest wine
Trod the pyramids and ruins of Angkor
I kissed the Mona Lisa and I breakfasted with kings
And I touched the nerves of nature in the raw

I said, oh, am I running in a race
I said, oh, take that smile right off your face
I said, oh, I can't make it

I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, no escape, no parole
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, there's no place that
I can call my home

I said, oh, am I running in a race
I said, oh, take that smile right off your face
I said, oh, I can't make it

I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, looking for a place to go

I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, no escape, no parole
I'm a wandering spirit, I'm a lost and lonely soul
