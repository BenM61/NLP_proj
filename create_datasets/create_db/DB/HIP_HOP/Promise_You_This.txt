Say man that nigga Snoop Dogg promised me a record deal man
That nigga promised me he was gon' come over man, and do some things with me man
That nigga Snoop Dogg promised me, man the nigga promised a whole lotta stuff man
But he didn't come through man
Look nigga, I'mma promise you this

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit, but I'mma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'mma promise you this

Nigga had to walk 'bout four days
These niggas actin' like hoes nowadays
When I was young I used to hustle for my own shit
A twenty nigga slanging with them insane Crips
I made my way out they call me Snoop Eastwood
Didn't forget where I came from, went back to the hood
Signed niggas, gave jobs and I made bail
And kept a lot of motherfuckers from goin' back to jail
Retail, wholesale, OG's won't tell
Oh yeah they will, oh yeah they will
But I paid no mind I get back on my grind
I had a football dream to have a football league and I did that

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'mma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'mma promise you this
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'mma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'mma promise you this

Niggas said something outta place, dawg
I'mma let it go, I can't catch a case dawg
These motherfuckers prayin' on my downfall
I run the paint when it comes to this roundball
See I'm a legendary nigga doin' legendary shit
Smoking on the blunt with your temporary bitch
One thing's for certain, two thangs for sho'
I'm a Long Beach nigga everywhere that I go
Now, if I do, if I don't, if I will, if I won't
See time is money and it's the first of the month
Quit actin' funny my nigga
And go get your money my nigga
He do, three-two

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'mma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'mma promise you this
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'mma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'mma promise you this

Say man (I'mma promise you this)
Look I don't even promise my wife or my kids nothin'
So what I look like promising you something nigga (I'mma promise you this)
Look here you need to get up, get out, get something

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'mma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'mma promise you this
