One
One, two, three, four

Every second I have
I'll shake it in my hand
Fifty dollars and donuts
I'm gonna see the man

Slide back I'm gonna have
The time
I'm gonna ride the path
To your mind
All right, Afro

Afro
Ain't that right
All right, Afro
Shake that ass

No doubt about it
You sure look handsome
Come on

Don't you go ahead with your lies
A friend of mine
All right, Afro
Come on
