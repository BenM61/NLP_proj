Feel so good, feel so good

Come on in, baby, have a seat
Take your shoes off, let me massage your feet
You look like you're in the mood for good love
Turn the lights off, girl, that's what I give you plenty of

I want to be more than a friend
Someone you can depend on
Love you over and over again
Tonight I don't want this love affair to ever end
I love you (Once we get started, it's not gonna stop)

I want to love you down from your head to your toes
And anywhere else, no one has to know
I want to love you down from your head to your toes
And anywhere else, no one has to know

Let's take a shower, baby, you see the water is fine (Pass me the soap)
And I'll wash your body and, baby, you'll wash mine (Now it's your turn)
Touch you, girl, in all the right places
And I want to fill up all your, your empty spaces

I want to be more than a friend
Someone you can depend on
Love you over and over again
Tonight I don't want this love affair to ever end
No, girl (No, baby, no I don't)

I want to love you down (Oh, yeah) from your head to your toes
(Down from your head, down to your toes, girl)
And anywhere else, no one has to know (It will be a secret between you and I, girl)
I want to love you down from your head to your toes (All the way down)
And anywhere else, no one has to know (Let me break it on down to you right now, girl)

Ooh, baby, you feel so good to me tonight
Let me ask you one thing, girl
Can I put you there (Yeah, yeah)
Can I put you right there, baby (Yeah, yeah)
Does it feel good to you, girl (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, does it feel real good to you, baby (Yeah, yeah)
If it feels good let me hear you say, "Yeah, babe" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I want to love you down from your head to your toes
(Oh tell me it feels right, tell me it feels so right, girl)
And anywhere else, no one has to know (Ooh, whisper those sweet little things in my ear)
I want to love you down from your head to your toes
(I want you to whisper those things you know, you know I like to hear, babe)
