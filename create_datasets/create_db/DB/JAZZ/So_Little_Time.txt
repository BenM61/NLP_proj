There's so little time and so much to do
There's so little time for dreams to come true
Many a ship to sail, many a magic land
Many a moonlit trail, many a road to walk hand in hand

There's songs of love we never have sung
Let's not waste one hour, the night is still young
Mama, a lifetime's not enough for the love I have for you
There's so little time, so much to do
