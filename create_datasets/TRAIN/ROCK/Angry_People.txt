That's the problem, dear, with angry people
They try to go it alone
Digging in and making cranky feeble pleas
That other angries disown
Angry people think a good solution
Is getting others involved
So they surround themselves with happy people
And watch their smiles dissolve

We just drag them down
We just drag them down
We just drag them down
Until they're just like us

Angry people get so sanctimonious
Telling us what to do
Hoping no one outs them all as phonies just cause
We are all phonies too
And those of us who once had wives and families
Understand what I mean
What was once a calm and peaceful refuge
Is overtaken by spleen

'Cause we just drag them down
We just drag them down
We just drag them down
Until they're just like us

I am the singer in the band
We're only trying to lend a hand
And though it's not what we had planned
We understand

That we just drag you down
We just drag you down
We just drag you down
Until you're just like us

In a square a thousand angry people
Are waving signs in the air (HEY!)
While a million other happy people
Are trying hard not to care (BACK OFF!)
You see, the happy people's biggest problem
Is they're never fearing the worst
While the rest of us will never sleep until
Your happy bubbles are burst

Yeah, we just drag them down
Didn't I just drag you down
Just watch me drag you down
Until you're just like us
Until you're just like us
Oh, until you're just like us
Until you're just like us
