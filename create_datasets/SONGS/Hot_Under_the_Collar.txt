If you can hear me,
Let me see you breathe and i'll tag along in the meantime
Im asleep tonight for greater times on the wayside
When you dreaming, what do you see? 
and how do you feel when you think of it?
'Cause I've been thinking a lot about giving you all I've got in a standstill

Diamond mines have closed and the forest knows its own
I have walked through the river by the garden
Nothing there to see, other then the trees
I have walked through the river by the garden
I have walked through the river by the garden

She was my best friend until she found another man
She don't know how badly she has hurt me,
Well i could hurt her too, if I wanted too
She don't know how badly i could hurt her

My heart keeps breaking every morning,
My head keeps aching every night
My heart keeps breaking every morning and my eyes are sick of crying

I let her down there, i could feel her fear
I left a mark in the river by the garden
When she turned her back, that's when i had my chance
Yeah i left a mark in the river by the garden
Yeah in the mark, that river by the garden?

My heart keep breaking every morning,
My head keeps aching every night
My heart keeps breaking every morning and my eyes are sick of crying
Yeah my eyes are sick of crying.
