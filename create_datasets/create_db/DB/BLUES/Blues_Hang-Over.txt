Lord, I wonder what could happen?
Ain't nobody here but me
All these empty bottles on the table here
I know I didn't drink all this by myself
I must have a blues hangover

What's this?
My check?
And I don't have change for a grasshopper, and that's two tickets
Uh-oh
Here come Bro
Sent him and his donkey
But he ain't got no money
Look like he done lost everything he ever has had
Ain't that the come-off?

Hear me
I done gave my baby twenty dollars for a Christmas present
And all I got was this slice of jelly cake
And Santa ate that up
Now, that's a whoop jelly

Well, I believe I'll go back on the stem now
With James, Rudolph, and Tomcat
Get my head bad again
Don't seem like nothin' goin' right for me today
All right
Here I go
Same old thing again
Look out, now!
