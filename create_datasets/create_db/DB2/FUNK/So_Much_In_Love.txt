As we stroll along together
Holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
So in love  (doo, so in love)
In a world of our own  (doo, so in love)

As we stroll by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love  (doo, so in love)
So much in love  (doo, so in love)
So in love  (doo, so in love)
So much in love  (doo, so in love)

We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, love you my darling
Can you tell it in my touch?

When we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So much love have we two
Just can't wait to say "I do"
So in love  (doo, so in love)
Are you and I  (doo, you and I)
So in love  (doo, so in love)
Are you and I  (doo, you and I)
So in love  (doo, so in love)
Are you and I  (doo, you and I)
