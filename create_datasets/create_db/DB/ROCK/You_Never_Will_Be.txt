You never will be mine
You never will be mine
You never will be mine
You never will be 

When I get left alone
The streets offer me a home
So many times I've tried
To reach for the truth inside
Each time you close the door
I think I need you more and more
Just give me the time of day
I'll make your hopes and dreams fall away
I'll make your hopes and dreams fall away

You never will be mine
You never will be mine
You never will be mine
You never will be 

Your skin it just drives me mad
Oh God I want you so bad
want to kiss your red hot lips
Push myself against your hips
Take me baby in your arms
Safe from all the damage, love and harm
Tie me up and don't let me go
Then f*ck me nice and slow
Then f*ck me nice and slow
Till I just can't take anymore
Till I can't take it anymore
