A call out of the blue
That's what I got from you
You said you wanted to talk
You're sorry it took so long

Then you tried to explain
Reasons you walked away
It wasn't done selfishly
While you walked
You were thinking of me

[Chorus]
I guess somehow
I should have known
You'd come back to me
On your own
It doesn't matter
I don't care how
It means so much
Cause you're here with me now

Find your way
Find your way baby
Find your way back to me

How could I believe
The things you say to me
When you left I felt deceived
And it's taken time to heal

Somehow you've found your way
But I wonder
If you're gonna stay
You say you've made mistakes
And you want to try again

[Chorus]

Find your way
Find your way baby
Find your way back to me
I want you too
Find your way
Find your way baby
Find your way back to me

[Chorus]
