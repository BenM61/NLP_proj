I guess I’ll never understand the opposite sex 
I guess it’s true some women are really complex 
I guess your infatuation didn’t last long 
I guess telling you I (blank) ed you was somehow wrong 

You were good 
I never seen it coming 
The more I pushed 
The more you kept running

I guess I’m just not worth another breath 
For you to tell me what went wrong 
I guess I finally find out for myself 
Just who is weak and who is strong 

I guess I’ll never understand a woman’s mind 
I guess it’s true some change all the time 
I guess your intuition rules you all 
I guess showing you my feelings made me small

You were good 
I never seen it coming 
The more I pushed 
The more you kept running

I guess I’m just not worth another breath 
For you to tell me what went wrong 
I guess I finally find out for myself 
Just who is weak and who is strong

I guess I’m just not worth another breath 
For you to tell me what went wrong 
I guess I finally find out for myself 
Just who is weak and who is strong

You wouldn’t even return my calls 
Like I done something wrong 
Your choice became my biggest fear 
Now I wish your memory would disappear 

You were good 
I never seen it coming 
The more I pushed 
The more you kept running 

I guess I’m just not worth another breath 
For you to tell me what went wrong 
I guess I finally find out for myself 
Just who is weak and who is strong

I guess I’m just not worth another breath 
For you to tell me what went wrong 
I guess I finally find out for myself 
Just who is weak and who is strong
