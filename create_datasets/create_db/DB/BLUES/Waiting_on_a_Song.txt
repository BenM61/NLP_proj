I been thinking and been hummin'
I been pickin and I been strumming
Just waiting, waiting on a song
I been hitching and I been thumbin'
I can almost hear one coming
I'm just waiting, waiting on a song

I looked down in my pocket
Underneath the bed
Walked under the lamp post
And one hit me on the head

Am I blind or too dumb to see
All the sound surrounding me?
I'm just waiting, waiting on a song

You can look up at the stars
Bow your head and count the cars
You'll still be waiting, waiting on a song
Might be a blue bird or a crow
On a cord between two poles
They're just waiting, waiting on a song

Songs don't grow on trees
You gotta pick em' out the breeze
Fall down on your knees
And pray one comes along
 
When those railroad gates come down
You gotta stop and turn around
Or you'll be waiting, waiting on a song
