Looking out my window today,
Seeing nothing but your sweet face.
I wonder what this feeling can be,
What's come over me?

Can it be love?

Lying in your arms I have felt
A space in time that makes my heart melt.
I wonder what this feeling can be,
What's this ecstasy?

Can it be love?
Can it be love?
Can it be love?
Can it be your love?

I feel new fire in the glow of your eyes.
Feeling for the first time, your lips, as sweet as wine.
The thought of you caressing me knocks me to my knees.
You swept me off my feet, you made my life complete.

Can it be love?
Can it be love?
Can it be love?
Can it be your love?

(Can it be love)

Memories and distant refrain,
Visions of the love we just made.
I wonder if this heart of mine will do
What you want it too?

Will it be love?
Can it be love?
Can it be love?
Can it be love?

I feel the fire in your eyes.
Tastin' for the first time, your lips, as sweet as cherry wine.
You caressing me knocks me to my knees.
You keep me safe, you keep me warm;
I'm feeling like a quiet storm.

Can it be love?  Baby, yeah.
Can it be love?
Can it be your love?
You make my heart fly sky high.
I just want to testify.
Baby, what your love has done for me
What your love has done.

I feel the fire, I feel the power.
I feel the fire, the power, the fire.
Can it be love?  Oh.
Can it be your love?  Oh.

Can it be love?  Oh.
Can it be your love?

I feel the fire, I feel the power.
I feel the fire, the power, the fire, oh
