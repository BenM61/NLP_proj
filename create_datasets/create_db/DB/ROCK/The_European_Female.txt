I knew she was a feline
She moved with ease and grace
Her green eyes, they held mystery
No emotion on her face

The European female she's here

She speaks her, lips are kissing
The air around her face
I don't always understand her
I love her air and grace

The European female she's here

The European female's here
We'll be together for a thousand years
And do you really fear
That you might fall?

I saw her in the Strasse
And in the Rue as well
Pursued her in the high street
She had me in her spell

The European female she's here

The European female's here
We'll be together for a thousand years
And do you really fear
That you might fall?

The European female's here
We'll be together for a thousand years
And do you really fear
That you might fall?

The European female's here
We'll be together for a thousand years
And do you really fear
That you might fall?
