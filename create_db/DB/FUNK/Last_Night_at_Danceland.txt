I woke up this mornin', just another day
Don't ask me for very much, gave it all away
No use to pretend, the movie has to end
I made my last stand, last night at Danceland

I got high last night at Danceland
For the last time before he said good bye
I could fly last night at Danceland
Kept on laughin' just so I wouldn't cry

Anyway, he bought blue orchids for my hair
I felt like Ginger Rogers after she lost Fred Astaire
I got by last night at Danceland
Now I'm down to love songs and loneliness

Anyway, he bought blue orchids for my hair
I felt like Ginger Rogers after she lost Fred Astaire
I got a high at Danceland, I could fly last night at Danceland
I said goodbye last night at Danceland
I made my last stand, last night at Danceland, yeah

I got high last night at Danceland
For the last time before he said good bye
I could fly last night at Danceland
But I kept right on laughin', just so that I wouldn't cry

Anyway, you bought blue orchids for my hair
Felt like Ginger Rogers after she lost Fred Astaire
I got a high, I could fly, I said goodbye, ooh, I could fly
I said goodbye at Danceland, yeah
I made my last stand, last night at Danceland, yeah

This is what I did at Danceland
Got a little high, got a little high at Danceland
Kept on laughin', kept on laughin' at Danceland
I thought I was flyin', I thought I was flyin' at Danceland

Kept on dancin', I kept on dancin' at Danceland
I thought I was flyin', I thought I was flyin' at Danceland
Kept on laughin', kept on dancin' at Danceland
