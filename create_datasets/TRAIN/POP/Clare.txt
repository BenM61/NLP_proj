My baby's love is called Clare 
Serpentine seductress, I can't compare 
My baby's love is merciless to me 
Wailing like a hussy and laughing drunkenly 
 
And over the rooftops when the stars prickle the skies 
London is sleeping and the Mississippi moon shines 
I hear them making love 
I hear them making love 
 
Clare was born in New Orleans 
She grew up in the bars of Bourbon Street 
Back in the days of Marie Laveau 
She learnt the ways of that old voodoo 
 
And over the rooftops when the stars prickle the skies 
London is sleeping and the Mississippi moon shines 
I hear them making love 
I hear them making love 
  
And over the rooftops when the stars prickle the skies 
London is sleeping and the Mississippi moon shines 
I hear them making love 
I hear them making love 
 
I hear them making love 
I hear them making love 
I hear them making love 
 
I hear them making love 
I hear them making love
