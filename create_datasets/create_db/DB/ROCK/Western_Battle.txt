Blind meeting blind
Gotta get away from their art
Gotta get a skin that I can fill
Time for me to breathe it's been too long

Plenty tires your mind
I can use a little more
Well you think you got it right
I could use a little more

So I'll keep moving
Through your starland
'Cause I'm closing
Where you gonna run to next?

All the wasters come alive
All the wasters come alive
All the wasters come alive
And all the wasters...

Blind linking to
I got myself a line linking from
So laughing at the best that you can do
I'm laughing 'cause I know I'll soon be strong

Plenty tires your mind
I can use a little more
Well you think you got it right
I could use a little more

I'll keep moving
Through your starland
'Cause I'm closing
Where you gonna run to next?

All the wasters come alive
And all the wasters come alive
And all the wasters come alive
And all the wasters...

And all the wasters
All the wasters
And all the wasters
All the wasters

And all the wasters
Go!
Plenty tires your mind
I can use a little more

Well you think you got it right
Yeah could use a little more
I'll keep moving
Through your starland

'Cause I'm closing
Where you gonna run to next?
I'll keep moving
Through your starland

'Cause I'm closing
Where you gonna run to next?
All the wasters come alive
And all the wasters come alive

All the wasters come alive
All the wasters come alive
