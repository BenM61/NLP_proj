"I Am Blessed"    Ooh, hmm   Here in the silence I say a prayer  Though I've never seen you somehow I know you're there  You're in the faces of the people that I meet  You're as silent as the Earth beneath my feet  So if I should complain that all I have is not enough  Forgive me, I've been given so much     And I am blessed, every time I look into my baby's eyes  I think of all the friends who've touched my life  I realise in a world where some have more and some have less  I have love and I am blessed     So many changes this world can put you through  Sometimes it's hard to find a way if a heart can get confused  But then I hold you and it all falls into place  You've given me what time cannot erase  So when I'm feeling down or feel sorry for myself  I look around and it's easy to tell     That I am blessed, every time I look into my baby's eyes  I think of all the friends who touched my life  I realise in a world where some have more and some have less  I have love and I am blessed     Every time I look into my baby's eyes     I realise I think of all the friends who touched my life     And I am blessed (I am blessed)  Every time I look into my baby's eyes (I look into your eyes)  I think of all the friends who have touched my life  I realise (I realise) you've given me such peace and happiness  In this world where some have more and some have less  I am loved  And I am blessed
