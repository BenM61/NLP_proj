i got mumbles on the beats and me and biz is rappin 
and when we get together we makes it happen 
and if you find my ryhme book well please don't bend 
cause i can kill the man with the jab of my pen 
i'm not a violent man 
but hang with violent men 
sometimes i like to chill and try to read zen 
i gotta give props to a writer named wren(???) 
cause he's been around since god knows when 
i think it's time for an introduction 
my name is d-rock from a crew called len 
been into hip-hop since the age of 10 
and i leave them in shock when i begin 
that's why i don't front on my first impressions 
and i only write rhymes for my circle of friends 
it's like that, and that's the way it ends 
me and biz markie constantly set trends 

oh, what a beautiful day 
what a beautiful day 
what a beautiful day 

party people in the place i'd like to tell you a tale 
about a high powered girl 
her name is gale 
she's a funky fresh girly, she ain't stale 
everytime i see her she makes me hard as a nail 
i was chillin at my house drinkin ginger-ale 
watchin monty python and the holy grail 
when i got a phone call it never failed 
it came all the way from a college named yale 
i said hello pretty momma, what's up female? 
lets go on a cruise, or go on a sail 
but first let me call my mane named dale 
i call him, but he was in jail 
we both went down and paid his bail 
it came back three weeks in the mail 
one thing i forgot this last detail 
that the biz markie will always prevail 
oh, what a beautiful day 
what a beautiful day 
what a beautiful day 

yo, i want to say peace to all our crews 
east and west that rock the best 
say wuzzup to g-force, my man without a porsche 
a shout out to sean and mikah(???) 
for throwin those parties 
and how ya doin johnny walker in vancouver?

and a special big beautiful day 
to a special big beautiful label 
for givin us all that 
special special special beautiful cash
