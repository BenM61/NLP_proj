I got sand all by my bath water, candles by my wine glass
Women all on my time, imagine how my time pass
They say them freaks come out at night
And you know who they came to see
Even though she ain't mine
I fucked her like her man to be

So many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one
Exotic as they might come
Better leave with two 'cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight

Light skin, dark skin, sit your fine ass right there
Come join at my table and don't question when tonight end
Toss a couple dollars and she down for whatever
Make no promises but promise I could f*ck you better
F*ck that singing shit, I be the shit
That YM, too legit to quit
You thinkin' that you better then that Venus and Serena shit
I'm all up up on my latest chick
She saying it's that greatest dick
I one-two stroke her
We caught up in the moment, aye
T-t-turn up, V12 and I burn up
My chick that fly bitch and your bitch unheard of
4 AM and we still poppin' bottles
Probably have a new chick tomorrow
'Cause there's so many so many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one
Exotic as they might come
Better leave with two 'cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight

My problems in this pitcher
Got a bucket full of liquor
And I know y'all got that bad bitch
But ya got way too many nigga's
What's your phone numb'?
Tyga got some roll up
Loud pack with your bad ass
'Cause these good girls just ain't no fun
Double cup and I'm slowed up
Smokin' dub with my chauffeur
Sneaka fly, hitta stylin' I'm the reason why you nigga's foamed up
New York and my slow bucks
DC got that old cup
Hold up, these nigga's want no bucks
Straight shot sipper
I ain't mixing my liquor
Bitch I'm not kidding
Y'all some Fisher-Price nigga's
And we some life livers hoping that this life give us
A lot of money, success, and a woman to ride with us

So many so many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one
Exotic as they might come
Better leave with two 'cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight
