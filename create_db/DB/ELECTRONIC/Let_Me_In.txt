Let me in 
with the flowers 
don't bring me down 
I'm on the ground 
Let me in 
you got the power 
to kill the pain 
I'm feelin' deep within 

Last night I hurt you so 
but 'till the mornin' sun grow cold and rivers flow 
I promise you my heart 
and we can make love grow 
until the moon up high deserts the sky 
I know 
you'll never face a broken heart 
No doubt about it 
I want to win 
you back again 

Let me in 
your darkest hour 
just take my hand 
and try to understand 
I know I hurt you so 
and till the seas run dry I'll worship you and more 
I promise you my heart 
now we can make love grow 
until the lovers cease to dream and have no heart 
my lovely lady we'll never part 

Now we can dance upon the sweetest love refrain 
you're my tomorrow and you're my today 
now only you can show the way 
through fire and rain I'm feelin' pain so much 
you're such a part of me I want you back 
hey! It's good to see you again 

No doubt about it 
I want to win 
you back again 

Let me in 
to feel the fire 
let love unfold 
my body's wet and cold 
I'll never let you go 
until the sand rolls in the desert 
day by day 
I promise you my heart 
and we can make love grow 
until the day no longer turn the night away 
my lovely lady in love I'll stay 

Hey! Babe 
lead me through the colors of your rainbow now 
you gotta understand 
you got this shadow hangin' over me 
I'm not the man I used to be oh! No 
my destiny is in your hands 
I know your heart is sad and blue 
I'm lonely too 
so what's the use it's no excuse oh! No 
you got a winnin' hand 
so honey come on 
Let Me In....
