It's beautiful
Right before the end of summer
It's true
Truth be told
The truth is that we're whatever we can hold on to
Berlin sunrise
You're gonna come down
Berlin sunrise
You're gonna come down
Let's do some more and
Just ignore the day that's coming
Right on cue
It's good to know
That good things don't last for ever, no they don't
Not for you
Berlin sunrise
You're gonna come down
Berlin sunrise
You're gonna come down
Fall into your lover's arms
And remember those whose lovers' arms are closed
And remember those whose lovers' arms are closed...
