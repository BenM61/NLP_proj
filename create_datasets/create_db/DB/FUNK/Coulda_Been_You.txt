[Chorus]
Could of been you laying next to me
Could of been you feeling everything
You had it all and you didn't know
Now I've gotta let you go, let you go

Should of been you laying by my side
Should of been you with me every night
But instead you had to play
Now I'm on my way
See you later babe, later babe

I can't understand it, baby
You must be out your mind
For you to walk away from me
When you had good love all the time
You played the game and now you've lost
And it's time to pay the cost
Turned away when I let you in
Now you're thinking 'bout what could of been
Should of been

[Chorus]

You thought the grass was greener on the other side
You didn't know your ass was colorblind
Now you're feeling like I did you wrong
But you had me baby, all along
You couldn't see forest for the trees
Now love has got you on your knees
You should of kept me when you had me then
Now it's could of been, should of been

Could of been you laying next to me
should of been you feeling everything
You had it all and you didn't know
Now I've gotta let you go, let you go

Coulda been you laying by my side
should of been you with me every night
But instead you had to play
Now I'm on my way
See you later babe, later babe

[D'Angelo]
Baby, let me explain 
(No no no no no no no)
I was temporarily insane
Didn't know what was going on in my mind
I was so blind, true love I could find lady
Can you please let me back in
I promise I won't do it again yeah, yeah
One more chance is all I ask
Girl, let's put the past
Let the past be the past
It's all in you, babe

[Angie]
I tried and I cried, whoa, whoa whoa

Could of been you, oh
I know you think I'm crazy
But I still love you
Heart and soul
Forever and ever and ever

should of been you, oh
I know you think I'm crazy
But I still feel you 
Why'd you have to play
Put me down
Broke me down

[Chorus: Repeats]
