All right â?¦

Girl, we're makin' music
Lyin' here tonight
The kind of song
That can't last long
But keeps on feelin' right.

I hear the tune you're playin'
And it makes my soul unwind
But I cannot sing your melody
With another song on my mind.

O-h, n-o-o â?¦

I can feel the shadows
Of a worn out melody
Simple tune
That ends too soon
In broken harmony.

The interludes of changin' moods
That never seek to bind
But I cannot sing your melody
With another song on my mind.

Treat me like a movie
That you have seen before
You know the way the ending goes
But you still come back for more.

So, girl keep on composin'
Let the music be
And always kind of song for you
A sometime song for me.

And when your bed is empty
Please don't think me unkind
But I cannot sing your melody
With another song on my mind.

O-h, n-o-o â?¦

And when your bed is empty
Please don't think me unkind
But I cannot sing your melody
With another song on my mind.

O-h, n-o-o â?¦
