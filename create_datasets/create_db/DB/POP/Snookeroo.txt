By Elton John and Bernie Taupin

ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!

I WAS BORN IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND,
I WAS RAISED IN A WORKING TOWN.
I BROKE ALL THE RULES WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL,
BUT THE TEACHER'S COULDN'T PIN ME DOWN.

I TRIED TO MAKE MY PARENTS PROUD
BY ADAPTING THE SOCIAL POWERS.
OH, PIGS WILL FLY AND THE EARTH WILL FRY,
WHEN THEY GET ME DOING HONEST HOURS.

SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO, DADDY'S GOING ON THE BOOZE.
MOTHER USED TO CUT MY HAIR AND SISTER USED TO MAKE THE NEWS.
WELL, IT WAS TWO ROOMS UP AND TWO ROOMS DOWN,
WE WERE SENTENCED BY THE WRECKING CRANE.
OH, I WAS BORN ON THE EVE OF HALLOWEEN
AND SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO'S MY NAME.

I NEED SOMEONE TO COOK FOR ME
AND TURN ME LOSE AT NIGHT.
I COULD SPEND MY LIFE WITH A FACTORY GIRL,
'CAUSE A FACTORY GIRL'S MY TYPE.

I HEAR THEM GOSSIP ON THE STREET,
MOST OF WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE.
OH, DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I HEAR THEM SAY,
"THERE GOES THAT LAZY, NO GOOD SNOOKEROO."

SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO, DADDY'S GOING ON THE BOOZE.
MOTHER USED TO CUT MY HAIR AND SISTER USED TO MAKE THE NEWS.
WELL, IT WAS TWO ROOMS UP (two rooms up)
AND TWO ROOMS DOWN, (two rooms down)
WE WERE SENTENCED BY THE WRECKING CRANE.
OH, I WAS BORN ON THE EVE OF HALLOWEEN
AND SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO, (Snookeroo)
SNOOKEROO'S MY NAME.

(Oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo)

SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO, DADDY'S GOING ON THE BOOZE.
MOTHER USED TO CUT MY HAIR AND SISTER USED TO MAKE THE NEWS.
WELL, IT WAS TWO ROOMS UP (two rooms up)
AND TWO ROOMS DOWN, (two rooms down)
WE WERE SENTENCED BY THE WRECKING CRANE.
WELL, I WAS BORN ON THE EVE OF HALLOWEEN
AND SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO,
SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO,
SNOOKEROO, SNOOKEROO,
SNOOKEROO'S MY NAME, YEH.
