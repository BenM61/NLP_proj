You're so awful, you're so ugly
So unattractive, so hard to get along with
I'd like to hurt you, I'd like to leave you
Cut these chains and release me
It's been a long time, I spent my whole life
Trying to please you, trying to make you smile
But you're fashionable, unhappy
I'm lazy, so I love you for a while
Like you're the last, last girl on Earth

Last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth

And when I left you, yeah, when I left you
I felt better; I was happy
Just for a minute, just for a second
I thought I missed you; I must've been losing my mind
I'm alone now; I'm all alone now
Things couldn't get much worse
I can't help wondering, I can't help thinking
Could she have been the last girl on earth?

Not the last last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth

Last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth
Last girl on Earth
Last, last, last, last, last, last girl on...
Last, last, last, last, last, last girl on...
Last, last, last, last, last, last
Girl on Earth
