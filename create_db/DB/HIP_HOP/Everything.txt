You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

It's all because of you
I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days
In your own special way
Whenever you're around
I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend
On you I can depend

You take me away
From the pain
And you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy
Days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
To me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love
That your love can't be replaced

You are my everything (you are my everything)
Love so good, so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything
And everything is you

My darling only you
Can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray
You'll never go away
I promise I will try
Until the day I die
To treat you like a king
Cause you are my everything

You take me away
From the pain
And you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy
Days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
It never occurred, it never occurred to me
I would fall so deep 
That your love can't be replaced

You are my everything (you are my everything)
Love so good, so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything
And everything is you

You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

When you're lovin' me
Put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me
Said I feel so safe I found security
When you're lovin' me
Forever I want you home with me
(When you're lovin' me) My every every every everything

You are my everything (you are my everything)
Love so good, so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything
And everything is you

(You take me away) You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

You are my everything
Love so good, so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything
And everything is you
