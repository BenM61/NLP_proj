Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?

Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?

There's a mood spreading round the world today
Can you feel the force?
It's with you in your work or at your play
Can you feel the force?
They're cleaning up the streets throughout the world
Can you feel the force?
Ghetto folk have had the final furl
Can you feel the force?

You can feel the pressure lifting off your head
People who make war are making love instead
This could be the dawning of another time
Hatred is a stranger we can see the sign

Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?
Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?

All you people with your heads on the ground
Can you feel the force?
I can feel the hope spreading all around
Can you feel the force?
I can feel a new beginning in the air
Can you feel the force?
Peace and love forming everywhere
Can you feel the force?

You can see a change in people's attitudes
Looking to the future in much brighter moods
There's a message clearly written in the sky
Time to change and soon we'll all be flying high

Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?
Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?
