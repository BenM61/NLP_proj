Oh, do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before, baby
Do, do, do, what I do, do, do
Adore, baby

Let's try again
Sigh again
Fly again to heaven
Baby, see
It's A, B, C
I love you
And you love me

I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, baby

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't
Come true, baby

My heart begins to hum
Dum, de, dum
De, dum, dum, dum

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done before

I remember the bliss
Of that wonderful kiss
You said that a boy
Could never give more joy
From any little miss

I remember it quite
It was a wonderful night
Oh, how I'd adore it
If you would encore it

I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, baby

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't
Come true, baby

My heart begins to hum
Dum, de, dum
De, dum, dum, dum

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done before
