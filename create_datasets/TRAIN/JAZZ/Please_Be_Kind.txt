This is my first affair, so please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh, please be kind
This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade
If you'll just understand, they'll never, never fade

Tell me your love's sincere, oh, please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, oh, please be kind
'Cause if you leave me dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please be kind
