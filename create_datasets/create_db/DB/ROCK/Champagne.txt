Champagne                                                                     
You're my champagne 
My only side mundane
You make me sane 
  
You are my tower 
When I am one step away from 
Hurting myself 
Girl, you can golden shower 
All over me 
Cause I'm one inch away from 
Destroying myself 
  
I only wish that you've plans for 
Me baby 
You know I'll be good and you can 
Stick everything in me 
The reason I jump from my seat is 
Not you, 
I'm just very alert, don't want to 
Car crash with you
