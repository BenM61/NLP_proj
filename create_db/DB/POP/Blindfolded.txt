I will go, I will go, I will go insane
If you never fight back when I complain
Do you mind, do you mind stepping up your game?
Got me wondering why you acting so damn plain

I get it, I'm sorry, I thought that we would be
So honest, we promised, don’t stay mad at me
I get it, I’m sorry, I'm blaming jealousy
If I’m honest, will you promise

Don’t leave me blindfolded it’s on you
When all I’m asking for is the truth
Don’t leave me blindfolded wish I could
Put them on a public watch
So that I can read your thoughts

What am i, what am i, what I am doing?
What if it's in my head and I lose him?
Can we talk, can we talk, can we talk again?
One more time, let me in, please listen

I get it, I'm sorry, I thought that we would be
So honest, we promised, don’t stay mad at me
I get it, I’m sorry, I'm blaming jealousy
If I’m honest, will you promise

Don't leave me blindfolded, it's on you
When all I'm asking for is the truth
Don’t leave me blindfolded, wish I could
Put them on a public watch so that I can read your thoughts

I get it, I'm sorry, I thought that we would be
So honest, we promised, don’t stay mad at me
I get it, I’m sorry, I'm blaming jealousy
If I’m honest, will you promise

Don't leave me blindfolded, it's on you
When all I'm asking for is the truth
Don’t leave me blindfolded, wish I could
Put them on a public watch so that I can read your thoughts
