Here I come
'Cause I don't know better
I'm a thief and a sinner
I'm a fool and a debtor

You got your pushin' numbers
You got your pushin' a broom
And what's lucky to some
Is breakin' even to you

[Chorus]
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down

Well I don't understand why
And I might never know
But I believe in love
I like to swallow it whole

How come the best of 'em wind up
Sweepin' dirt off the street
And the worst of 'em end up
Right back up on their feet

Got a heart full of blood
I got muscle and feeling
But I'm flat on my back
I'm starin' up at the ceiling

[Chorus]

If I've seen it once
I've seen it time and again
You don't know where you're goin'
Don't know where you are
You don't know where you been

[Chorus]
