I'm an ever spinning top 
Whirling around 'till I drop 
Oh, but what am I to do 
My mind is in a whirlpool 
Give me a little hope 
One small thing to cling to

[Chorus: x2]
You got me going in circles 
Oh, around and around I go 
You got me going in circles 
Oh, around and around I go 

First you go and tell me this 
Then you go and doin that 
Its mixed signals in my head 
You never give me straight facts 
Comin' at me with these stories 
Taken up a playa time 
You seemed confused up in yo head 
And you can not make up your mind 
I'd be the first one to listnin'
But I think its disrespect 
Lyin' through yo teeth talkin' out the side of yo neck 
Got me goin' round and round 
Make a playa wanna hurt ya 
Thinkin' that you was straight up 
Got me goin' in a circle 

Ay, my head is constantly spinnin' twistin' 
'cause Nadas was trippin' on me 
First time for ya lovy dubbi 
And now he call me his homie 
Wishy washy kinda feelin 
Tryna play wit my emotions 
And mumbled the words I love you 
Went then said that he was jokin'
Stuffed up in the mind 
Tough love is what he calls it 
I don't read between the lines 
Now you need to get the talkin'
Spell it out and make it clear 
Don't tell me what I wanna hear 
Yes or no jus' goin' and say it 
'cause inside I'm goin' crazy

[Chorus] 

I'm strung out over you (you, ova you)

Yes it relaxes me, satisfactory, 
Treat me like a queen 
It was love at first sight on that night 
Once I stepped on the scene 
Now my body once I got it 
Fulfillin' all my needs 
He had my feenin', obscenein' not meanin'
Jus' smellin' his grease 
I really want him, yes I want him 
But the law disagrees 
Our loves illegal certain people 
Man I wish they could see me 
He got me goin' in circles 
As dizzy as I wanna be 
Down through my toes 
He feel my soul 
Man I want him badly 

Ay, shawty got me spinnin' 
Like I drunk tha whole fifth 
Waitin' on my baby girl call her I need a lift 
Baby saved out the rip 
But can't save my ship 
Love the way the jam wobble 
In the thong that she get 
Prey to blissin' ova here 
Let me push yo button 
I'm a real gangsta shawty, don't worry bout nothin'
5 hours lata, bussin' unconditional lovin' 
And can tell the whole click 
This one here, I'm cuffin'

[Chorus] 

I'm strung out over you (I need you, ova you)
