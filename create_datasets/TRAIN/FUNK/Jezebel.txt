Jezebel
She cast a spell
After the show
If you meet her at the backdoor
She likes the boys in the band
She was a one-night-stand
But you better watch your wallet
She clean out your pockets
Jezebel

Jezebel
She's fine as hell
I met her in a pub
That's when she cast her spell
I looked in her eyes
It was time to bail
We left the club sometime after twelve
Now she got me hypnotized to the bossa nova
Trapped in the twilight hoping this spell could be over

Jezebel
She cast a spell
After the show
If you meet her at the backdoor
She likes the boys in the band
She was a one-night-stand
But you better watch your wallet
She clean out your pockets
Jezebel

Jezebel
She's a crook
Seduces men with her looks
She'll control your mind
And then she'll rob you blind
Jezebel
She looks alive from crime
Now she still got me hypnotized to the bossa nova
Trapped in the twilight hoping this spell could be over

Jezebel
She cast a spell
After the show
If you meet her at the backdoor
She likes the boys in the band
She was a one-night-stand
But you better watch your wallet
She clean out your pockets
Jezebel

Mama, lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

Now I learned from my mistakes
And when I woke from the nightmare dream
I realized it's not too late
If there's anybody out there that knows a Jezebel
Watch your back or she will send your soul to hell

Jezebel
She cast a spell
After the show
If you meet her at the backdoor
She likes the boys in the band
She was a one-night-stand
But you better watch your wallet
She clean out your pockets
Jezebel

Jezebel, Jezebel, Jezebel, Jezebel
