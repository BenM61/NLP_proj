Warm place calm and quiet
Small grace white birds high up
You know fireworks and fairy tales and dragonfly
In my summer mind

Soft sand dark skin
Palm trees and sun cream
Easy talking in the bed
I drink your lies

With some corona
And the heat smells good close to your head
Right in the streets of Barcelona
Dangerous, looks fake

Beautiful mistake
How come such a big storm in these green eyes
How come such a big storm in these green eyes
Easy talking in the bed

I drink your lies
With some corona
The heat smells good close to your head
Right in the streets of Barcelona

Don't care what people say I'm dreaming louder everyday
