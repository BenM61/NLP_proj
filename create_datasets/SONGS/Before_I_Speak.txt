What's mine is yours 
Though you were never mine 
My gracious doors 
Are open wide 

I gave my hand 
I gave my whole life too 
But you took my plan 
And turned it into bad bad news 

I need an explanation 
An emancipation 
From this revelation that I can not bear 
I need some information 
I need a real foundation 
You gotta have some wisdom 
That you'd like to share 

Tell me, how 
Can you judge me 
Before we meet 
Tell me, how 
Can you hear me 
Before I 
Before I 
Before I speak 

My heavy head 
My heavy mind 
My skinny self 
Is working overtime 

You ate my words 
And spit them out 
And those who heard 
Are left without a doubt 

Mold me 
Fold me 
Take me anyway you want me
