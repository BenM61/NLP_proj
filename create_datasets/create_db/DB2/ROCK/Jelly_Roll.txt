She said come lay with me darling
She said take my love from me
She said I'll be yours forever
If you just believe in me
Any way you want me, boy
My love I give to you
For I was born to love you
Take me any way you choose

Heartache coming my way
Angel feels like my dying day

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no priest
All I need is my baby girl
To bring it on home to me
I just need her loving
Each and every day
Only she can set me free
And take my blues away

She said trust in me my darling
For together we are strong
She said you are the one I live for
I would never do you wrong
She done fooling with my head
She take possession of my heart
Now I'm standing all alone here
And my world just fall apart

Heartache coming my way
Angel feels like my dying day
Feels like my dying day

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no priest
All I need is my baby girl
To bring it on home to me
I just need her loving
Each and every day
Only she can set me free
And take my blues away
Scream to the heavens
My God make me strong
No one can hear me
My love she has gone
What can I say?
What can I do?
Baby I tell you
My love still belongs to you

Love can break your heart
Only love can break your heart
I gave you all I had to give
No words could say how much I miss you
Love can break your heart
Only love can break your heart
I gave you all I had to give
No words could say how much I miss you

Love can break your heart
Only love can break your heart
Love can break your heart
Only love can break your heart
Love can break your heart
Only love can break your heart
