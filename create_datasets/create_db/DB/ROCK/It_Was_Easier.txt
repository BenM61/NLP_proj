First she took him to town
But the reason for this was not found
And before he even wanted to cry
She said summer days go by

Next she showed him around
Let me introduce and glad that I found
But the harder he wanted to try
She said summer days go by
Would you please identify
There's no time to cry

It was easier
When he ran away
Almost every day
No talking, no say
It was easier
When he tried to hide
So deep down inside
And turn out the light

It's birthday coming around
But the people for this were not found
And before he could fall on the ground
She said summer days go by
Would you please identify
There's no time to cry

It was easier
When he ran away
Almost everyday
No talking, no say
It was easier
When he tried to hide
So deep down inside
And turn out the light

So much easier
When he used to run away
Just like yesterday
Like a child
So much easier
When he used to hide a while
Behind a smile
Just like a child

No, he couldn't believe
That his girl was a thief
Who was taking their memories away
Nothing's determined to stay

It was easier
When he ran away
Almost everyday
No talking, no say
It was easier
When he tried to hide
So deep down inside
And turn out the light

So much easier
When he used to run away
Just like yesterday
Like a child
So much easier
When he used to hide a while
Behind a smile
Just like a child
So much easier
When he used to run away

Just like yesterday, like a child
So much easier
When he used to hide a while
Behind a smile
Just like a child
So much easier
When he used to run away
Just like yesterday
Like a child
