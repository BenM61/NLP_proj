Honey, you got me dreamin'
My head is spinning 'round and 'round, I can't believe it
Will you tell me your name?
And if you won't, that's all right, 'cause I won't complain
(What I want to know. . .)

(Are you free girl) Free to talk to me
(Are you free girl) To have a cup of tea, you see
(Are you free girl) Free to be with me
(Are you free girl, yeah, yeah yeah)

I hope you feel the same
'Cause I've had enough of ladies playing silly games (silly games)
Meet me, meet me half way
Because I want to pick your brain, see what you have to say

(Are you free girl) Free to talk to me
(Are you free girl) To have a cup of tea, you see
(Are you free girl) Free to be with me
(Are you free girl, yeah, yeah yeah)

(Are you free girl) Free up your mind
(Are you free girl) To have a cup of tea, you see
