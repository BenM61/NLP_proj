Hurricane hurricane
A mighty earthquake and a hurricane
The earth cracked open and was breathing fire
Everybody's running none ready to die
Some going crazy some insane
Saying save me from the mighty hurricane

People scrambling and on the run
Like they were hit with the atom bomb
Some lay cripple some lay lame
Just save me from the mighty hurricane

Rich folks falling down on their knees
Begging lord have mercy if you please
Take all of my money I don't need a thing
Just save me from the mighty hurricane
