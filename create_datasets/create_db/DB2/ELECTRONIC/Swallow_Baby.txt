"Martini is at the piano,a cigarette hanging from her lips"

The more I see, the more I do,
The more I spit, the more I chew,
The more you suck, the more I have to
Swallow baby.

And when I see the things you do,
The more I want the least of you,
The more I spit, the more you have to
Swallow baby.

You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push to make me
Swallow baby.

You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push to make me
Swallow baby.

And so you think that I'm a freak
Because I refuse to sneak
Around the back of your dull head is
Hollow baby.

And maybe you can see me lie
Out of your one good eye
Around the back of your dull head so
Hollow baby

Hang bone? Hang bone?
I don't need yours, 'cause I got one of my own.
Hang Bone? Hang bone?
I don't need yours, 'cause I got one of my own.

And now I see the things you do
It makes me want the least from you,
How does it suck for you to have to
Swallow baby

So maybe you can see me lie,
Out of your one good eye
Around the back of your dull head so
Hollow baby.

Swallow baby
Swallow baby
Swallow baby
Swallow baby

You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push to make me
Swallow baby.

You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push it,
You think you gotta push to make me
Swallow baby.

Hang Bone? Hang bone?
I don't need yours, 'cause I got one of my own.
Hang Bone? Hang bone?
I don't need yours, 'cause I got one of my own.
