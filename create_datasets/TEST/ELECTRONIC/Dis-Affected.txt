Just hanging around 
Like a dis-used satellite 
Gathering space junk 
In her bigger disguise 
Life strewn landmine style in her wake 
Clutching her ball of broken stardust 
Heating and squeezed 
Glowing so feebly 
Ready to throw into my eyes 
Stealla blowout 
Dust pouring from the vacuum 
Of her exploading mind 
Stealla 
I hide behind the calm moon 
I can't give her 
What she can't find 
Now I don't think she likes me 
I make it hard for her to find me 
Victory within defeat 
But opposites can be united 
Only in the form of compromise 
Between the light and the darkness 
Is a share in both skies 
Stealla blowout 
Dust pouring from the vacuum 
Of her exploading mind 
Stealla 
I hide behind the calm moon 
I can give her what she can't find 
Stealla hangs around the quasar 
Stealing illumination 
For her bigger reprise 
Juxtapose the boundary 
Heart like an asteroid 
Turning on that cosmic split 
Without delusion or regret 
But her repressed desires 
Stick like arrows in my flesh
