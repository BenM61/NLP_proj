Blood shot eyes on factory floors
Filling up little bottles
The great depressed, the o.k., the not sure,
Empty out little pockets
If you stop believing let me know
And we don't even show
Our feelings hide
What keeps deceiving, let it go
Now we don't even know
The biggest prize, I'm not so sure anymore

Blood shot types wash up on the shore
Crawling out from the life boat
Creeping past all border control
Filling up empty promises
If you stop believing, let me know
Now we don't even show
Our feelings hide
Don't let yourself feel alive

You're the first this has happened to

We mix together
We mix together
We mix together
