We make ritual noise
We weave the fabric of dreams
We build cities of sound
We feel the rhythm of time

We make ritual noise
We weave the fabric of dreams
We build cities of sound
We feel the rhythm of time

We make ritual noise
Wired to the world under our fingertips
We take special care
Listen to the words spoken in confidence

We make ritual noise
Shouting to be heard
Cooling our burning lips
We break down the gates
Open up our wounds bleeding for innocence

We make ritual noise
We weave the fabric of dreams
We build cities of sound
We feel the rhythm of time

We live generous lives
We have the power of will
We turn logic around
We feed the engine of change

We make ritual noise
We weave the fabric of dreams
We build cities of sound
We feel the rhythm of time

We live dangerous lives
We have the power of will
We twist logic around
We feed the engine of change
