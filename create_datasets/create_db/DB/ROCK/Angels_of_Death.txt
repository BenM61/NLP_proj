Tyrants from hell prepare to burn our souls
At the sound of the knell the Earth becomes a morgue

Angels of death the seven trumpets hail
Tyrants from hell have lust to burn our souls
Death by the flame in darkness we shall fall
Nuclear warfare a war to end all wars
Fire from hell revelations told

Engulfed in this tomb death awaits us all
Power and greed are our captors in this hell
