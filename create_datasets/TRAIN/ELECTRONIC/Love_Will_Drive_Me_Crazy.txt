I met a girl in Brooklyn
I met her in Paris
She told her name was Lisa
Her real name was Mary
I fell in love with Lisa
I married her one day
The next thing that I heard
She's leaving in l.a.

Oh be	-be	-baby I'm feeling love will drive me crazy
And if you call my number, girl
Oh, I'll kiss you - be my lady
Oh be	-be	-baby I'm feeling love will drive me crazy
And if you touch my body, girl
I'll love you - there's no maybe
Oooooooooh, can you, can you feel it (can you, can you feel it)
Can you, can you feel it
I'm feeling love is in the air

...
In a lazy red light bar
No one is just like Lisa
Her love is so bizarre
She had a friend in l.a.
Near downtown boulevard
The last thing I remember
She always break my heart

Oh be	-be	-baby I'm feeling love will drive me crazy
And if you call my number, girl
Oh, I'll kiss you - be my lady
Oh be	-be	-baby I'm feeling love will drive me crazy
And if you touch my body, girl
I'll love you - there's no maybe
Oooooooooh, can you, can you feel it (can you, can you feel it)
Can you, can you feel it
I'm feeling love is in the air

From L.A. to N.Y. babe
From Houston to L.A.
My heartache went like crazy
When she went away
From Texas to Vegas
From Vegas to the sea
I heard my heart was crying
Oh come back to me
