There's a rumbling in my head
It's getting louder and louder
There's a shaking in my bones
It's getting stronger and stronger

There's a hunger in my heart
It's full of promise, promise
There's an itch under my skin
It's under my skin, under my skin

'Cause I, I just wanna feel something real
'Cause I, I just wanna feel something

On the pavement I'm a looking
For a lover, a lover
And my eyes are rolling
She noticed, she noticed

There's a blood red on my shirt
And it's shining, shining
There's a sharp pain from my face
I kinda like it, I like it

'Cause I, I just wanna feel something real
'Cause I, I just wanna feel something real
Wanna feel something

I just wanna love
I just wanna touch
I just wanna see
(Something)

I just wanna love
I just wanna touch
I just wanna see

'Cause I, I just wanna feel something real
'Cause I, I just wanna feel something real
Wanna feel something
