And in the dark it comes for me
Malevolent and without thought
Uprooting trees, destroying cars
Cold and relentless, with arms outstretched

No boat nor brick
Nor crucifix can hold it back
I've been wicked
I've been arrogant

And when it comes it will feel like a kiss (Silent about it)
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And I cannot say that I was not warned or was misled
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss

Awaken from dreams of drunken car crashes
You saddened my friends and claimed all my lovers
I tried to stay still, so it will not see
Its talons rake the side of my face
When did you become such a slut?

And when it comes it will feel like a kiss (Silent about it)
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And I cannot say that I was not warned or was misled
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss

And I didn't think I'd catch fire when I held my hand to the flame
And I didn't think it would catch up as fast as I could have run
Fate came a knocking when I was looking the other way
A new disease came in the post for me today

And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And when it comes
And when it comes
And when it comes
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
