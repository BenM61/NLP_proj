It started out good
Like fairytale
No one got hurt
Cause truth came first
Beautiful
Left unconditional
You stood right by
But I drifted away
I should have stayed
But I lost faith
I knew you'd break
More give than take
The sun beats down
But there's a black cloud
Looming over my head, cause

All I know is I did you wrong
All I know is you'd be strong
Without me
Without me

Crimson sky
It was you and I
Will the love we have
Stand the test of time
Summer days
All the things we'd say
Nothing could
Ever get in our way
But then things changed
Like some cruel game
I've only got
Myself to blame
I broke your heart
Right from the start
It's taking over my head, cause

All I know is I did you wrong
All I know is you'd be strong
Without me
Without me

All I know is I did you wrong
All I know is you'd be strong
Without me
Without me

All I know is I did you wrong
All I know is you'd be strong
Without me
Without me

All I know is I did you wrong
All I know is you'd be strong
Without me
Without me

All I know is I did you wrong
All I know is you'd be strong
Without me
Without me
