Deeper, deeper than God
The kid is just a sleeper
Look in his eyes
"I think he's got a fever,
Should I get his mom?"
No, go and get a scalpel
We're planting a bomb
I think we'll build a tower
Inside of his head
That topples every hour
Renders him dead
We'll put him in a blender
See how he does
Until he can't remember
The boy that he was

This is Halloween
It's Halloween
Ha ha ha ha
This is Halloween
Whoever you are

Persistence, this is the key
Lock him in a basement
Leave him to me
A thing goes wrong
In the darkness unseen
As we're lighting them up
You know they're splicing the gene

This is Halloween
It's Halloween
Ha ha ha ha
This is Halloween
Whoever you are

The sin is the same
For masking the blame
Butcha didn't wanna
Down in the valley below
There's people on fire
And they don't even know

This is Halloween
It's Halloween
Ha ha ha ha
This is Halloween
Whoever you are

This is Halloween
Many thanks to you
Many things to do
And the beat goes on
(This is Halloween)
Until the beat gets through
Teary eyes only see a blurry reality
And the beat goes on 
Until the beat gets free
