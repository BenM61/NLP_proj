In Spain they say "Si, Si"
In France you'll hear "Oui, Oui"
Every little Dutch girl says "Ya, Ya"
Every little Russian says "Da, Da"

But, Sweetheart, tell me why
No matter how I try
You won't listen to my plea
Won't say "Yes" in any language to me
When will you say "Si, Si"

"Si, Si", "Si, Si"
"Si, Si", "Si, Si"
Every little Dutch girl says "Ya, Ya", ya-ya-ya
Every little Russian says "Da, Da"

But, Sweetheart, oh, why won't you tell me why
No matter how m-m-much I try, please tell me why
La-la-la-la-da, won't listen to my plea
Won't say "Yes" on any language to me
Oh-woh, and when you say "Si, Si", say "Si, Si"

La la la la la la la da da da da
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da daaa

If you could only say "Si, Si", "Oui, Oui", "Ya, Ya", "Da, Da,"
Da da da la da
And all my life would be a song,
Nothing could go wrong, go wrong, go wrong

If you give in, I'll win
I won't give up, give up
Darling, if you give in
I must hear you say "Si, Si"

Oh, won't you listen to my plea
Please say "Yes" in any language to me
Won't you say "Si, Si", say "Si, Si"
