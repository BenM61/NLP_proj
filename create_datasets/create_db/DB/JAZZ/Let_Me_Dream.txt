Let me dream, while my heart is large
As the moon, draws this lovely night
Let me dream, of a perfect love
For we too, need the stars above
A sun that keeps on shining
A rose forever blooming
A love that will weather the years, free from bitter tears
With my dream, I begin to live
Just for you alone, let me dream
