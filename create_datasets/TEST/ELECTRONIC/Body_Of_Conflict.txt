When I'm lost
Can't find my way
You're the light that leads to harbor

When I'm crushed can't find my strength
You are all elements of life
Giving me skin so warm so tender
Giving me deep a sense of believe

All I know, all there is
A reflection of you
A home to this body of conflict

Deep into my love
Deep into my heart
Deep into surrender

When I'm blocked
Can't find my words
You're the lines
Making a sentence
When I'm hurt
Can't find the sense
You're the sun
That heals all sorrow
All I know, all there is
A reflection of you
A home to this body of conflict

Deep into my love
Deep into my heart
Deep into surrender
