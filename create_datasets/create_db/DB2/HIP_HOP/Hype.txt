You're only twenty nine
Gotta lot to learn
But when your mummy dies
She will not return

We like noise
It's our choice
It's what want to do
We don't care about long hair
I don't wear flares

See my face not a trace
No reality I don't work
I just speed that's all I need

I'm a lazy sod I'm a lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod I'm so lazy
I'm a lazy sod I'm a lazy sid
I'm a lazy sod I'm so lazy
I can't even be bothered
Lazy lazy
