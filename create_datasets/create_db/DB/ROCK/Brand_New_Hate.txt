Makin' enemies is good
Makin' enemies is good
Makin' enemies is good

More to loose than necessary
And far too much to gain
I'm going down, down, down, down
Hide the pain

Of all the sharks in all the waters
I cut but I don't bleed
And you can feed me babe, feed me babe
It's all I need

And makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
Yeah!

Mind over matter
Mind over matter

Try to make a monkey of me
And I'll swing back and say
You make it easy man, easy man
It's a holiday

I don't need your fake assed friendship
Or your silicon sympathy
You've got a brand new f*ck you enemy

And makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
Yeah!

Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter

I don't hear you I don't need to
I don't hear you I don't need to

Waaah!

And makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
Makin' enemies is good
I've got a brand new hate for you
