You know I love you, can't stand the way you do
You know I love you, can't stand the way you do
Well, you telling me it's true now and that's alright for you

Bye bye, baby baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby baby, don't cry

Sometimes I wonder, why don't she write to me?
Sometimes I wonder, why don't she write to me?
If I've been a bad fellow, I didn't intend to be

Baby baby, come back home to me
Baby baby, come back home to me
You know I love ya baby, my old time used to be
