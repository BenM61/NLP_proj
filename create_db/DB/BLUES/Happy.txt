Only you can make me happy
Happy
Only you can make me happy
I never thought that I
I'd find someone like you
I feel hypnotized
With the things you do
I'll never let you go
No
you're so right for me
I have to let you know
Forever you and me

Only you can make me happy
Happy
Only you can make me happy
Happy

You must be Heaven sent
Sent into my life
And I compliment you baby
Baby
We have a love that's strong and true
It's true in every way
I want to be with you
Each and every day

Only you can make me happy
Happy
Only you can make me happy
So Happy
