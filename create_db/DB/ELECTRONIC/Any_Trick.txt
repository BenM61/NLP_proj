I can't stand this tension
I'm pulling out my hair
I sweat blood, day and night for you
You know this can't be fair

Tearing at my very soul
Wounding me with words
Shaking, as I lose control
I must be on the verge

You've even got me crawling on my hands and knees for you
I'm just your private clown, and there's no trick that I won't do

Ah, baby you've got me jumping like a monkey
I'm so crazy, I'll do any trick for you
Baby, you've got me jumping like a monkey
I'm so crazy, I'll do any trick for you

Doctor just can't cure me
Of this strange disease
All the symptoms that I show
Won't remedy with ease

Madness, chugging like a train
I'm fixed upon these rails
When the fuse goes in my brain
My sanity will fail

Ah, baby you've got me jumping like a monkey
I'm so crazy, I'll do any trick for you
Baby, you've got me jumping like a monkey
I'm so crazy, I'll do any trick for you

I'm just your whipping boy
Hangin' on each word you say
Love, so near insanity
This time push me all the way, all the way.
