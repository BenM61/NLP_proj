We're kids no more baby, we belong you and me together
I vowed never to do you wrong, and shall always keep you happy, (together)

Now dear the things that I need are very few 
But there is one thing, that I demand of you
Just be true, to me, just be true

Don't be offended from the things I've said
For I know it will never be that bad
But my dear, I couldn't help but let 'cha know
That if you should leave me, it would hurt me so

nah nah nah nah 
I've given you all of me, and and plan to give even more, baby
My true love and a sweet affection, and there's even more in store,
baby

Now all these things for you alone I'd do
And I'd need nothing in return, just as long as you
Just be true, to me, just be true
To me, wo oh wo ooh wo baby, 
(fade) to me, be be be be be be be be true
