And the fields are turning
And the temperature is rising
See the factories burning
(when?) the wheels keep turning

Well, I've seen that you've grown now
With the horses you ride
Gonna have your say now
I see the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind
She got the time
I see the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind
She got the time
I see the new moon rising

I see this small town boy now
From a small town family
He's got to find his way now
Gotta find himself a woman
With the skill of the people
He don't wanna be no whipping boy
Well, the time has come now
Gotta hit the highway

Oh, she don't mind
She got the time
I see the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind
She got the time
I see the new moon rising

I see the new moon rising

I see the new moon rising

See the new moon rising
When the (tides are turning)
She got the (luck of knowing)
She got the (? showing)
Well, they're all in-love now
And, see the (fields are turning)
I see the new moon rising

I see the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind
She got the time
I see the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind
She got the time
I see the new moon rising
