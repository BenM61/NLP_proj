I love your black dress, your red lips, your long legs, your high heels
I love your thigh-high boots, your snake skin one-piece suit
Yeah you really get me going when you put it all on
But I like it a little better when you take it all off

Now baby come one, put it all on
Baby come on, take it all off

I love your leopard spot bikini and your black pantyhose
I love it when you hop out of bed and dance to the radio
Yeah you really get me going when you put it all on
But I like it a little better when you take it all off

Now baby come one, put it all on
Baby come on, take it all off
Now watch me take it off

I love it when you keep me movin' every time you're standing still
I love the look in your eyes when you're licking your lips
Yeah you really get me going when you put it all on
But I like it a little better when you take it all off

Now baby come one, put it all on
Baby come on, take it all off
