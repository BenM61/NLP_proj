Have ya heard about a place in town
An eatin' place, drinkin' place of great renown
Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah

There is a rib joint where the folks all meet
Meet ev'ry mornin' for to drink and eat
It's not so high class but it can't be beat
Between 18th and 19th on Chestnut Street

You hear piano played by Stacy Trent
He is a famous boogie woogie gent
You ought to stop there if you're pleasure bent
Between 18th and 19th on Chestnut Street

Come along some night, if you're feelin' right
Wear a cloud for a hat
You have a reservation 
For some daybreak syncopation
That's where the Hoiti Toi meet the Hoi Polloi

The man that owns it is Sylvester Brown
His girl friend Bessie wears a rhinestone gown
It's on the south side at the edge of the town
Between 18th and 19th on Chestnut Street
