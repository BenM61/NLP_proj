If you're lookin' for the man
That will walk away from responsibility
I ain't the one, I ain't the one, I ain't the one
And if you're lookin' for the brotha
That'll treat you like anything but a queen, I ain't the one

But if you're lookin' for a man
That'll sweep you off your tired weary feet
Pay your bills, buy you pretty dresses

And take you anywhere you wanna eat
Make love to you every night of the week
Oh, don't think it over, girl
Look no further, I am the one, oh yes I am

If you're lookin' for a man
That'll make big money
And keep it all to himself
I ain't the one, no, no, not me

And if you're lookin' for a man
That'll have ten women
And confuse it all with his wealth
Listen here, I ain't that one
No, no, no, wait a minute

If you're lookin' for a man
Who can share his dinero
(His money)
Buy you half the town
(Half the town)

Treat every step you take
(Every step)
As if you're walkin', huh, on holy ground
(Holy ground)

Place you, place you above all others
When it comes, when it comes
To the gettin' on down
(Down)

Look no further, ooh
Your man's around
(He's around)
Oh yes, he is

He's standing right here, right here
(Right here, right here)
Don't you look no further, girl
He's standing right here, right here

I am the one
I am the one

If you're lookin' for a man
That'll make you feel like time has just begun
Ooh, a man that'll make you feel
Like you're the only thing that ever mattered
Underneath the sun, underneath the sun, ooh

If you're lookin' for somebody
Who will turn your bad day
Into one long night of fun
Look no further, baby, I'm, I'm the one

Oh yes, I am, I am the one
Don't you look no further, girl
Oh, I am the one
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh
My, my, my little Mayte
