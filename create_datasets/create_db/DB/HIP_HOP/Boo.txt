He tends to get carried away
Like a talk show he's got drama everyday
Lots of rage and mental abusing
The way he treats me it's obvious he's confusing
Me for some dumb bitch
Who will stick around
I tend to stick around

You tell me that you love me if it's true
Why am I runnin' from you and who
Are these bitches on my answering machine
Yeah you you tell me that you love me but boo
If this is love
It's a good thing you don't hate me

Superfly
Someone who'll at least try
Who'll smoke me out from time to time
And love me all night
Tell me everything about him
And none of it turns out to be lies
Easy
Rainbows
These words come to mind
And he loves me all night

You tell me that you love me if it's true
Why am I runnin' from you and who
Are these bitches on my answering machine
Yeah you you tell me that you love me but boo
If this is love
It's a good thing you don't hate me

Never settle for the things that you don't really want
'Cause all it gets you is a big ol' piece of unhappiness
Happiness could be mine but it's so hard to talk to you
Baby
One day I will
Some day I will and
This is what I'll say

Hold me close
'Cause I'm the most and
Make a toast to you and me
See that's the way love's supposed to be
Not stressful alright

You tell me that you love me if it's true
Why am I runnin' from you and who
Are these bitches on my answering machine
Yeah you you tell me that you love me but boo
If this is love
It's a good thing you don't hate me

Never settle for the things that you don't really want
'Cause all it gets you is a big old piece of unhappiness
It's a good thing you don't hate me
Is this is love how could this be
