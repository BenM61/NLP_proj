Same room
Give me a penny for you thoughts
I've got none

Same chair
Give me a penny for your thoughts
Just one

Well if you won't calm down
Count backwards
But the numbers never count for one

I plan on turning back, but I can't say no
I was leaving from the start
I plan to to swap your pennies for my thoughts one day
I'm counting backwards till then

Well if you won't calm down
Count backwards
Count the numbers till they head for one
When you lie in your bed
And the rumors wont set you free
I'll count for one

Same room

Same chair
