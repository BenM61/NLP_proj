Black is black
I want my baby back
It's gray, it's gray
Since you went away oh, oh
What can I do?
'Cause I'm feeling blue

If I had my way
She'd be back today
But she don't intend
To see me again, ooh, no
What can I do?
'Cause I'm feeling blue

I can't choose
It's too much to lose
My love's too strong
Maybe if she
Would come back to me
Then I can't go wrong

Bad is bad
That I feel so sad
It's time it's time
That I found my peace of mind
What can I do?
'Cause I'm feeling blue

I can't choose
It's too much to lose
My love's too strong
Maybe if she
Would come back to me
Then I can't go wrong

Black is black
I want my baby back
It's gray, it's gray
Since you went away oh, oh
What can I do?
'Cause I'm feeling blue
