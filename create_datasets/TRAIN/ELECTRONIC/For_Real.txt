You watch too many films
Too many films for real
And something else you take too seriously
Your record deal

A record deal pays bills
Pays bills and feeds a family
And your profile is too big
How ya gonna be a crime family

Too many films for real
You watch too many films, too many films for real

Don't get me wrong, I know you got guns and your not scared to use them
But is there money being made around these guns or lives until you lose them

You watch too many films, films for real
You watch too many films, films for real

Some of those people have to live that life, for real
I don't have to, I got a record deal
For real, you heard, I chill and smoke herb
And how about these sexy singers, sex gods, talking about hitting girls in a turn
You're fantastic, you're super sperm

Yeah, I'm a player hater, I hate when players can't take their turn
And when a record company drops me, that's when I learn
It's not real, it's just passing time
It's not real, all I do is rhyme
It's not real, it's just passing time
All I do, all I do is rhyme

You heard, you heard
"You go Romeo" girls say
You look tall in the video
And the color girl sings

Get money
Get money
Get money
Get money

And no one sings the blues and everyone sings the greens
Someone said keep your eye on the prize
How you lose the dream
Who am I to say, I know you need cash... in this hundred yard dash
I moved awhile ago and past through New York
I'll be back in a minute, it's my turn to talk
For Real, you heard
