Someday he'll come along 
The man I love 
And he'll be big and strong 
The man I love 
And when he comes my way 
I'll do my best to make him stay 

He'll look at me and smile 
I'll understand 
And in a little while 
He'll take my hand 
And though it seems absurd 
I know we both won't say a word 

Maybe I shall meet him 
Sunday, maybe Monday, maybe not 
Still I'm sure to meet him one day 
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day 

He'll build a little home 
Just meant for two 
From which I'd never roam 
Who would, would you? 

And so all else above 
I'm waiting for the man I love 

Maybe I shall meet him
