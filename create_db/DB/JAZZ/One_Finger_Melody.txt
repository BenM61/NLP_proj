Yum dida dida, I love to play this melody,
Yum dida dida, the melody you sang to me.
Here beside my piano, I linger,
Picking out a memory with just one finger.

Yum dida dida, the music brings me close to you,
Maybe if I play it long enough it will come true,
Now you're far away and I'm alone and so I play
Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day.

Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day.
(Yum dida dida da ooo, yum dida dida da ooo)
Yum dida dida, da ooo.
