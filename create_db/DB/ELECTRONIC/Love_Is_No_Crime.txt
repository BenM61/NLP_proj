When. When you're young. 
When your life has just begun. 
And you feel your world is changing. 
Do not be scared. Don't be shy. 
Take your time. If you want to know what love is.

Oh, Love is no crime. 
Life is to love, all the time. 
As long as the world is still alive. Baby. 
Love is no crime. Love is for you. 
Hold on tight. Tight to your dreams and you will see. 
Love is no crime.

Do what you like. Day and night. 
Do not fight. Just believe in all your feelings. 
Give me your hand and you soon, understand.
Love comes straight from my heart.
