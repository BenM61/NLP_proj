Every time my baby and I have a quarrel
I swear I won't give in
Then my baby starts to smile at me
And I know, I know I just can't win

When my little girl is smiling
There's nothing more I can say, whoa
I see those big bright eyes and then I realize
That girl is gonna get her way

Oh, let me tell you now, when my little girl is smiling (when my little girl is smiling)
I can't stay mad at her for long (when my little girl is smiling)
Why should I want to fight when I can hold her tight?
I just don't care who's right or wrong (when my little girl is smiling)

Oh, let me tell you now, when my little girl is smiling (when my little girl is smiling)
It's the greatest thrill there can be (when my little girl is smiling)
She gets her way it's true, but I know I won't be blue
As long as she just smiles for me (when my little girl is smiling)

(When my little girl is smiling, when my little girl is smiling) smile
(When my little girl is smiling, when my little girl is smiling) darling, smile
(When my little girl is smiling)
