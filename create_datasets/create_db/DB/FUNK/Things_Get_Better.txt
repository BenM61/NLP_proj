You can bring joy
Like I never had
I'm gonna' be right near you
As long as I can
That's why
I can be lonely
But you can be found
And I ain't lonely baby
You're always around
That's why
Things get better baby
When I'm with you
Things get better baby
When I'm with you
I can't live without you
I know that you're mine
I can't lose this feeling
You stay on my mind
That's why
Things get better baby
When I'm with you
Things get better baby
When I'm with you
