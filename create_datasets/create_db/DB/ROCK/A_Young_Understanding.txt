Hold on tight
You've got a way to go
You're terrified by the open road
In a daze you've lost control
You find a gang
And it makes you feel better than the other girls
And you pray they're just boys and not villians
One's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

Let go
There is nothing more to hide
Seeing life through closed eyes
Its just young understanding
You know, that time is on your side
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
Cruising round, in a friends new car
You've always known that they wont get you far
Found yourself on a downward slope
It's okay 'cause it makes you feel better than the other girls
And you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
One's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

Let go, there is nothing more to hide
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
You know, that time is on your side
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
Torn apart, can't you see?
They left their hearts in the seventies

Reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
Reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
Reach for a sign, reach for an understanding

Let go, there is nothing more to hide
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
You know, that time is on your side
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
Reach for a sign, it's just a young understanding
Reach for a sign, it's just a young understanding
