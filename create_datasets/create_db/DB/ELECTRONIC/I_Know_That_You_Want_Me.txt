Chorus 
 I know that you want me 'cause I can read your mind 
 show me all you've got boy true love is hard to find 
 I know that you want me but nothing is for free 
 so if you want to spend the night you got to be real 
 Sexy boy you rty to play with my mind 
 but your fakie smile ain't making me blind 
 And all the words you tell me just sound the same 
 guess you lose your time I won't play the game 
 Bridge 
 If you want to be with me just stay the night and play 
 make me love and set you free. I say 
 Chorus 
 Na na ne now 
 Na ne na ne now 
 Na na ne now 
 I got to, I got to find the best 
 You better stop to think you're making me wild 'caue 
 the way you act is more like a child 
 Don't you tease me now with sweet little lies 
 I won't get down till I see love in your eyes 
 Pleasure and fun I'm gonna give it up to you 
 I'm gonna take you to the top don't stop 
 the wohloe night I say 
 Chorus 
 I like the way you make your body move 
 and your loving pretty baby still has to be true 
 Now you sexy little thing you gonna drive me crazy 
 touch me thrill me making me bang bang boogie boy 
 you better stop being lazy the Funky Diamonds groove 
 gonna keep you busy
