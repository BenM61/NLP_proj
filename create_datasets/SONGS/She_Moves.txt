Far away, far away
In the land where the sun will never rise
Far away, far away
In the place with marmalade skies
Far away, far away
In the land where the sun will hide its eyes
Far away, far away
In the place with marmalade skies

All alone she moves
Into a broken paradise surrounded by the colored lights
On and on she moves
Into a paradise without day and without night

Far away, far away
In the land where the sun will never rise
Far away, far away
In the place with marmalade skies
Carry on, carry on
Deeper into the rabbit hole
Carry on, carry on
Until you reach the hallway made of gold

And all alone she moves
Into a broken paradise surrounded by the colored lights
On and on she moves
Into a paradise without day and without night

Ha, ha ah
Ha, ha ah
Ha, ha ah
Ha, ha ah

And all alone she moves
Into a broken paradise surrounded by the colored lights
On and on she moves
Into a paradise without day and without night

And all alone she moves
Into a broken paradise surrounded by the colored lights
On and on she moves
Into a paradise without day and without night

She moves
And
