Open your heart, open your mind
A train is leaving all day
A wonderful trip through our time
And laughter is all you pay

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day

Now dig
Loneliness already knows you
There ain't no reason to stay
Come here and take my hand, I'll show you
I think I know a better way, y'all

Around the world in a day
(Listen to me, babe)
Around the world in a day
(All the babies sing it now)

No
No shouting
No shouting
No, no shouting

The little will escort you
To places within your mind
The former is red, white, and blue
The ladder is purple, come on and climb

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
Come on, sing
Around the world in a day
Say papa, I think I want to dance

(Summer she is sweet)

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
All the little babies, sing around the world
Around the world in a day
