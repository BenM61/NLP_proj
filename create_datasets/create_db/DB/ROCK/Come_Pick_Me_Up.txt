When they call your name
Will you walk right up?
With a smile on your face?
Will you cower in fear?
In your favorite sweater
With an old love letter

I wish you would
I wish you would

Come pick me up
Take me out
F*ck me up
Steal my records
Screw all my friends
They're all full of shit
With a smile on your face
And then do it again
I wish you would

When you're walking downtown
Do you wish I was there
Do you wish it was me
With the windows clear
And the mannequins eyes
Do they all look like mine

You know you could
I wish you would

Come pick me up
Take me out
F*ck me up
Steal my records
Screw all my friends
Behind my back
With a smile on your face
And then do it again
I wish you would

I wish you'd make my bed
So I could make up my mind
Try it for sleeping instead
Maybe you'll rest sometime
Oh, I wish I could
I wish I could
I wish I could
