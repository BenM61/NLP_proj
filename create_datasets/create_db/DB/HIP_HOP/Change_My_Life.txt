Gotta change my life 
Lord knows I ain't livin right 
y'all know i ain't chillin right 
Smokin out everyday and night 
Gotta ease my mind 
Gotta find time to rewind 
Cause I'm fallin way behind 
Me and my dogs we known to ride 

Gotta watch my back 
Represent for the soldier 
Die couple years older 
Have boulders  a lil soda 
Get rich with a motive 
Now shit done changed 
Niggaz gunnin in the rain 
On straight cocaine 
And it ain't no thang 
Since the game in his arm 
Straight aim at his arm 
Gotta watch my back 
Gotta stack my flow 
Gotta pay my bills 
Leave bread in the will 
All to the old girl 
See y'all hoes betta chill 
Now back to the game 
Lotsa niggaa been dying for this 
Done lost they lives to this 
Got me on this survival some type of AK rider 
Na I started with thug 
A thug with a heart 
Took a trip with some heart 
Had a dude he was scarred 
See his maom in the park 
Tears dried up 
Mom what's wrong (what's wrong) 
Your son's gone 
Is he ever comin back home 
She said you straight young nigga 
Take a look in tha mirror 
I was there when you was gone 
Now back to the streets 
Where young niggaz like me 
Gon do what we got to do 
You ain't nuttin without ya crew 
Betta light in tha night and I'm thinkin bout you 
In the bedroom tied uo 
With ya mouthpiece wired up 
Just shaped on tha floor 
Had none of ya guns keep muthafuckaz fired up 
An see that's the truth 
I done told my nigga this street shit ain't a game 
But it seem the same 
Young nigga get slanged 
For a lil bit a fame and cocaine 
Try to do thangs 
Just for the benzs and beamers and bithces 
Thinkin riches gon take care snitches 
And niggaz wit triggaz 
Niggaz betta watch they back 
'cause the same time I'm tryin to speak to you and realease to you 
Some shit ya need 
Young nigga wit greed gon try to put the heat to you 
speed to you 

hook(x1) 

They callin in the gat 
In the dunge with a guy 
Ski mask and a vest 
Let his heart do the rest 
Thuggin, broke niggaz be the best 
Yes, and gon die if ya buck 
So get fucked right up 
Come back if ya like 
Bring ya gat if ya like 
And get stacked if ya like 
On ya back if ya like 
All I neded was a chance 
A MAC-10 and a benz 
So I can clown with my friends 
Show the world I'm a man 
Then broke but those in the pen 
When I'm off in the club 
Much love for the thugs 
See hennessy in the clubs 
Got all these rabid ass, maggot hoes 
they love the thugs 

hook(x2) 

Now bout dem hoes 
Try to find them a man 
That can pay they bills 
And yes they can 
Weight 28 grams 
Take a tour of the land 
ain't got no plan 
They'll wait for a thug 
Go give em a hug 
Show em how to be loved 
Then suck em up 
Straight fuckin em up 
Then get in his benz 
Get with all his friends 
Take all his ends 
Then send him to the pen 
Then do it all again 
Amen 
But lord forgive em 
Have mercy on they're souls 
For livin like hoes 
And say a lil prayer for me and my life 
'cause I ain't livin right you know I 

hook(till fade)
