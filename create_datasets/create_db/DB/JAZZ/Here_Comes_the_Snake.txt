Here comes the snake and he circles your leg
He's come to play and make your
body parts shake baby
He comes swervin' down your hall
It'll feel so good when he gives it his all

He's like a jail and you need an escape
Want you to come get a file in your cake
I know he did you wrong and I'm nere to give ya
what you wanted all along
Here comes the snake 

Yes, I believe but I'd rather not pray
What I believe in I'd rather not say baby
Did your God show you the door
Well, I'm here to eat your apple to the core
Here comes the snake
Here comes the snake
Here comes the snake
Here comes the snake
Here comes the snake
Here comes the snake
Here comes the snake
Here comes the snake
