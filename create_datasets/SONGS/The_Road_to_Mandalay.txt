Save me from drowning in the sea
Beat me up on the beach
What a lovely holiday, there's nothing funny left to say

This sombre song would drain the sun
But it won't shine until it's sung
No water running in the stream, the saddest place we've ever seen

Everything I touched was golden
Everything I loved got broken
On the raod to Mandalay

Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way

Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom badom

There's nothing left for you to give
The truth is all that you're left with
Twenty paces then at dawn, we will die and be reborn

I like to sleep beneath the trees
Have the universe at one with me
Look down the barrel of a gun and feel the moon replace the sun

Everything we've ever stolen
Has been lost, returned or broken
No more dragons left to slay

Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way

Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom badom

Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
ba da da da da dup bom bom
ba da da da da dup bom bom
Bom badom

Save me from drowning in the sea
Beat me up on the beach
What a lovely holiday, there's nothing funny left to say
