Maybe they think I am naive
Because of my baby face
They don't know it's my technique
To survive in this place

Lover's easy poetry
Speaking to my Berlin land
Who will write a song for me
To change the rules of my game

Happy Violentine
Happy Violent

Please no flowers as they die
Bad jokes and I eat you raw
If my dreams don't drive me mad
Let's sleep to be tomorrow

No love is part of the job
So I can delete this day
Switch me in a stand-by mode
Until someone presses play

Happy Violentine
Happy Violent
