There's no path to follow
There's no path to follow

There's a line in the sand
Put there by a man
By a man whose children
Will built castles made of stone

There's a man in the sky
Giving reasons why
That line grows deeper
Like these shackles round our bones

Move on to my own
Here come battle scars
It's the final charge
Here come battle scars

There's a child born
To the land of scorn
Sees past the borders
And the lords that hold his hand

He was led like a lamb
All part of the plan
This castle crumbles
As he walks out of this land

Move on to my own
Here come battle scars
It's the final charge
Here come battle scars

This is what we own
Here come battle scars
This is where we are
Here come battle scars

There's no path to follow
There's no path to follow
There's no path to follow

Living for the reasons
Of the dead that moved to
Paper from their heads
Until my fingers
And my deadly view is
Strangled by the rent

I have no purpose in this land
Have I forgotten how to stand up
With the humor and the need
I've got to find a way to be

I just turn up the stereo
I can't survive without the cold
This culture's fallen off its feet
I've got to find a brand new beat

Beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat, beat

There's a road ahead
'Tween the live and dead
Church bells are ringing
Like the panic in my head

Step, step, one by one
Walk into the setting sun
Water's rising, rising fast
History catching up at last

Danger ahead, death behind
No one to follow but old man time

Time, time, take us back
Before the line was drawn
Before the sky turned black, black, black
