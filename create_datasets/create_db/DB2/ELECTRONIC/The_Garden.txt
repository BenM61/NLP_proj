We've been sleeping in the garden
Breath of summer, breath of gold
As we turn against the sweep of hills
The sky's aglow
We fade away
We fade away

She burns away in light and silver
Luminous through all these years
Every gesture filled with longings
I still feel
We fade away
We fade away
We fade away
We fade away

I see you standing in the long light
Dress discarded, windows glow
All across the wild horizons
The sunset goes
We fade away
We fade away
We fade away
We fade away
