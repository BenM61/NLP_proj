I never have been handed much
I never have demanded much
I just want money, a nice position and loads of lovely love
I never have expected much
I never have rejected much
I want my dinner, some smart conversation and loads of lovely love

Some people go for quantity
Others go for quality

I've got the answer now it's not how much but how
I do not ask for bliss I guess it all boils down to this I guess
I just want money and then more money and loads of lovely love
I just want money, a nice position and loads of lovely love
I want my dinner, some smart conversation and loads of lovely love
I just want money and then more money and loads of lovely love

Some people go for quantity
Others go for quality

I've got the answer now it's not how much but how
I do not ask for bliss I guess it all boils down to this I guess
I just want money and then more money and loads of lovely love
Loads of lovely love...
I want my dinner, some smart conversation, a nice position will do
But I want loads and loads and loads of lovely love
