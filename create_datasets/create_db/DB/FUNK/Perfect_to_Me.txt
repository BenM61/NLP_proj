Another year has come and gone
But my love for you keeps on and on and on
You're perfect to me, no matter whatever seems
You're everything that's on my mind

And I did love you, one hundred years or more
You're everything that I love so
My devotion to you, more than you can stand
And I, I, I believe in loving the whole morning

Listen here, you know I love you, oh, how I love you
You're all that's on my mind, listen here
But oh, how I adore you, I'll go the last mile for you
You're in changing times

You're perfect to me, more than my eyes can see
You know something, you're the only thing
That's on, on my mind

As long as I live, I'll have love to give
I don't just get that now, I'll always be 'round
I'll always be 'round, closer 'round here

You're perfect to me
I don't care what anybody else see, no, no
You the only thing that's on my mind

I love you, baby, I'd walk the floor at night
Holding my arms tight, baby, now they don't feel better than this
I don't live no better than you, I love you, baby
I don't like fuss it's creatin'

It's all I gotta say, it's all I gotta say
All I gotta say, I love you, baby
It's all I gotta say, somebody understand here
I said something and it's all I gotta say
