Spendin' every night in a different state
Spendin' every night with a different date
I come into town and have a look around
And then I find a guy who wants to get down

I got boys all over the road
I got boys helpin' me unload

Forty boys in forty nights
I got no time to see the sights

Sometimes I nibble and sometimes I bite
I kinda sorta want to get skintight
Have some now save some for later
But there's no cute boys in Decater

I got boys all over the road
I got boys helpin' me unload

Makin out all night in Hollywood
You know I'd do 'em all if I could
My honey in Stuttgart doesn't care
That I collect their underwear
I got boys all over the road
I got boys helpin' me unload

Forty boys in forty nights
I got no time to see the sights

Sometimes I nibble and sometimes I bite
I kinda sorta want to get skintight
Have some now save some for later
But there's no cute boys in Decater

I got boys all over the road
I got boys helpin' me unload
