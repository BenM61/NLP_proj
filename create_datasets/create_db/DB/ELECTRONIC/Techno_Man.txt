Dave was dancing in a disco
Like a loser, looking for himself
But the strobo was flashing like a gogo
He had to crash on circle number twelve

Richard was searching for his glasses
Like a body, looking for the head
His eyes were kicked out by the masses
Sun glasses are very hard to get

Techno man you've got to do the echo
Techno man you've got to do the beat

Two sounds are better than one
Techno man
Two sounds are better than one
Techno man

Douglas was fishing for a girlfriend
Like an idiot, looking for a fool
But a singer doesn't have to look like Adolf
To be on stage acting very cool

Techno man you've got to do the echo
Techno man you've got to do the beat

Two sounds are better than one
Do the techno man
Two sounds are better than one
Do the techno man
Do the techno man

Two sounds are better than one
Why don't you buy another And One?
Two sounds are better than one
Do the techno man
