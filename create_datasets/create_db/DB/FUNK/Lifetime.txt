Been in love many times before,
But it didn't work out right.
This love for you I can't ignore,
I tried to run but I just can't hide no no
Girl, I put my trust in you,
I'm not afraid of what my boys might say
Because I know that my love is real
All I'm asking for is

A lifetime is all that I need
I'm ready to settle down and give you all of me.
A lifetime is all that I need
Don't ever take your love away
I'll be here always.

I never thought I'd feel this way,
I was always a playa going hard,
So many girls, so many games
I left a trail of broken hearts.
But somehow you came along,
Came along and set my soul on fire,
And ever since that day
My life hasn't been the same

A lifetime is all that I need
I'm ready to settle down and give you all of me.
A lifetime is all that I need
Don't ever take your love away
I'll be here always.

I never thought I'd fall so deep
The thought of your love, it makes me weak
You came along and turn my life around
(Leader)
Oh, you brought me down
(All)
Words can't express the way I feel
Whatever you want just ask I will
Girl it's our time, 
I made up my mind
(leader)
I want no else but you

A lifetime is all that I need
I'm ready to settle down and give you all of me.
A lifetime is all that I need
Don't ever take your love away
I'll be here always.

A lifetime is all that I need
I'm ready to settle down and give you all of me.
A lifetime is all that I need
Don't ever take your love away
I'll be here always.
