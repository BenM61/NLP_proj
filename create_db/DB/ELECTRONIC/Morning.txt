Ayy bro, I swear I used to get up 7 in the morning, every morning
No flying up the motorway, I'm 'ready in the bando
Patterned, early shift
Ain't nothin' better than a good morning

Nah, she ain't tryna go back to work in the morning
I'm touring, no sleep 'til the morning
My niggas bag work in the morning
You know her back hurts in the morning
My youngin's mash work in the morning
Got racks in the morning, I got packs in the morning
He lacked in the morning, he got wrapped in the morning
Look, you know I'm stacking racks in the morning
I'm yawning, tryna get roaring, the morning

Yo, she wakes me up with 'ucky in the morning
No lie, she got me feeling lucky in the morning
My little niggas sliding round with bruckies, and they touring
They might wake up to a duppy in the morning
The phone line's gettin' kinda jumpy in the morning
I'm in London, they're in country, and they're calling
I'm blessed like a Sunday in the morning
I swear I went from riding on them prison buses
Now I'm coming in a foreign
My trap spot just held a raid in the morning
She said my watch look's like it's raining and pouring
Thanks babe, but you can't stay 'til the morning
Even 'dem paigons must rate how I'm balling
But let me catch 'dem man late or the morning
I'm blatantly connin'
Then go to my girl's yard and stay 'til the morning
I'm coolin' here
Yo, my future ain't for certain, but my jewelry's clear

Nah, she ain't tryna go back to work in the morning
I'm touring, no sleep 'til the morning
My niggas bag work in the morning
You know my back hurts in the morning
My youngins mash work in the morning
Got racks in the morning, I got packs in the morning
He lacked in the morning, he got wrapped in the morning
Look, you know I'm stacking racks in the morning
I'm yawning, tryna get roaring, the morning

Every single morning time, used to hit the morning grind
Three scores alike, let them go for forty-five
I'm a naughty guy
My watch is hitting in the morning light
Like it came with a torch inside
On a early trip, just to serve a nick
I ain't wore no dirty kicks since I saw a thirty-six
My little nigga didn't wake up for his early shift
Now I'm flying down the motorway to go and murder him
My soldiers do what I tell them to do
All this coke that I'm cookin' leave a smell in the room
Yeah, I serve to them homies that be selling to you
So you don't even know me but you're selling my food
I'm in 7-0-2, with the incredible view
Just a night in this suite, cost a set of the Loubs
But no, don't get me twisted, I'm reckless and gifted
It's 8 in the morning, I'm pressing and mixing

Nah, she ain't tryna go back to work in the morning
I'm touring, no sleep 'til the morning
My niggas bag work in the morning
You know my back hurts in the morning
My youngins mash work in the morning
Got racks in the morning, I got packs in the morning
He lacked in the morning, he got wrapped in the morning
Look, you know I'm stacking racks in the morning
I'm yawning, tryna get roaring, the morning
