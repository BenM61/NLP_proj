I don't know about me
I can't see that I have changed
What I was is what I am
That still remains

What I love is what I see
But you've just twisted me too much
Tested and pried
To look inside
Now you can't stay

The taste of your tears
Tears me apart
The bittersweet salt cracks my heart

I don't know about me
I can't see that I have changed
What I was is what I am
That still remains

To au revoirs I have grown wise
I know goodbye should mean goodbye
There's no regrets
Just dry your eyes
Wipe your face
