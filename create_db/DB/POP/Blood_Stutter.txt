Down southern, pulled under
Crossed fingers, eyes wander
A torn t-shirt, warm evening
A dark secret you can't keep it

But in the car all the stars arrive on my ceiling
Cigarettes you forget I've known you seven years
And then your blood stop stutters I'm the one who always made you feel it
And what I've done is not enough to hope you out of here

Long summer, the sun lingers
A sure stunner, in deep water

But in the car all the stars arrive on my ceiling
Cigarettes you forget I've known you seven years
And then your blood stop stutters I'm the one who always made you feel it
And what I've done is not enough to hope you out of here
What I've done is not enough to hope you out of here

But in the car all the stars arrive on my ceiling
Cigarettes you forget I've known you seven years
And then your blood stop stutters I'm the one who always made you feel it
And what I've done is not enough to hope you out of here
And from your mouth coming out tell me nothing really matters
But tonight and this ride you don't want to see it end
But in truth you know that I can still see the blood in the water
And what I've done is not enough to hope you out of here
What I've done is not enough to hope you out of here
What I've done is not enough to hope you out of here
