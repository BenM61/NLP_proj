Jimmy Mack Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack when are you comin' back
Jimmy Mack Jimmy, 
Oh, Jimmy Mack when are you comin' back
 
My arms are missing you,
My lips feel the same way too
I tried so hard to be true, like I promised to do
But this guy keeps comin' around 
He's tryin' to wear my resistance down
 
Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh, Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back
 
Now he calls me on the phone about three times a day
Now my heart doesn't listen to, what he has to say
But this loneliness I have within
Reaching out to be his friend
 
Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh, Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back
I just need your loving, need your loving, yeah, yeah

I wanna say I'm not getting any stronger
I can't hold out very much longer
Trying hard, to be true
But Jimmy, he talks just as sweet as you
 
Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back
Jimmy, can't you hear me, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back
I just need your loving, need your loving
Hey, oh, Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back
Hey, Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back
Oh, I'm not getting any stronger, I can't hold out very much longer
