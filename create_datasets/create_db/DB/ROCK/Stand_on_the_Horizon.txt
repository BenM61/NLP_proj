How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am
The proudest man
Ever born

I stand on the horizon
I wanna step across it with you
But when the sun's this low
Everything's cold
On the line of the horizon

Come to me
Oh won't you come to me
Come to me
Oh won't you come to me
Come to me
Oh won't you come to me
Oh won't you come to me

How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am
The cruelest man
You have known
That you ever known
That you ever known
That you ever known

I stand on the horizon
I wanna step across it with you
But when the sun is this low
Everything's gold
On the line of the horizon

In South Shields Metro station
I heard Marsden Rock was breaking
The North Sea shaking
All that we know
To make us see the point of living
Is to live
So won't you come to me
Oh won't you come to me yeah
Oh come to me
Oh won't you come to me yeah

Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?
Oh won't you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?
Oh won't you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Oh won't you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?"
The North Sea sings
"Oh won't you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Oh won't you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Come to me"

Oh won't you come to me with you
Won't you come to me with you
Won't you come to me with you
Won't you come to me?

Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?"
Oh, the North Sea's singing
"Won't you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Won't you come to me baby?"
Oh, the North Sea sings
"Oh won't you come to me?"
