You'll hear me calling in your sweet dream,
Can't hear your daddy's warning cry.
You're going back to be all the things you want to be
While in sweet dreams you softly sigh.

You hear my voice is calling to be mine again,
Live the rest of your life in a day.
Get out and get what you can
While your mummy's at home a-sleeping.
No time to understand
'Cause they've lost what they thought they were keeping.

No one can hear us in your sweet dream,
Don't hear you leave to start the car.
All wrapped up tightly in the coat you borrowed from me,
Your place of resting is not far.
You hear my voice is calling to be mine again,
Live the rest of your life in a day.
Get out and get what you can
While your mummy's at home a-sleeping.
No time to understand
'Cause they've lost what they thought they were keeping.
