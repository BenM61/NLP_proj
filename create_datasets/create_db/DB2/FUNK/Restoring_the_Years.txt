Lend me your ears, thus said the Lord
Just know that my word, will not return void
Your time I sustained, there's no need to fear
I'm restoring the years you've sown in tears
Restoring the years you've sown in tears

I am the author, the writer of time
No matter how long, things will work out just fine
Deposit this word, there's no need to fear
I'm restoring the years you've sown in tears
Restoring, the year's you've sown in tears

Lift up your hands, receive from the Lord
Your broken spirit, receive from the Lord
Deposit this word, there's no need to fear
I'm restoring the years you've sown in tears
Restoring, the year's you've sown in tears

I'm healin' you, I'm healin' you, healin' you
I'm healin' you, I'm healin' you, healin' you
I'm healin' you, healin' you, I'm healin' you
Healin' you, I'm healin' you, healin' you
I'm healin' you, healin' you

I'm restoring the years you've sown in tears
Restoring, the year's you've sown in tears
