River river soon I'm gonna be
Over on the other side
Water water I just gotta be
Over on the other side
Don't be long now 'cause I'm movin' on

In the morning' they're gonna find me gone
Movin' over on the other side
Movin' over on the other side
Come on and follow me
You'll be satisfied

On the other side
The sun will shine
On the other side
Everything is fine
On the other side
We'll learn to be content
I know where the grass is green
We'll step ashore and the air is clean
So weep no more
Leave your troubles far behind
On the other side

No more lonesome city misery
Over on the other side
That's why everybody ought to be
Over on the other side
Don't you tell me "Get to work at nine"
Gonna do things in my own sweet time
I'm movin' over on the other side
Movin' over on the other side
Come on and follow me
You'll be satisfied
