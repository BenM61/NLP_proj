You're the one the one for me
Are you ready to fly with me?
Through the night of party and ecstasy
Take my hand, fly with me
Keep on movin' to the sweet melody
Let me show you you were my destiny

You make me feel like dancin'
Until the mornin' comes
You make me feel romancin' on and on and on
You make me feel like dancin'
Until the mornin' comes
You make me feel romancin' on and on and on

You're the one the one for me
Are you ready to fly with me?
Through the night of party and ecstasy
Take my hand, fly with me
Keep on movin' to the sweet melody
Let me show you you were my destiny

You make me feel like dancin'
Until the mornin' comes
You make me feel romancin' on and on and on
You make me feel like dancin'
Until the mornin' comes
You make me feel romancin' on and on and on

On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on

You make me feel like dancin'
Until the mornin' comes
You make me feel romancin' on and on and on
You make me feel like dancin'
Until the mornin' comes
You make me feel romancin' on and on and on
