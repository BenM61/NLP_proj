esme could you shut the door
and put the oil lamp on the floor
i feel it coming on again
just like it did on saturday
voices after murder park
in the damp in the dark
maybe we should call the law
maybe we should call the child's parents

i'll love you until the end

hi, hello, what have you seen?
god, it's good to hear your voice again
did you miss your brother
darling i will always love you
lying, in a shallow grave
there's a church nearby and a railway
on a bed of mud and wire
esme find out where the child is buried

marry the first born
bury the stillborn
i love you and i always will

we are lying here
waiting to be buried
we are lying here and you're losing
contact with the dead

please don't ask about the future
i am not a fortune teller
i know you're just being civil
but don't make this trivial
uncles i have never seen
only in my own dead dream
on a bed of mud and wire
esme find out where the child is buried

i'll love you until the end
