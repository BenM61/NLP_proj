I tried to tell you, boy 
It can't be tonight 
It just isn't right 
You've got to understand 
When there's hesitation 
You've got to be patient

It's not to win or lose 
It's how you play 
You've got to find a way 
To make me stay 
Oh, can't you see 
We're losing ground? 
You better slow it down 
Or walk away 

I'm not giving you my heart 
Right from the start 
I got to know 
You're not learning to love from me 
I got no secrets in the dark 
Right from the start 
I got to know you'll stay 

Just 'cause I wanted you 
Don't take advantage 
Don't take me for granted 
I need much more than this 
Can't affection, some real attention

It's not to win or lose
It's how you play 
You've got to find a way 
To make me stay 
Oh, can't you see 
We're losing ground?
You better slow it down 
Or walk away 

I'm not giving you my heart 
Right from the start 
I got to know 
You're not learning to love from me 
I got no secrets in the dark 
Right from the start 
I got to know you'll stay 

It's not to win or lose 
It's how you play 
You've got to find a way 
To make mistakes 
Oh, can't you see 
We're losing ground?
You better slow it down 
Or walk away 

I'm not giving you my heart 
Right from the start 
I got to know 
You're not learning to love from me 
I got no secrets in the dark 
Right from the start 
I got to know you'll stay
