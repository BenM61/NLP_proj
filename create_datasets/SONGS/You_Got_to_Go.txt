Dream on little dreamer
This is how it all begins
Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is

Dream on little dreamer
Follow all of your signs
You gotta gather up what you need
You gotta choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You gotta go

You gotta keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
You know you got to go

Keep on little dreamer
Keep hold of all that you are
Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is

Dream on little dreamer
Follow all of your signs
You gotta gather up what you need
You gotta choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You gotta go

You gotta keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
You know you got to go

You got to go
You got to go

You gotta gather up what you need
You gotta choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You gotta go

You gotta keep your ideals high
You gotta know that the sky belongs to no one
You know that you got to go (You got to go)

Dream on little dreamer
Follow all of your signs
You gotta go
You gotta go
