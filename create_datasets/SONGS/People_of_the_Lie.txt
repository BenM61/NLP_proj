Don't look 

At me as if I didn't know
Your vanity is all you ever show
What you believe and advocate
Fanatic dogma recycled from yesterday

Got a master plan
Genocide
Can't understand 
People of the lie

You are to me the waste of flesh and blood
I'd love to see you buried in the mud
And when you die no one will shed a tear
So pass me by don't need your hatred here

Got a master plan
Genocide
Can't understand
People of the lie

Prejudice
Intolerance
Eye for an eye

You cannot hide behind those empty claims
Your racist pride is nothing but a game
And you will lose for right is on the side
Of those who choose to fight for humankind

Got a master plan
Genocide
Can't understand
People of the lie

You can't believe
Don't be deceived
