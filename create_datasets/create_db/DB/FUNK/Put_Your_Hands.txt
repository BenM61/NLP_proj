Have a little talk with Jesus 
Tell him all about your troubles 
Cast upon him all your cares 
Take it to the Lord in prayer 
He's not a man that he should lie 
So Mary wipe your weepin' eyes 
Cause he is the balm in Gilead 
He's yet alive 
My God's not dead 

Put your hand in the hand of the man that stilled the water 
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea 

Like a ship that's tossed and drivin'
Battered by an angry sea 
When the storms of life are raging 
And that spirit falls on me 
I know in him I found a friend 
Who's gonna be there until the end 
I have no doubt he can work it out 
And then I come through 
I'll lift my hands and shout 

Put your hand in the hand of the man that stilled the water 
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea 

Sometimes I wonder how I made it over 

Put your hand in the hand of the man that stilled the water 
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea  

Everytime I move I lose 
When I let sin in 
Now it's time to turn around 
Back with God again
