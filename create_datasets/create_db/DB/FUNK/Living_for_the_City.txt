A boy is born in hard time Mississippi 
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty 
His parents give him love and affection 
To keep him strong moving in the right direction 
Living just enough, just enough for the city

His father works some days for fourteen hours 
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar 
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many 
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny 
Living just enough, just enough for the city yeah
 
His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty 
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy 
To walk to school she's got to get up early 
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty 
Living just enough, just enough for the city

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many 
His patience's long but soon he won't have any 
To find a job is like a haystack needle 
'Cause where he lives they don't use colored people 
Living just enough, just enough for the city

Just enough for the city
Living for the city
Just enough for the city
Enough for the city
Just enough for the city
Living for the city
Just enough for the city
Enough for the city
Just enough for the city
Living for
Just enough for the city
Living for the city
Just enough for the city
Just enough for the city
For the city
Just enough for the city
For the city
Just enough for the city
For the city
Just enough for the city
For the city
