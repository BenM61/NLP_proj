The purr of a tame house cat
The smile of a Miss Congenial
The worth of a poison rat
This at last

The nerve of you
The nerve of you
You treat me like a fool
Tryin' to make me blow my cool
You think you know it all
But you've got a lot to learn

Every dog, yeah, has his day now
Now I'm gonna see you get yours
You took the key to my heart
Now I'm gonna change the lock on the door

One dog, yeah, one day now
When it's over I'll be on my way singin'
Doggie, doggie, doggie, doggie
Singin' dog dog oooh dog

The sweetness of a flower
The love you put on me
The glow of a silver moon beam
The sting of a mad queen bee
You stung me

The nerve of you
The nerve of you
You treat me like a fool
Tryin' to make me blow my cool
You think you know it all
But you've got a lot to learn

Every dog, yeah, has his day now
Now I'm gonna see you get yours
You took the key to my heart
Now I'm gonna change the lock on the door

One dog, yeah, one day now
When it's over I'll be on my way singin'
Doggie, doggie, doggie, 
Singin' doggie doggie ooh
Dog dog oooh dog
