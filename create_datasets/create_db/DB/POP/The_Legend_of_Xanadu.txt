You'll hear my voice 
On the wind cross the sand 
If you should return 
To that black, barren land 
that bears the name of Xanadu 

Cursed without hope 
Was the love that I sought 
Lost from the start 
Was the duel that was fought 
to win a heart in Xanadu 

Now no footsteps leave their traces 
Only shadows move in places where we used to go 
And the buildings open to the sky 
All echo with the vultures cry as if to show 
Our love was for a day 
And doomed to pass away 
In Xanadu 
In Xanadu 
In Xanadu 

What was it to you that a man lay down his life for your love? 
Were those clear eyes of yours ever filled with the pain & tears of grief? 
Did you ever give yourself to any one man in this whole wide world? 
Or did you love me and will you find your way back one day to Xanadu? 

You'll hear my voice 
On the wind cross the sand 
If you should return 
To that black, barren land 
that bears the name of Xanadu 

In Xanadu
