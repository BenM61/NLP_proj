People don't know much
Need a whiskey crutch
To think of something new
Hey you watching me
Lookin' through a screen
I'm here in front of you

Sometimes the days, they feel so long
Yeah, we all live under the same sun

So I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again
'Cause I don't wanna be like them
I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again, and again

People piss you off
Some you say you love
Those you call a friend
Walking through a crowd
Then you look around
See there's no one left

We live and then we die as one
Yeah, we all live under the same sun

So I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again
'Cause I don't wanna be like them
I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again, and again

I left my heart in Amsterdam
Where I could dream and nights were long
I left my heart in Amsterdam
I hit my head against the wall
Over, over, over
Again and again and then over
Over, over
Again and again and then over
Over, over
Again and again and then over
Over, over

So I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again
'Cause I don't wanna be like them
I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again
And again, and again

Oh, I left my heart in Amsterdam
I left my heart in Amsterdam
Oh, I left my heart in Amsterdam
I really need that feeling back, yeah
