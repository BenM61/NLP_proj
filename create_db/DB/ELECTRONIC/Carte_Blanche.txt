Do you love me?
Yes, I love you
Do you trust me?
Yes I do
Do you love me?
Yes, I love you
And you trust me?
I'm not sure
Now the stars are sick of shining
Though nothing's really wrong
And it doesn't take a jealous man
To sing a jealous song
So you love me?
Yes, I love you
And you trust me?
Yes I do
Do you know me?
You don't know me
You can trust me
I don't know
Now the lilac's lost its fragrance
And the soil has turned to dust
And it doesn't take a trusting man
To sing a song of trust
Is it over?
It feels over
Don't you trust me?
No I don't
