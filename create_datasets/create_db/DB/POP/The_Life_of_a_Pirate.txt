It's not easy to be this complicated
'Cause I lose my way, change my mind, and I'm more recently jaded
Or I'll be indecisive, and always end up choosing the wrong thing
But I can guarantee you'll never hear me say that all I want's a home, a family, a porch swing 

'Cause I wanna be a pirate
Rhys one thing I've decided
It's the only thing that could ever intrigue me
There's no start or end in sight and I guess I'll have to try it 
Worse case I'll get swallowed by the deep blue sea 
There's no more tryin' to fight it
The pain I'll leave behind me
The sweet imperfections of a hot mess of a girl 

And I believe in miracles  
But there's no way that I'll ever fit in
To the modern way of livin', it's just not me
Work a, 9 to 5, live in complacency
And I gave it my all, I tried really I swear for a girl on her own
But after over analyzin' everything there is here it's time for my ship, and fresh air

'Cause I wanna be a pirate
Rhys one thing I've decided
It's the only thing that could ever intrigue me
There's no start or end in sight and I guess I'll have to try it 
Worse case I'll get swallowed by the deep blue sea 
There's no more tryin' to fight it
The pain I'll leave behind me
The sweet imperfections of a hot mess of a girl 

And if I know me like I think I know me
I'll try to bargain with myself
I'll tell myself it's really not that bad
And I'll try to stick it out
A little longer in society never killed no one

But I can tell you, it's a guarantee that I'll always run 
Away from every problem or severed relationship 
Cause that's who I am
I wanna be a pirate 'cause they get to be who ever they want on the deep blue sea

Here I come
