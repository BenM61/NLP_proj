It could take a second
To tear down years of work
And we won't get these days
Back again (back again)

I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me

And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted

Someone, tell me how I've ended up here
With nobody watching over me?

We need to bring back the days we used to love
Before all the color drains away

I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me

To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those (sing it loud)

Where did they go?
The days we used to know
Where did they go?
Have I forgotten what it feels like?
Where did they go, where did they go
The days we used to know
Where did they go, where did they go

Have I forgotten what it feels like?

And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted
