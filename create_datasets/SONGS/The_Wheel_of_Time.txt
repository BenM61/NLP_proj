Time to say, my laughter wasn't real
Time to cry 'bout you inside
And I don't know where I'll find you
But I feel inside of me
Something's around, it showed me love
It changed my life, that's the wheel of time
Till now I don't know when I'll see you
Miss you so...
Sometimes I feel, you're close to me
But still invisible

I changed my life, my style, I changed my mind...
My life has changed my mind, the wheel of time
Had to change my life, my style
'cause that's the wheel, that's the wheel of time

(closes your mind)
Time... time... time...
(closes your mind) That's the Wheel of time
Time... Time... Time... (closes your mind)
Time... Time... Time... (closes your mind)
That's the wheel of time

I changed my life, my style, I changed my mind...
My life has changed my mind, the wheel of time
Had to change my life, my style
'cause that's the wheel, that's the wheel of time

I changed my life, my style, I changed my mind...
My life has changed my mind, the wheel of time
Had to change my life, my style
'cause that's the wheel, that's the wheel of time

I changed my life, my style, I changed my mind...
My life has changed my mind, the wheel of time
Had to change my life, my style
'cause that's the wheel, that's the wheel of time
