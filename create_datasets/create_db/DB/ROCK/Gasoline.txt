Last night I saw that beauty queen
Watched her paint her face on 
I want to be that magazine 
That she bases life on 
I want to waste her monthly blood
want to get some on my love 
want to get some gasoline 
And burn the house down

She's got nothing to say
She's got bills to pay
She's got no one to hate
Except for me

When I saw that beauty queen 
And watched her paint her face on 
I want to be the one unclean 
That she wipes her ass on 
want to waste her monthly blood
want to get some on my love
want to get some gasoline 
And burn the house down

She's got nothing to say
She's got bills to pay
She's got no one to hate
Except for me
She's got nothing but shame
She takes pills for pain
She's got no one to blame
Except for me.
For me
