Shawty (shawty), all I got is a dollar and a dream
Is ya gonna roll wit me? (roll wit me)
You see I've tried a 9 to 5, and it just don't fit me
(Fit me) (no)

Ya feel me? (oh do feel me)
But I ain't leaving here if you ain't wit me (If you ain't wit me)
'Cause girl a suit wit a smile that don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon kill me  (That's gon kill me)
I'm tryin' to turn it around,
Start this thing from the ground
And as long as you're down I know,

Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just gotta make it (alright) just gotta make it  (Just gotta make it)
Just to see that smile upon your face I know I
Just gotta make it (alright) I just gotta make it
Everything I do I do for you and we

To the top of the world me and my girl we

One day soon you gone walk outside
(Yes you are) And see a Mercedes (Mercedes)
And I'm gone give ya the keys and tell ya 'go shoppin' (Shopping)
(And buy errything you want, buy errything you need,
Make sure you get some shit for me)
Then I can get us out the hood and have us living good
But first I gotta know that you gonna roll

'Cause girl a suit wit a smile don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles its gon kill me (That's goin' kill me)
I'm tryin' to turn it around, start this thing from the ground

Get up early an go standing on the block, some how I

At the round table and come up on a plot, some how I

Having big dreams that we ridin' in the Bentley Continental,
While me copping you a cute lil' Mercedes
And I know I got the block hot,
But until I make happening for you baby I will not stop
I will drap you with diamonds and furs,
Visions of your hair blowin' in the wind from my drop top
(Like a baller, like a true shot caller)
The homie Trey Songz tippin'
All day long get me high too,
Makin' that money for the family
(Can I get up with ya its that nigga named Twista)
Come and take a lil' cruise with a Jeep,
Threw the Chi-town streets cause you feeling me up on the inspiration whenever I'm

Looking at you day after day I know I
