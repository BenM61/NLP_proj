Freedom isn't free, the powers that be
Want to eliminate the choices for you and me
Our rights our liberties, a change is coming through
But the question is when will that be?

What would you say if I told you I knew?
Would you just run and hide or say it was true?
Tell me the truth
We lose equilibrium. Why must I feel that way?
Oh why must I feel that way?

What is going on, this deception at every turn?
My soul's in danger of the things I've done
My past transgressions, events balled into one

What would you say if I told you I knew?
Would you just run and hide or say it was true?
Tell me the truth
We lose equilibrium. Why must I feel that way?
Oh why must I feel that way?

It started so long, the path we follow
The steps that we take are never ending
Every time I see your face, I discover what I hate

Clarity is our own worst enemy

What would you say if I told you I knew?
Would you just run and hide or say it was true?
Tell me the truth
We lose equilibrium. Why must I feel that way?
Oh why must I feel that way?
Freedom isn't free
Why must I feel that way?
Freedom isn't free
Why must I feel that way?
