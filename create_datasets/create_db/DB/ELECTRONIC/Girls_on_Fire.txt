This one's for my girls, they're on fire
And you know that you got it, you know that they're doing it well
This one's for my girls, we're on fire
And you can see we're from heaven, you know that we're hotter than hell

Look at our hips moving like we don't know how to be straight
Look at my girls moving, watch them let their shoulders do the rest and you know
Look at how we're proving we're the solo reason you came
See the way we're losing all of those goddamn inhibitions, let's go

Nobody taught us how to move like that
Somebody taught you wrong so face the fact, it's not a test, we're not the rest

This one's for my girls, they're on fire
And you know that you got it, you know that they're doing it well
This one's for my girls, we're on fire
And you can see we're from heaven, you know that we're hotter than hell

Hear it, listen, connect it to your phones
Love it, hate it, call it what you want

Who'd you think you're talking to?
We don't know how to be tamed
Look at how we're moving, everybody falls like dominoes and you know
See the way we're walking, going slow-mo into your brain
See the way we're losing all of our goddamn inhibitions, let's go

Nobody taught us how to move like that
Somebody taught you wrong so face the fact, it's not a test, we're not the rest

This one's for my girls, they're on fire
And you know that you got it, you know that they're doing it well
This one's for my girls, we're on fire
And you can see we're from heaven, you know that we're hotter than hell

We come, we come out of nowhere
We roll up, we roll up our sleeves
We come, we come out of nowhere
We roll up, we stroll off the street
We come, we come out of nowhere
We roll up, we roll up our sleeves
We come, we come out of nowhere
We roll up, we stroll off the street

This one's for my girls, they're on fire
