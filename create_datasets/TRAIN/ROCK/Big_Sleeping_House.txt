We went to a cheap hotel,
A no soap no sleep hotel,
The difference and for public scorn.
In the dead town where we were born,
How I hoped you wouldn't change your mind.
But until it was time to find,
She was even crazier than I

In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
With the ghost to grin at you,
Afternoon,
Now please get out.

This the night before,
We've had a little
And we want some more,
It changed the world
And it makes us sweat,
Make no promises make no threats.

And I gave her what I give you now,
It was weak and it was built on sand.
And she, with both her hands.

In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
With the ghost to grin at you,
Afternoon,
Now please get out.

With the ghosts.

I heard you ran off to America,
She has position and possessions now,
And I bet you can't remember how.

In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
We held my hands
Up to her face
And said damn this place
All

In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
With the ghost to grin at you,
Afternoon,
Now please get out.
