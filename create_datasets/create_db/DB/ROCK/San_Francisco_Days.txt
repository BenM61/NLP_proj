I still love you, I still want you
I still need you, don't hang up and say goodbye

Walking on the beach last night, hoping things would be all right
My baby lying on her bed, it's you I saw instead
Thinking of the one I love, you're know what I'm thinking of
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights

I met a girl in Mexico I should of told her then I know
That I still think of you, we never will be through
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights

I still love you, I still want you
I still need you, don't hang up and say goodbye

Walking down to Market street feeling my heart skip a beat
To see someone who looks like you, I guess that I'm not through
Dreaming of the one I love, you know what I'm dreaming of
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights

I'm heading for that Golden Gate hoping I won't be too late
To find the one that I still love
It's you I'm dreaming of
San Francisco nights

San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
San Francisco days, San Francisco nights
San Francisco
San Francisco
San Francisco nights
San Francisco
San Francisco
San Francisco
