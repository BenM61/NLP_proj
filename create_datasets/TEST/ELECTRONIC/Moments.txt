I grew up with a lot of green
Nice things 'round me
I was safe, I was fine

Grew up with a lot of dreams
Plans who to be
None of them know were mine

I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And me

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one, I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the drugs
But on good days I am charming as f*ck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the drugs
But on good days I am charming as f*ck

I can be the perfect one
But I'll make you come
And I'm locked in you're mind

You can say I don't belong
That I'm so wrong
I can tell, tell you lie

I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one, I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the drugs
But on good days I am charming as f*ck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the drugs
But on good days I am charming as f*ck

Rough around the edges, memories and baggage
You know me
Never play the safe card, when I go I go hard
And now you know

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one, I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the drugs
But on good days I am charming as f*ck
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the drugs
But on good days I am charming as f*ck
