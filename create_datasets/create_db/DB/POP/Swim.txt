Sink to the bottom
Only to wind up belly-up on your bedroom floor
Innocuous form
I'm in the water half of the day
But still, you wade till I'm ready to float
And you carry me home

We'll be alright in the morning
When the world is on fire we'll be treading in the yard
Till I'm ready to float
And you carry me home
We're dancing outside in the purple dark
By the blood that we shed on the boulevard
I know that you carry me home
You carry me home to swim
(Swim, swim, to swim)

Locked to the love seat
Flash me your front teeth
It's cherry and bone, cherry and bone
You are the athlete
I am the astronaut, for thousands of miles I float
Still, you carry me home

We'll be alright in the morning
When the world is on fire we'll be treading in the yard
Till I'm ready to float
And you carry me home
We're dancing outside in the purple dark
By the blood that we shed on the boulevard
I know that you carry me home
You carry me home to swim, (swim)
The world is on fire
(and you carry me)
And I'm ready to
(carry me home)
To swim, swim
The world is on fire and I'm ready to float

Goodbye to my mother whose body I lived in
Turned blood into water and taught me to swim

We'll be alright in the morning
When the world is on fire we'll be treading in the yard
Till I'm ready to float
And you carry me home
We're dancing outside in the purple darke
By the blood that we shed on the boulevard
I know that you carry me home
You carry me home to swim
(Swim, swim, to swim)
Carry me home (to swim)
