You don't have to go, you can stay here with me
I'll get the next round, you finish your drink
We can get drunk and go stare at the moon
We might be dead soon

We all need a place where we lay down our guns
If it don't work out I'm not one to judge
Why don't you come over? I don't work till noon
And we might be dead soon
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
I'm down, f*ck it
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
 
Let go, live it
Let go, live it
Let go, live it
 
I get so nervous how I could go wrong
But in a moment it all could be gone
Pretend we've got nothing important to do
'Cause we might be dead soon
Can give you tomorrow, can give you tonight
You're wasting my time was the time of my life
I don't wanna worry, I just wanna spoon
'Cause we might be dead soon
 
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
I'm down, f*ck it
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Let go, live it
Let go, live it
Let go, live it
F*ck it
 
And if we don't see another life
Then at least we had tonight
And if we look back and wonder why
Made me feel alive, I feel alive
 
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
I'm down, f*ck it
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
Where you wanna go?
 
Let go, live it
Let go, live it
Let go, live it
F*ck it
Let go, live it
