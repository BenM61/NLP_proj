Aiyo! let's take it to they ass kid!
Nah - gained while we came
We're international, niggas know the name
I'm Billy Danze (plow!) I'm mad loud (plow!)
I represent the 1-5-4 fuckin 5
It's M.O.P., and you know we stay strapped
So when you bustin, motherfucker, we'll be bustin back
I gotta hip grip if you wish, cause I'm swift
I'm bugged, you can catch a slug from my Smith
I put herbs out of they myseries
And a lotta niggas in hip hop with props can't't get with me
I had my name ever since I was a little kid
For all the ill Hill shit I done did
I've been down for years and years to come
The nigga that you're hearin ain't the motherfuckin one
Now if you're real, motherfuckers, please stand
(Clack clack! salute!) clack clack! salute, it's Mr. Billy Danze
I realize, that real guys will take a look at our size
But there's more than what meets your eyes
From Monday through motherfuckin Sunday
M.O.P. will be bringin that motherfuckin gunplay
