This beat is hypnotic
I wanna ride like a shofa
The sound of zonic's
Controlling me just like a robot
I go bionic, so d, d, dj put it on
I'm losing logic and cruising deeper in the zone

It's so cinematic
Charismatic
You got me froze up
This acrobatic
Beat is something
I need a dose of
I'm systematic
Mo, moving every single bone
There's no mechanic
That can't understand what I'm on

Let's crank it up (crank it up)
'Til the walls cave in
Crank it up (crank it up)
Put the record on spin
Cause I am ready to party
Gonna get my girls and get naughty
Crank it up (crank it up)
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up

Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa (crank it up)
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa

Th, this beat is melodic
Harmonic, got me striking poses
I get up on it, electronically feeling so fresh
It's so erotic my body's like a cyclone
I'm like a puppet, can't stop it
Drop it like a stone

It's so cinematic
Charismatic
Got me froze up
This acrobatic
Beat is something
I need a dose of
I'm systematic
Mo, moving every single bone
There's no mechanic
That can't understand what I'm on

'Til the walls cave in
Crank it up (crank it up)

Cause I am ready to party
Gonna get my girls and get naughty
Crank it up (crank it up)
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up

Turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
Turn it up dj
Turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
Turn it up dj
Turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
