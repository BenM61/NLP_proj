Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?

If I should die before I wake
Its 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Is there a way I could make you understand?

But how
Do you expect me, to live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air air, No air air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew right off
The ground and float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down, for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air air, No air air

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air air, No air air

Got me here out in the water so deep

Tell me how you goin' be without me?

If you ain't here I just can't breathe

There's no air, no air
No air air, no air air
