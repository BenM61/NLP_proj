Killing the miles
The road where I belong
Snow on the window screen
I ride the storm
Headlight into the dead of night
Color the forest white

Open up your mind
Go into the void, go into the void
Truth is what you'll find
Go into the void, go into the void
The void
Open up your mind
Go into the void

Taking a ride
I'm easy on your eyes
Dance of a million stars
I paint the sky
Headlight into the dead of night
Color the forest white
