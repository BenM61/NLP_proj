Tell you something clearly 
Tell you something real 
But you tell me nothing 
You never do nothing real 
Your kind it keeps on cutting

Division you create now its all exploding soon 
Nothing left to break no hope in complaining 
All this lay in ruin its a time for mending
Gathering of the wounds
