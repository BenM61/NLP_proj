Oh, how
You could make me smile
And how
You could make me laugh
I felt so safe
I loved you more with each breath

But how
Things have changed now
The way
You pushed me out
It's time to come back around
It's time to let you know that

I hope you hurt as much as me.

This love turns to hate
I watch you make the same mistakes
Now that I've pulled through
I hope it all comes back to you

When you're cut wide open
When you're feeling broken
Maybe then you'll see
(Just how much you fucked with me)
