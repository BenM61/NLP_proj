Do you think that you've come far
Through winds so hard
And are you as disgruntled as you appear
Are you wishin' that I wasn't here

Well, one day soon that dam is gonna break
It'll wash you away, it'll wash you away
Yeah, on day soon that dam is gonna break
And it'll wash you away, it'll wash you away from me

Do you know love, do you push it below you
What does it owe you
And are you as ungrateful as you appear
Are you wishing I wasn't here

Well, one day soon that dam is gonna break
And it'll wash you away, it'll wash you away
Yeah, one day soon that dam is gonna break
And it'll wash you away, it'll wash you away from me

And that's the best damn thing could happen to you
Yes, that's the best damn thing could happen to you
For you
