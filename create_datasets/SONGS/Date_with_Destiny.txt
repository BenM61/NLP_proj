You have a date with destiny, she's late
Fate goes on ahead, can't wait
Lady love runs out like an estranged wife
But it's alright, time's on your side

Left with your dreams, you're only means of escape
Seems you're only friend is time as you wait
Hate can't wait to take positive hostage
But it's alright, time's on your side

So don't let it bring you down, it's wrong
There's always a way around, so hold on
Open up your mind and let light in

Don't let it bring you down, it's just fate
There's always a way around, if you wait
Open up your mind and let light in

Now you see positivity and its confidence
Mr optimistic and his best friend confidence in a new light
It's alright, time's on your side

And when time comes open and join him
Mr negativity, hating his boys and slope away as hope starts to say
It's alright, time's on your side

Don't let it bring you down, it's wrong
There's always a way around, so hold on
Open up your mind and let light in

Don't let it bring you down, it's just fate
There's always a way around, if you wait
Open up your mind and let light in

When we get to the party
Party packs no doubt
Enjoyment's at the door
Kick ya disappointment out

There's fun on the floor
Good vibes on the mic
Spite tries to fight
With hate and dislike

But will gets his way 'cos will's got the power
Time has the last say 'cos time has the hour
It's alright, time's on your side

Don't let it bring you down, it's wrong
There's always a way around, so hold on
Open up your mind and let light in

Don't let it bring you down, it's just fate
There's always a way around, if you wait
Open up your mind and let light in

Don't let it bring you down, it's wrong
There's always a way around, so hold on
Open up your mind and let light in

Don't let it bring you down, it's just fate
There's always a way around, if you wait
Open up your mind and let light in
