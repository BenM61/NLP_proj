Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside

Tunnel vision, for a hundred thousand miles
Indecision, focused as a tiny child
Dilation, light escaping from your eye
Keeping station, time lapses in the world outside

Palpitation, thumping like a humming bird
Concentration, missing every single word
No admission, all the money in the world
On a mission, spinning like a little girl

Feel confined, so recline
Break outside of your cathedral

Heart is beating inside out of you
Inch by inch and step by step is the best that you can do
Your eyes on the horizon and you don't look dowm
The temperature keeps rising and your head keeps spinning round and round

Feel confined so recline
Break outside of your cathedral
Break outside of your cathedral
Of your cathedral break outside
Of your cathedral

Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside of your cathedral
Break outside of your cathedral
Of your cathedral break outside
Of your cathedral
