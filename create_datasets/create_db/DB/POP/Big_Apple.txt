See my face you know where I've been
Walking in jungle
Cruising down boulevard part of the race
Taking a tumble

Loving a stranger
Is fearing from danger
Is crying in some avenue
And soon the hate will be there

Assassin with gun is taking his aim
To target his rival
And tossing the street is a dangerous game
The stakes are survival

Love in that stranger
Still fearing that danger
Still crying in some avenue
And soon the hate will be there too

Life in the Big Apple moves very fast
And so must you
Do like the others do
And don't you drag your heels
Life in the Big Apple moves very fast

Cops on route are hot in pursuit
As windows are shattered
Caf and arcade are teeming with loot
The sidewalks are scattered

Walking down highways
Just seeing things my way
While dealer man enjoys his wealth
You spare the rope, he'll hang himself

Life in the Big Apple moves very fast
And so must you
Do like the others do
And don't you drag your heels
Life in the Big Apple moves very fast
And so must you
Do like the others do
And don't you drag your
Drag your

Life in the Big Apple moves very fast
And so must you
Do like the others do
And don't you drag your heels

Life in the Big Apple moves very fast
And so must you
Do like the others do
And don't you drag your heels
