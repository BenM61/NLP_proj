Tell me 'bout your youth.
Ah, just tell the truth.
Was it nice and smooth
Or was it a lie?

And when you
Were a child,
Were you young and wild
Or just undefined,
Ready to cry?

It should have been me,
You should've believed in me.
It's all in the way you say
This doesn't happen every day.
It doesn't happen every day.

Living in denial.
Have you lost your smile?
Well, it takes a while
Before you'll forgive.

And what's that on your sleeve?
Won't you tell me, please.
We can make believe
Just for a while.

It should have been me,
You should've believed in me.
It's all in the way you say
This doesn't happen every day.
It doesn't happen every day.

Cow-cow-cow- coward incurable.

Cow-cow-cow-coward incurable.

Cow-cow-cow-coward incurable.

It should've been me.
You should've believed in me.
It's all in the way you say
This doesn't happen every day.
It doesn't happen every day.

Cow-cow-coward.
Cow-cow-coward.
Cow-cow-coward.
