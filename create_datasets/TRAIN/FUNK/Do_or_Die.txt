I've been called an operator
I can sell an Eskimo snow
Baby, you're a calculator
But all you ever tell me is no

You make me run, run, run, say you're having none
You make me run, run, run, chase me with a gun
I'll never give up

I got to do or die, I'm reaching for the sky
I'd like to make you mine, you know I will in time
(Incomprehensible) got to do or die
No matter how you try, you'll never change my mind
I got to do or die

Taurus's are more determined
Nothing's gonna stand in their way
Loving you was my ambition
I was born the nineteenth of May

You make me run, run, run, you say you're having none
You make me run, run, run, chase me with a gun
I'll never give up

I got to do or die, I'm reaching for the sky
I'd like to make you mine, you know I will in time
(Incomprehensible) got to do or die
No matter how you try, you'll never change my mind
I got to do or die

I've been called an operator
I can sell an Eskimo snow
Baby, you're a calculator
But all you ever tell me is no

You make me run, run, run, you say you're having none
You make me run, run, run, chase me with a gun
I'll never give up

I got to do or die, I'm reaching for the sky
I'd like to make you mine, you know I will in time
