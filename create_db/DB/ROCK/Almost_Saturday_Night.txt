Outside my window, I can hear the radio,
And I know that motor wagon is ready to fly,
'Cause it's almost Saturday night.

Bye bye, tomorrow, Jody's gone to the rodeo,
And you know some good old boys are ready to ride,
'Cause it's almost Saturday night.

[Chorus]
Gonna push the clouds away, 
Let the music have it's way,
Let it steal my heart away, 
And you know I'm-a-goin'!

Outside the ringing, the night train 
Is bringin' me home,
When you hear that locomotion get ready to ride,
'Cause it's almost Saturday night.

[Chorus]

Outside the ringing, the night train 
Is bringin' me home,
When you hear that locomotion get ready to ride,
'Cause it's almost Saturday night.
Oh yeah!
