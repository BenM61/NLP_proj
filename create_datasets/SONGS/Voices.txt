There are voices in my head
And my heart is heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They can space me into what they're all about

Well power slips away
And I'm weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my faith
As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the voices inside of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Throw this sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I know

My hurt became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we're not okay
The feeling brings me blush all the same, all the same

You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the voices inside of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
