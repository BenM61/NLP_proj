I am weak but thou art strong,
Jesus, keep me from all wrong,
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to thee.

Just a closer walk to Thee,
Jesus grant my humble plea!
Daily walking close to thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Through this world of toils and snares,
If I falter Lord, who cares,
Who with me my burden shares?
None but thee, my dear Lord, none but thee.

Just a closer walk to Thee,
Jesus grant my humble plea!
Daily walking close to thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

When the journey here is o'er,
Time for me will be no more,
Guide me to thy distant shore,
To thy shore, O dear Lord, to thy shore.

Just a closer walk to Thee,
Jesus grant my humble plea!
Daily walking close to thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
