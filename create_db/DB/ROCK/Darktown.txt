Take a trip take a ride
Through Darktown don't be shy
Gather by the clocktower take your seats
Glad you're here it's for keeps
Festering wounds from years gone by
Toxic waste you buried inside
In Darktown
Take a turn step on down
Through an alleyway you'll find
By the backstreet trash resides
The underworld you tried to hide
And from a dark corner where walls loom high
You'll hear the sound of a small child's cry
In Darktown
Legions of hate schools of fear
Proudly accomplished their mission here
A hidden agenda behind the eyes
For the gifted ones they most despised
They couldn't do it in the X-rated world
But presided over the boys and girls
In Darktown
