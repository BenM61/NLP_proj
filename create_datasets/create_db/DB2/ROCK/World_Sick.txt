We got a minefield of crippled affection
All for the borrowed mirror connection
That's why I'm leaving this spoken detention
I'm a romance addict so that I can confess that

I get world sick every time I take a stand
Well, I get world sick, my love is for my man

We got a lady who's wanting to dance
Men with the maybe looking for endings

And I get world sick every time I take a stand
Yeah, I get world sick, my love is for my man

I'm sick of the self-love, losing the bless me
The exit the roof of the rule of what we'll be
And all the destroyers that never wore dresses
They live for the older, well I'll confess this

I get world sick every time I take a stand
Yeah, I get world sick, my love is for my man
I get world sick every time I take a stand
Yeah, I get world sick, my love is for my man
