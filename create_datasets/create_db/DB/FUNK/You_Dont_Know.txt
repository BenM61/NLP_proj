You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning she's my water
In the evening she's my cup of tea

Just as long as I live
Whatever's trouble to her
I go to her and like a miracle
Everything is alright

You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
She brings her loving home now
Just the way it's supposed to be

What she wants, she can get
But you know she's loving
Til she's ready, til she's ready to quit

Will somebody help me

Just as long as I live
Whatever's trouble to her
I go to her and like a miracle
Everything is alright

You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning she's my water
In the evening she's my cup of tea

Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows like I know

You don't know
You don't know
Nobody knows
What that woman has done
