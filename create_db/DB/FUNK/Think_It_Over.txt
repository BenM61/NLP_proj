Think it over, think it over... 

Some people say You've been messing around, 
Wish You could hear what they say
I'm not too sure, But You're just not the same, 
We got to find us a way
 
[Chorus:]
Think it over, 
Before You do something to tear us apart
Think it over, 
All this talk is breaking My heart
Think it over, 
Before You go out and do it again, 
Think it over, 
Just get together before it all ends
Think it over, Think it over

In the beginning, we both really cared
That's something that You should know
Let's think about all the love that we shared, 
You shouldn't let it all go, so

Think it over, 
Before You do something to tear us apart
Think it over, 
All this talk is breaking My heart
Think it over, 
Before You go out and do it again, 
Think it over, 
Just get together before it all ends
Think it over, Think it over

Think, Think it over
Think it over, 
Think, Think it over, over

Better think, 
Better think of the things You've done to Me
Better think, 
Better think before I set You free
Better think, 
Better think before You do wrong again
Better think, 
Better think before the evening ends

Think, Think it over
Think it over, 
Think, Think it over

Better think, Better think
What it's like to be all alone
Better think, Better think
What it's like in an empty home
Better think, Better think
'Cause I'm willing to forgive and forget
Better think about the love
That You ain't gonna get

Think it over

Can't we forget about the love that we had.
And make it just like brand new
I'm not too proud to forgive and forget, 
But baby, what about you?
