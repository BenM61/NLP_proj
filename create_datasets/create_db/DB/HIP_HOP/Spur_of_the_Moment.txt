(feat. DJ Quik)

[Ludacris (Dj Quik)] 
Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
Hey man let me ask you something man
You ever have one of them days where you felt like
You might to got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
You know what I mean like you just got your paycheck
Paid off a car note or something
Just jumped out the shower feeling fresh than a motherfucker
With ya good shoes on, what you know what I'm talking bout?
(You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?)
Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
Like call everybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
(In Compton we call that "spur of the moment")
Well let's do it, spur of the moment, what up?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car lost up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flipping through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't tripping on child support

[DJ Quik]
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we goin' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chilling with Luda
'Cris stop and twist the Buddha got me feeling like this is it
If we goin' party, we goin' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we goin' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You would of thought you would of learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dog

[Chorus: Ludacris (Kimmi)]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
(And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright)
G'd up, my mind is freed up
(From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright)

[DJ Quik]
Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does being mental cost? If you ain't knowing you already lost

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Remembering the days on the block sipping whiskey
Running 'round grinning, running 'round sinning
Getting lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinning
But I'm all grown up now, less throwing up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's arrived
And tonight we goin' celebrate being alive right

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's looking this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feeling quite differ
Can't nothing go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools want to scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
If it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Cause I do ? elevation
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it "More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6"
And show it in the back of my truck, at the picnic

[Chorus: x2]
