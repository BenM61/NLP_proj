Oh Western Union man
Send a telegram to my baby 
Send a telegram, send a telegram 
Who, send a telegram to my baby 
This is what I want you to do 
I want you to tell her that I'm all alone
I tried to call her on the phone
Tell her I'm in misery 
And think she's avoiding me 
And if the telegram don't do 
Send a box of candy too 
And maybe some flowers 
Tell her that I missed her for hours and hours
Send a telegram, send a telegram 
Send a telegram man
To my baby you hear what I say 
Oh Western Union man send a telegram 
Send a telegram to my baby 
Oh Western Union man 
Hey send a telegram 
Send a telegram, send a telegram 
Oh send a telegram to my baby 
This is what I want you to do 
Listen, tell me have you got a boy you can send
This is what I want him to do
Put him on his bike right away 
See if he can get my message through 
Maybe tomorrow 
But mail it right away 
I want the girl to know that I miss her
Something like yesterday 
Send a telegram, send a telegram man
To my baby 
Do you hear what I say 
Oh Western Union man why don't you send a telegram
Oh send a telegram to my baby 
Western Union man send a telegram 
Oh send it right on to my baby 
Hey Western Union man
Send a telegram, send a telegram
