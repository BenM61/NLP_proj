My breath was coming fast 
And as I make a start 
You turn to go, oh, oh 
I'll do what you want me to 
I'll cry at the thought of the loss of a heart 

Love is reason 
Love is reason 
Love is reason 
Love is reason enough 

My morals are changing fast 
I told you it wouldn't last 
You turn and go, oh, oh 
I'll be what you want me to be 
I'd die at the thought of the loss of your heart 

Love is reason 
Love is reason 
Love is reason 
Love is reason enough 

Oh, love is reason enough 
I'll die at the thought of the loss of your heart 
Love is reason 
Love is reason 
Love is reason 
Love, love is reason 
Is reason enough 
Is reason enough, love is reason enough 
Is reason enough
