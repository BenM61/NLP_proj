Even though I live my life on the road
Doesn't mean I don't have time for you
Plenty have tried, almost came close
But none of them compare to you
So let's live our life, more than one night
Promise if I could, I'd do it twice

So, what you say? Put them on pause, press play
Hold on, I got more to say

I know my life can get so crazy but as long as you're right here
None of the gossip, nothing can stop us
I'm wanna love you with no fears
We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
'Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance
(Baby let's just take our chance)

Last week I was in Paris with friends
Only thing that was missing was you
Who would've thought we wouldn't be married by now
We been true lovers since high school
Let's live our life, dancin' all night
You are where you should be, I want this for life

So, what you say? Put them on pause, press play

I know my life can get so crazy but as long as you're right here
None of the gossip, nothing can stop us
I'm wanna love you with no fears
We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
'Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance

Don't be shy, don't be scared (get up)
I won't judge, I don't care (get up)
Baby move your feet, baby move your hips (get up)
Been waiting for so long for a feeling like this

I know my life can get so crazy but as long as you're right here
None of the gossip, nothing can stop us
I'm wanna love you with no fears
We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
'Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance
(Baby let's just take our chance)
(Baby let's just take our chance)
