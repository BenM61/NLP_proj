You tied the knot
Don't bite the hand or it won't feed
What she ain't got,
Be sure to make sure you don't need.

You can't go back.
You've booked the band,
So take your partner by the hand.

[Chorus]
Cha cha cha loco
Cha cha loco
Cha cha cha loco
Cha cha loco

You like the dress (Huh).
It's out of mothballs once a year
The good champagne;
Tomorrow night it's back to beer,

But now you're here.
You'll dance at night,
But never get the steps quite right.

[Chorus]
