When your hair has turned to gray
I love you still the same old way
We turn the lights way down low
Maybe your own gray hair won't show
But when my hair starts gettin' thin
Middle-aged spread and double chin
Folks gonna laugh thinkin' we're too old
But we steal a little kiss
And let the good times roll
When we reach that age where we can't walk
We just sit down hold hands and talk

When we reach that age where we can't walk
We just sit down hold hands and talk
Hold hands and talk 
Hold hands and talk
Hold hands and talk
Hold hands and talk
