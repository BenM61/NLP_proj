We're talking into corners.
Finding ways to fill the vacuum.
And though our mouths are dry.
We talk in hope to hit on something new.
Tied to the railway track.
It's one way to revive but no way to relax.

We're just bored teenagers.
Looking for love,
Or should I say emotional rages.
Bored teenagers.
Seeing ourselves as strangers.

We talk about the whys and wherefores.
Do we really care at all?
Talk about the frailty of words.
Is rarely meaningful.
When we're sitting watching the 'planes.
Burn up through the night like meteorites.

We're just bored teenagers.
Looking for love,
Or should I say emotional rages.
Bored teenagers.
Seeing ourselves as strangers.

Bored teenagers.
