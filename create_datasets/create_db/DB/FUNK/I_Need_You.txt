Since the day I lost you, girl
I just can't face the world
I can't help feelin' kinda small.
I let you go one day
But now I ain't ashamed to say

I need you, I know that I need you
For without your love I'm just no good at all

Oh,  I need you to confide in (Yes, I do)
I need you to take pride in (Yes I do)
I need your shoulder to cry on (Yes I do)
You're all I've got to rely on
And that's why I need you
Baby baby baby
take me back again
I couldn't admit to you the,
It's sad how much 
I need you. I need you

I guess I lost my head 
Cause I know I must have said
A lot of things to make you cry
I've made myself a lonely man
But now I've come to understand how much
I need you, I tell you I need you
And I'm gonna keep needing you till the day I die

Oh,  I need you to confide in (Yes, I do)
I need you to take pride in (Yes I do)
I need your shoulder to cry on (Yes I do)
You're all I've got to rely on
And that's why I need you
Baby baby baby
take me back again
I couldn't admit to you the,
It's sad how much 
I need you. I need you
