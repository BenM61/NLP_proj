[Chorus]
Got to get it got to get it out of my head
I think I expected too much of it
Got to get it got to get it out of my head
I know I wanted too much from it
Got to get it got to get it
Who needs to feel like that
Got to get it got to get it
Who needs to feel like that
Got to get it got to get it
Who needs to feel like that
Got to get it got to get it

Can't get you out of my head I try
Thoughts of you I just cannot defy
We must have had something real strong
I'm tossing turning all night long
Can't even enjoy a fantasy
Without your face jumping in a scene
Can't escape your grip cause you clutch my mind
Want to dream of other girls but you I find
Thought getting you out of my heart was hard
But now I see that was just the start
Your legacy is trying to drive me mad
To forget I concentrate on all the bad
Can't shake this monkey off my back
Tried drinking everything from beer to jack
No answers in all the books I've read
All I know is I've got to get you out of my head

[Chorus]

Yeah yeah yeah
Out of my thoughts let go my mind [Repeat: x7]

I'm gonna have to change this thing so let's stop it for a second
Okay let's do it

[Chorus]

Yeah yeah yeah
Chorus
Yeah yeah yeah
