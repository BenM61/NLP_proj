I know a cat named Way-out Willie
He's got a groovy little chick named Rocking' Lily
Yeah, rock and rolling Suzie Q
Does that crazy old hand jive, too

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive 

Mama, mama, look at Sister Flo
Doing that hand jive with Uncle Joe
When I gave little sister a dime
I said "Do that hand jive one more time"

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive 

A doctor, a lawyer and an Indian Chief
They all dig that Diddley beat
Way-out Willie gave them all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet 

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive 

Papa told Willie, "You'll ruin my home
You and that hand jive have got to go"
Willie told Papa, "Don't you put me down
They're doing that hand jive all around town"

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive

Willie and Lily got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior, and that ain't all
Well, the baby got famous in his crib, you see
When he did that hand jive on MTV

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive
