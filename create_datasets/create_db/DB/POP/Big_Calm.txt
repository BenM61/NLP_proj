Trapped in the skies
What am I to do
Brothers from another planet
y'all know the truth
Papa was a Rolling Stone
Nigga Never (brouh!! )
Things I used to do with her I now do alone
Never blizzard
Freako, now leaning on towers I roam
You fell with watching
Makes these pigs think my styles be drones, ah
F*ck that bullshit
Rather walk alone
Nigga standing on the verge of
You know the song

Super rocket, Nosaj the Great,
And morcheeba
How much more can you take
It's
Te-te-te-te-terrible,
Te-te-te-te-terrible,
It's morcheeba
Super my rocket, brothers from another planet
y'all know the truth
It's morcheeba
Super my rocket brothers from another planet
y'all know the truth

Super my rocket, Nosaj the Great,
And morcheeba
How much more can you take
It's
Te-te-te-te-terrible,
Te-te-te-te-terrible,

On our way to the moon
Te-te-te-te-te-terrible,
Te-te-te-te-te-terrible,

On our way to the moon
Te-te-te-te-te-terrible,
Te-te-te-te-te-terrible,

Te-te-te-te-te-terrible,
Te-te-te-te-te-terrible,

It's morcheeba and a spaceship sighted
It's morcheeba and a spaceship sighted
It's morcheeba and a spaceship sighted
