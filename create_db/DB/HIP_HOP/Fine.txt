I get it from my mammy, and I know how to handle it
Plus I got a motor like a banshee
If that's ya man, girl you can forget it
I'm standin' by the bar, parrot-toed, bowlegged
I make him want to hit the bare guts
It ain't his birthday, I'm the reason he got his hair cut
Turned on by my stank walk, now he can't talk
But I'm a give him what he came for

Drop that shit, now roll wit it, roll wit it, roll wit it

Nigga got a lump in his throat so he can't swallow
Sh-she walkin' wit it, yeah that why ya ass'll get it
Gotta keep it at a distance
Cause if you walk my way nigga gon' be persistent
Smack that ass, pat, pat
Back that ass up to the back, back

You got me day dreamin', havin' wet dreams
Jacki, is there anymore room in them jeans
For a freaky motherfucker like me
A ATL nigga wit a lot of gold teeth
Goddamn you fine wit a big behind
I just want to touch your booty one time
Is it soft like it look, I'm curious George
Your booty put a smile on all the boys

Said you like this chunky monkey and you want it
Cause I ride it like a pony when I'm on it
You just want to get up on it so you can bone it
I'm a have you givin' loans of money for homes, yeah
Queen of the South, Jacki-O gon' hold it down
Boys seen them pictures in Vibe, they want to blow me down
They want to show me round, they know it's sunshine
They see the ghetto booty and they know it's lunchtime
Gourmet cuisine got 'em actin' silly
He ain't even f*ck, I only let him suck the titties
Now we in Hong Kong, I got the thong on
He on the phone, told his hoe that he ain't comin' home

Drop that shit, now roll wit it
Drop that shit, now roll wit it
Drop that shit, now roll wit it, roll wit it, roll wit it
