said it sounds so good to me 
you gotta get on up now 
say it again, Jodeci 
get on up 
you gotta get on up now 
wait a minute, let me tell you 
everybody grab somebody 
turn this mutha into a party 
fellas take your lady's hand 
ladies go and choose your man 
there's no need to be afraid 
Friday night, let's all get payed 
positive is the attitude 
negative is not the mood 

get on up 
you gotta get on up 
get on up now 
let us say it again 
you gotta get on up now 
and you can't sit down 

now that everybody's movin 
everybody in here is groovin 
everything is alright 
the atmosphere is so nice 
the DJ is doin his duty 
all the ladies shakin their bootys 
and the night is still young 
and the party's just begun 

get on up 
and you can't sit down 
gotta get on up now 
and you can't sit down 
get on up 
and you can't sit down 
gotta get on up now 

party 
all day 
never stop 
never stop 
and you can't sit down 

get on up 
and you can't sit down 
gotta get on up now 
and you can't sit down 
get on up 
everybody just get on up 
you gotta get on up now 
get on up
