Ah the stories from the streets
They make their way up to your window
Re-awaken certain memories
This way you re-live them again and again

One will change into the other
Until you don't know what is real
And it's true, you've gone full circle
And it's not the first time you've been here

Fall back on a wave
Alive and well
It folds and it turns
It breaks, it burns
It all happens once again

I will go this way
You will go that way
What's it to you?

I will go this way
You will go that way
Who's gonna stop you?

It's true you have been thinking
Whatever it took you to get ahead
And the people you wish to remove yourself from
Well you sometimes turn to them instead

It's all for no good reason
Except to just keep passing on

Ah the stories from the streets
You ain't got no idea where they come from

Fall back on a wave
Alive and well
It folds and it turns
It breaks, it burns
It all happens once again

I will go this way
You will go that way
What's it to you?

I will go this way
You will go that way
Who's gonna stop you?
