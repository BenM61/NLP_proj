In the desert of my dreams I saw you there
And I'm walking towards the water steaming body cold and bare
But your words cut loose the fire and you left my soul to bleed
The pain that's in your truth deceiving me has got me scared

Oh why (oh why)
Oh why (oh why)
Oh

Through your eyes the strains of battle like a brooding storm
You're up and down these pristine velvet walls like focus never forms
My walls are getting wider and my eyes are drawn astray
I see you now a vague deception of a dying day

Oh why
Oh why

I fall into the water and once more I turn to you
And the crowds were standing staring faceless cutting off my view to you
They start to limply flail their bodies in a twisted mime
And I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I'm lain entwined
You're gone and I'm lost inside this tangled web in which I'm lain entwined

Oh why
Oh why

Oh,
Oh,
Oh
