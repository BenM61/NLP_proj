Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just wanna take my place

A pretty girl
Floating in a room
Wrapped in her innocence
And her cheap perfume

Fluttering around men
Like a moth around the light
Think she won't burn herself
Well, I just think she might
(She might)

A little girl
Not a woman yet
Spiteful little eyes
That say watch out I'm a threat

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
Don't you, don't you
Don't you, girl, don't you dare

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just wanna take my place

You can call me sweetie
And other charming names
And yet you give him the eye
While I'm standing next to him
(Yes, you do)

Don't like your ways
Besides I got my pride
Would you mind, girl
Stepping aside

Oh, no, you don't understand
You're acting amazed
Don't take me for a fool girl
Fade away

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just wanna take my place

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just wanna take my place

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
And don't you, don't you
Don't you, girl, lay your hands

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
And don't you, don't you
Don't you, girl, don't you lay your hands

Lay your hands
(Lay your hands)
Off my man
(Off my man)
You don't even want him
You just want what I have
