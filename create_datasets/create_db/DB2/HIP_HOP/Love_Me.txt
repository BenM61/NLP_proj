Didn't know if I could make it
I tried to hold out as long as I could
I have to tell you how I feel
Cause I don't want to be misunderstood

Bridge 1:
It's time that we got together
And prove what a love should be
Our love could be like a dream
We could be a fantasy if only you will just

Love me, love me, I'll be there for you
Love me, love me, it will be a dream come true
Love me, love me, hapiness is overdue
Love me, love me, the way that I love you

I know you've been through so many changes
With other loves that weren't there for you
If you let me in your life I'll do all that I can
To make this love paradise for two

Bridge II:
Someone to share life forever
That's what I'll be for you
We'll leave the whole world behind
This would be reality if only you would just
