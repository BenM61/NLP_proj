We are, we are the satellites
All night we keep on moving
We are, we are the lights
Around the world, around the world (singing)
We are, we are the satellites
So high, we keep on moving
We are, we are the lights
Around the world, around the world

All the satellites
Keep on moving
We are, we are the satellites
All night we keep on moving
We are, we are the lights
Around the world, around the world

Satellites
Satellites

We are, we are the satellites
All night we keep on moving
We are, we are the lights
Around the world, around the world
Singing
We are the satellites
We keep on moving
We keep on moving
We keep on moving

We are the satellites
We keep on moving
We keep on moving
