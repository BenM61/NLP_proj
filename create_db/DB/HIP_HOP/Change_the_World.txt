Raising hustlers, thieves and prostitutes
Young homie think before you shoot, murderer

Where will our children go when there's no place (Nowhere) anywhere they can go
And trouble may come in sometime you get pulled
Over by one time and when its 1999 the one didn't even make any stride
Murder all around the whole world is nausiatin', everybody overrated why everybody's actin' agitated I thought we graduated back in the sat away up on the battle station (oh yeah)
Patience is a birth defect and ain't nobody perfect, and when the curtains
O's open up the door no more, no more.

See we losing this world we love and it looks like the sin that won't end
So I'm reaching high up above, Lord let your blessings begin

And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world

You got me to set off the riot, ridin' with my Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls
Here we go, roll up some more Phillies my nigga let me hit it
Niggas we thuggin' immortalized, let's get high, it's them niggas you most desire
I can remember from way back in the day, coming up out the ghetto was a hell of a struggle
From selling the fiends llello
But it was my dream to kick flows and put my people on another level
Now could it be for the lust (Lust)
Could it be for the rush (Rush)
My niggas love when they bust (Bust)
They steady buck and they duck (Duck)
They put your dick in the dust (Dust)
My niggas creeping on a come up
Come up nigga, killer, thuggish ruggish nigga
Nigga, finna' descent into the dawn of a new millennium
Anticipating life without Satan hating,
And all enemies to hell, I'm sendin them

And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world

Everyday the devil at me, and I wish the Lord throw a Hummer at me, I ain't happy
Me and Eazy E in a B-E-N-Z, with my niggas right next to me
It's my legacy, we can't let it stop, uh uh, not now
The whole world ending up in buck-buck-pow
Corruption, destruction, disaster
Everybody tryna rap faster than the master
Oh Lord, could you save my soul?
Nigga tryna go platinum 'round 40 years old
The Lord know we can do this shit, it ain't no stoppin us now 'cause we can prove this shit
Nigga me, Stew D, PD, Freaky G, the whole world wanna be riding with me
I'm in the flesh, let's talk about sex, babies having babies, Generation X
With the AIDS epidemic, we ain't pure no more, and I know they gotta cure for this shit, we ain't rich
First we lost Eazy, then we lost Pac
Biggie got killed, when this shit gonna stop?
Everybody wanna know what's goin on with the thuggish, ruggish, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Tryna' get prepared for the Y2K
And if I don't die today, I'm gonna try an change the world

And let's change the world (Change the world)
And let's change the world (Change the world)
And let's change the world (Change the world)
And let's change the world

You need a lesson you can learn from rapping
But they try an ban it, realize that it ain't gonna happen
We done changed the world, ghetto voices being heard and failed
You know it's funny, I got my guns, better arm yourself
Most don't have a clue, if it goes down what to do?
Don't you know this government ain't built for me and you
I have a dream, no, I have a wish
If we can't save ourselves, then let's save the kids
Let the world go, let these babies have somethin'
Let the world go, just don't blow this motherfucker up
You kill him, he'll kill you
Some say it stupid but violence really lives where I come from
Hungry little kids where I come from, judge not me where I come from

See we losing this world we love and it looks like the sin that won't end
So I'm reaching high up above, Lord let your blessings begin

And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
