Smeared black ink

Your palms are sweaty.
I'm barely listening
To last demands.

I'm staring at the asphalt wondering
What's buried underneath.

(Where I am)
(Where I am)

I wear my badge.
A vinyl sticker with big block letters
Adhering to my chest.

It tells your new friends,
"I am a visitor here."
"I am not permanent."

The only thing
Keeping me dry is

It seems so out of context
In this gaudy apartment complex.
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that "I'm just visiting".

I am finally seeing 
That I was the one worth leaving.
I was the one worth leaving.

DC sleeps alone tonight.

It seems so out of context
In the gaudy apartment complex.
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that "I'm just visiting".

I am finally seeing 
That I was the one worth leaving.
I was the one worth leaving.

The district sleeps alone tonight
After the bars turn out their lights
And send the autos swerving
Into the loneliest evening.

I am finally seeing 
That I was the one worth leaving.
I was the one worth leaving.
I was the one worth leaving.
I was the one worth leaving.
