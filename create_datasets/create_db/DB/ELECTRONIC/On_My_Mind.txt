Baby why are you so fly? 
I'm caught up in your soulvibe. 

Rumor has it that you want a man with a big digital following. 
I know this could seem kinda forward, 
But you're meant for me girl, 
I'm sure of it. 

I see your body and I just can't find the words to say, 
This ain't no virtual fantasy, 'cause girl we got a sensual chemistry. 
You can't imagine all the things I'm gonna do to you, 
I ain't like them other dudes, no. 

You're no good for my health, 
I keep telling myself that it's all good, 
I don't need ya, 
So how come you still stick around here? 

You been on my mind all day, all night, Darling. 
I can't seem to find my way, I'm drowning. 

And if you want some fun, it's all good. 
'cause baby I got my gun 
Oh, Pretty baby. 
Let me come over and make your body sing. 

I know that you're so full baby, 
We could kick it old school, honey. 
And she said, ain't nobody would love me better 
So exciting, it's getting wetter. 

You're no good for my health 
I keep telling myself that it's all good, 
I don't need ya 
So how come you still stick around here? 

You been on my mind all day, all night, Darling. 
I can't seem to find my way, I'm drowning.
