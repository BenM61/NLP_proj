Can I describe what it's like
To have sex with the lights on?
And would ya feel right if I did ya tonight?
And put the bite on?

All this and more little girl
How bout on the floor little girl
No time to implore ya girl
I'm just a dead boy
You know that I'm just a dead boy
I wanna be a dead boy
I'll die for you, if you want me to

Got feeling in my knees that tell me the degrees
I been loved on
Ya got dents in your head that tell me all the beds
You've been shoved on

A teenage feelin', rockin' and a realin'
Now we're doing alright
You got a little girl eye and it's unzipped my fly
You feel so dead tonight
