I can't form a sentence
To save my life
I try to coin a phrase
But I can't make it sound right
I feel helpless
A little dumb
I'm an educated fool
With a brain gone numb
All I wanna do is let you know that you
You had the heart to change the heart of me
You took me to a love I never knew

26 letters is all I got
To tell you how I feel about you
26 letters and you know I'm never ever
Gonna write the perfect paragraph
I try to express
With adjectives of thankfulness
But, I don't know if I can do it
With 26 letters

I could be a scholar
I could be a sage
I could write a million books
And be the latest rage
I still can't say enough
For what you've done for me
With this limited vocabulary
All I wanna do is let you know that you
You had the heart to change the heart of me
You took me to a love I never knew

On and on and on I go
With limited descriptive prose
And I give up 'cause I've said it all before
