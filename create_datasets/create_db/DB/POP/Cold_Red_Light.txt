They cover your mouth
And they poison your children
Everybody cries
Everybody's with them

Do they give you what you want?

There's a cold red light
And a cynical future
But your mind is in chains
And your body's not the answer

Faith is not enough
Sex is not enough
Drugs are not enough
Love, love

Bang dirty bank Nazi
He's knocking at your door
You will always be the weak
You will always be the poor

But does he give you what you want?
Does he give you what you want?

There's a cold red light
And a cynical future
But your mind is in jail
And your body's not the answer

Faith is not enough
Sex is not enough
Drugs are not enough
Love, love

There's a cold red light
And a cynical future
But your mind is in chains
And your body's not the answer

Faith is not enough
Sex is not enough
Drugs are not enough
Love, love
