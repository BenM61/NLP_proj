I'm a stranger in your town
That's the place I belong
Laid behind the frame
And the curtain's torn again

A wailing saxophone
And you know it's all in my song
All the sin that I can take
But you don't even know my name

You've got so sense of fun
But you know I've one
All the good has turned to bad
All you know what I think of that

No time to dream
No time to sigh
No time to kill
When love walks by

And who's that crying in the street
Death is the friend I've yet to meet
