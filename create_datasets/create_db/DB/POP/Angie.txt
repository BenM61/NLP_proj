Angie, Angie
When will those dark clouds all disappear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here
With no lovin' in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Angie, Angie

Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
Ain't time we say goodbye
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams were held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie

Angie

Angie, I still love you baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on baby dry your eyes
Angie, Angie
We can't say we never tried
Angie, Angie, ain't good to be alive
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried
Angie, Angie, we can't say we never tried
