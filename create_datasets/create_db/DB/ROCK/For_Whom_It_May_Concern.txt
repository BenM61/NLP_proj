Nowhere to hide, no words to speak
A silent scream is all I give
I want to hide, I want to speak
I want to show that all you see is me

Standing here, I'm standing here and the 
Reflection you see is just a shadow
Standing here and all I am is what I always denied 
And I hope that you will understand my reason why

I played the reed with all I had
The one I fool is me

Standing here, I'm standing here and 
The reflection you see is just a shadow
Standing here and all I ever dreamed 
To be is a shade of who I really am
I still am standing here and the 
Reflection you see is just a shadow
Standing here and all I am is who I am and 
I hope that you will understand my reasons why
