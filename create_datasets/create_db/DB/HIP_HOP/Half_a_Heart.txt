Half a heart to love you
Half a heart to love you

Yesterday you said you loved me
Today you're not thinking of me
I don't believe love
Is supposed to be this way

First of all you wanna hold me
Baby then you hot and cold me
Acting like nothing's wrong
And everything's OK

You just can't decide
Then you wonder why

I've got half a heart to love you
Half a mind to leave
Torn between what I want
And what I need
I'm completely divided
Now it's me that's undecided
That's the way it is
You get back what you give
Only half a heart

So do your Jekyll and Hyde thing
Your out of sight is out of mind thing
Then come on back and try to
Save it with a kiss

I'm not the kind you take for granted
Not good at second chances
And if I go you know exactly what you'll miss

Oh you make me cry
Then you dry my eyes

I've got half a heart to love you
Half a mind to leave
Torn between what I want
And what I need
I'm completely divided
Now it's me that's undecided
That's the way it is
You get back what you give
Only half a heart

You're everything I dreamed of
Half the time (Half the time)
You're so start and stop
Oh baby I'm thinking that I might
Be hopelessly in love with you
And then I'm not.

I've got half a heart to love you
Half a mind to leave
Torn between what I want
And what I need
I'm completely divided
Now it's me that's undecided
That's the way it is
You get back what you give
Only half a heart
