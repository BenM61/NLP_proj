I want a girl
Just like the girl that married my dad
Just like the girl that married my dad
She don't have to be the world
She just gotta be my girl

She don't have to be the world
She just gotta be my sweet little girl
She don't have to be a world of  thought
But she's gotta be, gotta be just like my mom

And I want the love
Just like the love that my mama gave
Just like the love that my mama gave
She don't have to be no queen

Just let her love me
She gotta be just like my mom
