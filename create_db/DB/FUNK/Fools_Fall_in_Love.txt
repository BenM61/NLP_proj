Well, fools fall in love in a hurry
Fools give their hearts much too soon
Just play them two bars of Stardust
Just hang out one silly moon, oh, oh

They've got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I understand
Shake the hand of a brand new fool

Well, fools fall in love
Just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams, oh, oh

They're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now I understand
Shake the hand of a brand new fool

Oh, oh, they're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now I understand
Shake the hand of a brand new fool
