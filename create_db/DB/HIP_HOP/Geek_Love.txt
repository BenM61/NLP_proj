With His Converse tied real tight he might
Just be my boy always and for all days
The first boy I've known to get straight A's
And appear in everyone of my high school plays
Mozart blasting from his Volvo
And there's tape on his glasses in charge of hall passes
Not the kinda guy I mostly been with
I go for thug or Abercrombie and Fitch
With a little bit of skater boi here and there
Not a guy who doesn't even show his underwear
When he sags his pants but I wanna go with him
To the school dance and have him be my date
But I'm afraid that he doesn't know how
To move and everybody would flip and have a cow
Now just because he brings his lunch packed this situation that I'm facing is jacked

[Chorus]
I wouldn't call him fly suspenders and a bow tie
I wouldn't call him the man but he can still hang with the fan

Now this ain't the description I saw in my dreams
But they say nothing is quite like it seems
So even though you see his socks when he walks
And his pants are so tight circulations cut off
I think I should give him a chance and ignore his metal braces and tight pants
But my friends disagree they disapprove of my plans to make a move
But it would behoove me
To not pay attention to them My friends
Just don't understand just cause he's not the man
They try to act hard now pretend like they floss
We'll see who's laughing when my geek is their boss
Maybe he doesn't have experience with dates
But I bet the same thing happens to Bill Gates
So even though he doesn't have Sean Jean or Gerbauds
I got love for my geek I want everyone to know

[Chorus: x3]
