Night was dark, your skin was dark
Your eyes were shining bright
Oh black beauty, close in my heart
I was King Salomon who held his queen of Sheba tight
Oh black beauty, held in my arms

How we were told, love was not meant for us
Two different worlds stepped apart
Heart against heart

But we knew where to find an opportunity
Far away where no one was near
We could meet there at night and we're impunity
Oh black beauty, love without fear

Our love was wonderful
So young and so pure
I held your trembling hands
I was so sure
Then when our lips met there was no returning
The fire was burning in our hearts

So we were told, love was not meant for us
Two different worlds stepped apart
Heart against heart

But we knew where to find an opportunity
Far away where no one was near
I was King Salomon who held his queen of Sheba tight
Oh black beauty, love without fear
