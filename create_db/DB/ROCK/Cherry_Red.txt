Run here pretty baby, sit down on your daddy's knee
I want to tell ev'rybody, how you've been sending me
Now if that's your secret, you can keep it to yourself
'Cause if you tell me, I might tell somebody else

I ain't never loved and I hope I never will
Because a lovin' proposition, will get somebody killed
Lead me pretty baby, 'cause you know I can be led
Squeeze me pretty baby, until my face turns cherry red
