It's such a sweet feeling
The feeling I get
Close the door, make no noise, keep it a secret
I can't help thinking
We've only just met

I can feel heartache
Comin' my way
Feels so right, the way you are
Come here and kiss me
I can't help thinking
This isn't okay

But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you

Maybe it's easier
To close my eyes
If I can't see her fucking you up, keeping you inside
I can't help thinking
This isn't my life

I feel no sadness
When you say she cries
See the way you look at her, keeping it inside
I can't help thinking
This isn't alright

But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you

But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you

But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
But I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
