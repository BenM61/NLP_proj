I've made up my mind
I've got to get out in a hurry
I've stated my case
There's no need to come on with worry

'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
And my boot heels are clean
I'll always try to do better
I don't live in no dream

I live down to the line

You know I made it all right (down to the line)
Stayed up all night (down to the line)
It's the way to live life (down to the line)
It's the way to live love (down to the line)

Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line

I found me a way
To stand up this way without cryin'
Now they asked for the key
But they're complainin' instead of just tryin'

But I'm a real straight shooter
And my boot heels are clean
I'll always try to do better
I don't live in no dream

I live down to the line

You know I made it all right (down to the line)
Stayed up all night (down to the line)
It's the way to live love (down to the line)
It's the way to love life (down to the line)

Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line, down to the line

Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line, down to the line
Sooner or later it gets you every time
Down to the line, I'll make it all right
Down to the line, sometimes I stay up all night
Down to the line, down to the line
Down to the line, sooner or later, it gets you every time
I stay up all night, I make it all right
Stayin' up all night, down to the line
Make it all right, down to the line
