What you say?
Are you ready for the night to be the day?
Got temptation within all over your face
Won't you tell me that you only love the chase
Let's find a way
Meet me at the bar and don't be late
I could drink you up like summer lemonade
Give it to me, baby, straight, no chase

Once we get this thing in motion
We won't have no time to talk
Moving in the dark, we ain't never gonna stop
Oh (oh)

We don't need no reason
We just keep the feeling
Everybody's leaving
We go overtime
Moving to the future
Let me see right through ya
I don't wanna lose ya
We go overtime

Drop me a line
We can do this all the time
You and I
Let's go into overtime
Drop me a line
We can do this all the time
You and I
Let's go into overtime

I ain't someone
Someone who could share my point of view
Say you want to stay but love is true
Say you do, say you do
Baby, when we get it going
We won't ever want to stop
And, baby, when we kiss
It's gonna tear a roof off

We don't need no reason
We just keep the feeling
Everybody's leaving
We go overtime
Moving to the future
Let me see right through ya
I don't wanna lose ya
We go overtime

Drop me a line
We can do this all the time
You and I
Let's go into overtime
Drop me a line
We can do this all the time
You and I
Let's go into overtime

Overtime
Overtime
Overtime
Overtime

We don't need no reason
We just keep the feeling
Everybody's leaving
We go overtime
Moving to the future
Let me see right through ya
I don't wanna lose ya
We go overtime

You got me working
Overtime
You got me working
Overtime
You got me working
Overtime
You got me working
Overtime
You got me working
Overtime
Oh
You got me working
Moving in the dark, we ain't never gonna stop
Oh
Overtime
Let's go into overtime
