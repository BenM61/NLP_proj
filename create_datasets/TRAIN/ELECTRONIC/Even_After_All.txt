Even after all
The murdering
Even after all
You're suffering sow
You know I love you so
You know I love you so and so
Even after all

All that you go on, sir
Is the order of the day
And all that you believe, sir
Is the order in this society
You know I love you so
You know I love you so and so
Even after all

This is my manner y'all
Man just feel satisfied
No competition
No competition at all
I just feel satta star
Them eyes are gorgeous girl
No demise, upraise
I got to raise it again
Them eyes are gorgeous
I must advance
I don't check for no superficial
It's got to be beneficial
These sonic fruits
These sonic fruits
Sights
These sonic fruits
Got them moving around alright
Hyper play
Steppin' and rising

Even after all
The murdering that go on
Even after all, oh no
Your suffering sow
You know I love you so
You know I love you so and so
Even after all

You just survive soldier
And your soul is beautiful
And your soul is good
