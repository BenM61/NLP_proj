Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Here I am
I'm your Brooklyn baby
With a premonition
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Evil comes a-flying
Flying so, so low
Sky is turning poison
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Helicopters are coming
Helicopters are coming
To take me far away
Two-fingered Gypsy king
Has a golden, wounded knee
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Going to be a hero
I have my body in a sack with me
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Delta blues
Oh, lucky baby
Oh, lucky baby
Providence is coming
Providence is coming
Ace of spades by his side
Ooh, ace of spades by his side

Here I am
Oh, here I am
Helicopters flying
A long way down south
To a secret mission town
In the U.S.A
In the U.S.A
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
About the blue light squadron
About the blue light squadron
Here as a witness
I never had a chance
Cartoon creeps are playing
Playing dirty games
Sending me to my home
In a one way ticket bodysack
Just like Jimmy always said
An unknown hero
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou

Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Gypsy baby
Bye bye Gypsy baby
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
