I'm rollin' like a Playboy beep, beep, beep
Just another page, just another freak
Cops say I'm bangin', girls say I'm slangin'
Just 'cause my black Cross Courts be hangin'
Ah huh, that's it baby
Beep diddy beep, will I call you maybe
Sky Pager looks like a Phaser
That's the attire of a Northwest player
San Jose, I got a show
Chillin' like a champ with a girl in a limo
There we go again, I got a beep
The girl got nosy beggin' for a peep
Get off me girl, this is business
I'm workin' it and you can't witness
A Oakland skeeso, how do I know
'Cause four-one-five was the area code
Turn it off, turn it on, so I won't get busted
You know rap stars never get trusted
Baby want to get so I put it on vibrate
How does Mix-A-Lot communicate

With beepers, baby, ha ha

One-eight hundred-seven five nine-seven two four three
But if you ain't got that pin number dummy, you can't call me
To hook up with Mix you gotta call that number
Then sit by the phone and wonder
Will he call? If you're fine I might
If you're a duck, good night
I got a cellular but you can't have my digits
Motorola beeps and the boy gets with it
Code one, two (Yo come on black
You gonna tell her about me, what's up with that?)
That's Attitude Adjuster, my homey
Huggin' more girls than Bellica Rolee
Gettin' 'em sprung, bustin' 'em out
Rollin' up dames, 'cause he's got that clout
Pullin' young females, yank 'em on the stage
One fell prey when she called that page
Called his beeper
Sweetie got sprung but he might not keep her
He never called back, so she called me
(Where's Attitude at? He was supposed to meet me)
I don't know but I'm wishin' you luck
How does Attitude Adjuster hook up?

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Pagers, call 'em what you want
Some brothers some brothers wear fake ones, still tryin' to flaunt
Walkin' in a party, lookin' like Joker
Big ole six inch garage door opener
Not me, 'cause my bank is set
Three dope Benzos, one Corvette
I'm not braggin' or movin' them thangs
Just clockin' them dollars at the real estate game
(Sky Pager)
Telepage Northwest, satellite service pushed to test
Got a beep from a girl named Natalie
My memory slip, 'cause I need a new battery
Power on, display light's up
Incoming calls from the girls with butts
Girls call 'cause they might get lonely
Ha, I run 'em like ponies
Pick 'em up, put 'em in the Benzo
I get a beep and I leave 'em in limbo
That's right I'm livin' like that
What do I keep pinned to the strap

My beeper 
Beepers

Beepers 

Oh yeah, girls got 'em too
They keep 'em in their purse, plain and cool
Big players, rollin' up fellas
They comin' up but they never will tell us
Smooth, ha, I bet you didn't know
The girl you called dumb was clockin' your dough
Jackin' ball players and never gettin' tossed
Done worked every brother on the Sea hawks
Yeah, she looks good, but she thinks she's swift
Tryin' to pull up on the Mix-A-Lot tip
Sittin' in the movie, she stepped out smooth
Oh baby girl, I got one too
