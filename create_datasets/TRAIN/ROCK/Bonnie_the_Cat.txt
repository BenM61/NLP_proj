Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure you're not one of them
I know what will be

Could be your last resort
Like gold against your soul

(You think you've got it all wrapped up now
You stumble on so unsuspecting
I know what will be)

I hold your birth control to ransom
The cells divide and grow inside you
I know what will be

I know what will be

I know what will be
