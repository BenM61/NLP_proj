Somebody told me
"Get over it"
It's like water under bridges
That have already burned 
They say
"It gets better
It gets easier"
The memories start to fade
And sad songs that always play
You start to hate 

Do you remember 
The days we used to spend?
Memories so strong
It keeps me from moving on
If I could go back
I'd take our worst days 
Even our worst days are better
Than loneliness
