If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
And let's go far away
To another place
Let's hideaway
Oh, just you and me

I peep game long time ago
When he told me, he's never seen a chick before
He wouldn't give me no explanation
'Cause he knows when I pack my bags it ain't for no vacation, oh

I'm gonna do my thing
I'm leaving his alone (I'm gone, I'm gone)
Oh I'm moving on my way
He's history, history (he is history)
If he believe it's over, your'll see
A girl's gotta do what she gotta do oh

If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hideaway (we're gonna hideaway)
Oh, just you and me

If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hideaway
Oh, just you and me

I call six one two, five five, five
Twenty-four, twenty two, to find you
I packed my bag's
Gassed up the Jag
And told my dad
Your the finest girl I never had

And so my lady
Left a message said "page me"
I know it might sound crazy
But say you'll be my baby
She crushed my new Benz
Slept with my best friend
Spent all my ends it's got to end

Ooh how do I know
You won't hurt me like he has
(I know you're afraid he'll want me back)
You've gotta have faith in me (you know I do)
I'd never play you baby
'Cause my love is all right
(That's all you'll ever need)
'Cause I need someone for me
This love was meant to be
It's our destiny
Just run away with me, oh ho

If you leave him
I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word (our destiny is to be together baby oh)
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away (I wanna know)
Oh just you and me

If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh just you and me

If you leave him
I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh just you and me

If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh just you and me

If you leave him
I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh just you and me

If you leave him
I'll leave her
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh just you and me

If you leave him
I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh just you and me

If you leave him
I'll leave her
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh just you and me

Thou shall get your party on
