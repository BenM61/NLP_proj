Would you come on and go with me?
Would you come on over to my place?
Would you come on and go with me?
Would you come on over to my place? Yes

I don't feel like being lonely tonight
You see, I want, I want some company
And you look like you're just my type
See, you're the kind 
You're the kind whose spirits are runnin' free

Let's take a sip of some cold, cold wine
And dance to the music nice and slow
And you wont be under and kind of pressure
You see, we'll just let, we'll just let the evenin' flow

So come on and go with me
Would you come on over to my place?
Would you do that baby?
Come on and go with me?
Would you come on over to my place? Well

You look like you're just bored to death
And you wanna get away
You wanna get away from this noise and the crowd
Let's go where it's nice and quiet
Where there's nobody, there's nobody else around

Let's sit by a cozy lit fire
And we can be in each other's company
Now how does that sound to you?
You see, cause it sounds so good
It sounds so damn good to me

So, come on 
Would you come on over to my place
Would you do that, baby?
Come on, come on and go with me, that's right
Come on over to my place
How does that idea sound to you?

See my car's right outside, we can leave right now
That's if you're ready to go
I know you're just meetin' me
And you see, I'd understand it
I'd understand it if you said no
But don't you do it, baby

Don't you do that baby (no)
Don't you do that baby (no, not tonight, no)
No, no, no, no, no (I believe you)
Just come on and go with me, that's right (oh, man)

See, I like what I see, I like what I see (I've been watchin' you too)
I gotta have you baby (I've been checkin' you out all night long)
All right (that sounds nice)
Anything you wanna do is alright baby
Just come on, just come on (well, you said your car's right outside)
