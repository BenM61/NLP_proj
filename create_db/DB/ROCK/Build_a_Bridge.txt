Build a bridge to your mind
Takes me there every time
Lay it all on the line
If there's a way
Build a bridge, make a path
Overlook the aftermath
Make my tears be your bath
If there's a way
Only if you'll take a ride
Go with me to the other side
Even though it's gonna crumble down
I'll keep building 'till you come around
Even though it's gonna fall apart, break my heart
I'll keep building 'till I die
Build a bridge of memories
Stretch it out overseas
To the end of the world
If there's a way
Build a bridge made of pain
Send my longing down the drain
Have no reasons to complain
If there's a way
Only if you'll take a ride
Go with me to the other side
Wait wait for me wait please wait for me
Wait wait for me wait please wait for me
Chorus (x2)
