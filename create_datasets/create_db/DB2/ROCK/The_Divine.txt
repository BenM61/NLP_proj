Seems like a thousand days
And there can be no doubt
His mind was in a haze
And he was so worn out
He lost serenity
Within a fractured life
With no apology
He knew that he was right
But his eyes they did not see
Heading for a tragedy

To prove his innocence
He'll take it to the grave
In his deliverance
Somebody could be saved

And the world he could not face
Prayin' for a state of grace
He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

Inside his caravan
He pulled the shutters down
And will he ever see
What all the others found?
He stood upon the roof
Get closer to the sky
Condition critical
No time to wonder why
But his eyes they could not see
Heading for a tragedy

He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

And the world he could not face
Prayin' for a state of grace
He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind

Gave his life

He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

He gave his life
