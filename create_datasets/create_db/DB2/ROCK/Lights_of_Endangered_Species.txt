Saw a magician cut you in half so bloodless
Daunted, I applauded
Looking around at all them eyeless faces
You crept into me and stood alone
Arms stretched out to nothing
Like the memory of something gone wrong

Slip the darkness down to the harbor
Feel your star dress, burn in the water
Forget your promise, turn out your light
Lay down and sleep tonight
Dream of your sons, dream of your daughters
Come back to you

Got my guns in a row
I got my boys to the shore
Not all but we'll stay here all day long
And get beat to shit for you
Get beat to shit for you
Spinning a right that was never far off wrong
So in pieces your sons and in pieces your daughters
Come back to you

Good morning beautiful
I've waited all my life
To watch you breathe in
Stand up and decide
To set something, anything, on fire

It's spilling over your shoulders
The dawn
