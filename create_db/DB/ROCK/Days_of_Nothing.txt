It's getting harder to resist, I'm pulling powder from
The walls, guess we all have wicked friends. But it's the
Piles and piles of pepper on the shadows and the eyelids, 
It's the blindness of my close friends and the days and
The days of nothing. It's the days and the days of
Nothing. It's getting harder to come back from living
Lighter than a leaf. It's getting harder to depend on me.
Oh, but you leave me no choices, no body no voices. You
Leave me no choice, I'm fucked and far away. You leave me

No choices, no body, no voices. Don't you know I left
Myself these piles and piles of pepper on the shadows and
The eyelids. It's the blindness of my close friends and
The days and the days of nothing. But you leave me no
Choices, no body no voices, you leave me no choice. I'm
Fucked and far away, you leave me no choices, no body no
Voices. Don't you know I left myself here don't you
Know I left myself these days and days of nothing.
