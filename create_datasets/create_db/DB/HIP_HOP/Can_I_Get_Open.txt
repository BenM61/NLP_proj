Hey Jay, Can I get open? (You know it)
Hey ya'll, Can I get open? (You know it!!)
(You want a fly style Ski's about to show it)

As I, um you know, play you like Uno
Sigga-sigga slam a jam, jugga just like a sumo
I gets big, check out my thingamajigum
Styles I kick em, suger smack ya dig em
Divva-divva damn, I'm divva on a sigga-sigga slam
You knows who I am, you knows who I am
Back up that's an order
Da-da, Da-da, get out the water
Nah not yet, ready, set, go!
When I grab the mic they get pet-tro-fied
Why?, Hey! I'm just so fly
Lions, Tigers, Bears, oh my God!!
Goodness gracious, whitness style
Drive a child wild
I'm rippin this microphone
Ain't no place like home, Ain't no place like home

Yo Ski, Can I get open? (You know it)
Hey Jay, Can I get open? (You know it)
Hey y'all, Can I get open? (You know it!!)
(You want a fly style T's about to show it)

You know they got me like, Holy cow, what can you do now?
When I flip the style girls be like "Ohh child"
I'm living dangerous 
But as strange as living the lifestyle of a bad rich and famous kid
When I get raw baby paw better parlay
Beat me?, aww please, that's what they all say
You can't get with the kid, no not the kid
"Uh-uh no he didn't", oh yes I did
Well I wax enough backsides in a jiffy
"I know he ain't just front on him", but you damn skippy
Good god, damn I'm slam hard
With my sqaud, uh good god
Damn I'ma scream, AH he's a dream
Boat when I float, rough on every note
Mean like a horror flick, till tomorrow
I'm gone, ghost, peace, sianara

Yo T, Can I get open? (You know it)
Hey Ski, Can I get open? (You know it)
Hey ya'll, Can I get open? (You know it!!)
(You want a fly style Jay's about to show it)

Well, cause Can I? is never a question of how but
When I rip it, will I quit it, forget it
Still I'm always on point whenever I hit it
Biting's forbidden, don't do what ya gonna..., too late ya'll did it
I'm shredding the track, I'm burning you back-back, like Backdraft
Brotha's who running the crack down I stutter, that-that niggas fast
I pick up the pieces, I straigten it out like Pete Rock
Or see is, or creases, it's your choice, Jesus--Christ
I'm nice like that, you freakin gay right
I flow like water, so put your finger in a dyke
I slam, I got original flavor, pick up the jam
I killed Chico, and now it's just me- The Man
Go get your gun I go all out with a can
Brothers is having a hard time with who I am
J kicken it, A rippin it, way past why
I'm so crraazzyy, AAAAHHHH

Did I get open? (you know it)
Tone Hooker: Hey ya'll did I get open? (you know it)
Ski: Hey ya'll did I get open? (you know it)
All: You know it, you know it, you know it
