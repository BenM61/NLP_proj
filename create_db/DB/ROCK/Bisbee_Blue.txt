When you can't find the hours 
Days keep on slipping through
Avenues under construction
Blocking out your sky blues

burried beneath the letters
Bills and the junk in the mail
Finding the strain to your heart
From the troubles down the trail

no sign of your old haunts here 

gone with the copper crews
Veins mined in vein remind you
Choices we choose to lose

new cities keep on sprawling
Old towns falling too
Raining a river of color

and it's flowing bisbee blue 

straight to you bisbee blue

some say this way's the only one that's true

bring me back bisbee blue 
Bring me back

oh these days, seem dark 

darkest I've seen

darling you send me through the hours 

days keep on sifting through
Chipping away to remember

days with you bisbee blue 
Shining like bisbee blue
Bring me back bisbee blue
