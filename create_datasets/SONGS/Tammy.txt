I hear the cottonwoods whisp'rin' above
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love
The ole hootie owl hootie-hoo's to the dove
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love
Does my darling feel what I feel
When she comes near?
My heart beats so joyfully
You'd think that she could hear
Wish I knew if she knew what I'm dreaming of

Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love

When the night is warm, soft and warm
I long for her charms
I'd sing like a violin
If she was in my arms
Wish I knew if she knew what I'm dreaming of
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love

Oh, Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love
