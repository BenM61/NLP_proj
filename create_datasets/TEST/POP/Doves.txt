We've traded places times before
We were built for making love and not for war
I'm screaming fire! fire!
Watching from the door
I'm feeling burnt clean, under your eyes
Putting me out

Ooh ooh, baby don't hurt no more
Ooh ooh, keep from crying
Ooh ooh, baby don't hurt no more
Ooh ooh, Ooh baby don't hurt no more

And I feel it go
What we held so slow
Goes so quickly
And I need to know
All I need to know
Is the pain of lying

It's just a little too much on my mind, this time
It's just a little too much
On my mind
And I'm begging you please, singing


It's not for you, It's not for you
It's not for you

Ooh ooh, ooh baby don't hurt no more
Ooh ooh, ooh baby don't hurt no more
