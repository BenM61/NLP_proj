I love you too
I want you too, my love

Liberian girl, you came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl, you came and you changed me, girl
A feeling so true

Just like in the movies with two lovers in a scene
And she says do you love me?
And he says so endlessly I love you, Liberian girl
