I hear the slammin' of the door
There you go again
I can't take it anymore
That's just the way it is

But then I listen to my heart
And the anger fades
I wanna hold ya
Never let ya go away

I feel a raging war inside
A battle between the heart and mind
But love wins when I close my eyes

The heart is blind
It will not see
When hope is gone
The heart will still believe
I see you go
Through tearful eyes
But for the sake of love
The heart is blind

I know there's been a lot of nights
When we couldn't sleep
The words are like a knife
They cut so deep

But when I listen to my heart
It's deeper than the pain
I really love ya
That's all that matters anyway

I feel a raging war inside
A battle between the heart and mind
But love wins when I close my eyes

The heart is blind
It will not see
When hope is gone
The heart will still believe
I see you go
Through tearful eyes
But for the sake of love
The heart is blind

(Bridge)
I'll always love you
And hard times can only make us strong
If we keep holding on

The heart is blind
It will not see
When hope is gone
The heart will still believe
I see you go
Through tearful eyes
But for the sake of love
The heart is blind
