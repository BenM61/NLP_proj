Never felt so good before
Never dreamed I would explore
Makin' love in the positions that you got me doin'
I never thought I'd beg for more
Never thought I'd find a man who can do it again and again
And then even do it like once again

I've never trembled in my life
Heard about it once or twice
But now I'm shakin'
And I swear the shakin' feel so nice

Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause I don't want to be away from you
You shouldn't have felt so good
Love knows I've never felt so good
It's wonderful
Well, there's only one thing I need to know

Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of the night
Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of my life

Can I stay with you, babe
Through the end of all time
Oh, baby, please
Let me stay through the night

Never felt so weak before
Never met a man so sure
Of how and when and where to touch, and just how much
I've never been to ecstasy
But now I'm feelin' it
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over

Whatever I can do for your love
You just ask, consider it down
And I'll do anything
Whatever you want, whenever you need it

I just want to give it all to you
More than you could ever expect me to
I swear whatever you do
I'll do it three times, baby, back to you
I'm good to go
Well, there's only one thing I need to know

Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of the night (Yeah)
Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of my life

Can I stay with you, babe
Through the end of all time (Stay, stay, stay, baby)
Oh, baby, please
Let me stay through the night

One night of love
It turned me around, it turned me around
One night of love
Things'll never, never, never, never, never be the same
One night of love (Ooh)
Baby, I'm deep in love
Blew my heart away

Can I stay with you, babe (Stay)
For the rest of the night
Can I stay with you, babe (Stay)
For the rest of my life

Can I stay with you, babe (Stay, stay, stay)
Through the end of all time (Ooh)
Oh, baby, please
Let me stay through the night

Can I stay with you, babe (Stay, stay, stay)
For the rest of the night (All through the night)
Can I stay with you, babe (Stay, stay, stay)
For the rest of my life (For the rest of my life)

Can I stay with you, babe (Stay, stay)
Through the end of all time (Ooh)
Oh, baby, please
Let me stay through the night

Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of the night (Oh, ooh)
Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of my life (Mmm...mmm...)

Can I stay with you, babe
Through the end of all time
Oh, baby, please
