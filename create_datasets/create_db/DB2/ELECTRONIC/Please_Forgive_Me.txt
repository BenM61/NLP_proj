Please forgive me
If I act a little strange
For I know not what I do
Feels like lightning
Running through my veins
Every time I look at you
Every time I look at you

Help me out here
All my words are falling short
And there's so much I want to say
Want to tell you just how good it feels
When you look at me that way, ah
When you look at me that way

Throw a stone
And watch the ripples flow
Moving out across the bay
Like a stone I fall into your eyes
Deep into that mystery, ah
Deep into some mystery

I got half a mind
To scream out loud
I got half a mind to die
So I will never have to
Lose you girl
Won't ever have to say goodbye
I won't ever have to lie
Won't ever have to say goodbye

Whoa I,
Whoa I,
Whoa I

Please forgive me
If I act a little strange
For I know not what I do
Feels like lightning
Running through my veins
Every time I look at you
Every time I look at you
Every time I look at you
Every time I look at you
