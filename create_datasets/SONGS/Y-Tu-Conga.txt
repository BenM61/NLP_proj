Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet
It's the rhythm of the island
And like the sugarcane so sweet
If you want to do the conga

You've got to listen to the beat
Come on shake your body baby do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tryied it do that conga beat
Feel the fire of desire as you dance the night away
'cause tonight we're gonna party till we see the break of day

Better get yourself together and hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system there's no way you're gonna stop
Come on shake your body baby do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it do that conga beat

Come on shake your body baby do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it do that conga beat
Come on shake your body baby do the conga

I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it do that conga beat
Come on shake your body do the conga
