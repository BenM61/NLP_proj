Inbred expectations in a belt of social security,
Free thought demolished,
Generations, of stereotypes clash,
Traditional values abolished.

Outcries from the blind converted,
Mentally shocked.

Their forcified vision shies away from reality,
Finally blocked.

Majority overweight the scales of balance,
Secrets hidden,
Sin after sin in their eyes.

Understanding is now too late,
Utopia is banished,
The very morals trusted in have brought demise.

Religion, love, compassion,
Confuse the truth with lies.

Traditions to be changed? Accept the inevitable?
Forge the narrow-mindedness to create a new paradise.
