Now that time, it came calling
An angel has fallen
And nothing can be how it's been

And when love seemed so heartless
When light turned to darkness
Now only her star can be seen

What have we done?

You could talk without speaking
Cry without weeping
Your secrets will never be told

Leave your bonds left unbroken
Words left unspoken
And dreams that can never unfold

What have we done?

So there's no one to cry for
To lay down and die for
Now only the scars can be seen

What have we done?
