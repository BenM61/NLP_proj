Stop my flight to fight 
And die 
And take a stand to change my life 
So savage with red desperation 
I clench my hands 
You draw your claws 
A hidden rage consumes my heart 
Fueled by years of wasted time 
I close my eyes 
And tense myself 
And screaming 
Throw myself in fury over the edge 
And into your blood 
Tear at flesh 
And rip at skin 
And smash at doubt 
I have to break you 
Fury drives my vicious blows 
I see you fall but still I strike you 
Again and again 
Your body falls 
The movement is sharp and clear and pure 
And gone 
I stop and kneel beside you 
Drained of everything but pain 

Screaming throw myself in fury 
Over the edge and into your blood 

Kiss you once and see you writhe 
Hold you close and hear you cry 
Kiss your eyes and finish your life 
Kiss your eyes 
Finish your life 

Again and again 
Your body falls 
The movement is sharp and clear and pure 
And gone 
I stop and kneel beside you 
Knowing I'll murder you again tonight 

Knowing I'll murder you again 
Knowing I'll murder you again 
Knowing I'll murder you again 
Knowing I'll murder you again 
Tonight
