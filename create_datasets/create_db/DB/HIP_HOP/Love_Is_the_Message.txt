Remind me Tuesday I gotta go handle my business

Yo, don't play with them shits up in here

Time Balotti rap version of the black Gotti

Run it in the gun store

Wu Tang executive new Donna Jay
Darts in your area that's how I play
Nobody else shouldn't really have a say
When it come down to this Shaolin, USA
Represent fully give me your air space
Razor Sharp label keep coming out the face
Make room as I step up to the plate
RZA create sounds of earthquakes
Make no mistake kid why'll just faking
Cross-over cats that love to eat bacon
WTC rush like Regan
Crush your little song while you on your knees begging

Who? That nigga right there?

Dripped out dip promoter
Dead arm that nigga trying to get up over
Thinking he clever but he rolled up
Fronting on the God yo
Acting like that cheese ain't right
Aight that night dunn rolled on the mic
Jumping out the Lex door suede Lugz on
Looking like he worth ten thousand on the arms
Cuban connect I had it smashed
This is Godville kid we real
Staring at his steel dunn ask
Jewels that he rocking
Bone bracelet
Had laced kid screaming on his neck lex rocking
Nigga had a fat lab
Hundred bag
Tools you had
Ohh little wifey had it all with a fat ass
What you want to eat boo?

Niggas want to get you
You need to put a laser on your shit boo
Sat there bluffing
Saying nothing
Looking at bird pop shit
Acting like she bugging

Eighteen karat gold and fresh boots
Me and my team regulate to the roots
Big pockets
Blow mics out the sockets

A whole lot of dollars and real scholars
The Wu got knowledge
Represent five percent
One hundred percent pay attention
To the stretch Lincoln
Drinking Evian Don-Don
Stay calm under pressure
Break the sound barrier
Big Wu Tang trucks roll in your area
Wallabees for life
We too hype
One ring with the ice
Don't stress it
What? Love is the message
18 points on my brand new record
Dart clapper
Ran like a snapper
Watch out for Cappa
Make way

Throw the heat out
Ready to stop all beef out
Play me
Maybe you will catch more gravy kid
We ill in the back feeling on your ladies
