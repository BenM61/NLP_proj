I'm trying to find my way home to you
I'm gonna wipe all your tears away
Ignorance and hate are killing this world
So where's the change?
It'll happen someday

Oh- I try not to give up hope
That one day things will get better
We're all gonna be together -
May not be sunny weather

Don't give up hope

Its never been a question of "this is alright"
'Cause we're not gonna have it
All that I can do is hope against hope
We'll set it right 
'Cause we're killing each other

Oh- I try not to give up hope
That one day things will get better.
We're all gonna be together -
May not be sunny weather

Don't give up hope

Well I don't know what to say,
But you've turned
Me inside and out
And I don't know what to do
But I'm young and so are you so,

Oh- I try ;not to give up hope
That one day things wil get better
We're all gonna be together-
May not be sunny weather

Don't give up hope
