Our love was my womb but our bond has broken
My shield is gone, my protection is taken

I am one wound, my pulsating body
Suffering be

My heart is enormous lake, black with potion
I am blind, drowning in this ocean

My soul torn apart, my spirit is broken
Into the fabric of all he has woven

You fear my limitless emotions
I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions

Did I love you too much? Devotion bent me broken
So I remained, destroyed the icon

I did it for love, I honored my feelings
You betrayed your own heart, corrupted that organ

Family was always our sacred mutual mission
Which you abandoned

You have nothing to give, your heart is hollow
I am drowned in sorrows

No hope in sight, of ember
Reckoning eternal pain and horrors

I am a glowing shining rocket
Returning home

As I enter the atmosphere
I burn off layer by layer
