To love - and be loved
That's what life's - all about
Keeps the stars - coming out
What makes a sad heart sing - the birds take wing
To love - and be loved

That's what living - is for
Makes me want you the more - the more we cling
Let others race - to the moon
Through time and space - to the moon

My goal is greater than this
To reach your lips - to share your kiss
To stay - in your arms 
Is the dream - I pursue

To be sheltered - and safe - from the storm
To be cozy - and ever - so warm
And for always - to love 
And be loved - by you
