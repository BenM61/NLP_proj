Love is a stranger in an open car
To tempt you in and drive you far away

Love is a stranger in an open car
To tempt you in and drive you far away

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

Love is a danger of a different kind
To take you away and leave you far behind
And love love love is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it and you still can't get enough of the stuff

It's savage and it's cruel and it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood and it seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal, it distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up and you're left like a zombie

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

It's guilt edged, glamorous and sleek by design
You know it's jealous by nature
False and unkind
It's hard and restrained
And it's totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
