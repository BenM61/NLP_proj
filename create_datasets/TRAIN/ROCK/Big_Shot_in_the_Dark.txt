You used to be a candle in the wind
Now you're a big shot in the dark
You used to think that love was the answer
Now it's just another big question mark
You used to believe in the power of music
And all that revolutionary stuff
Back when money was the root of all evil
Back before you suddenly grew up

You used to laugh at the men on the chessboard
All those little pawns wanting to be king
You used to say "I refuse to play that game"
Now you think that winning is everything
You used to feel like a babe in the woods
Livin' out of your little gunny sack
You used to be a cry in the wilderness
Now you're just another lumberjack

You had it right the first time
You used to love swimming upstream
Now you like to go with the flow
Take a ride on the big waterslide
And never mind the rocks
Or the whirlpool down below

You used to be a candle in the wind
Now you're a big shot in the dark
You used to think that love was the answer
Now it's just another big question mark
You used to believe in the power of music
And all that revolutionary stuff
Back when money was the root of all evil
Now you just can't seem to get enough

You had it right the first time
