It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
 When your true lover comes your way 
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white 
The poets say 
The story goes that once a cherry tree 
Beside an apple tree did grow 
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago 
The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall 
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall 
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find 
The branches of the two trees were intertwined 
And that is why the poets always write 
If there's a new moon bright above 
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white 
When you're in love
