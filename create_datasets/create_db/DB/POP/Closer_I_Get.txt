People say it just doesn't matter but
The closer I get I'm giving in
I can't escape
Damn what a shame
Listen to me just for a minute
I can be quick, no gimmick
I got a plan we should live it

The closer I get, I can't relate
This ain't our place, let us go far far away
Find a new home, rules of our own
You and me both are the same
Try to be strong baby come on now, come on
Lie after lie, so many times
When I'm trying to find a peace of mind

I've got love for you when the time gets rough
When all the stress adds up
When you say I've had enough
Got love for you when the time gets rough
When all the stress adds up
When you say I've had enough

What ever happened to the good times?
We should create for ourselves, not rely on
They'll never get a hold of me
Simple you see, the simplicity
Yeah the closer I get I can't relate
I can't escape, oh the pain
How they lie all the time
When I'm trying to find a peace of mind

I've got love for you when the time gets rough
When all the stress adds up
When you say I've had enough
Got love for you when the time gets rough
When all the stress adds up
When you say I've had enough

Yes I found my own way out
I'm going all the way
Until the people all find out
They're going all the way down
