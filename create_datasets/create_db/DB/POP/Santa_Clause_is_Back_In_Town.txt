(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)

Well, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground (Christmas, Christmas)
Well, you be a real good little girl
Santa Claus is back in town (Christmas, Christmas)

Got no sleigh with reindeer, no sack on my back
You're gonna see me comin' in a big black Cadillac

Whoa, oh, it's Christmas time, pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground 
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town (Christmas, Christmas)

(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)

Hang up your pretty stockings
Turn off the light
Santa Claus is comin' down your chimney tonight

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, it's Christmas time, baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town (Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
