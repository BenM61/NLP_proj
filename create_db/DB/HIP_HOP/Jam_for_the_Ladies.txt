(with mc lyte and angie stone)
One things for sure
Well we got soul
It's a jam for the ladies and the superstars
I could leave the whole set but never go too far
If you're from where-ever to where-ever you are
Get yer jam, get it on
Superstar
Jam on
If you're from where-ever to where-ever you are
(MC Lyte, would you put it right)
Everybody moves
I paid my dues
You pick and choose
I stick and move
Yes yes y'all
It ain't gonna stop
The ladies
Keep rippin' the spot
Now men what you heard
'Cause women are comin' up
Keepin' it raw
Sexy and rough
Fly from the top
To the bottom it's gonna be
Cut 'em, gut 'em, we got 'em
It's like the old leagues 
It's a jam for the ladies and the superstars
I could leave the whole set but never go too far
(Do it superstar)
(Jam on, jam on)
If you're from where-ever to where-ever you are
(MC Lyte, do it right)
You know I can't stand to be held back (it's so fly)
And all the ladies y'all got my back yeah
Even when we're solo in action
We come together like six sets of jacksons
For the ladies and a superstar
Lyte leave the set but never go too far
I toured the world but i'm rollin' it now
Don't want my girl to brag, eve was holdin' it down
Jam for the ladies, we putting it down
Snatchin' the crown 'cause we fend for high ground
It's a jam for the ladies and the superstars
I could leave the whole set but never go too far
(Jam for the ladies)
(Do it superstar)
