What cha' gonna do when you don't know who to turn to 
And what cha' gonna say when you don't know what to pray 

And where you're gonna run when you don't know where to hide 
And what cha' gonna do when the pain just won't subside 

I say oh, oh, oh, oh 
My soul is crying out I'm saying oh, oh, oh , oh 

When my heart is feeling really really low I'm crying 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
When I don't know where to go I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, oh 

That's my soul crying out 
Yeah yeah yeah 
That's my soul crying out 
Yeah yeah yeah
