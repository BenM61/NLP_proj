One of these days and it won't be long
You're gonna search for me and down the road I'm gone
'Cause I believe
Oh yes, I believe
I believe to my soul
You're tryin' to mess around with me babe

You keep complainin, my progression is slow
You shouldn't complain baby
You aught to know
'Cause I believe
Oh yes sir I believe
I believe to my soul
You're tryin to make a fool of me

Once you told me you loved me I found out it was a lie
You should be ashamed baby hang your head and cry
'Cause I believe
Oh yes, I believe
I believe to my soul
You're tryin' to make a fool of me
I believe it
