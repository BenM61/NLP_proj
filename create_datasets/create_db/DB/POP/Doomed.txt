Hollow one
With inverted tongue
From whence does fulfillment come?
When I expel
From this mortal shell
Will I die for living numb?

Am I vital
If my heart is idle
Am I doomed?
Am I vital
If my heart is idle
Am I doomed?

I feel you
But nobody else
Though you're someone I can't see
Yet you say nothing
Of the stoic suffering
That stirs lukewarm in me
If lovelessness is godlessness
Will you cast me to the wayside?
Well, I feel the peeling
Of half-painted ceilings
Reveal the covering of a blank sky

Am I vital
If my heart is idle
Am I doomed?
Cradle me
So I can see
If I'm doomed

Am I vital
If my heart is idle
Am I doomed?
Cradle me
So I can see
If I'm doomed

Am I vital
If my heart is idle
Am I doomed?
