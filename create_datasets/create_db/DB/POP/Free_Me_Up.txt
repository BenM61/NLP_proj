I'm giving up my electro TV things
'Cause I don't ever need, no
Anything like that again
I'm livin' on the move and
I want to drop these chains
Well you'd be surprised what I left behind
It keeps me looking upward

You free me up to live this life far from any Earthly sense of home
There's a place where I belong but there's nothing here I really own
I really own

Do you deem this to be extreme behavior?
I'm a little bit too ideal
You call it young man's fever
But I've got my treasure stored beyond Heaven's gates
And you'd be surprised what lies behind them
It keeps me looking upward

You free me up to live this life far from any Earthly sense of home
There's a place where I belong but there's nothing here I really own
But there's nothing here, there's nothing here
No there's nothing here I really own
I really own

All that you find here, you will lose it
All you find here, you will lose it
All you gain here on earth, you'll lose in the end
All you gain here on earth, you will lose it... Lose it

You free me up now
There's a place where I belong but there's nothing here
Nothing here, I really own
