I'm back home
Out here the cold wind blows
I did not want to leave
I wondered if she knows
The first word she said to me was goodbye

And in the west the sky grows darker
Back east the sun will rise
Back home my wife and daughter
Don't know where I am tonight
But soon I will find a road that leads home

May have died here would never know
Wonder where I walk among the ghosts
Even though I left so long ago
I got someone waiting back at home
We got married down in Texas, Texas
A little daughter of my own

She doesn't care about
A cold wind that carried this on 
All that she knows right now
Is that her father is still gone
The first word she learned was to say goodbye

May have died here would never know
Wonder where I walk among the ghosts
Even though I left so long ago
I got someone waiting back at home
We got married down in Texas, Texas
A little daughter of my own
Alright

May have died here would never know
Wonder where I walk among the ghosts
Even though I left so long ago
I got someone waiting back at home
We got married down in Texas, Texas
A little daughter of my own
Like I hear is getting reckless, reckless
Better find my way back home
We got married down in Texas, Texas
A girl she'll be grown
I can't stand getting restless, restless
You're gonna have to let me go
