Hey, baby, how you doin' 
Wow, huh, it's really been a long time 
You know 
Remember that night 
You remember 

On a starry winter night in Portugal 
Where the ocean kissed the southern shore 
There a dream I never thought would come to pass 
Came and went like time spent through and hourglass 

You made love to me like fire and rain 
Ooh, you know you've got to be a hurricane 
Killing me with kisses, oh, so subtly 
You make love forever, baby 
You make love forever 

I ain't gonna let you go that easy 
You've got to say you love me too 
I ain't gonna let you go that easy 
I'm gonna give it all to you 

Portuguese love 
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby 
Portuguese love 
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby 
Portuguese love 
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby 
Portuguese 

Harbor nights, we made love till the morning star 
Then you crooned a song to me on your guitar 
Was it so familiar calling soft my name (Teena) 
Sunlight dancing slowly through loves window panes 

And you made love to me like sugar and spice 
Hush my broken heart, this must be paradise 
Killing me with kisses, oh, so tenderly 
You make love forever, baby 
You make love forever 

I ain't gonna let you go that easy 
You've got to say you love me too 
I ain't gonna let you go that easy 
I'm gonna give it all to you 

Portuguese love 
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby 
Portuguese love 
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby 
Portuguese love 
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby 
Portuguese 

Amore Portuguese 
Say you love me, baby 
Amore Portuguese 
Say you love me, baby 

Yo quiero a la ser amor 
A feeling too hard to ignore 
Say amore Portuguese 
You've got to say you love me 

You knew that you felt good to me, oh, baby, oh 
From the first kiss to the last I'm trembling 
You made love to me like no other man 
And if you please I'd like to go back there again 
Killing me with kisses, oh, so tenderly 
You make love like, wee 
You make love forever 

I ain't gonna let you go that easy 
You've got to say you love me too 
I ain't gonna let you go that easy 
I'm gonna give it all to you 

Portuguese love 
Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby

Won't you say it to me, say it to me, say you love me, baby
