All through the night 
I was a redwood before your door
So I don't die realize who was here before
Sunlight through the blinds
Black hills white nights
Oh and you know native bones mixed in the walls
Adobe bricks can make us scented wind and red clouds
Sunlight through the blinds
Black hills white nights
Up on the mountain we climb
Watch the seas rise so high
We will be baptized just like before
White night sunlight
