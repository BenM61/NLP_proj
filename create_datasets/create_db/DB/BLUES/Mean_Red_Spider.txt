I got a mean red spider, and she been webbin' all over town
I got a mean red spider, and she been webbin' all over town
I'm gonna get me a mean black spider, so I can tear her cobweb down
I got a break comin', no need for me to moan
I got a break is sho' comin', no need for me to moan

That's jus' a mean red spider, she's breakin' up my happy home
All right stop this stuff man
Go ahead man
If I don't go crazy, I will surely lose my mind
Well you know if I don't go crazy, I will surely lose my mind
That's jus' a mean red spider, and she jus' bother me all the time
