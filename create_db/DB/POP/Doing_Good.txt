Calling you lovable
How are you feeling now?
Making it all above
Falling for you somehow

I can't refuse you walking along the promenade
Wish I could leave you every time but all you say

'Cause I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing so good
I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing so good
