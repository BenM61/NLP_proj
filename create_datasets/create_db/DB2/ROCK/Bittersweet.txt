I'm giving up the ghost of love
And a shadow is cast on devotion
She's the one that I adore
Queen of my silent suffocation

Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Bittersweet

I won't give up, I'm possessed by her
I'm bearing a cross, she's turned into my curse

Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Bittersweet, I want you (how I wanted you)
And I need you (how I needed you)

Oh, break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

Bittersweet
