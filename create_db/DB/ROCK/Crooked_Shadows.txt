Does it hurt? Well you're not alone
'Cause I'm here for you when you need to let it go
Let the world spin on its own
And the storm will pass before you even know
Just remember that

Always break from the heavy weather
Cast a line as we walk together  
Side by side beside our crooked shadows
Only a fool would even try for this
We'll be the ones who get away with it
Running side by side beside our crooked shadows
Crooked shadows, our crooked shadows

Leave your keys, you won't need them
Only bring what we can carry on the run 
I believe, I believe in us
'Cause together you and I are strong enough

Always break from the heavy weather
Cast a line as we walk together
Side by side beside our crooked shadows
Only a fool would even try for this
We'll be the ones who get away with it
Running side by side beside our crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
Our crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
Crooked shadows

Only a fool would even try for this
We'll be the ones who get away with it
Running side by side beside our crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
Our crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
Our crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
Crooked shadows
