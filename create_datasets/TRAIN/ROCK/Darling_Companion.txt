Darlin' Companion
Come on and give me understandin'
And let me be your champion
The hand to hold your pretty handin'
Darlin' Companion
Now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landin'
I can depend on you

Darlin' Companion
Heaven knows where we'll be landin'
Just as long as we keep laughin'
Keep in mind just what's worth havin'
Darlin' Companion
I'll tell the mountains and the canyons
As long as I got legs to stand on
I'm gonna run to you

a flossy mare like you should have a steed
a little bridlin'down with me is what you need

Darlin' Companion
Come on and give me understandin'
And let me be your champion
The hand to hold your pretty handin'
Darlin' Companion
Now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landin'
I can depend on you
