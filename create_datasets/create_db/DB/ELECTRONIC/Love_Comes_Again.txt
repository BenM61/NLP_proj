You have become 
What you have always been 
Light flickering around 
Peripheral vision 
No words we can speak 
Of paths to be chosen 
All trails that we trek 
Shall lead us back to here 
Because our

Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come again 
You gotta believe that 
Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come again 

Deep within me 
Turn all the secret stones 
Forests and fields 
Breathing with blood and bones 
Still no words we can speak 
Of paths to be chosen 
All trails that we trek 
Shall lead us back to here 
Because our

Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come again 
You gotta believe that 
Love comes again 
Just when I've broken down I found 
Love can come again
