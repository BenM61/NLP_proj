Rock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, honey, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby, like my back ain't got no bone
Roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
Honey, roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby, you don't know how it make me feel

Rock me baby, honey, rock me slow
Hey, rock me pretty baby, baby rock me slow
Want you to rock me baby
Till I want no more
