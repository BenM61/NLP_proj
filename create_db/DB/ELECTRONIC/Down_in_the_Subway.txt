Rain keeps on falling
Sun refuse to shine
Baby quit your stalling
And say that you are mine

'Cause I've got so many troubles
Oh I feel like I could cry
Going down in the subway
Jump on that train track and die
Down in the subway
I hide these tears of mine
Down in the subway
I'm gonna cry cry cry 'til the end of the line

Cold hearted baby
You're too mean to smile
Every day is stormy
Oh you're one evil child

I've got so many troubles
Oh I feel like I could cry
Going down in the subway
Jump on that train track and die

Red blooded baby
You're too tough for me
I don't mean maybe
Oh why don't you let me be

'Cause I've got so many troubles
Oh I feel like I could cry
Going down in the subway
Jump on that train track and die
Jump on that train track and die
Jump on that train track and die
Going down in the subway
Jump on that train track and die
Jump on that train track and die
