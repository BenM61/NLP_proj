If I had a dollar for every time you said you love me, I'd be a millionaire
If I walked a mile for every time you'd meant the words, I'd still be right here
You gave me all that I could want
But not a penny for my thoughts
I had to see your face when the penny dropped

And I'll need to know right now that
I don't want to stay
I just want to go right now today

Who wants to be a billionaire?
You wake up with diamonds in your hair
Adored by everyone that you meet
The world is falling at your feet
I ask you who wants to be a billionaire
Not me, baby

I don't wanna live with you in the hope open day you'll die of a heart attack
Wanna feel my conscience knowing I don't have no monkey on my back

I'll need to know right now that
I don't want to stay

Who wants to be a billionaire?
You wake up with diamonds in your hair
Adored by everyone that you meet
The world is falling at your feet
I ask you who wants to be a billionaire?
Not me, baby
Not me, baby
Not me, baby
Yeah

I, I want you to know right now
I, that I don't want to stay
I ask you
Baby

You wake up with diamonds in your hair
Adored by everyone that you meet
The world is falling at your feet
I ask you, who wants to be a billionaire?
Not me, baby
Not me, baby
Not me, baby
Not me, baby

Who, who, who wants to be a billionaire?
You wake up with diamonds in your hair
Adored by everyone that you meet
The world is falling at your feet
I ask you, I don't wanna be a billionaire
Not me

If I had a dollar for every time you said you love me, I'd be a millionaire
