(Verse)
You're that kind 
That turns my head and makes me look
Whoa whoa whoa uh uh uh...uh
You're the kind 

That makes me pull single dollars
Out my pocket book, ooh baby
You're sexiness in my restitute makes me
Want to cook my favorite recipe

And place it on your table, baby
Your in-toxic ting and so divine
You're the kind that stays on a sista's mind

And I know you'll think this is crazy 
But, I got something better at home
Ooh whoo oo woo woo
Hey hey I got something better at home

(Verse:)
He's the kind that breaks it down
And curls my toes, woo woo woo baby ow
He's the kind that loves my mind and feeds my soul
And I love it baby

His intellect and outer respect, makes me want to crawl 
And be my best
And I know...
He loves his baby

He sense of self and silliness 
Makes the hardest things
The simplest and I look but don't touch
Never know baby

And I know you'll think this is crazy 
But, I got something better at home
Ooh whoo oo woo woo
Hey hey I got something better at home
'Cause, I got something better at home
Ooh ohoo ooo
'Cause, I got something better at home
Ooh ohh woo wooo

(Bridge:)
Baby I know you love me 
And your love is wonderful
You help me feel free
I won't betray you unintentionally, or intentionally
I got you babe
You can rest your shoulders and sleep at night
Okay

And I know you'll think this is crazy 
But, I got something better at home
Ooh whoo oo woo woo
Hey hey I got something better at home
Alright 'cause I know
'Cause I Know know know, 
I know, I got something better at home
Oh
