If I get on up and dance for you
scream and shout like a witch will do,
Would you give a little bit, uh huh
Give a little bit of attention to me, uh huh,
If I dress on up in fancy clothes,
with a come on smile and a real nice pose,
Would you give a little bit, uh huh,
Give a little bit of attention to me

Yeah baby, baby
Well I'm tired of gettin' through to you   
  
It ain't no good 'cause I just can't get enough,
I can't do enough,
I'm always here when you wanna play,
But then you walk away,
when I need your love,
I need your love

I don't wanna be the star attraction,
just need some action,
So come on baby can't you see,
All I'm asking for is a little attention to me,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If I walk right up with another guy,
Come on now boy won't you turn an eye,
Would you give a little bit, uh huh,
Give a little bit of attention to me,
oh yeah,
Are you listenin' baby

So won't you give a little bit,
give a little bit now,
Give a little bit of attention to me,
I need your love,
Come on give a little bit
