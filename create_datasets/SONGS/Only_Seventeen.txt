Nobody hears when you're talking
Too many tears have you calling What can I do
Why is it no one seems to care
Where is the love you often wonder
Too many nights you wait and wonder how can it be
Why do you feel there's no one there
If only you could steal away somehow
Maybe they'd understand what's the use anyhow

You're only seventeen
Lost in a world where you belong
Only seventeen
Caught in a dream and always wrong
And as the night begins to fall how can you win
You're only seventeen

Wishin and hopin' sometimes prayin'
Wanting to leave but you keep sayin'
Someday soon, sooner or later you'll be free
You know inside your heart that you want to run
But it tears you apart 'cos it can't be done

You're only seventeen
Lost in a world where you belong
Only seventeen
Caught in a dream and always wrong
Though you try to laugh there's a photograph
That reminds you too much of your dreams

There's a chance that you'll laugh with that with that photograph
Which reminds you of what might have been
You're only seventeen
You're only seventeen
Lost in a world where you belong
Only seventeen
Caught in a dream and always wrong
And as the night begins to fall how can you win

You're only seventeen
Lost in a world
Only seventeen caught in a dream
Your only seventeen
Lost in a world
Only seventeen
Caught in a dream
