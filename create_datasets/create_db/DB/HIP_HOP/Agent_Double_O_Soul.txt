Double-O-Soul! 
I dig rock and roll music 
I can do the twine and the jerk 
I wear strictly continental suits 
And high collared shirts. 
I've got a reputation of being 
Gentle but bold. 
And that's why they call me 
Agent Double-O-Soul baby! 
Agent Double-O-Soul. 
They call me Double-O-Soul baby 
I'm Agent Double-O-Soul. 

I don't carry no pistol 
I don't wear a false mustache 
And you'll never see me carrying 
Around a little black bag. 
My real names no secret 
But from me it will never be told. 
I'm just known as Agent Double-O-Soul baby! 
Agent Double-O-Soul. 
They call me Double-O-Soul baby 
I'm Agent Double-O-Soul. 

There once was a fella 
Who was down on rock and roll. 
He couldn't get himself together 
He didn't have no kind of soul. 
The office put me on his case 
And I tracked him down right away. 
Now he's a deejay on a radio show 
A station that everybody knows. 
Call me Double-O-Soul 
Call me Double-O-Soul 

Double-O-Soul 
Double-O-Soul 
Double-O-Soul 
Double-O-Soul 

At my job I work real hard 
I'm on the go 
Rain, sleet, or snow. 
I'm Agent Double-O-Soul baby! 
I'm Agent Double-O-Soul 
They call me Double-O-Soul baby.
