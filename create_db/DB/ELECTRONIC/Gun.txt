It's feeling like the same old dance
We never even had a chance
You say it will be alright
But I'm lying awake tonight
It's a lie
I thought you could be the one
But I might as well use a gun
I'm dying inside
And this deep longing grows
And I'm so tired
I'm so tired

You're dreams are mine
You have
Do you know that?
Reason to be proud
You can fall asleep 
You dream aloud, dream aloud I'll be awake
And you can travel far 
Reason to be proud
And I'll be here if you should
Dream aloud
Fall apart
Dream aloud

I'm lonely as I've ever been
My patience is wearing thin
You're love is a killing ache
Don't know how much I can take
I thought you could bring the sun
But I might as well use a gun
I'm dying inside
And this deep longing grows
And I'm so tired
I'm so tired

Is this another way of saying goodbye?
I remember what you said
Say it now
