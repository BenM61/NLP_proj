Sitting home waiting for you,
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do.
I try my best to be good to you,
But you're never around when I'm in the mood.
 
I'm getting tired
Of being tired of your ways,
You haven't come home
Or even called today.
And you don't know the pain
When I'm feeling alone,
I'm calling out your name
When your not even home.
 
And I need you with me, babe,
Can't see you leaving me, babe,
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go.
And I hope your feelings change,
Come bring your loving back to me,
So I can give you all you need and much more.
I'm sitting...

Sitting home waiting for you,
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do.
I try my best to be good to you,
But you're never around when I'm in the mood.
 
All my friends think that
I am a fool,
And since you have been gone
I've been thinking so too.
Just tell me what it is
And what you feel I do wrong,
We should stay together
'Cause our love is so strong.

And I need you with me, babe,
Can't see you leaving me, babe,
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go.
And I hope your feelings change,
Come bring your loving back to me,
So I can give you all you need and much more.
I'm sitting...

Sitting home waiting for you,
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do.
I try my best to be good to you,
But you're never around when I'm in the mood.

By myself all day long,
This feeling that I feel for you
Feels so strong.
With myself all day long,
This feeling that I feel for you
Since you've been gone.

Sitting home waiting for you,
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do.
I try my best to be good to you,
But you're never around when I'm in the mood.
