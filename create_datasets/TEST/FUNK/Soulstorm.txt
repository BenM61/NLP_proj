Now we're walking down an alley 
Now I'm talking spiritually 
We got one eye on the future 
And the other on our money 
And all our feeling goes dead 
When we switch on that channel 
So verified with the terrible flannel 
Try to switch off my head 
Use my soul instead 
So I'll get ahead of these things 
I said 

There's a soul, soul 
A soulstorm everywhere 
Say everywhere, everywhere 
A soulstorm everywhere 

I was taught that talk is cheap 
And I have learned that love is deep 
God gave me my soul to keep 
So I talk love a whole big heap 
And I will not point a finger 
For it is timeless and will linger 
I keep my own words down 
So I won't drown 
Repeat one more time
Repeat one more time
Don't hinder 

There's a soul, soul 
A soulstorm everywhere 
Say everywhere, everywhere 
A soulstorm everywhere 

Some people might be wondering 
Is his head in the clouds and no ground under him 
What the so and so's he on about 
So I'll just break it down, down (no doubt)

I got up out of bed one misty morning 
Found myself sitting there and brainstorming 
About how to be true without being corny 
Do some soul-storming 
Must be the benefit of the global warming 
I realized that there ain't no harm in 
Planting soul and a little farming 
Do some soul-farming 
Soul

There's a soul, soul 
A soulstorm everywhere 
Say everywhere, everywhere 
A soulstorm everywhere 

There's a soul, soul 
A soulstorm everywhere 
Say everywhere, everywhere 
A soulstorm everywhere 

There's a soul, soul 
A soulstorm everywhere 
Say everywhere, everywhere 
A soulstorm everywhere
