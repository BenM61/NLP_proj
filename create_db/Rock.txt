name: ! (The Song Formerly Known as)(Regurgitator):
I don't go to parties baby
'cause people tend to freak me out
Watch their lips you can work it out
I can hear the words but I still don't know what it's all about
You won't see me down the disco mama
Bright lights really hurt my eyes
I'd rather stay and dance with you
To the funky music playing on your stereo
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and new
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
I don't go to concerts baby
Music's always up too loud
Cigarettes and alcohol get up my arse
I always lose you in the crowd
You won't see me tribal raving baby
'cause I won't ever look that good
I'd rather dance in ugly pants in the comfort of a loungeroom in suburbia
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
That's right
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh ooh, things don't get no better
Better than you and me
That's right
Better than you and me
Better than you and me
Thankyou mr. dj

name: "40"(U2):
(Sing this with me, this is "40")

Waited patiently for the Lord
Inclined and heard my cry
He lift me up out of the pit
Out of the mire and clay

I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song

How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long, how long, how long
How long to sing this song?

He set my feet upon a rock
And made my footsteps firm
Many will see
Many will see and hear

I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song

(Sing it)

How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long, how long, how long
How long to sing this song?

Thank you, good night!

name: "45"(The Gaslight Anthem):
Have you seen my hands?
Just look at 'em shake.
And the song just keeps on repeating,
Drop the needle again.
And I dance with your ghost,
Oh, but that ain't the way,
I can't move on and I can't stay the same.

And all my friends say

"Hey hey, turn the record over.
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side.
There you go, turn the key and engine over.
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet."

Have you seen my heart,
Have you seen how it bleeds?
And the nights are so long, baby,
Out here in the deep.
The tick, ticking of hours, lonely.
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms.

But "better sense" says

"Hey hey, turn the record over.
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side.
There you go, turn the key and engine over.
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet."

And all my friends say,
"Hey hey, turn the record over.
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side.
There you go, turn the key and engine over.
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet."

Where you used to be, where you used to be, where you used to be, here with me.

name: "5150"(Van Halen):
The love line is never straight and narrow
Unless your love is tried and true
We take a chance with new beginnings
Still we try win or lose
Take the highs with the blues

Always one more
You're never satisfied
Share one for all with you
It's only one for me
Ah, why draw the line
And meet you half the way
And you don't know
What the means, oh yeah

I feel like a running politician, oh
Just trying to please you all the time
I've given you myself with no conditions
Going wide, running long
Feeling lost but not for long

Always one more
You're never satisfied
Share one for all with you
It's only one for me
So why draw the line
Meet you half the way
When you don't know
What that means, oh yeah

Always one more
You're never satisfied

Whoa yeah

name: "A" Bomb in Wardour Street(The Jam):
Where the streets are paved with blood
With cataclysmic overtones
Fear and hate linger in the air
A strictly no-go deadly zone
I don't know what I'm doing here
'Cause it's not my scene at all
There's an 'A' bomb in Wardour Street
They've called in the Army, they've called in the police to

I'm stranded on the vortex floor
My head's been kicked in and blood's started to pour
Through the haze I can see my girl
Fifteen geezers got her pinned to the door
I try to reach her but fall back to the floor
'A' bomb in Wardour Street
It's blown up the west end, now it's spreading throughout the city

'A' bomb in Wardour Street, it's blown up the city
Now it's spreading through the country

Law and order take a turn for the worst
In the shape of a size ten boot
Rape and murder throughout the land
And they tell you that you're still a free man
If this is freedom I don't understand
'Cause it seems like madness to me
'A' bomb in Wardour Street, hate Bomb
Hate Bomb, hate Bomb, hate Bomb

A Phillistine nation, of degradation
And hate and war. There must be more
It's Doctor Martin's A-P-O-C-A-L-Y-P-S-E

name: "Blasco" Rossi(Vasco Rossi):
La combriccola del blasco 
Si è fermata dentro a un bosco 
Che nessuno aveva voglia di abitare 
Fu così che per dispetto 
Che qualcuno da su un...tetto 
Tutto a un tratto! da sul tetto...si mise a urlare! 
Guardate l'animale!... 
Guardate l'animaaaleeeeeeee

La combriccola del blasco 
Era poco più di un pugno 
Ma se si stringeva colpiva molto duro 
Fu così che per non fare 
Per non fare troppo male 
Lasciò il bosco per un posto, più sicuro

Magari un po' più buio 
Ma molto più sicuro 
Magari un po' più buio 
Ma molto più sicuuuurohohohohoh

La combriccola del blasco 
Era tutta gente a posto 
Ma qualcuno continuava a dirne male 
Si diceva che quel blasco 
Fosse stato prima un rospo 
Tramutato non so come e anche male 
In uno strano animale!... 
Con delle voglie strane 
Uno strano animale 
Con delle voglie straaaneeeeee

La combriccola del blasco 
Arrivati a questo punto 
Sparì dentro un buco profondo come il mare 
A vedere se quel tale 
Arrivava fin là in fondo 
Arrischiando, per lui stesso? d'affogare
Magari in mezzo al mare 
Per prender l'animale

Vieni già in fondo al mare 
A prender l'animale 
Vieni già in fondo al mare 
Che ti do l'animale

Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?

Do you take plight on my tongue like lead?
Do you fall gracefully into bed anymore?

You looked out the window, you looked at the moon
And you sat on the corner of my bed and you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head

Now I don't know and I don't care
If I ever see you again
I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will be there

Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you keep me anymore?
You kick my foot under the table
I kick you back can't say that I'm able
To stand for you or fall for you ever again

Wish for a perfect setting
Wishing that I am letting you
Take me where you want me all over again
You can't give yourself

name: "I Often Dream of Trains"(Robyn Hitchcock):
I often dream of trains when I'm alone
I ride on them into another zone
I dream of them constantly
Heading for paradise, or Basingstoke or Reading

I often dream of trains when I'm awake
They ride along beside a frozen lake
And there in the buffet car
I wait for eternity, or Basingstoke or Reading

I often dream of trains till it gets light
Summer turns to winter overnight
The leaves falls so suddenly
The sun sets at four o'clock, exactly what I'm dreading

I often dream of trains when I'm with you
I wonder if you dream about them too
Maybe we'll meet one night
Out in the corridor, I'm waiting for you baby...

name: "M"(Los Piratas):
Mi amor se cae al suelo y no se queja demasiado
Podría ser peor se dice y sigue caminando
Mi amor jugaba a ser mayor mucho antes de llegar
Y expresa en una mueca que está harta de esperar
Pero no importa estaré bien si tú te quedas a mi lado
Y disimula recogiendo su amor propio destrozado

Mi amor dejó el colegio porque dijo que era caro
Nada he aprendido y ya me estaban fastidiando
Empezaré cualquier empresa y cuidaré de que estés bien
Tú quédate conmigo sólo tienes que aprender

M está segura de que todo irá mejor
Pero nunca pasa nada y aún seguimos siendo dos
M está tranquila porque dice que es mejor
Pero nunca he estado solo y esta casa es para dos

Yo tocaba fondo y me dormía en la cocina
M me abrazaba y se tumbaba encima mía
No te preocupes que esto pasará, mañana estarás bien
Y me cogía la cabeza y la metía en su jersey

M nunca dudó que me quería a pesar de todo
Pero el día que se fue no le importó dejarme solo
Lo hago por ti me dijo ya verás sin mi estarás mejor
Y me dio un beso en la mejilla cogió la puerta y sonrió

M está segura de que todo está mejor
Pero nunca he estado solo y esta casa es para dos
M está tranquila porque dice que es mejor
Pero nunca pasa nada y echo de menos su amor
M está tranquila porque todo irá mejor
Pero nunca he estado solo y esta casa es para dos
M está contenta porque dice que es mejor
Pero nunca pasa nada y nunca más seremos dos.

And I'll always be waiting in the back room
I'm boring but overcompensate with
Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography

Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines

name: "You've Got" the Touch(Alabama):
Lyin' beside you watching you sleepin'
After you've loved me so tenderly
I'm searchin' for some way to tell you
How good it felt when I held you
There's so many ways you get to me

'Cause you've got the touch
It turns me on and on
You light the fire in me
That keeps burning strong
The longer I'm with you
The deeper and deeper in love I fall
You've got the moves
You move me so much
You've got the touch

As you wake up you pull me closer
And whisper good morning warm in my ear
Nobody could do that like you do
You make it so easy to love you
And I know I will for a million years

'Cause you've got the touch
You turns me on and on
You light the fire in me
That keeps growing strong
The longer I'm with you
The deeper and deeper in love I fall
You've got the moves
That move me so much
You've got the touch

Nobody can touch me like you do
You make it so ease to love you
And I know I will a million years

'Cause you've got the touch
You turns me on and on
You light the fire in me
That keeps growing strong
The longer I'm with you
The deeper and deeper in love I fall
You've got the moves
That move me so much
You've got the touch

You've got the moves
That move so much

See your face ever place that I walk in 
Hear your voice every time that I'm talking

Feel pain for you 
I will twist the knife and bleed my aching heart 
And tear it apart 

I will lie for you 
Beg and steal for you 
I will crawl on hands and knees until you see 
You're just like me 

Violate all the love that I'm missing 
Throw away all the pain that I'm living 
You will believe in me 
And I could never be ignored 

I would die for you 
I would kill for you 
I would steal for you

So long ago
Was it in a dream?
Was it just a dream?
I know, yes I know
It seemed so very real
Seemed so real to me

Took a walk down the street
Through the heat whispered trees
I thought I could hear
Hear
Hear
Hear

Somebody call out my name (John)
As it started to rain
Two spirits dancing so strange
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse

Dream, dream away
Magic in the air
Was magic in the air?
I believe, yes I believe
More I cannot say
What more can I say?

On a river of sound
Through the mirror go round, round
I thought I could feel
Feel
Feel
Feel
Music touching my soul
Something warm, sudden cold
The spirit dance was unfolding
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse
Ah! Bowakawa, pousse pousse

name: & Jay-Z Singt Uns Ein Lied(Casper):
Es gibt eine Zeit zu rennen
Es gibt eine Zeit zu ruhen
Es gibt Tage, an denen man sich anstrengen muss
Die simpelsten Dinge zu tun
Es gibt für alles eine Antwort
Es gibt für alles eine Zeit
Aber ich frage mich heute Abend wie oft
Und habe ich eine Wahl

Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Wie häufig siehst du himmelwärts?
Und wie häufig stehst du auf und freust du dich darauf?
Und Jay-Z singt uns ein Lied
Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Wie häufig siehst du himmelwärts?
In der Schönheit des Moments
Wenn du lachst und schreist und rennst
Und Jay-Z singt uns ein Lied

Meine Hände sind ständig in Bewegung
Solang' ich denken kann, bin ich nervös
Das liegt daran, dass ich hoffe, dass dir nichts zustößt
Es gibt eine Zeit zu beten
Es gibt eine Zeit zu stehen
Aber heute ist der Tag zu knien
Und dich auf Augenhöhe wieder zu sehen

Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Wie häufig siehst du himmelwärts?
Und wie häufig stehst du auf und freust du dich darauf?
Und Jay-Z singt uns ein Lied
Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Wie häufig siehst du himmelwärts?
In der Schönheit des Moments
Wenn du lachst und schreist und rennst
Und Jay-Z singt uns ein Lied

Mehr Kraft als Mut, mit mehr Schnaps als Blut
In den Augen, taumel durch die Nacht im Flug, schlafimmun
Ab und zu Lebenslichter, schwebenden Songs
Hab' neunundneunzig Probleme, wir sind jedes davon
Durch Krisen, Tresen und Alk, meiner Miesepeter-Gestalt
Waren es immer nur gerade Worte durch schiefe Zähne gelallt
Du warst mein Ketamin, mein Amphetamin
Mein Auf und Ab, Euphorien und zuckersüße Lethargie
Seht uns hier zugleich, nur noch Fragen, die blieben
Für die Komödie gezahlt, aber für das Drama geblieben
Und im Radio lief Jay-Z immer wieder mit seinem Lied
Von der großen Stadt
Erinnert uns wieder, wie klein wir sind

Wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Wie häufig siehst du himmelwärts?
Und wie häufig stehst du auf und freust du dich darauf?
Und Jay-Z singt uns ein Lied
Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?
Und wie häufig schlägt dein Herz?

name: '39(George Michael):
In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, to a new home we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All the letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

For my life
Still ahead
Pity me

Mit dem Herz in der Hand und der Leidenschaft I'm Bein

Wir haben nicht die höchste Spielkultur,

Doch der Cup bleibt in unserem Land.

Beim zweiten Mal wars Glück,
Beim dritten Mal der verdiente Lohn
Und diesmal wirds ne Sensation.

name: 'A' Bomb In Wardour Street(The Jam):
Where the streets are paved with blood
With cataclysmic overtones
Fear and hate linger in the air
A strictly no-go deadly zone
And I don't know what I'm doing here
'Cause it's not my scene at all
There's an 'A' bomb in Wardour Street
They've called in the Army, they've called in the police to

I'm stranded on the vortex floor
My head's been kicked in and blood's started to pour
Through the haze, I can see my girl
Fifteen geezers got her pinned to the door
I try to reach her but fall back to the floor

'A' bomb off in Wardour Street
It's blown up the West End, now it's spreading through the City

'A' bomb in Wardour Street, it's blown up the City
Now it's spreading through the country

Law and order takes a turn for the worst
In the shape of a size-ten boot
Rape and murder throughout the land
And they tell you that you're still a free man
If this is freedom I don't understand
'Cause it seems like madness to me
'A' bomb in Wardour Street
Hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb

A Phillistine nation, of degradation
And hate and war there must be more
It's Doctor Martin's A-P-O-C-A-L-Y-P-S-E, Apocalypse!

name: 'cause Cheap Is How I Feel(Cowboy Junkies):
It's the kind of night that's so cold, when you spit
It freezes before it hits the ground
And when a bum asks for a quarter, you give a dollar
If he's out tonight, he must be truly down
And I'm searching all the windows for a last minute present
To prove to you what I said was real
For something small and frail and plastic baby
Cause' cheap is how I feel

Half a moon in the sky tonight, bright enough
To come up with an answer
To the question, why is it that every time I see you
My love grows a little stronger
But your memory leaves my stomach churning
Feeling like a lie about to be revealed
But I'll horde all this to myself
Cause' cheap is how I feel

It's not the smell in here that gets to me, it's the lights
How I hate the shadows that they cast
And the sound of clinking bottles is the one sure thing
I'll always drag with me from my past
I think I'll find a pair of eyes tonight, to fall into
And maybe strike a deal
Your body for my soul, fair swap
Cause' cheap is how I feel

name: 'Cross the Breeze(Sonic Youth):
Let's go walking on the water
Come all the way please

Should I stay or go?

No need to be scared

Close your eyes and make believe
You can do whatever you please
I want to know
I think I better go

Let's go walking on water
Now you think I'm Satan's daughter
I want to know
Please let me go!

Just too quick
Now I think I'm gonna be sick
I want to know
Should I stay or go?

I'm trying for the future
It's funny that way
I want to know
I want to know!

I took a look into the hate
It made me feel very up-to-date
I want to know
Should I stay or go?

Hold me tight, down on my knees
So I don't go burning 'cross the breeze
I want to know
I want to know

I want to know
Should I stay or go?

Burning 'cross the breeze
Burning 'cross the breeze

name: 'It's a Good Life If You Don't Weaken'(The Tragically Hip):
When the color of the night
And all the smoke for one life
Gives way to shaky movements
Improvisational skills

A forest of whispering speakers
Let's swear that we will
Get with the times
In a current health to stay

Let's get friendship right
Get life day to day
In the forget yer skates dream
Full of countervailing woes

In diverse as ever scenes
Proceeding on a need to know
In a face so full of meaning
As to almost make it glow

For for a good life
We just might have to weaken
And find somewhere to go

Go somewhere we're needed
Find somewhere to grow
Go somewhere we're needed

It begins to tell,
'Round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'Round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,
For your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.
Feelin' sad,
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight

name: 'Til Death(Capture the Crown):
Hold up! Carefully holding you tighter
Carefully holding you close
Can you help me open my eyes to see what is pure
And what is right? I've been trapped in this fantasy all my life
Do I have to search for words, can I just smile?
What we have isn't far from good, nor good from far
I've made these mistakes (in the past) but our time is now
So in love, I'm falling deeper and deeper, I'll wait for you
What I have is all I have to give and I want to give you it all
Emancipation of myself is only the beginning, I'm a compass
Give me direction to go in.

'Til death do us part, hear nor see anyone but you
I see no one but you, you stop my world
'Til death do us part, you'll by my special lady

A sudden impact shock that stops my pulsing blood
I see the glory shining light of paradise
And insincerities, forever left behind

'Til death do us unite

I see the mournful flowers fading on my grave
And all my friends are crying to god my soul to save
Hateful faces spitting on my last resting place
And all my foes are praying to hell my mind to take

I hear the echos of your prayers and your lies
Your falseness and your greed mendacious sorry sights
My hopes are buried by my broken dignity
Still god will bless and curse us all
To all eternity

Every time I feel alone

But we both know you left me no choice

[Chorus]
(chaque fois que tu ton va)
You just bring me down
(je pretend que tu fais bien)
So I'm counting my tears 'til I get over you

Sometimes I watch the world go by
I wonder what it's like
To wake up every single day
Smile on your face
You never tried
We both know we can't change it
But we both know we'll just have to face it

[Chorus]

If only I could give you up
But would I want to let you off of this soapbox baby?
We both know that we want it
But we both know you left me no choice

And the churches won't stretch out through tarmac of flyovers,
The city don't smell like they said in the brochures,
And it's no longer surprising when lovers and lawyers, they lie,

Well we've had our problems but hey hasn't everyone?
As soon as they're gone we just drag in another one,
'Cause I see that your upset but you say there's a lash in your eye,
And I'll gladly put up with your shit â??til the day that I die.

Yeah well, I get the feeling I'm just not cut out for this,
All strategy's, hidden agendas and politics,
But if we can stand before legions of enemies, just you and I, 
And I'll gladly put up with this shit â??til the day that I die, 
â??til the day that I die [Repeat: x1]
Oh the day that I die.

name: 'Til the World Ends(Three Dog Night):
Seasons change and summer's gone
Another year of love I've known
Fades like a dream
Rearrange, boy, make yourself strong
You're not the first or last who's lost everything

And you can bundle up your feelings
Hang them in some closet
Until you need them again
All of us brokenhearted young lovers
Oh, we'll search for one another
'Til the world ends

Frosty window, scribbled name
Stabbing sad refrain of
What's come to pass
The candle glows, so follow the flame
The light of hope can ease the pain of loneliness

Hang them in some closet
Until you need them again
All of us brokenhearted young lovers
Oh, we'll search for one another
'Til the world ends

You know we all live for once
Using is a part of living your life
Daylight always follows the night
Looking at life as it's always been
It will be that way here
'Til the world ends

Between a rock
Between a rock and a hard place

There's a beating heart
Watching the lights go down on my world
Stoney faced
Letting the rope slip though my fingers
Ain't nothin' straight, 
Always a riddle
Caught up in the middle of the party line
I got a brick but I can't find a window
Take me to your shelter...

Between a rock
Between a rock and a hard place 
(You better lay your money down)
You'll never stop
What you started in the first place
Between a rock
You gotta roll with the punches baby
Between a rock and a hard place...

There's so many words
You place your bet you take your chances
The dealer pays
But he'll never let you leave the table
They're gonna take you lock, stock and barrel
Down to the knuckle, down on your luck
And when they've stripped you of all resistance
You can take you place...

Between a rock
Between a rock and a hard place

You'll never stop
What you started in the first place

name: ( I Just ) Died In Your Arms(Cutting Crew):
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can´t get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don´t see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would´ve thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must´ve been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must´ve been some kind of kiss
I should´ve walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I´m a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I´ve lost and found, it´s my final mistake
She´s loving by proxy, no give and all take
´Cos I´ve been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms...
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it´s over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

Oh I, I just died in your arms...

name: (Another) 1984(Billy Squier):
From over the air comes a voice without care
Says we're doin' all right
But day out and day in from what he's been sayin'
We're in for a fight
I glance at myself and the world rushin' by
I can see for myself and the fear comes alive
Shades of termination--we're dyin' to survive

1984

Machine is the mind--it will rule by design
So you're never alone
We store information without confirmation
Accept the unknown
I think to myself of the times we have tried
To be true to ourselves and to live with the lie
Avoid the contradictions--just keep yourself alive

1984

I can't help it...I can't help it...I can't help it...
Life is your decision--we choose to do or die
Can you live with the reality of 1985

Polite conversation ain't no consolation
For blanks in your eyes
Amidst the confusion there lives the illusion
That love will survive
But I got a chance with myself if I try
To be sure of myself and myself choose to try
Fight for stimulation and love to stay alive

1984



name: (Are You) The One That I've Been Waiting For?(Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds):
I've felt you coming girl, as you drew near
I knew you'd find me, 'cause I longed you here
Are you my desitiny? 
Is this how you'll appear?
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?
Well take that coat babe, and throw it on the floor
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

As you've been moving surely toward me
My soul has comforted and assured me
That in time my heart it will reward me
And that all will be revealed
So I've sat and I've watched an ice-age thaw
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

Out of sorrow, entire worlds have been built
Out of longing great wonders have been willed
They're only little tears, darling, let them spill
And lay your head upon my shoulder
Outside my window the world has gone to war
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

Oh we will know, won't we?
The stars will explode in the sky
Oh but they don't, do they?
Stars have their moment and then they die

There's a man who spoke wonders though I've never met him
He said, "He who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in"
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting
And how every little thing anticipates you
All down my veins my heart-strings call
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?

Baby, you don't have to tell me goodbye

There is someone new who gets your kiss now
What about the times before - don't they exist now?

Whoah baby, you don't have tell me
Baby, 'cause I already know, you see
Baby, you don't have to tell me goodbye
Have a little lesson now

Baby tried to be a middle guy
Baby when I know what is on your mind
Baby you don't have to tell me goodbye

Go ahead, tell me that's life, each day if you could
You are giving me a taste of life but good

Whoah baby, you don't have tell me
Baby, 'cause I already know, you see
Baby, you don't have to tell me goodbye

Baby tried to be a middle guy
Baby when I know what is on your mind
Baby you don't have to tell me goodbye

name: (Baby) You've Got What It Takes(Jerry Lee Lewis):
Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby you've got what it takes

You know it takes a lot of kissin'  SPOKEN (Tell me about it)
to make a romance sweet 
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
Mmm, and it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
and baby, you've got what it takes.

I said,  mm, mm, mm. uh-huh, mm, mm, mm
Ah, ah, hah   mm, mm
You know you've got just what it takes!

Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do."
"Oh, yeah"
And baby, you've got what it takes.

Ah, ah, hah   mm, mm, uh-huh, mm, mm, mm
Mmm
You know you've got just what it takes

Because it takes oh yeah
"You're back in my spot again, honey"
"I like your spot"
To stay away from you
"I can't stay away from you"
It takes more than a lifetime, daddy, to prove that I'll be true
"Now it's you"
But, it takes somebody special  
"Like me, baby"
To make me say, "I do."
And baby you've got what it takes

"C'mon, let's play it again, huh?"
"C'mon, let's do it one more time, all right?"
And baby you've got what it takes
"One more time, Brook"
"Ah-ha, OK, Ah-ha"
And baby you've got what it takes
