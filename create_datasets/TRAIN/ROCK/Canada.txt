A look out California
Ooo-ooo, I gotta warn ya
Here comes Canada

Canada, you got an open door
You got so many things
I swear, I never saw them before
So much more, you got a world in store
You got a home from home, got a hold so strong
Can't seem to ignore

These things I do
I do for nobody else but me

A look out California
Ooo-ooo, I gotta warn ya
Here comes Canada

Canada, you proved your worth
You got snow peaked mountains tumbling down
You had them from birth
Say it clear, so the world can hear
I swear I never left you
Without shedding a tear

These things I do
I do for nobody else but me

A look out California
Ooo-ooo, I gotta warn ya
Here comes Canada

These things I do
I do for nobody else but me

A look out California
Ooo-ooo, I gotta warn ya
Here comes Canada ...
