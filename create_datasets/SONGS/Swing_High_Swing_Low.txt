Swing high, swing low
Swing to and fro
Not fast, not slow
A little swing can do more than anything else for you

Swing out, swing in
It's not a sin
So let's begin
You'll never get the gate if your swinging is up to date

When your one and only
Complains that he's lonely and blue
A rhythmical campaign can do more than champagne
To see him through

Swing high, swing low
Swing to and fro
Not fast, not slow
And if you think you can't swing high, swing low

When your one and only
Complains that he's lonely and blue
A rhythmical campaign can do more than champagne
To see him through

Swing high, swing low
Swing to and fro
Not fast, not slow
And if you think you can't swing high, swing low
