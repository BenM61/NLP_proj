Mmh, yeah
Special occasion
Like when you dress up in your tie and tails, yeah
Special occasion 
Ev'ry time and it never fails
To give me a thrill
That's fresh and new
Every time I'm kissin' you 
It's something that you do 
That makes ev'ry time I kiss you 
A real special occasion
Like one that calls for toast of champagne
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Special occasion 
Ev'ry time and it's hard to explain
How the same old touch 
From the same old hand
Can make me feel like a diff'rent man 
I just can't understand 
But all the time you touch me 
It's a real special occasion yeah, yeah
Special occasion, oh
Mmh, mmh, yeah
Ooh, beautiful music begins to play 
You are the sun 
Brighten up my day 
Why don't you stay 
'Cause ev'ry time I'm with you
It's a real special occasion 
Like when in school
You got your cap and gown yeah
And it's a real special occasion
And every time that you come around, baby
