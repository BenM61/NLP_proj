I've been down, but not like this before 
Can't be 'round this kind of show no more 
All, all that you dream 
Comes to shine in silver lining 
And clouds, clouds change the scene 
Rain starts washing all these cautions 
Right into your life, make you realize 
Just what is true, what else can I do 
Just follow the rule 
Keep your eyes on the road that's ahead of you 
 
I've been down, but not like this before 
Can't be 'round this kind of show no more 
 
All of the good, good times were ours 
In the land of milk and honey 
And time, time has its scars 
Rainy days they turn to sunny ones 
Livin' the life, livin' the life lovin' everyone 
 
I've been down, but not like this before 
Can't be 'round this kind of show no more
