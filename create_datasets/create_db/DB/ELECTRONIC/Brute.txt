Between the liquor, the bend and the noise in my head.
Between your mind and my crime
And me int the grime.
Between the gun, the lead and the lies that I said.
Through your sweet breath,
Come the down of my death.
Touch me - hate me.
Give yourself to me and break me!
Cut these eyes and I will see.
Kiss these lying lips for me
Stroke this skin and I will kneel.
Brutalize me, I will heal!
Between the bullet and my lip,
And the lies you let slip.
Between the dirt of this soul,
And your hear that's a hole.
Between the place where you hit,
And this face that you spit.
Through your sweet breath,
Comes the down of my death.
Touch me - hate me.
Give yourself to me and break me!
I escape a lot of the time by sitting on my bum and
And analysing my past, you know? Are you through? Are you?
Cut these eyes - I will see!
Kiss those lying lips for me!
Stroke this skin - I will kneel!
Brutalize me - I will heal!
