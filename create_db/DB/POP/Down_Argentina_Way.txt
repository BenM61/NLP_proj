You'll find your life will begin
The very moment you're in Argentina
If you're romantic senor
Then you will surely adore Argentina

You'll be as gay as can be
If you will learn to, si, si, like a Latin
For mister, soon as you learn
Then you will never return to Manhattan

When you hear, yo te amo
You'll steal a kiss and then
If she should say, manana
It's just to let you know
You're gonna meet again

I'll bet an old castanet that you will never forget Argentina
Where there are rumbas and tangos to tickle your spine
Moonlight and music and orchids and wine
You'll want to stay down Argentina way
