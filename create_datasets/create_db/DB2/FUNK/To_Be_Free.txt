To be free
Or to feel free
The first one is a myth

Yeah to be free
Or to feel free
The first one is a myth

For to be is to feel and to be real is to see

You want more
You say you want me
He left us alone as day was dawning

You got more
Did you get me
Red sleeps after sunrise has fallen

You hard core
You're hard on me
You're dressed up at dawn way before me

Bereft as the sunlight was falling upon me

To be free
or to feel free
The first one is a myth

To be free
or to feel free
The first one is a myth

To be is to feel and to be real is to see

To come is so organic unbelievable
A solitary sign to open up your mind
A love that's so organic unbelievable
A solitary sign to open up your mind

Open up your mind
