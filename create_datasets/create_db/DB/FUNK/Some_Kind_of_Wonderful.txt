Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
Any time my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And every thing seems to be some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
