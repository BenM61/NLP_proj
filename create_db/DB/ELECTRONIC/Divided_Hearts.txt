You're looking through your window
Into the neon light
You trying to forget him
But the feeling keeps you up all night

Flashback flashback flashback
Only come from an abstract mind
I look back
I see you in your frame

I only wish I could climb through
But the wall around it stops me once again
Flashback flashback flashback
Only come from an abstract mind

Divided hearts
Why do they break
We watch them fall to pieces on the ground
Divided hearts

Why do they break
And we are left with our divided hearts
Standing conversation
Down at the Pink Cafe

You tellin' me you got reason
But I can't hear a single word you say
Flashback flashback flashback
Oh the code of the abstract mind

Divided hearts
Why do they break
We watch them fall to pieces on the ground
Divided hearts

Why do they break
And we are left with our divided hearts
