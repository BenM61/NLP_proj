Didn't you know
I was a boy
Before you came

I was a boy
Didn't you know
Before you came

Didn't you know
I was my own
Before you came

I was my own
Didn't you know
Before you came

I was a boy
I was a boy
Before you came

It didn't show
I was a boy
Before you came

I was a boy
It didn't show
Before you came

Yes I was a sire
Before the fire
Before your work

I was a boy
I was a boy
Then I was your girl

Yes I was a sire (I was undiscovered)
Before the fire
Before your work

I was a boy (My best friend was my brother)

I was born a sailor
Dream what I was made of

I was a boy
I was a boy
Before your work

The sea rolled past my shoulder
I ruled land and water
Unlike no one's daughter

I was a boy
I was a boy
Before your work

I was undiscovered
My best friend was my brother

I was a boy
I was a boy
Before your work

I was born a sailor
Dream what I was made of
I was born a soldier
The sea rolled past my shoulder
I ruled land and water
And my best friend was my brother
