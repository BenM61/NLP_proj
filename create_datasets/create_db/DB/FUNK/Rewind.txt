Since that day you're all I think about
Thought you were impossible 'til now
You're with me wherever I wake up
I'll take my chances, I know that I'm falling
I'm best when I'm next to you

'Cause I'm heating up, are you reading my mind
I know that I'm stalling, don't leave me behind
I'm s'till on the run, you don't know where I hide
I'm giving you eyes, but you misread the signs

And I can't rewind, baby
I'll search anywhere for you, and I can't rewind
Baby, don't blink when I'm watching you, and I can't rewind

Watch you from afar, I just can't stop (but I can't stop staring)
Had the words but then they slipped my mind (now I can't remember)
Every time we lock eyes all the lights fade out
I'm getting stage fright, when you walk up to me
Boy, you're over the line

'Cause I'm heating up, are you reading my mind
I know that I'm stalling, don't leave me behind
I'm s'till on the run ,you don't know where I hide
I'm giving you eyes, but you misread the signs

And I can't rewind, baby
I'll search anywhere for you, and I can't rewind
Baby, don't blink when I'm watching you, and I can't rewind

This ain't a mystery, I'm tryin' to keep my cool
You standing next to me, I'm about to break the rules
Turn my head to the right, now I'm looking for you
For the rest of the night
And I can't rewind
For the rest of the night
I can't rewind
Rewind

Baby
I'll search anywhere for you, and I can't rewind
Baby, don't blink when I'm watching you, and I can't rewind

For the rest of the night
And I can't rewind
For the rest of the night
I can't rewind
For the rest of the night
And I can't rewind
Oh, no, no, baby
The rest of the night
I can't rewind
The rest of the night
And I can't rewind
Can't rewind
I can't rewind
Don't blink when I'm watching you
