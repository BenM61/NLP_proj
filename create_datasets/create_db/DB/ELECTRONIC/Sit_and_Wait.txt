A year has come, a year has gone,
Still hanging tough, the blues is going on.
Fingers walk the edge of time,
My heart is burning, I'm ready to fly.

All we can do is to sit and wait,
All we can do is just to sit and wait.
They say: All we can do is to sit and wait,
All we can do, yeah, that's what they say.
Sit and wait, sit and wait, just sit and wait.

I could run away and touch the sun,
Where there's a spark could be a fire.
Impossible dreams? Promises?
Still I ain't nothing, I ain't nowhere.

All we can do is to sit and wait,...
All we can do is to sit and wait,...

All we can do is to sit and wait,...
