Down in the valley, the valley so low,
Late in the evenin', hear the train blow.
Hear the train blow, dear, hear the train blow,
Late in the evenin', hear the train blow.

The train won't stay, love, it goes right through.
It will be gone, love, and so will you!
Know I love you, dear, know I love you,
Angels in heaven know I love you!

The train is gone, love, and out of sight;
Goodnight my darlin', darlin' goodnight!

Goodnight my darlin', darlin' goodnight!
