Can you see the day,
When everyone can say they've got one?
A cloud is moving in,
Blotting out your landmine vision
So many are afraid,
Concealing all their secret weapons
You can see it in their eyes,
Like the brake lights on a highway glisten

Three billion is a lot,
It's impossible to separate them
A career is made and lost,
In sorting out the devastation
What you get you've got,
The rest can be imagination
And what you lose you've lost
Here comes the instant separation

Careful where you step
There may be a mine under there
Careful where you step
There may be a mine under there
