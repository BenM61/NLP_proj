I remember the way 
Our sainted mother 
Would sit and croon us 
Her lullaby 

She'd say, kids, there's a place 
That's like no other 
You got to get there before you die 

You don't get there 
By playing from the rule book 
You stack the ages 
You load the dice 

Mother dear 
Oh, we know you're down there listening 
How can we follow 
Your sweet 
Advice 
To 

Easy street 
Easy street 
Where you sleep till noon 

Yeah, yeah, yeah 

She'd repeat 
Easy street 
Better get there soon. 

Easy street 
Easy street 
Where the rich folks play 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Move them feet 

Move them ever-lovin' feet 
To easy street 
Easy street 
When you get there stay 

It ain't fair 
How we scrounge
For three of four bucks 
While she gets 
Warbucks 

The little brat! 
It ain't fair this here life 
Is drivin' me nuts! 
While we get peanuts 
She's livin' fat! 

Maybe she holds the key 
That little lady 

To gettin' more bucks 

Instead of less 
Maybe we fix the game 
With something shady 

Where does that put us? 
Oh, tell her. 
Yes! 

Easy street 
Easy street 
Annie is the key 
Yes sirree 
Yes sirree 
Yes sirree 
Easy street 
Easy street 
That's where we're gonna
Be!
