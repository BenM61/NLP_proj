When all your hope has gone
And everything you love g gone away 
Whatever gets you through the day 
That's our way
Cause I why sitting on the side 
Watching the tide
Drifting away
Whatever gets you through the day 
That's your way

Cause I don't think I'm brave enough 
To admit I'm breaking up
And when the pain just tears you up 
The only thing you need is love
So just get yourself back on it 
Another day is gonna come 
Keep on praying for it
Aaah 

It's all just people talking
Does it really matter what they say? 
Whatever gets you through the day 
That's your way
Cause I don't care who's right sometimes 
I wish they'd all just go away
Whatever gets you through the day 
That's your way

I think I've been here long enough 
To know what things are really worth 
And I can see through all that stuff 
Cause all you really need is love

So just get yourself back on it 
Another day is gonna come 
Keep on praying for it
Aaah

So just get yourself back on it 
Another day is gonna come
Keep on praying for it
Aaah

Switch yourself back on and 
Get yourself back on it 
Switch yourself back on and 
Get yourself back on it

I think I've been here long enough 
To know what things are really worth 
And I can see through all that stuff
Cause all you really need is love

So just get yourself back on it 
Another day is gonna come 
Keep on praying for it
So just get yourself back on it 
Another day is gonna come 
Keep on praying for it
Aaah 

Whatever gets you through the day
Whatever gets you through the day
Whatever gets you through the day
