She walked out the door
She walked out the door
The china is smashed on the floor
A five-year relationship
Took two to recover from
Tell me how long
Your heart will hold on

You wanted freedom
But now that she's gone
There's no depth to the song
The song that you're singing

Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 

You want what you've not
You want what you've not
Desire never wants what it's got
Desire never stops
The lie of the mind
Thought over feelings
Meaning that feelings denied
No kiss for the bride

Love is a deal that we strike
to conceal that we're blind
To the roll of a dice

Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 
Gone baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone 

Love love love love love
Blah blah blah blah blah
