Baby plea, first time I plea to you
Darlin', now ya got me so upset, baby, because I don't know what-a-do

Don't pull no subway, I rather see you pull a train
Don't pull no subway, I rather see you pull a train
You know I love you, love ya baby, girl, ya know it's a cryin' shame

Feel so bad, baby, feel like my heart's skippin' a beat
Feel so bad, baby, feel like my heart skip a beat
Well now, I'm tellin' you pretty baby, don't you know what you're doin' to me?
