No no need for a baseball bat
Don't need no knife for a sharp attack
No excuses no looking back
We think too much about the things we lack
This neo violence pure self-defiance
This neo violence the tough alliance

I hardly noticed your short romance
Your careless manners and your anxious glance
Kissed and telled got paid in advance
You're far behind now love you missed your chance

This neo violence pure self-defiance
This neo violence the tough alliance

Truly sorry thought you'd get the wink it's in our nature to be out of sync
Truly sorry thought you'd get the wink it's in our nature to be out of sync

This neo violence can't stand the silence this neo violence the tough alliance
