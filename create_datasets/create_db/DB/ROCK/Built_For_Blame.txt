Eyes can only see what they want
When they're open minded to the thought
Of getting hurt again beaten to the bone
With the thought of all your worst events
You said just look (you just look) don't touch
Oh you think you know
It's exactly what you want for love, love
Your heart without a key and just is lock to bleed
This wreck you've made it's all you'll need

This is what it takes to breathe (we're getting up again)
This is what it takes to fake a smile and say
That everything's okay
As long as I take blame

Picture perfect down the drain again and again
I'm really tired of these
Stupid little people knocking you to the ground
You would've never found
The mess you made
I hope it's worth all of the shame

This is what it takes to breathe (we're getting up again)
This is what it takes to fake a smile and say
That everything's okay
As long as I take blame

We sit inside our heads
'cause this is such a curse
We sit inside our heads
'cause nothing ever worked
Nothing ever works

'cause what if this doesn't work
We sit inside our heads
This is such a curse
And it never ever worked

This is what it takes to breathe
This is what it takes to fake a smile and say
That everything's okay
As long as I take blame

This is what it takes to breathe (we're getting up again)
This is what it takes to fake a smile and say
That everything's okay
As long as I take blame.

(guess I'm the one to blame)
