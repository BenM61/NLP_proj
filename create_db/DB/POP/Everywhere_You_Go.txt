I could be a lover like that
Just give me all the things you want now
Tell me the best thing I can do

You say you got a lot of good reasons
I know I told a lot of good lies now
I could lose everything for you

So if you fall asleep and gotta wake up
Say that is so
I'll be the one to tear you away from here

Everywhere you go I'll come running
Everywhere you go I will bring you around
Everywhere you go I will come to you
But I won't bring you down

Fly a little, take a long drive
We can be whatever we want now
Won't be the same here without you

So if you can leave a little later
Stay here awhile
I could take all there fears away from you

Everywhere you go I'll come running
Everywhere you go I will bring you around
Everywhere you go I will come to you
But I won't bring you down

All the tears you cry as the miles roll by
I'll be reaching out to hold you
There is nothing else that I won't do for you

Everywhere you go
I will come to you
But I won't bring you down
