Every day, when day's done
I say so long to the rising sun
Then I send my prayers
Then I sit in my rocking chair

Then I rock myself to sleep
Prayin' that I am here to keep
Then I ride the rising sun
Gee ain't I being a lucky one

Every day, when day's done
I say so long to the rising sun
Then I send my prayers
Then I sit in my rocking chair

Then I rock myself to sleep
Prayin' that I am here to keep
Then I ride the rising sun
Gee ain't I being a lucky one
