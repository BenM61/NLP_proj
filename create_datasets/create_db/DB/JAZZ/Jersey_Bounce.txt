They call it that Jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Wherever they play, the funny rhythm they play

It started on Journal Square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
And now you hear it everywhere

Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, makes it sound, the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The Jersey bounce'll make you swing

How I love that Jersey bounce

Oh come on and play that Jersey bounce

They call it that Jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Whenever they play that Jersey Bounce

It started on Journal Square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
That tune called the Jersey Bounce

Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, make it sound the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The Jersey bounce'll make you swing

Ounce by ounce
The Jersey Bounce
Puts you right in the swing
That Jersey Bounce 
It'll make you swing

Give me that Jersey Bounce.
