Time waits for no one, sure as the tide pulls the ocean 
Sure as the path that's been chosen cannot be changed 
In my life's destination, I searched for the explanation 
For some kind of reason for my sorrow and pain 
But in my isolation, I learned to listen 
To be thankful for the love that I'd been given 

This is my journey, journey through life 
With every twist and turn, I've laughed and cried as the road unwinds 
This is my journey, and I've learned to fight 
To make me strong enough, to lift me up, to bring my dreams alive 
In my desperation, I swore never again 
Would I hear all the laughter of my friends and my family 
A million tears that I'd cry then began to dry 
Silence of the night time 
I have come to realize a sweet inspiration filled my horizon 
Gave me the heart to go on and never would give in 

I'm going to love each moment of every day and every night 
I'll look back to the past with the sweetest smile 
For now, I realize I've been given the key to life 
I've been kissed by the angel by my side 
Oh, yeah 

To bring my dreams alive 
To bring my dreams alive
