I made my reservation, I'm leaving town tomorrow
I'll find somebody new and there'll be no more sorrow
That's what I do each time, but I can't follow through
I can't breakaway, though you make me cry
I can't breakaway, I can't say goodbye
No I'll never never breakaway from you, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

I'll make that vow to myself, you and I are through
Nothing can change my mind; I'm sorry won't do
That's what I'll say each time, but I can't follow through
I can't breakaway, though you make me cry
I can't breakaway, I can't say goodbye
No I'll never never breakaway from you, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

Even though you treat me bad and many cruel words are spoken
You have got a spell on me that just can't be broken, no, no

I'll take your picture down and throw it away
There'll be no baby now, for you to call each day
That's what I'll say each time, but I can't follow through
I can't breakaway, though you make me cry
I can't breakaway, I can't say goodbye
No I'll never never breakaway from you, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

I can't breakaway, though you make me cry
I can't breakaway, I can't say goodbye
No I'll never never breakaway from you, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

I can't breakaway, I can't breakaway, I can't breakaway
