You are jesus, son of god, son of man
I call you savior, with nail scarred hands
You will be my sun in the morning light
Bringing redemption to my dark night

Beautiful surrender is where I wanna be
Locked into your arms, for all eternity
Come and take my hand, you can lead me where you please
That beautiful surrender is chasing after me

I am beloved, full of faith, standing tall 
Confident and brrave, ready to fall
Into your light, you are the voice that call
With no reservation, I surrender all

I surrender all my heart and soul to you my love
