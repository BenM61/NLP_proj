Here I am Lord, One more time Lord
Cold and hungry at your door
I am empty, I am broken
Take me in Lord, just once more

I'm a sailor, I'm a drifter
I have wandered the whole world through
But no matter where I go Lord,
Every road leads back to you

I've been searching on the mountain, 
Cross the ocean deep and wide 
oh but now I found my answer
It was you, Lord, all the time

I'm a sailor, I'm a drifter
And I have wandered the whole world through
But no matter where I go Lord,
Every road leads back to you
Every road leads back to you
