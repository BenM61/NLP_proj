Like who the f*ck are you 
Yeah who the f*ck are you 
Is it recordin' yeh? 

I come direct when I inject and I'm expecting your respect 
I'm a baller you've been chucked I'm the kind of kid you can't protect ya know 
Out n about I put my elbow in your mouth 
You're a fassy there's no doubt 
I bet my sword will make you shout 
I'm intense you best see sense I'll have you hangin' from a fence 
Then I'll laugh at your expense and maybe chuck you 50 pence 
Snitch you make me switch you sound and look just like a bitch 
Whether you're poor or whether you're rich I'll leave you lyin' in the ditch 
Cause I'm from ragged raggo rags you wear raggo rags like me 
I'm ahead boy I ain't in tune rappin' raggo rapidly 
We easily be the worst bust academics first 
Batty crew m.c's get academically reversed 
I'm academically perverse 
Academically perverted 
Batty crew mc's get academically diverted 
Some return 
We clearly get burnt get hurt, until they realize they should academically of flirted 

You don't want the beef you don't want the grime 
You ain't got the guts I ain't got the time 
But you can come to the man and get jacked 
Come to the man n get pill 
Come to the man n get shot 
Come to the man n get killed 
We call it armsouse, armsouse go n get your crew 
If you can't back that armsouse who the f*ck are you 
We call it armsouse, armsouse go n get your firm 
If they don't want to listen then we better make em learn

Raised in the gutter I was told I should fight 
I create and cause confusion from the left to the right 
I'm sweet as a nut, I'm doin' alright, cosy n comfortable 
Still I try n avoid the sergeant, p.c and the constable 
Raised in the gutter I was told I should bop 
I create and cause confusion from the bottom to the top 
I doin' o.k, I will honestly say this year I'm flyin' through 
I could easily find myself in jail but I ain't tryin' to 
I keep it clear in front, relax wid the pressure, 
I'm dirty, and I'm stank but ain't nobody fresher 
My haters make enquiries, make it obvious they care 
When it comes to my location they would love to be aware 
But I could be in the manor, could be overseas, could well be definiteley making peace 
Could be live at Wembley warmin' up for jay-z 
Still I'm definitely certain that you can't see me 

You don't want the beef you don't want the grime 
You ain't got the guts I ain't got the time 
But you can come to the man and get jakked 
Come to the man n get pill 
Come to the man n get shot 
Come to the man n get killed 
We call it armsouse, armsouse go n get your crew 
If you can't back that armsouse who the f*ck are you 
We call it armsouse, armsouse go n get your firm 
If they don't want to listen then you better make em learn
