Go

How many years have we waited
For a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted
Chasing a love that was not our own?

I sat ashore and watched as one
Hopeless wave crashed upon another
While my thoughts ran to the hills
My heart never, never reached the sea

With only delusions
Of an endless, endless journey
I am left with an ocean
Between you and me

An ocean between

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone else's dream, yeah

The gate to my heart
Has been well shut
With the splendor of
My aspirations closed in

How many years have we waited
For a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted
Chasing a love that was not our own?

Is this your salvation?

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone else's dream

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone else's dream

How many years?

How many years have we waited
For a ship that never, never set sail?
And how many days have we wasted
For a ship that never, never set sail?

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone else's dream

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone else's dream
