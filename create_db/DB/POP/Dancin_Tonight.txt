Don't waste time, it's now or never
The girl won't stay at home forever
It's time you treat her right
The lady wants to got out

Dancin' tonight, under the lights
You'd better romance her tonight, 
She wants to go dancin'

So don't be late, that moon is rising
All that neon's hypnotizin'
Don't wait around too long
She'll find someone to take her

Dancin' tonight, under the lights
You'd better romance her tonight, 
She wants to go dancin'

She takes you someplace 
Where the blues don't last
And colors change beneath the floor
She tells the band to play her something fast
She's holding out her hand
Don't blow your only chance to take her

Dancin' tonight, under the lights
You'd better romance her tonight, 
She wants to go dancin'
