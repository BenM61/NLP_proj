I've done nothing wrong
I am not that strong
I've done nothing wrong to you

Only the weak defend me
Only the weak pretend that

You didn't waste all that time
To just leave forever
You couldn't say you had all
You want only better

I tried making sense
I've got no defense
I lost all pretense for you

And only the loved believe me
And only the pure can't see that

You didn't waste all that time
To just leave forever
You couldn't say you had all
You want only better

And who would you say
Looks behind today?
And who would you say
Just looked the other way?

'Cause you didn't waste all that time
To just leave forever
You couldn't say you had all
You want only better

You didn't waste all that time
To just leave forever
You couldn't say you had all
Only the weak pretend that

You
And only the loved believe me
And only the pure can't see that

You didn't waste all that time
To just leave forever
You couldn't say you had all
And only the weak pretend that

You didn't waste all that time
To just leave forever
You couldn't say you had all
And only the weak pretend that
