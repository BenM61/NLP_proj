My mama told me when I was quite young
Don't be a bad boy and don't run
'Cause he's gonna get you
He's gonna get you

So little girl that's why I'm tellin' you
Don't you dare break my heart in two
Or he's gonna get you
He's gonna get you (Sing)

The boogie man is gonna get you
If you're messin' around in the dark
Playin' with my love and affection
That ain't smart, no that ain't smart, oh

So little girl that's why I'm tellin' you
Take my love, take my money
But don't you dare break my heart in two
Or he's gonna get you (He's gonna get you)
He's gonna get you (He's gonna get you) Sing

The boogie man is gonna get you
If you're messin' around in the dark
Playin' with my love and affection
That ain't smart, no that ain't smart, oh

Look out, look out, here he comes, there he is, run
The Boogie Man will get ya
The Boogie Man will get ya
The Boogie Man is gonna get ya (If you're a bad girl)
The Boogie Man is gonna get ya (Don't make me sad girl, oh)
Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes, here he comes, who

The Boogie Man is gonna get you
If you're messin' around in the dark
Playin' with my love and affection
That ain't smart, no that ain't smart, oh

The Boogie Man is gonna get you ( I'm crazy about you baby)
If you're messin' around in the dark (I'm crazy 'bout your love)
Playin' with my love and affection
That ain't smart, no that ain't smart, oh
