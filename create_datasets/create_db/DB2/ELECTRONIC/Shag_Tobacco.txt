I have ordinary addictions 
I've outgrown the ways of the street and the nightshade 
Hey! goodnight ladies... ladies bye bye. 

I work odd hours, get home late most nights 
She's upstairs, I'm downstairs, 
Drinking coffee in the kitchen 
Spoon in the sugar, knife in the butter... I want you. 

Do you love me? Say you do, I'd like to see you undress 
Let the light shimmer down, I've ordinary addictions 
Whisper soft into my ear, secret words heaven sent 
So you can read my mind 

Hush dear... the night is always young 
There's no day here, tomorrow never comes 
Let colours fly, we're safe from harm 
See orange glow, let our love flow 

No Romeo no Juliet, 
What we got is deeper than that 
Lets stay in bed, watch t.v. and shag tobacco 
I want you, I want you... 

You're my amphetamine you're my lover... 
And there's no other... ...there's no other... there's no other
