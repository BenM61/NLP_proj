Catch me baby, I'm about to cry
Got no lovin' of any kind
Catch me baby, don't let me fall
Without your love I'd lose my mind

Catch me baby, don't let me down
Down to the ground, don't leave me alone
Catch me baby, don't turn away
Come on and say that you really care

We just gotta get it together
If it's the last thing we ever do
We just gotta get it together
Cause I need you, yes I do

Love me baby, kiss me well
Can't you tell what I've been going through
Love me baby, don't leave me behind again
There's time to mend the love that we once knew

We just gotta get it together
If it's the last thing we ever do
We just gotta get it together
Cause I need you, yes I do
