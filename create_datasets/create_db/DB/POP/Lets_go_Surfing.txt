Wake up
It's a beautiful morning
Honey, while the sun is still shining
Wake up
Would you like to go with me?
Honey, take a run down to the beach

Oh, mama
I wanna go surfing
Oh, mama
I don't care about nothing

Wake up
There's a new kid in the town
Honey, he's moving into the big house
Remember
When I was so very hopeless
Darling, he's gonna make it all better

Oh, mama
I wanna go surfing
Oh, mama
I don't care about nothing

Down, down baby
Down by the rollercoaster
Sweet, sweet baby
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

Oh, mama
I wanna go surfing
Oh, mama
I don't care about nothing

Oh, mama
I wanna go surfing
Oh, mama
I don't care about nothing
