Everything I have is yours,
You're a part of me.
Everything I have is yours,
My destiny.
I would gladly give the sun to you,
If the sun were only mine.
I would gladly give the earth to you,
And the stars that shine.

Everything that I possess I offer you,
let my dream of happiness come true.
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call;
Everything I have is yours,
My life, my all!

The more I'm with you, the more I can see
My love is yours alone.
You came and captured a heart that was free,
Now I've nothing left I call my own!

Everything I have is yours,
For you're a part of me.
Everything I have is yours,
My destiny.
I would gladly give the sun to you,
If the sun were only mine.
I would gladly give the earth to you,
And the stars that shine.

Everything that I possess I offer you,
let my dream of happiness come true.
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call;
Everything I have is yours,
My life, my all!
