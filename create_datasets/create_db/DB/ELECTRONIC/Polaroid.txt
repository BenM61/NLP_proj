Let me tell you how it happened
I wasn't looking for someone that night
No, I was never a believer
But you could fall in love with the first sight

But all of a sudden
We loved and got lost in the moment
All of a sudden
She's gone in the flash of a light
I never was looking, hmm
I'll be looking for the rest of my life

We took a polaroid
You signed your name up on it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it stops fading

Was it my imagination?
I could've swore I saw someone like you
A thousand people at the station
And it's like I used to doubt of you

Then all of a sudden
I loved and got lost in the moment
All of a sudden
She's gone in the flick of a light
I never was looking, hmm
I've been looking for the rest of my life

We took a polaroid
You signed your name up on it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'll see your face again
We took a polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it stops fadin'

We were dancing without moving
All my friends are leaving me behind
I didn't wanna catch a feeling
There was something in the flashin' light

Then all of a sudden
I loved and got lost in the moment
All of a sudden
She's gone in the flick of a light
I never was looking, hmm
I've been looking for the rest of my life

We took a polaroid
You signed your name up on it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it stops fading

We took a polaroid
You signed your name up on it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
