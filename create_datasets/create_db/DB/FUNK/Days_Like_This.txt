I've been here before, baby, knowing that I'm in love
And I admit I wanna say that you're the one
(You're the one)
Sometimes I let my fears over rule my common sense
Instead of loving you, I was running away
(Running away)

You're the only, the one that my walls won't hold
And I'm open even though I, I can be so cold
And it's really not, not at all about anything that you do
It's even hard for me to understand
It's something I just go through

I knew that there would be days like this
When I wanna let go
Feeling like a man over my head
But I won't let the days like this
Change my feelings for you
Cause I can't forget everything we had

I apologize for the changes I put you through
My intent did not include hurting you
(Hurting you)
But insecurities had a way of taking over me
And telling me that any excuse would do
(Just would do)

See I need ya, your heartbeat right next to mine
Cause I know that we'll get through this, it just takes sometime
Baby don't say a single word, put you arms around me
This is the time that I love you the most
But I gotta win this war inside of me, oh

I knew that there would be days like this
When I wanna let go
Feeling like a man over my head
But I won't let the days like this
Change my feelings for you
Cause I can't forget everything we had

I knew that there would be days like this
When I wanna let go
Feeling like a man over my head
But I won't let the days like this
Change my feelings for you
Cause I can't forget everything we had

I knew that there would be days like this
When I wanna let go
Feeling like a man over my head
But I won't let the days like this
Change my feelings for you
Cause I can't forget everything we had

I knew that there would be a day like this
(Days like this)
I knew that there would be a day like this
I knew that there would be a day like this
(Days like this)
I knew that there would be a day like this
