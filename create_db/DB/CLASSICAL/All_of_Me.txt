The first day that I met you
I think I always knew
That you were meant to be the one
And then the feeling grew
With God and friends my witness
Our love will never die
I take the gift you gave me
Don't need to question why

For all the faults I'm made of
For all the wrongs I do
I'm not asking you to judge me
Just be true

All of me
Is what I give to you
And everything I have
I wanna share with you
And with this ring
For all eternity
I make this vow
When I give you all of me

This life is short and precious
A one way ticket ride
I thank you for the journey
I know you're on my side
And we are only here once
I'm glad we shared this day
Of knowing something special
That will never go away

For all the faults I'm made of
And all the wrongs I do
I'm not asking you to judge me
Just be true

All of me
Is what I give to you
And everything I have
I wanna share with you
And with this ring
For all eternity
I make this vow
When I give you all of me

All of me
That's what I give to you
And everything I have
I'm gonna share with you, yeah
And with this ring
I give for all eternity
My love
I make this vow

All of me
Is what I give to you
And everything I have
I wanna share with you
And with this ring
For all eternity
I make this vow
When I give you all of me
I give you all of me
