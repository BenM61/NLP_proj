Sit'n round wondering just what the hell to do with your life
Only get one chance but you seem to always think twice
And I'm getting so tired of trying to always be nice
You're sweet and sincere, but so ruled by fear

What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
Cause I can't
Well I can't

I don't quite feel like faking it again tonight
Don't really feel like saying everything is alright
You're sweet and sincere, but so ruled by fear

What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
Well I can't
Well I can't

Go on do it
If you really, really mean it
Oh don't just hold back then regret it
You're sweet and sincere, but so ruled by fear

What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
Well I can't
Well I can't
