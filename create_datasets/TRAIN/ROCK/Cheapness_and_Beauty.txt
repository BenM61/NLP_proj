This is a real addiction, confusion and cheap tattoos
A princess, a car thief, and a lost shoe
Lonliness, laughter, lust, the promise of pain
Judas in blue jeans tell me your name

Eyes across the room, unspoken
Eyes, glitter promise
Cheapness and beauty
Trickery and lies
Cheapness and beauty
Oh I'm so weak sometimes

Glue for the broken toy, the wings for the saint
A buddah, a false god, and some war paint
Wasting your wisdom, yes, but who can you trust
Love holds a mirror up to all of us

Eyes across the room, unspoken
Eyes, glitter promise
Cheapness and beauty
Trickery and lies
Cheapness and beauty
Oh I'm weak sometimes

It's much too late to say goodbye
Despite all good advice
This pain is such a part of me
I won't apologize

For running to your rescue
Though you slap me in the face
It doesn't really matter
'Cause we always fall in love again

Cheapness and beauty
Trickery and lies
Cheapness and beauty
Oh I'm so weak sometimes

Cheapness and beauty
Trickery and lies
Cheapness
I won't apologise

Cheapness and beauty
I see it in your eyes
Cheapness and beauty
Oh I'm so weak sometimes
