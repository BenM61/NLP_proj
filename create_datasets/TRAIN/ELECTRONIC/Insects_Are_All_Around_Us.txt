insects are all around us
they produce many sounds 
at many frequencies and volume levels
we are so accustumed to hearing 
that we seldom listen to them
crickets produce their chirps by rubbing their wings together
rough spots on the crickets wings produce the chirping vibrations which we hear
the cricit is highly sensitive to temperture
infact we can tell the temperature by crickets
count the number of chirps in 15 second and add fourty
the results are very close to a ferinheight thermometer
