People talkin', tryin' to break us up 
Why won't they let me be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words don't bother me

I've been abused in my heart 
I've been abused, I've been abused in my heart
People talkin', tryin' to break us up
They know I love you so

I don't care what the people may say 
I'll never never let you go
I've been abused in my heart
I've been abused yeah I've been abused in my heart

Oh people talkin', tryin' to break us up
Scandalizin' my name
Say anything to make me feel bad yes
Anything to make me shame

I've been abused in my heart 
I've been abused yeah, I've been abused in my heart
I've been abused, I've been abused, I said I've been abused

Honey you make me feel bad and you make me feel so bad
But I'm gonna love you 
Bay in the middle of the night
Make you feel alright

Just stick with ol' Jerry Lee, baby, you know what I mean
Honey you know I won't treat you wrong 
Brrr, oh yeah, brrrr, come on baby
