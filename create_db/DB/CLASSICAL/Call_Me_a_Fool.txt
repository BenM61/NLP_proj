Call me fool 
Thrill me or taunt me 
I'll be where you want me
Call me fool

Call me fool 
Go with a new love
Come back when your through love
Call me fool

Don't be afraid to parade this slave you have made
Give the world a laugh
Wise men say all or nothing at all
But fools are happy with half

Call me fool 
Take what I give you
I'll love and forgive you
Long as you call me into your arms
Call me fool

musical interlude
Don't be afraid to parade this slave you have made
Give the world a laugh
Wise men say all or nothing at all
But fools are happy with half

Call me fool 
Take what I give you
I'll love and forgive you
Long as you call me into your arms
Call me fool
