Emotions, what are you doin'?
Oh, don't you know, don't you know you'll be my ruin?
You've got me crying, crying again
When will you let this heartache end?

Emotions, you get me upset
Why make me remember what I want to forget?
I've been lonely, lonely too long
Emotions, please leave me alone

You worry my days, yes, you torture my nights
Never a dream, no, those dreams never turn out right

Emotions, ah, give me a break
Let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh, can't you see what you're doin' to me?
Emotions, please set me free

You worry my days, oh, you torture my nights
Never a dream, no, those dreams never turn out right

Emotions, ah, give me a break
Oh, let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh, can't you see what you're doing to me?
Emotions (ah, ah, ah) please set me free
