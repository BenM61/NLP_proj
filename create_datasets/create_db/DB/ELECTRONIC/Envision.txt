I don't know what more to say
Hey you what's the delay inside
'Cause I just can't envision it

You pretend people can see
Who you are, claim to be inside
But you just can't envision it

All my friends say he's a fool
And promise that you're cool inside
But you just can't envision it

Maybe one day you'll be brave
And trust your life and save
till then you just can't envision it

Can't envision it
Can't envision it

How do you see this would play
In your mind are you strayed inside
If you just can't envision it

Don't you realize the truth
Instead of lies is mute and cry
But you just can't envision it

If love is such a game than
Hate yourself is such a shame
And you deprive
Can't you just envision this

Maybe one day you'll be brave
And trust your life and save
till then you just can't envision it

Can't envision it
Can't envision it
