A walk in the park
This happens when something's up
And stays till dark
She's writing cathedral park
But the words are lame
Like her life
And then she says
When you said there's something wrong
It seemed like I'm living without you
Of all the ways to hit me
Of all the things to say
A night at the bar
This happens when she's alone
Three pints too far
He's a bar-fly in lonely town
She sees him off
He's useless
And then he says
When you said there's something wrong
It seemed like I'm living without you
Of all the ways to hit me
Of all the things to say
When you said there's something wrong
It seemed like I'm living without you
Of all the ways to hit me
Of all the things to say
