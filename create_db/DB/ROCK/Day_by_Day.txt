Day by day, look what the papers say 
Day by day, look what the papers say 
Stranded in the jungle 
Trapped inside the tube 
(You) hate your next door neighbor 
'cause he's got more than you 
Going round and round, day by day 
On the circle line 
Round and round 

Day by day, it's all work no play 
Day by day, it's all work no play 
Living for inflation 
I know I never win 
Just to earn a living 
They keep me locked in 

Day by day, who cares anyway 
Day by day, who cares anyway 
I feel like a robot 
On the production line 
Ain't got no tomorrow 
On the circle line 
Going round and round, day by day 
On the circle line 
Round and round 
Round and round 
Day by day 
Day by day
