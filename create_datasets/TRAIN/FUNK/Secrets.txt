You've got changing faces
That never leave a clue
Two of those hiding faces
Locked inside of you
We made love so cruel
You go running off in the night
To keep things undercover
But I saw her in the light
And I discovered your

Secrets
(Secrets)
In your heart
You'll hear 'em knocking at your door
(Secrets)
Secrets in the dark
Will come on creeping
(Secrets)

Oh, there is no escape, don't you know
She'll come back to haunt you
And she will seal your fate
As my memory will taunt you
Your mysterious exhibitions
I couldn't figure out before
And then I felt her kiss upon you
She was the key that unlocked the door
Into the world of your

Secrets
(Secrets)
In your heart
You'll hear 'em knocking at your door
(Secrets)
Secrets in the dark
Will come on creeping
(Secrets)

Secrets in your heart
She'll come on knock, knocking for more
(Secrets)
Secrets in the dark (who who who)
Voices in the dark cry out your
Secrets

I wouldn't find out your

Secrets
(Secrets)
In your heart
You'll hear 'em knocking at your door
(Secrets)
Secrets in the dark
Will come on creeping
(Secrets)
