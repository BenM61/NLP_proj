I got to keep movin', I got to keep movin'
Blues fallin' down like hail, blues fallin' down like hail
Hmmm-mmm, blues fallin' down like hail, blues fallin' down like hail

And the days keeps on worryin' me
There's a hellhound on my trail, hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail

If today was Christmas Eve, if today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day
If today was Christmas Eve, and tomorrow was Christmas Day
Aw, wouldn't we have a time, baby?

All I would need my little sweet rider just
To pass the time away, huh-huh
To pass the time away

You sprinkled hot foot powder, mmm
Mmm, around my door, all around my door
You sprinkled hot foot powder
All around your daddy's door, hmm-hmm-hmm

It keep me with ramblin' mind, rider
Every old place I go, every old place I go

I can tell the wind is risin', the leaves tremblin' on the tree
Tremblin' on the tree
I can tell the wind is risin', leaves tremblin' on the tree
Hmm-hmm hmm-mmm

All I need's my little sweet woman
And to keep my company, hey, hey, hey
My company
