One for the money and two for the show
Three for the busker who plays by the road
They say life's a bitch, and then you die
And if wishes were fishes then all pigs would fly
But there's always a busker, so hey busker I...

Well I once did a solo for Elton John
He was stopped on my corner so I played him a song
And for seven whole seconds he looked in my eye
Then the lights turned to green and he left with a smile
And we both thought but there, but for God's grace go I...

I once shared a band with a girl named Lee
We were singers and lovers in close harmony
Ah, but this thing called fame creeps up so secretly
And one day when I got home early for tea
There was no video and no colour TV
And a big empty bed where my Lee used to be

Ah, but thousands of people march to my songs
Some just ignore me and shuffle alo-ong
Some others tip me, hah, and sometimes they sing right along...

One for the money, two for the show
Three for the busker who plays by the road
Well, I ain't got no boss and I ain't got no plans
Except what I play, hah, and perhaps where I stand
And if you listen real close I can sound like a whole - damn - band
Take it away

Well, the bright side is I can still work anywhere
'Cause Springstein and I have the same crowds each day
Guess the only real difference is how much they pay...
It's OK then

It's one for the money, two for the show
Three for the busker who plays by the road
They say life's a bitch, and then you die
And if wishes were fishes then all pigs would fly
But there's always the busker, so hey busker I...
