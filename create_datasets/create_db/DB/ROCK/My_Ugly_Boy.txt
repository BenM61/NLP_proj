Lost in time I can't count the words
I said when I thought they went unheard
All of those harsh thoughts so unkind
'Cause I wanted you

And now I sit here I'm all alone
So here sits a bloody mess, tears fly home
A circle of angels, deep in war
'Cause I wanted you

Weak as I am, no tears for you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Deep as I am, I'm no ones fool
Weak as I am

So what am I now I'm love last home
I'm all of the soft words I once owned
If I opened my he heart, there'd be no space for air
'Cause I wanted you

Weak as I am, no tears for you
Weak as I am, no tears for you
Deep as I am, I'm no ones fool
Weak as I am

In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?

In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?

In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you?

Weak as I am
Weak as I am
Weak as I am
Weak as I am, am, am

Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you?
Weak as I am, yeah!
