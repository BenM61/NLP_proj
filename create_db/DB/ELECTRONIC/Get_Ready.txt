Get down with the style
House on the ground, please when I squeeze
Pump to your knees. You must have bet I'm in here to stay,
Ready to take you around the way.
So get ready for this, mind your own biz
Cause I'm bad, yeah, with the microphone biz
No need to sit, cause we're 2 Unlimited
Ready, ready, ready for this!

Feel the base, you just get closer
Be impressed by the words I chose of
Once again kickin' it live, doin' 
everything yo just to survive
Above the law, I take our stand
Being on stage with a mic in my hand
Bustin' it loud to the crowd
The age is 20, I'm from the south!

Be a part, break my heart
Get ready for this, mind your own biz
People in the front, show me what you want
and I won't give it in get ready for this!
We're 2 Unlimited, so people won't you sit?
Movin' up and down, dancin' on the ground.
Feelin' kinda free, security
House is style that moves you from the ground.

House on the ground, bass in your face
Racin' the place, no time to waste
Feelin' hypnotised, I can see it in your eyes
Feelin' kinda better, put on your sweater.
Feelin' like a white, I think it doesn't matter
Super, dope, def, and even outrageous
If I was an animal, they'dve kept me in cages
So get ready for this! Ya'll ready for this?

Step back, relax. Don't you wanna come in?
When I start rappin' the girlies wanna come in.
Into my house, into my room
That'sthe part where it goes "boom! boom!".
Name here is Ray, the group is 2 Unlimited
We've got a lot to say, to you, ah yeah and your other crew
If it is a dream, boom see boom!
