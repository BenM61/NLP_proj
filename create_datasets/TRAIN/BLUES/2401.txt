There's a hero living at 2401 and all around
A family circus in the sun
Got his Mothers working
While you're having fun

Trying to change the system
Many things that must be done
Where did Moon go?
Better call at GTO

In the red room
Pam is planning where to go
Gail and Pauline
Who is prowling round your door?

A maniac, The Raven
Could he have his gun back?
No! 2401, got myself a place to stay
On the railroad, Kansas nearer every day

Miss Christine cooking
Looking very gay
How do you say a Thank You?
How do you ever tear yourself away?
