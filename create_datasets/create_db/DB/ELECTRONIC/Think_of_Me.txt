I'm getting tired of waitin' around
I feel like I'm always trackin' you down
I don't want to point my finger at you
But there's something you're forgettin'
Here's what you better do, you better

Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone
And then you'll
Think of me

You walk in and you see me cryin'
You apologize say you lost track of time
I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're gonna lose me too if you don't
Know what's good for you

Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone
And then you'll
Think of me

Tell me what I did to you to make you
Treat me so badly
If you want to see me anymore
If you don't want to see me walking out the door, you better

Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone
And then you'll
Think of me

You better think of me
Think, think, think of me
You know you're driving me crazy
You better, you better, you better think of me, oh yeah

Stop wastin' all my time
You know it could have been so fine
Hey boy I'm waitin' on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else
Stop thinking of yourself

You better think of me
I know you want to baby
You know you're driving me crazy
Think, think, think of me
You better think of me
Think, think, think of me

Stop wastin' all my time
You know it could have been so fine
You better, you better

You better think of me
I know you want to baby
You know you're driving me crazy
Think of me
You better, you better, you better think of me
Stop wastin' all my time
You know it could have been so fine
Hey boy I'm waitin' on a sign
