Let the tears dry and bring back your smile,
Hear the mountains cry.
The tears will grow where you laid your tears,
Rivers will flow, rivers will flow,
Flow where you rest your fears.

A soul has fled when the blood was shed,
A soul that cared for life so deeply.
The memory will grow in us
And make you and I a family.
