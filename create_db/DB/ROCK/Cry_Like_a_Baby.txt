Well I never lived through the great depression
Sometimes I feel as though I did
And I don't have answers for every single question
But that's OK 'cos I'm just a kid

Well I've seen pictures of my mother
When she looked exactly like me
And I've seen all my friends running for cover
Running from something they can't see

And it's not easy to get handle on my life
But I have tried it time and time again

But I still cry just like a baby
And I answer back to feel a little free
And I still fly even though I'm gonna fall
But I'm too far to let it get to me

Well I'm not much like my generation
Their music only hurts my ears
And I don't hide my pain to save my reputation
It's too hard to keep up with these years

And it's not easy to a habit disappear
But I have tried it time and time again
