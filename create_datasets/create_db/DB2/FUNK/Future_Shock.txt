Future shock
Ooh, hoo

Hey, little sister
Where's your brother
See your mother
Standing on the soup line

God bless your father
Ain't got the strength
To be bothered

The almighty world
Hear me now
Whisper on
To weigh him down

We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock

Future shock, future shock

All worldly figures
Playing on niggers
Oh, see them passing
See how they're dancing
To the superfly

Oh, ain't it wrong
When you don't know
Where we come from

Dancing in our youth
Dying at the truth
It ain't over
(Over, over, ain't over)

We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock

Future shock, future shock

The price of the beat
Higher than the dope in the street
Is it any wonder
For those with nothing to eat

We got to stop all men
From messing up the land
When won't we understand
This is our last and only chance
Everybody, it's a future shock
Future shock, future shock

Future shock, future shock
