If you leave my dream
Will you turn out the light
So my eyes won't see
That my fantasy is escaping me for reality

Shall I tell her that she's the spring arriving on wings
Shall I tell her that I hear our hearts our whispering
And the words I overhear as you draw near

What shall I do?
If you won't run away with me forever
What shall I do?

What shall I do?
The only thing that time will change
Is whether, I can retrieve my heart if you leave

When I kissed your lips
It's as if I've been hit by a melody
There have been no regrets
Though I've placed all my bets on your memory

Shall I tell her that she's the glow, that my heaven knows
Shall I tell her that she's the gleam that powers my dream
And by the flame that floats between our eyes I realize

What shall I do?
If you won't run away with me forever
What shall I do?

What shall I do?
The only thing that time will change
Is whether I can be seen with you in my dream

As the sunset fades
And with moonlight trades
Tender harmonies

Shall I tell her that I can see, the woman she'll be
Shall I tell her that I'm now alive instead of surviving
'Cause if I lay with her, I stay with her

What shall I do?
If you won't run away with me forever
What shall I do?

What shall I do?
The only thing that time will change
Is whether I can retrieve my heart if you leave
