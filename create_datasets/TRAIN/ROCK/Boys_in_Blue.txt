Police sirens break the air
They're on their way
Riots break out on the streets
Someone's got to pay

Why has it got to this
Why can't they realise
Someone's going to die
They're after you

Boys in blue
Boys in blue
Running after you
Police vans screech to halt

Out jump the law
Chasing youths down the street
Beat them with a stick
You resist they hit you more

What can you do
Dragged away into their van
So they can bully you
They're after you

Boys in blue
Boys in blue
Running after you
No one's left on the streets

It's quietened down
The problems still exist
Solutions must be found
Tension in the cities

It's running high
It's going to explode soon
You're all about to die
They're after you

Boys in blue
Boys in blue
Running after you
The government's not interested

They don't care at all
They think that jailing you
It's the problem solved
My time in prison i resent them more

Why cant they face the facts
That their policies are wrong
