Worried, you betcha
Discouraged, I don't know
Every time I see a 1040
Out of my pocket it goes

Ow, I hate taxes

I work hard for my money
Every April you take it all away
Don't you know I work hard for my money
Every day, people
You take it all away from me

Ow, ow, I hate taxes

Taxes gonna break my back, I swear
Don't you know I pay a lot more than my share?
I hate taxes

Can't have any fun anymore
Gotta make plans for everything now
Gotta plan for every thing I do, people
Can't go out and have a real good time
Now I've gotta worry about everything
That my little money can buy

Oh, ow, I hate taxes

Taxes gonna break my back, I swear
Don't you know I paid a lot more than my share?
I hate taxes

You know I'm thinkin' about movin' somewhere else
But I can't because I love America too much
Especially California, yeah
I guess I'm gonna have to pay these taxes
If I'm gonna live here, oh
