Is there a light?
You have inside you
Can't touch

A looking glass
Can only show you
So much

Follow the signs
Slowly but steady
Don't rush

The day will come
When you are ready
Just trust

Dancing on the astral plane
Holy water, cleansing rain
Floating through the stratosphere
Blind, but yet you see so clear

Is there a way?
For you to shine
Without fear

From other worlds
But you can't say
What keeps you here

Dancing on the astral plane
Holy water, cleansing rain
Floating through the stratosphere
Blind, but yet you see so clear

Dancing on the astral plane
Holy water, cleansing rain
Floating through the stratosphere

Blind, but yet you see so clear
Blind, but yet you see
Blind, but yet you see
Blind, but yet you see
Blind, but yet you see so clear

Is there a way?
For you to give it
Your all

Dreaming a dream
Of sweeter things great or small

Dancing on the astral plane
Holy water, cleansing rain
Floating through the stratosphere
Blind, but yet you see so clear

Dancing on the astral plane
Holy water, cleansing rain
Floating through the stratosphere
Blind, but yet you see so clear

Dancing on the astral plane
Holy water, cleansing rain
Floating through the stratosphere

Blind, but yet you see so clear
Blind, but yet you see
Blind, but yet you see
Blind, but yet you see
Blind, but yet you see so clear

There is a light
You have inside you
Can touch
