[Repeat: x4]
I've seen this pumped thing electric,

[Repeat: x4]
Do it again,

[Chorus: x4]
Oh my God what have I done,
(Do it again),
All I wanted was a little fun,
(Do it again),
Got a brain like bubblegum,
(Do it again),
Blowing up my cranium,
(Do it again).

Turn off my robotic brain,
All my thoughts are all the same,
(All insane).

[Repeat: x4]
Do it again,

Paint my face and bang my drum,
Hold my bone up to the sun,
Bang my drum and paint my face,
On my plane to hyperspace.

[Repeat: x4]
Do it again

[Chorus]

Turn off my robotic brain,
All my thoughts are all the same,
(All insane)
