Drop your silver in my tambourine
Help a poor man fill a little dream
Give me pennies, I'll take anything
Now listen while I play my green tambourine

Watch the jingle-jangles start to chime
Reflections of the music that was mine
When I toss a coin you'll hear it sing
Now listen while I play my green tambourine

Rub-a-dub before I walk away
Anytime you want, I'll gladly play
Money feeds my music machine
Now listen while I play my green tambourine
Listen while I play my green tambourine
