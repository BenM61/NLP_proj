Honey don't walk out I'm too drunk to follow 
You know you won't feel this way tomorrow 
Well, maybe I'm a little rough around the edges 
Inside a little hollow 
I get faced with some things sometimes 
That are so hard to swallow 
Hey hey hey! 

I was born a rebel 
Down in Dixie on a Sunday morning 
Yeah with one foot in the grave 
And one foot on the pedal 
I was born a rebel 

Well she picked me up in the morning 
And she paid all my tickets 
Yeah she screamed in the car 
And threw me out in the thicket 
Well I never would've dreamed 
That her heart was so wicked 
Oh but I keep coming back 
Cause it's so hard to kick it 

I was born a rebel 
Down in Dixie on a Sunday morning 
Yeah with one foot in the grave 
And on e foot on the pedal 
I was born a rebel 

Even before my father's fathers 
They called us all rebels 
Burned our cornfields 
And left our cities leveled 
I can still see the eyes 
Of those blue bellied devils 
When I'm walking round tonight 
Through the concrete and metal 

I was born a rebel 
Down in Dixie on a Sunday morning 
Yeah with one foot in the grave 
And one foot on the pedal 
I was born a rebel
