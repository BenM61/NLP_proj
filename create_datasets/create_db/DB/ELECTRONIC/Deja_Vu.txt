How in the world did it happen while I was dreaming about the ocean in my sleep
How in the world did it happen though I must have known it coming deep inside of me
Yes I've seen it before but the memory got lost as time sank it with its hands
Like a wave on the shore its lace caresses my feet and sinks them in the sands

Why did I let it happen to me
Why did I let you come to me when I knew I can't play the game without getting hurt
(Deja vu)
Could it be you
Could it be me for you
Or am I just lonely for your knowing touch

My life has been dry and nice like a sunny california day
Its been such a long time since I stood in the wind and the rain
This is what my heart feared 
What happened as I checked you out and you kissed me hello
Now its all come back to me how sweet the dream and the torture of yearning can be
Oh

Why did I let it happen to me
Why did I let you come to me when I knew I can't play the game without getting hurt
(Deja vu)
Could it be you
Could it be me for you
Or am I just lonely for your knowing touch

Could it be 
Could it be you
Deja vu
Playing the game without getting hurt
Deja vu
Oh
Could it be you
Deja vu
Could it be me playing the game
Deja vu
Deja vu
Could it be you
Deja vu
Deja vu
Deja vu
