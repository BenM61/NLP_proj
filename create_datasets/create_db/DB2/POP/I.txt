Look at my behaviour.
I can't help myself.
One feet before the other,
And hope you didn't notice. 
I'm 14 days ahead to you.
In my head you already mine. 
I hope I don't seem like the desperate kind. 

Sometimes I, melt I, 
I don't know where to put myself, 
But I'm not alone, cause right outside, 
There's two people just falling in love.

I see you're looking,
But are you looking my way? 
I like the things, all I could only say. 

Sometimes I, melt I, 
I don't know where to put myself, 
But I'm not alone, cause right outside, 
There's two people just falling in love.

Some other time, some other place 
Would maybe I show you my real face. 

Sometimes I, melt I, 
I don't know where to put myself, 
But I'm not alone, cause right outside, 
There's two people just falling in love.

Sometimes I, melt I,
