Some kids grow up with lots of toys
Some grow up knowing other boys
And I was born in the land of the free
But these things never happened to me

'Cos I was born a man
Don't remember being a child
I was born a man
Don't remember running wild

As soon as I was old enough to get my pay
I was working sixteen hours out of every day

Some kids grow up with a mothers love
And some with even more
But me I just turned up one day
On someone else's door

'Cos I was born a man
Don't remember being a child
I was born a man
Don't remember running wild

As soon as I was old enough to get my pay
I was working sixteen hours out of every day

But I won't cry
No I won't bore you
It has been good but it could have been better

Life's like a woman
Go out and take her
She'll treat you good if you are good back to her

I was born a man
Don't remember being a child
I was born a man
Don't remember running wild

As soon as I was old enough to get my pay
I was working sixteen hours out of every day
