Amberlights in Amsterdam
Slowed me down in no man's land
Chasing dreams and dodging tramps
Playing the cosmopolitan
Driven by your fantasies
Dealing danger and decease
All my love can't set you free 
In Amsterdam

Crossing bridges one by one
And wandering along the waterfront
Felt the heartbeat flooding the streets
Though the surface is calm still the waters run deep
Drowning in your fantasies
Drifting further from my reach
All my love can't set you free 
In Amsterdam

Shine on Amsterdam teardrops in my hand
A rough and uncut diamond the heart of Amsterdam
Shine on citylights springtime's scented nights
Like a lovers kiss the feeling's timeless 
In Amsterdam
 
Interlude in Amsterdam
With our sweet illusions and passionate plans
Followed the curve to rainbow's end
We were going to fast on a dangerous bend
Driven by your fantasies
Dealing danger and decease
All my love can't set you free in Amsterdam
