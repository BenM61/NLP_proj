Have you ever watched a moonbeam
As it slid across your windowpane
Or struggled with a bit of rain
Or danced about the weather vane
Or sat along a moving train
And wondered where the train has been
 
Or on a fence with bits of crap
Around its bottom
Blown there by a wind beam
Who searches for the moonbeam
Who was last seen
 
Looking at the tracks
Of the careless wind beam
Or moving to the clacks
Of the tireless freight train
And lighting up the sides

Of the weather vane
And the bits of rain
And the windowpane
And the eyes of those
Who think they saw what happened...
