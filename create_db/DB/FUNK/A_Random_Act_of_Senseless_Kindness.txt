I picked up the morning paper 
The headlines were no surprise 
A random act of senseless violence 
Was committed again last night 
It seems the whole world has gone crazy 
And something needs to be done 
So starting today, I'm gonna find a way 
I'm gonna repay someone

With a random act of senseless kindness 
Unexpected hand to help remind us 
A little bit of love is the cure for hate 
It's easy to give up but it's never too late 
A single step in the right direction 
Person to person making a connection 
We can change the world that's become so violent 
With a random act of senseless kindness

How I long to live the simple life 
When neighbors were still friends 
And the sidewalks leading downtown 
Were safe to walk back then 
The classrooms and the school yards 
Were havens for our kids 
Well, it's a long way back but we can get on track 
Today's a good day to begin

With a random act of senseless kindness 
Unexpected hand to help remind us 
A little bit of love is the cure for hate 
It's easy to give up but it's never too late 
A single step in the right direction 
Person to person making a connection 
We can change the world that's become so violent 
With a random act of senseless kindness

We can change the world that's become so violent 
With a random act of senseless kindness 
A randon act of senseless kindness
