Come back, you know I miss you
Got to hold you once again
In my life

It's late, it's quiet
A taxi waits at the door
Footsteps, a door slam
What's going on, it's a quarter to four

So many times, so many fears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life

The phone keeps ringing
Are you there with a friend
I call back, it's busy
I hang up and try once again

So many times, so many fears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life

So many times, so many fears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life

Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life
Come back, baby come back
Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life
Come back, baby come back
Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life
Take a boat, take a train, take an aeroplane
Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life
