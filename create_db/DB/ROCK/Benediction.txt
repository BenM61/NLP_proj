Genuflect, show respect, don't forget it's a papal command,
Take your seat, all you need is your rosary beads in your hand,
Time to start, cross your heart, be a part of the mystical band.

[Chorus]
Look at everybody trying to find their own place,
Looking for a heaven up high,
Working just to get into a state of grace,
We know we're gonna need it when we die.

Say your prayers, feel your fears, shed your tears, you're afraid of hell's fire,
As you sit there and pray you'll get carried away by the choir.
And the incense is sweet, takes you right off your feet, makes you higher.

[Chorus: x2]
