Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it

Won't you rock with me, baby?
I wanna rock the night away
We're gonna dance until the sun shines
We're gonna dance until you say

That you wanna take off, take off with me
Oh, yeah, we're rocking
Into space to another place

Won't you rock with me, baby?
I wanna rock the night away
We're gonna dance until the sun shines
We're gonna dance until you say

That you wanna take off, take off with me
Oh, yeah, we're rocking
Into space to another place

Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it

Won't you rock with me, baby?
I wanna rock the night away
We're gonna dance until the sun shines
We're gonna dance until you say

That you wanna take off, take off with me
Oh, yeah, we're rocking
Into space to another place

Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it
Rock rock, rock, rock it
