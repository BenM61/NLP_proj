Just the thought of losing you
Is much more than I can take
Tell me I'm not going crazy
Tell me that I'll be ok
After all that we've been through
Don't you see the big mistake we're making
Tell me I'm not going crazy

After all this ends up going nowhere
After all the road still leads to nowhere
After all the promises are broken
After all the after alls are spoken

Asked you where you want to go
I see you walking to the door
Don't you know that door is going nowhere
Then I thought I heard you leaving
Wake me up if I've been dreaming
Don't you see the big mistake you're making

After all I guess we're going nowhere
After all I didn't want to go there
After all the hearts have been set to breaking
After all this time I've been mistaken

Even still, I think of losing
Everything I think is sure
There's no simple remedy, it's
Something that we all endure
Be glad for what you've got
Don't take anything for granted
It's something after all

Just the thought of losing you is all
Just the thought of losing you is all
After all the roads have led to nowhere
After all the roads have led to nowhere
