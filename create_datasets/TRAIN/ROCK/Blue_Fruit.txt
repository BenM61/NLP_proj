Sitting round when I'm on the trees
Like Glasgow breezes
Blue lagoons and classic sunsets

But you are all I'm looking for
You are why duty calls

Blue fruit, blue fruit
Blue fruit's growing on my door
Blue fruit's coming through my floor

Told me so when I go to bed
And dream of aces
Wake me up to Italian vistas

But you are what I'm looking for
You are why duty calls

Blue fruit, blue fruit
Blue fruit's growing on my door
Blue fruit's coming through my floor

I'm alive, hold me tight
Blue fruit's growing on my door
Blue fruit's coming through my floor
