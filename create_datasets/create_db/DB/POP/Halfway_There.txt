If we never flew
We would never fall
If the world was ours
We would have it all
But the life we live
Isn't so simplistic
You just don't get what you want

So we take what comes
And we keep on going
Leaning on each other's shoulders
Then we turn around
And see we've come so far somehow

We're halfway there
We're looking good now
And nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there
And looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there
We're halfway there

When the chips are down
Back against the wall
Got no more to give
'Cause we gave it all
Seems like going a distance is unrealistic
But we're too far from the start

So we take what comes, And we keep on going
Leaning on each other's shoulders
Then we turn around
And see we've come so far somehow

We're halfway there
We're looking good now
And nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there
And looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there
We're halfway there

How you ever gonna reach the stars
If you never get off the ground
And you'll always be where you are
If you let life knock you down

We're halfway there
We're looking good now
And nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there
And looking back now
I never thought that I'd ever say
We're halfway there
We're halfway there

We're halfway there
We're halfway there
We're halfway there
We're halfway there
We're halfway there
We're halfway there
