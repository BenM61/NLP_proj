Picture a scene in your mind
Looks at all the people and take note of the setting behind
Listen, watch, and wait
A plot begins to take shape

There's a story
And then characters will come to you
Relating events as they choose to
But all their words and actions come entirely from you

If you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility
And you can lead your characters anywhere you want
You have immunity
Have you considered the way

People might react to all the things that your characters say?
And are their actions hand in hand with what you want to portray?
Are you sick?
Are you crippled? Insane?

Expressing the desires that daren't speak their name?
Are you the one to be blamed?
Now you're a storyteller you might think you are without responsibility
But in directions, actions and words

Cause and effect
You need consistency
How can you finish the tale?
Lives which have played a part

Are summarized from the very start
And episodes left out to make it all go our way

"It's a might big world
Some of it I've seen
But mostly I've only heard
And stories are all fiction from their moment of birth"

You're just a storyteller
You're not trying to escape responsibility
If we believe you then you're successful
But you don't make claims of verity
