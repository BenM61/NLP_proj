She stole my heart
Faster than a heat seeking missile on a mission
Faster than a bass took a hook when daddy fishing
Faster than a walnut rolls off a hen house
Faster than a whiskey shot goes down down South

Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning

Faster than a McQueen running them red lights
Faster than the Duke boys jumping that hillside
Faster than Elvis could shake rattle 'nd roll
Faster than a skirt flying up on the Row, I said

Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning

Faster than number three breaking every record
Faster than a tree dies in the desert
Faster than a bug splattered on my windshield
Faster than you die when you take too many pills

Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning

Alabama moonshine intoxicating this old heart
Holdin' a metal umbrella when the storm started
Oh that's what love's supposed to feel like, yeah
Oh that's what love's supposed to feel like, woah yeah
Oh that's what love's supposed to feel like, yeah
Oh yeah that's what love feels like

Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning
