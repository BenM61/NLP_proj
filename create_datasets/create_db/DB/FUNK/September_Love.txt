When we were you - and so naive
Emotions turned - in our hearts
When love was young - we promised and believed
In one love - and our dreams

Couldn't save it girl oh no
Time put us worlds apart and out of control
But I love you now as always
Woman those memories live inside me every day

Oh how I remember (I still remember September love)
In the heat of the night (I still remember September
dreams)
When the love bites (Do you remember our September
song)
And I want your love right now (I still remember
September love)
(September Love)

Passions would flow - when love was won
Endlessly and everlasting
Yes we have grown from this love we've known
And our dreams - never lasting

Couldn't save it girl oh no (How I remember your face)
Time put us worlds apart and out of control
That love song made just for us
Woman those memories live inside me every day

Oh how I remember (I still remember September love)
In the heat of the night (I still remember September
dreams)
When the love bites (Do you remember our September
song)
Such a lovely song (I still remember September love)
Oh yeah

September's gone
September song
And I wanna hold you near me right now

(I still remember September love)
In the heat of the night (I still remember September
dreams)
When the love bites (Do you remember our September
song)
And I need your love right now (I still remember
September love)

When I held you close to me
