Oh...
Cloudy was the day when Sunshine came into my life
And made it brighter
She touched me with her warmness as the light shines from her smile
She makes me happy
I could never keep myself away 'cause when I'm next to her
I feel the warm rays reaching out from her love

She touched me with a smile that glows
I can't go a day without my Sunshine
She warms me with her heart of gold and
I can't go a day without my sunshine

When life's troubles come around
And they start to get me down I call my Sunshine
Because there's no other remedy strong enough for me
Just her
I can never keep myself away 'cause when I'm next to her
I feel those warm rays reaching out from her love

She touched me with a smile that glows
I can't go a day without my Sunshine
She warms me with her heart of gold and
I can't go a day without my sunshine

She touched me with a smile that glows
I can't go a day without my Sunshine
She warms me with her heart of gold and
I can't go a day without my sunshine

Oh...

I can never keep myself away
'Cause when I?m next to her
I feel those warm rays reaching out from

Sunshine,  Sunshine,  Sunshine

All I want to say girl

You know, sometimes sunshine turns to rain
