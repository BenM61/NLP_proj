You thought you were Axl or Iggy
But you were nothing like that
But you looked good with a bottle
And you smiled like a little brat

And I don't wanna go back
To your town

You thought you were Axl or Iggy
But then the dream came alive
Then we went out and they bought it all
And then I ran home again

And I don't wanna go back
To your town

You're caving in, you'll save yourself
You want it bad like no one else
You won't get in, you won't get through
And everyone keeps telling you
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine

You say it when you drink
How that shrink was on fire
When you kicked him in the nuts
And tied him up with wire
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine
