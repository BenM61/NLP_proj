The City Council met last week, the vote was four to three
To burn the home town depot down and build a factory
To take that stretch of history and tear it off the map
To take melt old engine number nine and turn it into scrap

Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
If you can't afford a quarter then you ought to give a dime
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line

Oh, I could tell you stories of the glories of that train
Of the 49'er miners and the time old Jesse James
Stole a thousand golden nuggets in that 'Great Train Robbery'
And when old Abe Lincoln rode with Tad upon his knee

Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
If you can't afford a quarter then you ought to give a dime
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line

Just twenty thousand quarters and just forty thousand dimes
And we'll ride again to glory on the old Blue Water Line
We'll have William Jennings Bryant stokin' coal on number nine
So dig inside your pockets for the old Blue Water Line

Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
If you can't afford a quarter then you ought to give a dime
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line
If everybody gave then we could save the Blue Water Line

Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
Blue Water, Blue Water, Blue Water Line
