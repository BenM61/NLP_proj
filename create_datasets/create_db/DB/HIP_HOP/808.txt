Stack it like me, wouldn't like me
Ask Kelly, his original plan
To get as large on the map, by makin' you clap your hands
Damn shoo bizzatch, I'm not gonna lie
I'll pump my amps to this
Cutie pie, honey bunch
If you're not busy take me to lunch
Oh, ya'll done did it now, with the luscious music
World poppin' crews, and what, 8-0 grooves
Is what intended, you to get me up you
You one in a mill, forget the mens
Cause they ride in my pockets baby
And today I just wanna
Jiggle my ball
Bet I knock your socks off
Wit' my what what what (wha wha wha wha)
Yea yea
