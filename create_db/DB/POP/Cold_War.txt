So you think that I'm alone
That being alone is the only way to be
When you step outside
You spin like fire for your sanity

This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for

If you want to be free
Feel on the ground is the only place to be
Cause in this life
You spend time running from depravity

This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for

When wings to the weak
And bring grace to the strong
Make our legal stumble as it applies in the world
All the tripes come and the mighty will crumble
We must brave this night
And have faith in the world

I'm trying to find my peace
I was made to believe there's something wrong with me
And it hurts my heart
Lord have mercy ain't it plain to see

That this is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for

This is a cold,
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for

Do you know?
Is a cold
Do you?
Do you?
Ah ah ah ahhhh
Ah ah ah ahhhh

Is a cold,
You better know what you're fighting for
