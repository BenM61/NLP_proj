Life begins when somebody's eyes look into your own.
Life begins when you get your gal all alone.
From morning until twilight
I don't know I'm alive
But I know love begins at 8:45.

The stars are gonna twinkle and shine,
How they'll shine!
This evening about a quarter to nine.
My loving arms are going to tenderly twine
Around you around a quarter to nine.

I know I won't be late
Cause at half past eight,
I'm going to hurry there.
I, I'll be waiting where the lane begins
Waiting for you on needles and pins.
And then the world is going to be mine
Mine all mine!
This evening about a quarter to nine.

I know I won't be late
Cause at half past eight
I'm going to hurry there.
I'll be waiting where the lane begins
Waiting for you on needles and pins.
And then the world is going to be mine
Mine all mine!
This evening about a quarter to nine.
