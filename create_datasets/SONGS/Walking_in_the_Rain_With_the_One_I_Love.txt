He is following me
See you tomorrow
See you on Monday
Okay, girl!
Oh, don't be, don't be late!
It Starts to rain

The sure is,
Everybody is trying to get out the rain
Oh, It feels so good!
The rain and thinking of you
So as I get home, I'm gonna call you
And tell you how much I love you
Oh I feel so good

Oh, I can walk in the rain with the one I love
Feel so fine,
Walking in the rain with the one I love
All mine
Two years is all I have
Didn't say
Well I got mine in so many ways
Living together

Whether near or far,
It doesn't matter where you are

So we love each other
Giving love so warm and free
Make our trade a reality
Then it'll last forever and ever
With every step we take and every
Breath we make, darling, just you and me

OH, I can walk in the rain with the one I love
Feel so fine,
Walking in the rain with the one I love
All mine

So we love each other
With every passed day we share
To follow someone
Just being together
Making love so tenderly
Explode to the extasis
Then it'll last forever and ever
Together we hold the key
To make for ever our destiny

OH, I can walk in the rain with the one I love
Feel so fine
Walking in the rain with the one I love
All mine

I'm gonna call you right now
Dear, I hope he is home
Hello
Baby, I'm home
I've got something to tell you
What?
I love you
Oh, I love you too
Did you come out the rain?
Oh yes,It was so beautiful
Let me tell you how it started

Walking in the rain with the one I love
