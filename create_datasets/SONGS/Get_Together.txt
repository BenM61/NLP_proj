I got ready and realized
I had to pick the guys
The girls were on their way
Helpin' me fix up the place
A brand new outfit
I can't wait to get in
The doorbell's ringin'
Nine o'clock let's get it started

I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
And we do whatever
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
No plans
Whatever's clever

A place to let the tunes
Dictate the mood
Don't be too cool
To kick off your shoes
The music can't be loud
'Cause we can't hear what we're talkin' about
I am in chill mode
Just loungin' with my phone

If you name it we'll do it
If you want it we'll get it
Make sure you don't miss them
I know you'll regret it
We'll never forget it
I'm takin' pictures
Then somebody will yell
And no I'm not trippin'

I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
And we do whatever
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
No plans
Whatever's clever

No special occasion
Just good conversation
I'm just havin' fun
'Cause I'm always on the run
I don't need no reason
'Cause it's always in the season
To please and to
Relax with us
Enjoy yourselves

I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
And we do whatever
I'm not havin' a party
I'm havin' a get together
That's when we get together
No plans
Whatever's clever
