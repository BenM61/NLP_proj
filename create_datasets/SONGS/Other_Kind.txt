I woke up this morning and I took a look around at all that I got 
These days I've been lookin' in the mirror and wondering if that's me lookin' back or not 
I'm still the apple of my mama's eye 
I'm my daddy's worst fears realized 
Here of late all this real estate don't seem all that real to me sometimes 

I'm back out on that road again 
Turn this beast into the wind 
There are those that break and bend 
I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind 

Now my old buddy, what's his name, says, "Man what the hell are you thinkin' 'bout 
Fool, you got two of everything, but you hang your head just like you was down and out"; 
And I'm damn sure not suffering from a lack of love 
There's plenty more where that came from 
Ah - but leave it up to me to say something wrong and hurt someone before I'm done 

You see it used to be I was really free 
I didn't need no gasoline to run 
Before you could say Jack Kerouac you'd turn your back and I'd be gone 
Yeah nowadays I got me two good wheels and I seek refuge in aluminum and steel 
Aw, it takes me out there for just a little while 
And the years fall away with every mile
