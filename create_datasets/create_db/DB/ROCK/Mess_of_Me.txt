I am my own affliction
I am my own disease
There ain't no drug that they could sell
Ah there ain't no drugs to make me well

There ain't no drug
It's not enough
There ain't no drug
The sickness is myself

I made a mess of me I wanna get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I've made a mess of me I wanna reverse this tragedy
I've made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my live alive
The rest of my life alive!

We lock our souls in cages
We hide inside our shells
It's hard to free to the ones you love
Oh when you can't forgive yourself
Yeah forgive yourself!

There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
The sickness is myself

I made a mess of me I wanna get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I've made a mess of me I wanna reverse this tragedy
I've made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my live alive
The rest of my life alive!

Ah! Right

There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
No drugs to make me well
There ain't no drug
It's not enough
I'm breaking up
The sickness is myself
The sickness is myself

I made a mess of me I wanna get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I've made a mess of me I wanna reverse this tragedy
I've made a mess of me I wanna spend the rest of my live alive
The rest of my life alive!!
