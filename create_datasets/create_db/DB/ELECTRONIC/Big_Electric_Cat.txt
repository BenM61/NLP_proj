She arrives like a limo
Smooth and moving
On the prowl through the crowd
To the beat of the city
She glows in the dark
Wherever she parks
Concrete crumbles and the night rumbles

Big electric cat

She dances through the street
Like the flame of a fire
Everybody's hypnotized
Everybody perspires
Even little children cry
Grown men shout
The dogs bark
The lights go out

Big electric cat
