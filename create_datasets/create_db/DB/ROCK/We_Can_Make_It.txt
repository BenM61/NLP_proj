It's been a long week
And I'm losing my mind
Cause I don't want to come home again
Is it the birds, or the waves, or the words?
That I'm talking of now
Cause I don't want to come home again

We can make it. We can make it. We can make it. 
We can make it. We can make it. We can make it. 
We can make it. We can make it. We can make it.

I just get the feelings that I choose
Not to be bruised tonight
It's been a long week
That I'm thinking of now
Now I don't want to come home again
Is it the waves, or the words, or the birds?
That I'm talking about
That I don't want to come home again

We can make it. We can make it. We can make it. 
We can make it. We can make it. We can make it. 
We can make it. We can make it.

Somewhere between right and wrong 
I choose, not to be bruised tonight
Somewhere in the ways of the things 
I choose, not to be bruised tonight
