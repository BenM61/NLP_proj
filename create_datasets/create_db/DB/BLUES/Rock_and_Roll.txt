It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Ooh let me get back, let me get back
Let me get back, Baby where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

It's been a long time since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back, 
Carry me back, Baby where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time, 
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, opens your arms, 
Open your arms, Baby let my love come running in

It's been a long time, been a long time, 
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
