The words she means are those she doesn't say
So slowly running out of things to say
She was not afraid to ring a bell or two
There's no one who can tell her how to feel

I just wish that I could help her out
But I'm part of the problem it turns out
She was not afraid to ring a bell or two
And I'm part of the problem it turns out

I noticed she thinks I have figured it all out
Surely I get by
But know this: I'm confidently pretending
But that's hard when you don't have
An excuse to try

The words she means are those she doesn't say
So slowly running out of things to say
She was not afraid to ring a bell or two
She was not afraid to ring a bell or two
I'm part of the problem it turns out

We're almost halfway there
Still getting you nowhere
Wrap it in a cloud
To figure this out
