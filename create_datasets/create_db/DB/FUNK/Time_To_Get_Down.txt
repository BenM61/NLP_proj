Hey, why don't you just stop trying to be so cool
And let me know the lowdown of how you feel about things?
Oh, you ain't doing nothing but jive, baby
And we've got a very serious problem, yeah
Yeaaa-aaah

Come on, baby

It's time for you to stop playing with my feelings, girl
Come on, girl, you know it damn well, baby
(It's time to get down, down, yeah)

Oh, if there's nothing else, you can make up your mind right away

Can't you see I wanna love you?
As long as you want it, baby
As long as you need it, baby

Oh, baby, baby, believe me when I tell you every word I say is true (Believe me, yeah)
