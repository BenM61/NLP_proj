You were meant for me, I was meant for you
Nature patterned you and when she was done
You were all the sweet things rolled up in one
You're like a plaintive melody
That never lets me free
For I'm content the angels must have sent you
And they meant you just for me
 
You were meant for me, I was meant for you
Nature patterned you and when she was done
You were all the sweet things rolled up in one
You're like a plaintive melody
That never lets me free
For I'm content the angels must have sent you
And they meant you just for me
