Today is a lucky day
We can get away 
Just tell the DJ to play (and play)
I just want to hear you play my favorite song
I just to hear you play my favorite

(Verse 1)
DJ's got me feeling kinda sexy 
Got my body moving on the floor 
Everytime i hear that Funky music
I just let the rhythm take control 
Come on...come on

Today is a lucky day
We can get away 
Just tell the DJ to play (and play)
I just want to hear you play my favorite song
I just to hear you play my favorite
I like the jam your playing for me (don't stop don't stop that jam)
Don't stop the jam just play it for me
(it's that jam yeah, it's that jam yeah)

Today is a lucky day
We can get away 
Just tell the DJ to play (and play)
I just want to hear you play my favorite song
I just to hear you play my favorite

(Verse 2)
When you put the needle on the record 
Ain't nobody standing on the wall 
Everybody's stepping at this party
Doing what we're doing 
Everybody just get down and have a ball 

Today is a lucky day
We can get away 
Just tell the DJ to play (and play)
I just want to hear you play my favorite song
I just to hear you play my favorite

Today is a lucky day
We can get away 
Just tell the DJ to play (and play)
I just want to hear you play my favorite song
I just to hear you play my favorite

(Bridge)
Let the music play till the break of day yeah
Got to feel the groove got to make a move
As we dance all night till the morning light 

It's that jam (x4)

Today is a lucky day
We can get away 
Just tell the DJ to play (and play)
I just want to hear you play my favorite song
I just to hear you play my favorite

Come on get up and dance (x8)
