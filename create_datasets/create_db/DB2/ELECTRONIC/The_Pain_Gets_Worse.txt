Tell me it's a dream
The pain gets worse
Tell me you have seen
The pain gets worse
That we can't regain
It really hurts
Don't make me shout out
The pain gets worse

Tell me he were wrong
The pain gets worse
Tell me you have longed
The pain gets worse
To be here with me
It really hurts
Tell me you have seen

The pain gets worse
The pain gets worse
The pain gets worse
It really hurts
The pain gets worse

Tell me once again
The pain gets worse
That you wanna be friends
The pain gets worse
That you'll swallow your pride
It really hurts
That you'll stay by my side

The pain gets worse
The pain gets worse
The pain gets worse
It really hurts
The pain gets worse

Tell me it's a dream
Tell me you have seen
That we can't regain
Don't make me shout out
