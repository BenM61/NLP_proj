Seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I missed you
(I missed you too)

'Cause you, you and I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin

It's all come together
Problems we've defeated
And I'm here hand in hand
You take all that I got if you need it, baby

'Cause you, you and I-I-I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I-I-I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin

Love will last forever
(Forever)
We can make it real
(Got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never
(No, no, never)
We can truly feel
(What you feel)

I feel like getting back together
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Younger and wiser
Time has shown the way
We've come full circle
To stay
(Don't go away)

'Cause you, you and I-I-I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I-I-I
Back together again
Got the world in a spin

Truth is the light
It's the joy that we both share
Make love day and night
It's so easy to do when you care

Love will last forever
(Forever)
We can make it real
(Got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never
(No, no, never)
We can truly feel
(What you feel)
I feel like you
Back together

Back together again
Back together again
Back together again
