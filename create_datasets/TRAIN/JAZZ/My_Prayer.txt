My prayer is to linger with you 
At the end of the day 
In a dream that?s divine... 

My prayer is a rapture in blue 
With the world far away 
And our lips close to mine. 

Tonight, while our hearts are aglow, 
Oh, tell me the words that I'm longing to know... 

My prayer and the answer you give, 
May they still be the same for as long as we live, 
That you'll always be there 
At the end of my prayer!
