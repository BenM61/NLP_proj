Polly wouldn't listen to her mama
Polly wouldn't listen to her papa
She tried to make the swinging city scene
And now there's not a place that Polly hasn't been

Polly, pretty, pretty Pollyanna
Pretty, pretty Pollyanna
Pretty Polly Garter
Oh, I think that pretty Polly should have stayed at home

Pretty Polly, dressed as jolly as can be
She's so darling, all the fellas do agree
And half a million people can't be wrong
Oh, I think that pretty Polly should have stayed at home

Polly wrote a letter to her mama
Polly made confessions to her papa
Mummy's proud 'cause Polly's still in chains
She's happy now her baby's coming home again

Pretty Polly, she learned that life is just a game
She is sorry, she just had to break the chains
And Mama knows 'cause mama was the same
Oh, she's happy now her baby's coming home again

Polly, pretty, pretty Pollyanna
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Pollyanna, Pollyanna
Pretty Polly Garter

Oh, Polly, pretty, pretty Pollyanna
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Pollyanna, Pollyanna
Pretty Polly Garter
Oh, I think that pretty Polly should have stayed at home
