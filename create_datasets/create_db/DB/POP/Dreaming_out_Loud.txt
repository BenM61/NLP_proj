Well, hello sir, we look for Monday
Is confident we?ll get there someday
Pushing all the papers to a wealthy man
Might I say, a beautiful tie you wear
And how do you find such lovely polka dots
And stripes these days?

Break all my thoughts hit the floor
Like I'm makin' the score
I'm the king of the world, I'm a popular man
Count by zero's to ten
If you can't, well, I can
Don't let any one wake me

I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud
And all at once, so familiar it seems
I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece, apart of me

Curtain calls in sanctuary
Actors in the cloth, they freak me out
Mockin' my purpose in the magazines
And famous how they make you feel grand
They're always there to hold your hand
In times of trouble, they're best of friends

Break all my thoughts hit the floor
Like I'm makin' the score
I'm the king of the world, I'm a popular man
Count by zero?s to ten
If you can't, well I can
Don't let any one wake me

I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud
And all at once, so familiar it seems
I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece, apart of me

They don't care what you say
They don't care what you think
All they care, what you do
Long as you're off beat
Take a look at yourself

Storm tries to come and wreck my world
No, I won't let it
Stumbled escape, through anchored drapes
No way to bedding

I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud
And all at once, so familiar it seems
I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece
I'm dreamin' out loud, I'm loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece, apart of me

Well, hello sir, we look for Mondays
