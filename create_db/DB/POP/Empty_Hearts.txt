Are you leaving, are you going
Did you think you could lose that feeling without me knowing

Are you wishing you'd never met me
Does it just take a train whistle blowing to forget me

All the losing and the knowing but you love her still
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel

Are you leaving, are you going
Did you think you could lose that feeling
Without me knowing

All the losing and the knowing, but you love her still
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel
Tell me what an empty heart must feel

Are you leaving, are you going
Are you leaving, are you going
