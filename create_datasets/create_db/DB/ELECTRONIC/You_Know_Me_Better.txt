Me, a new me
A new me, a new me
A new me

I think we waited
Long enough, baby
You know me
Only too well

I just thought someway I have to match you
So don't be defensive
No, no, don't try to pretend to
Look surprised

Have you ever known me?
Bit too shy to jump in
But when it comes to you, I can't win
'Cause you know me better than I know myself

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

Me, a new me
A new me

Understand it, nobody understands you
The way that I can, let's see this thing through
One thing remaining
Things will never be the same again after tonight

So let's get down to it
This thing is getting stronger and stronger
When you did take it further
I can't wait no longer of waiting my turn
I've waited in line

How long have I known you?
Not in all this time been untrue
I think I'm rolling free, let me see this through
You know me better than I know myself

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself

How many years can we keep going on this way?
Too afraid to nurtured stay
Where I believe the friendship can survive
Maybe it won't, if we do or we don't

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

You know me better than I know myself
You know me better than I know myself
You know me better than I know myself
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect
