Hands too burnt
Sitting on the side of the road
Ain't gotta an honest feeling in my bones
Felt like a fever
Came on like a stone
But what I felt, it can't be helped no more

Get up up-up-up-up-up-up
If you want my, want my, want my, love
Get up up-up-up-up-up-up
If you want my, want my, love

Fire!
Fire!

Bless my soul, that's the way it is
Bless my soul, I can't resist

Swift as a river
With a hand as hard as stone
What's hot as hell the same, won't leave you cold
I'm a believer
My world's just good as gold
Walkin' a fine line, might not need to go

Get up up-up-up-up-up-up
If you want my, want my, want my, love
Get up up-up-up-up-up-up
If you want my, want my, want my, love

Fire!
Fire!

Bless my soul, that's the way it is
Bless my soul, I can't resist

Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!

Bless my soul, that's the way it is
Bless my soul, I can't resist
