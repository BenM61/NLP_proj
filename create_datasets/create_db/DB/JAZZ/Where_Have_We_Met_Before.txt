It might have been the beach at Bali-Bali
Or was it by the blue Miami shore?
I don't recall your name
But won't you tell me, just the same
Where have we met before?

It might have been way back in Nagasaki
Where women wicky wacky 'round your door
I seem to recognise
The light that's shinin' in your eyes
Where have we met before?

Did I hold your hand in a little gypsy tea room
Or on the Isle of Capri?
Tell me, did we sing in a chapel in the moonlight
September in the rain, remember me?

It might have been in Paris in the springtime
The thought of it intrigues me more and more
And then again it seems
I might have kissed you in my dreams
Where have we met before?

Each time I look at you
I pinch myself to see if it's true
I'm positive we've met before
I wish that I knew
But we haven't
Let me introduce me to you

Whenever you're around I feel as light as the air
I haven't got a worry and I haven't got a care
But when you are away I feel the lowest despair

Did I hold your hand in a little gypsy tea room
Or on the Isle of Capri?
Tell me, did we stand and talk and laugh along the chapel in the moonlight?

It might have been in Paris in the springtime
The thought of it intrigues me more and more
Oh, where could we have met before?
