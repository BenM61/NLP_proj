Been looking for love 
 I never could find it 
 While I'm standing here 
 And he is so blinded by her silly ways 
 He just can't imagine 
 She's playing a game 
 A game that he played for so long oh 
 I want him to know 
 Just how much I love him 
 I wanted to show 
 But he just believes 
 I'm a friend he can trust 
 But I want to touch him 
 I love him enough 
 To heal all the hurt in his heart 
 Oh yes I do but how do I start 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 Can you tell me who to call? 
 When the one I love 
 Is loving someone who can't see 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 Tell me if he'll ever fall so in love with me 
 Or could it be it's just make believe 
 Boy I had a dream 
 Or maybe a vision 
 That I was your queen 
 Cause I fit the slipper 
 You took me away 
 To happily ever 
 We laughed and we made 
 Sweet love till the sun came again 
 Oh yeah we did, hmm 
 But that was the end, oh 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 Can you tell me who to call? 
 When the one I love 
 Is loving someone who can't see 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 Tell me if he'll ever fall so in love with me 
 Or could it be it's just make believe 
 Oh, if you're looking for love 
 It's right in your face 
 I've been waiting for you 
 So don't run away 
 Fairy tales can come true 
 If you believe 
 (They can come true if you believe) 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 Can you tell me who to call? 
 When the one I love 
 Is loving someone who can't see 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 Tell me if he'll ever fall so in love with me 
 Or could it be it's just make believe 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 I want to know, I want to know 
 Is he gonna know? 
 That I'm loving him 
 And I'm needing him 
 Or will he love someone who can't see 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall 
 Mirror, mirror 
 On the wall
