Hooked into her system 
Don't draw the line 
Honey, I ain't through with you 

The harder the better (let's do it 'til)

Gotta get it while you got it 
A little bit of everything, even when it hurts 

Sure feels good 
Don't draw the line 
Honey, I ain't through with you 
The harder the better (let's do it 'til)
We're black and blue

Honey, I ain't through with you

The wetter the better let's do it 'til
We're black and blue
