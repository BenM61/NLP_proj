Seems like yesterday 
You were in my arms 
And in a special way 
You touched my heart with all your charms. 
Now you're gone 
And I find myself 
Baby, I'm all alone 
And there's no love left. 

 Hey! Hey! 

Don't know why I failed. 
For you I've always cared 
And I did all I know 
To win your love and make it so 
You'd always stay 
But you turned away. 
Honey, what could I say? 
How could you 
How could you do me this way? 

Cuz I'm chained 
To your love and affection. 
Chained cuz your love 
Is my only direction 

Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh. 
I've got to make it right 
Somehow it all went wrong 
Somewhere down the line 
The love I lost 
The love I gotta find 
Whoah! and it won't be long 
I've gotta make it right baby 
And carry you tenderly back home. 

I'm chained 
To your love and affection. 
Baby, chained to your love. 
When I hear your name 
How I tremble, how I tremeble, yeah. 
Honey, you know, honey, you know, yeah. 

Now I admit that I 
Haven't been the perfect guy 
For a girl as sweet as you 
But my heart and soul cries out to you. 

One more chance that's all I need 
 I'm gonna make it right, baby, 
Now you just stay won't you stay with me? 

Cuz I'm chained 
To your love and afection. 
Baby, I'm chained cuz your love 
Is my only direction. 
I'm chained
