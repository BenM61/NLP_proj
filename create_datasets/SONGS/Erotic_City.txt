Ah, ah, ah, ah
Erotic City
Erotic City

All of my purple life
I've been looking for a dame
That would want to be my wife
That was my intention, babe

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive
We can f*ck until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me

Every time I comb my hair
Thoughts of you get in my eyes
You're a sinner, I don't care
I just want your creamy thighs

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive
We can f*ck until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me

All of my hang-ups are gone
How I wish you felt the same
We can f*ck until the dawn ('til the dawn) (until the dawn)
How I wish you were my dame (baby, won't you call my name?)

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive
We can f*ck until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me

Uh, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa

Baby, you're so creamy

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone ('til the dawn)
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me

If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time (you and me)
Some time, some time, some time, Erotic City
If we cannot make babies, maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty you and me, Erotic City come alive

We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone (Come alive)
Erotic City can't you see, thoughts of pretty you and me
We can funk until the dawn, making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City

Ah, ah, ah, ah, Erotic City
