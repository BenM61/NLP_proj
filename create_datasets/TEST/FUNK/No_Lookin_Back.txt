I'm fading out of sight
My wheels are the only sound
Runnin' at the speed of sight
I can't slow down

Out on the open road
Racing to beat the night
No matter where I go
Guess I'll get there all right

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up
It used to be a simple thing

I can't hold on, I can't return
Time to let go, start to live and learn

I took the one way flight
Too high to see the ground
Now I know how long it takes
A heart to come down

Why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up
It ought to be a simple thing

I can't hold on, I can't return
Time to let go, start to live and learn

I can't hold on, I can't return
Rivers will run, bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how
But there's no lookin' back now
