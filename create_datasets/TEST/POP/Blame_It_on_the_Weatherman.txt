It's just one more day 
No one said 
There would be rain again 
Won't blame it on myself 
I'll blame it on the weatherman 
Get away for a while 
Here I am out on my own again 
Won't blame it on myself 
I'll blame it on the weatherman 
 
Standing on the shore 
Calling out your name 
I was here before 
I could see your face 
Only clouds will see 
Tears are in my eyes 
Empty like my heart 
Why do ya say goodbye 

The rain goes on(on and on again)
The rain goes on(on and on again)
Alone I can hear 
Hear our song 
Playing for me again 
Won't blame it on myself 
Just blame it on the weatherman 

Standing on the shore 
Calling out your name 
I was here before 
I could see your face 
Only clouds will see 
Tears are in my eyes 
Empty like my heart 
Why do ya say goodbye 

The rain goes on(on and on again)
The rain goes on(on and on again)
Alone I can hear 
Hear our song 
Playing for me again 
Won't blame it on myself 
Just blame it on the weatherman
Maybe it's too late 
Maybe it's too late to try again 
Maybe I can pray 
Maybe I can wait 
Maybe I can blame it on the weatherman 

The rain goes on(on and on again)
The rain goes on(on and on again)
Won't blame it on myself 
Just blame it on the weatherman 

Oh blame it on the weatherman
