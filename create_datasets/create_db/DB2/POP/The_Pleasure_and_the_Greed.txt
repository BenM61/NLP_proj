So I make you happy
And I make you sick
Forget the traffic
I'm used to all of it

It's no fair to say
I'm only taking what I need

Don't feel so snappy
I don't give a shit
Forgive the traffic
I'm used to all of it

It's no fair to say
I'm only taking what I need
What I need
OK I fess up to the pleasure and the greed

I'm always over at your place
And I'm licking your hmmm hmmm
You should be over at mine
Licking my wounds

I'm always over at your place
And I'm licking your hmmm hmmm
You should be over at mine
Licking my wounds

You're used to all of this
What I need
It's no fair to say
I'm only taking what I need
What I need
OK I fess up to the pleasure and the greed

What I need
Pleasure and the greed
The pleasure and the greed
Pleasure and the greed
Pleasure and the greed
Pleasure and the greed
Pleasure and the greed
