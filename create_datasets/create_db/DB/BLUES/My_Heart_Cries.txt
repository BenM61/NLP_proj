I was lost in the world of dreams 
Hunting every star shining over him, it seems
I watch like a shepherd boy
Searching for his laughing, and dancing everywhere
You can walk, yeah you catching me
You and I are joy, oh yes you set me free
We kiss and the world was our club

And my heart cried oh I love you so
Then my heart cried oh I love you so
Then my heart cried oh I love you so
Love you so
Love you so
