You've never seen what I could do. 
Like run a mile and jump hoops too
And ruin everything for you 
Could make me smile if you want to

Duckin' and divin' skippin' and skivin' 
Between the shit and the shovel, 
The ass lick and the grovel and God
Oh what a Lord, makes me thankful for being bored!

And everything you do 
To make me happy but you could 
Make me jump and spin Loops too
And crack a smile in front of you

Duckin' and divin' skippin' and skivin' 
Between the shit and the shovel, 
The ass lick and the grovel and God
Oh what a Lord, makes me thankful for being bored!

You know I hate it when you cry
It makes me want to burn your eyes 
With a poker every time 
And chase my tail to make you smile.

Duckin' and divin' skippin' and skivin' 
Between the shit and the shovel, 
The ass lick and the grovel and God
Oh what a Lord, makes me thankful for being bored!

Duckin' and divin' skippin' and skivin' 
Between the shit and the shovel, 
The ass lick and the grovel and God
Oh what a Lord, makes me thankful for being bored!
