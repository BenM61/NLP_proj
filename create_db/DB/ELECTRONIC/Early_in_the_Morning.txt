Oh I bet
You were a virgin
'Til you let me
Oh I miss your kiss

When you are gone
I was young and foolish
Didn't know what I was doing
Didn't know I'd lost you

'Til you were gone
Oh I miss your loving
When you are gone
Now I gotta get up

Early in the morning
Find me another lover
Now I've got to get up early
Every morning

'Cause the early bird
Always catches the worm
Now I've got to get up early
Every morning

Got to make up for the
Lesson I learned
Got to find me a lover
Who won't run for cover

Find me a lover
Who won't run for cover
Got to get up
Early in the morning

Find me another lover
Now I gotta get up
Early in the morning
Find me another lover

I was young and foolish
Didn't know what I was doing
Didn't know I'd lost you
'Til you'd gone

She had a pretty face
Drove me wild
I even wanted her to have my child
