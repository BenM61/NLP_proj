Aceyalone:
Every time I flow I get this vision and I know
Everytime I know I manifest and then I grow
Everywhere I go I plant a seed I hope I grow
But every seed planted ain't always granted life though
Some grow slower then they flourish in the end
Then again some go fast then they die out soon as they began
Now many music on my seed
Planted in the minds to feed
Yes indeed I cut off bleed
I sweat in tears until I'm free
My set for tha 213
Wit protect to the e-why-e
Just soak it in like mother earth
Who was once this jewel
Is just a sess poop for fools
Truly world there's another chapter to that never ending capture rapture
I tap yo mental
And strokes ya mind so gentle
I'm the sunshine not the star and I rymhe irregular annnd bizzare
But I no exactly who I are
Ye..and I love keepin true and not off guard
Nobody likes to be a waterboy foreva
Neva seein the feild thinkin you got it together
Playin foosball in the street its yo game but its they concrete
Its my ball its my treat an its my world its my hit
And I live a hell hole in the wall and I don't never see the light of day
So flipnos controlin alla y'all but they won't take mines away
What is that instict
To react before you think and make that thought complete tell it to the weak
Smell before you eat
See I neva try to mislead
And I walk this planet keyed
Yes indeed I cut off bleed
I sweatin tears until I'm free
My set to the 213
My protect to the e-why-e
Just soak it in despite all this anguish
For a book of human language
The lion will never ever lie down with the lamb
That's how its taught when I saught out to tell em who I am
I exam
I loot for the bank and swam
Change my program
But they hold me back like water in a dam
But I won't be held
Even though I'm trailed with bread crumbs
Ill take em to the max headdrum
You'll need more then excedrin
Codina
Morphina
Niccotina
Caffine in yo canteen
In yo bloodstream
Ima well oiled machine keep my area quarinteend
From the gardens of flowinteene to shores of tripily
Scientifically ain't to rippen me I'm terrificly well spoken
See many attempts to get a glimps of what the hell I'm smoken
But it ain't no bamma
I just mastered this bastard grammar
I go outside my peramata and stretch out my diamita
It gets bigger the gamera so pitcture that wit your camera
(i don't no what the f*ck he says here)
And much more hearts then yours
I just express mines a little different
Cause life ain't fair but who really cares?
I no some people that's over here but they wanna be over there
I no some real cool cats ye but they wanna be bears an when I see em chasen chickens I get heated like a flare
On your face looks scared ye space looks kinda teared
Your a square and I'm beyond comparen I'm rare ye
And I'm sick of turnin apples into pears
Soon as I get a little bit of it ima share
See I never try to mislead and I walk this planet keyed
Yes indeed I cut off bleed
I sweatin tears until I'm free
My set to the 213
My protect to the e-why-e
Just soak it in despite all this anguish
For a book of human language
