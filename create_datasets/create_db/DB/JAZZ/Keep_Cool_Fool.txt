Keep cool, fool, if you don't know what you're doing
Keep cool, fool, 'cause you don't know what you're doing
Keep cool, fool, if you don't know what you're doing
Or else you're gonna bring somebody down

Keep cool, fool, if you don't want any trouble
Keep cool, fool, 'cause you don't know what you're saying
Keep cool, fool, if you don't know what you're saying
Or else you're gonna bring somebody down

Twice
It's better to be big than to be small
(Twice, once, twice)
It ain't nice
Or just like Humpty Dumpty on the wall
Well, you're going to fall

Keep cool, fool, if you don't want any trouble
Keep cool, fool, or your trouble will go double
Keep cool, fool; don't you blow up like a bubble
Or else you're gonna bring somebody down

Twice
It's better to be big than to be small
(Twice, once, twice)
It ain't nice
Or just like Humpty Dumpty on the wall
Well, you're going to fall

Like the bear
Going nowhere, oh, Brother Rufus

No, I'm like the chicken
Always sticking
That's why I say to you
Keep cool, fool
Keep cool, fool
Oh, keep cool, fool
If you don't know what you're doing
Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
