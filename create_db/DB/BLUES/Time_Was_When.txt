Time was when you was mighty glad
To have me 'round you, that's when I found you
Time was when you, you used to favor me all day
Then you went away, I always knew you wouldn't stay

Time was when you was mighty careless
With my money, you were funny
You said that the best was none too good
Then you went away, I knew you wouldn't stay

Time was when you said lots of silly things
To please me, you never teased me
And called me a baby doll and lots of dirty names too
Now you say that we're through

And after doing all those dirty things like that
Packed up all your clothes and left your baby flat
But I can remember when there was a time

Time was when you was mighty careless
With my money, you were funny
You said the best was none too good
Then you went away, I always knew you would go

Well, time was when you said lots of silly things
To please me, you never teased me
You called me a baby doll and lots of dirty names too
Now you say that, oh, we're through

And after doing all those dirty things like that
Packed up all your clothes and left your baby flat
But I can remember when there was a time

And after doing all those dirty things like that
You packed up all your clothes and left your baby flat
But I can remember when there was a time
