There goes my girl
There goes my first love
With the guy I used to call my friend
There goes love I thought would never end
And I can't forget her
My heart is breaking
When I see her holding hands with him
Can't help thinking how it might have been
She's still my first love

My first love is still around. She never left this part of town
Now I see her most ev'ry day but she don't look my way
There goes my first love with the guy I used to call my friend

She loved me but not for long. I wish I knew where I went wrong
Now ev'ry day those pretty feet come walking on down the street

There goes my first love with the guy I used to call my friend...
