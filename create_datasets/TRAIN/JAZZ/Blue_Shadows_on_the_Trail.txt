Hades of night are falling
As the wind be-gins to sigh 
And the world's silhou-etted a-gainst the sky.

Blue Shadows on the Trail
Blue moon shinin' through the trees.
And a plain--tiff wail, from the distance
Comes a driftin' on the evening breeze.

Move a-long, Blue Shadows, move a-long
Soon the dawn will come and you'll be on your way

Un-til the darkness sheds its veil
There'll be Blue Shadows on the Trail.

Move a-long, Blue Shadows, move a-long
Soon the dawn will come and you'll be on your way

Un-til the darkness sheds its veil
There'll be Blue Shadows on the Trail.
Shadows on the Trail.
