The way she walks
The way she talks
How long can I pretend
Oh I can't help it, I'm in love 
with the girl of my best friend

Her lovely hair 
Her skin so fair
I could go on and never end
Oh I can't help it, I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend

I want to tell her how I love her so
And then hold her in my arms but then
What if she got real mad and told him so
I could never face either one again

oh the way they kiss
Their happiness
Will my aching heart ever mend
Or will I always be in love
With the girl of my best friend

Never end
Will it ever end
Please let it end
Will it ever end
