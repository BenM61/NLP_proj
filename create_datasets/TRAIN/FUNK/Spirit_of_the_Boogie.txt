Get up, let's boogie all
The boogie's back again
For the boogie there is no beginning
And there is no end, ha

Come on, feel the funk, y'all, get up
Come on, feel the spirit, spirit of the boogie
Come on, feel it, get (?)
Come on, pop your fingers

It's the boogie, y'all
Get down, got to feel it
The spirit of the boogie
That's right, come on now

Get up, just feel the spirit of the boogie
Check it out, just let it flow
Cause when the boogie come to get you
You ain't got nowhere to go
Just feel the spirit of the boogie
Let it ease right on inside

Feel the spirit of the boogie band
It's the baddest little boogie in the land
Feel the spirit of the boogie band
It's the baddest little boogie in the land

Oh, shake some booty
To the spirit of the boogie
Do it, ride the rhythm

Ride, ride the rhythm
Ride, ride the rhythm
Ride, ride the rhythm
Ride, ride the rhythm
Ride, ride the rhythm
Ride, ride the rhythm

Feel the spirit of the boogie band
It's the baddest little boogie in the land
Feel the spirit of the boogie band
It's the baddest little boogie in the land
It's the baddest little boogie in the land
It's the baddest little boogie in the land
It's the baddest little boogie in the land

Feel the spirit of the boogie band
