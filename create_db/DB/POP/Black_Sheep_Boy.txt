Here I am back home again
I'm here to rest
All they ask is where I've been
Knowing I've been West.

I'm the family's unknown boy
Golden curls and envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shining Black Sheep Boy.

If you love me, let me live in peace.
Please understand,
That the black sheep can wear the golden fleece,
And hold a winning hand.

I'm the family's unknown boy
Golden curls and envied hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shining Black Sheep Boy.
