I've been thinking 'bout us
I've been thinking 'bout making this right
Thinking 'bout holding on
Writing this song for as long as I can
I've been thinking 'bout us
I've been thinking 'bout holding you tight
Thinking 'bout you and I
High as kite for as long as I can

So here is something that I've
Been missing every day
It's something inside your eyes
That's fading every mistake
So here is something that I've
Been missing so many ways
It's something inside your eyes

I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday

I've been thinking 'bout us
I've been thinking 'bout making this right
Thinking 'bout holding on
Writing this song for as long as I can
I've been thinking 'bout us
I've been thinking 'bout holding you tight
Thinking 'bout you and I
High as kite for as long as I can

So here is something that I've
Been missing every day
It's something inside your eyes
That's fading every mistake
So here is something that I've
Been missing so many ways
It's something inside your eyes

I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
I miss you everyday
