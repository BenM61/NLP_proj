Friends need one other
More than enough to hold on
Love enough to share
Since I got to know you
Believe in the sound of my heart
Strong enough to tell you
That I care

Everybody's a dreamer
(a dreamer, a dreamer, we need
Love)
Everybody needs love
To be around so

Let me be the one you believe in
I'll be there oh yeah yeah

I want to stay with me
Whispers the sound of my heart
Long enough to share
Whenever you feel
Feel like you need what I need
Take me to the rhythm

I want to be the one to talk to
I'll be there for you
Taking care of you
'cause you're cute
Beauty is in the eye
Of the beholder
I'd never scold ya
Unconditional love is hard to find
I'm blind
Deaf and dumb
My heart has a big sign
That says welcome
To a love that's forgiving
I'm living
Free
I wanna be
Refrain
