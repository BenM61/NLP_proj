She falls apart
By herself
No one there to talk or understand
Feels the same
Dries her eyes
Finds herself, opens a door and sighs

People see right through you
Everyone who knows you well
Falls apart
Might as well
Day is long and nothin' is wasted

Run away, run away
Hold you tomorrow but your goin' away
Run away, run away
Hold you tomorrow but you're leavin' today

You walk alone
By yourself
There's the sound, nothin' is changin'
They've gone away
Left you there
Emptiness in nothin' you can't share

All those words that hurt you
More than you would let it show
Comes apart
By yourself
Always well but nothing is wasted

Run away, run away
Hold on to you but you're goin' away
Run away, run away
Hold you tomorrow but your leavin' today

Sometimes I feel aroused so I cannot be down
All the time I've been on my owm
Any sound of being here
Time to wastearound a friend
I know where to runaway. 
No where to run away yeah!

She falls aprt, no one there
Hold her hand and seems to disappear
Falls apart
Might as well
Day is long and nothin' is wasted

Run away, run away
Hold on to you but your goin' away
Run away, run away
Hold you tomorrow but you're leavin' today
