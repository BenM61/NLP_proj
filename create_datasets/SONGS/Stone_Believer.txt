I've been walking a long long long time
Came back to hear what you feel about it
It's not the way you look
That makes me feel this way
It's like a blind man with that distant look
You take me where I have to stay

I couldn't hear those three things you were saying
Cause my mind was away to a big black lie
Of the fact that I were trying
To be something that as yet you're not

Look out people (?)
That should be all alone
Meanwhile say keep away
We don't need no more things to pay

You told me you'd be my friend if only I would
Let you to be close to me
It was to hard to believe
So I let you go
Bye-ey-ey
Let me walk right on by
You didn't even try to know my name
You let me slip right there by
You didn't eve try to know my game

You gotta keep tryin'

Who ever think about my all night crying
That would be to keep trying

Told you so many times before
I feel I should tell you once again
You have to live with my love to me
I know you now more than a friend

More than a friend could ever be
Like a cool cool prison that cuts your side
She drove to the deep blue fields
Don't know my troubles and mysteries

Stone believer
Stone believer
Stone believer
Stone believer

She made me a stone believer
Stone believer
I heard about the things I've been missing
Stone believer
Like that moment I hear the good word
Stone believer
Saying if I should want by insisted
Stone believer
When I heard the good word
Stone believer
I heard about the things I've been missing
Stone believer

You're such a just little believer
Stone believer
Cause you is the leaders of the clothes we trust
Stone believer
It's such a just little believer
Stone believer
It's like all time rush
Stone believer
Wooooo
Stone believer
Wooooo
Stone believer
