When everybody leaves you lonely, times are worse then sad
And the world is falling on ya head
Just remember for all you know, good or bad, come what may
You're gonna live tomaro, if you don't die today.

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

Now the fear got in me, it's got in me deep.
It's where it's gonna stay, and never leave.
Someone come lay my worry, someone come kill my pain.
Someone come and put me on my feet again.

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

We have to love one and other,
That's what the good man say.
But I have too much trouble going 'round my head.
Someone come and pick up my love
Take it all away
Feels like I'll break down tomaro if I don't die today

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love
Ay.
