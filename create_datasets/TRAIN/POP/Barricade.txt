You've done it
You've taken the final guess
Your confession to a man who was wearing a dress
A new day
To disperse the clouds
Or police the release of more bombers in crowds
You've been fighting for ages but what for 
You've been fighting for ages but what for 
You've been fighting for ages but what for 
Someone tell me
You've done it
You've broken the final curse
Your confessions to a man who was driving a hearse
A new day
A dead weight to hold
You'll be responsible for the children that you have told
You've been fighting for ages but what for 
You've been fighting for ages but what for 
And your forefathers left by the backdoor
Someone tell me
Fear and hate is taking me over
Fear and hate is taking me over
Fear and hate is taking me over
Fear and hate 
You've done it 
You turn out the final lights
Your confessions to a man who was reading last rites
A new day
Another parade
Adding fuel to the fire of the memory they saved
You've been fighting for ages but what for 
You've been fighting for ages but what for 
And religion is left by the backdoor
Someone tell me
Too frozen
Too frozen to repent
You'll never get to heaven with a violent intent
