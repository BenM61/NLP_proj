I believe in you
Do you believe in me?
Please say you do
Oh, can't you see that?

Every time I try to live alone
I find that I can't make it on my own
So please
Bless my dreams

All God's children
Right or wrong, weak or strong
All God's children
Old and young, everyone needs real love

Right out from the start
I was taught to listen to my heart
So when I tell you
This is real

I know, I'm not mistaken
Help me heal
Don't leave my heart to break in two
Without you

All God's children
Right or wrong, weak or strong
All God's children
Old and young, everyone needs real love
Needs real love, needs real love

One and all
[Incomprehensible] no exceptions
When you call
Baby, let your love shine through
Bright and true

All God's children
Right or wrong, weak or strong
All God's children
Old and young, everyone

All God's children
Right or wrong, weak or strong
All God's children
Old and young, everyone

All God's children
Glad or sad, good or bad
All God's children
Dark or light, day or night

They need real love
They need real love
