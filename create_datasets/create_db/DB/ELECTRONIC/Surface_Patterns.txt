On to
On to the mindfield
Into
Into the hole
Chemical
Chemical cauldron
Location still unknown

Out of the tunnel, into the light
World destruction, now seems right
A barren landscape of burning hell
Within our dreams
We feel the spell

Watching
Watching their minds blow
Sinking
Lower than low
Hooded mutations
Ride by nights
Scouring the earth
For impure life
They seek they search
And will destroy
Immoral acts they will employ

Constricting
Freedom of movement
Convulsing
Body in pain

Stigmatized by the
Sound of fear
The land is full of chemical tears
Communication has broken down
Exterminated body parts
On the ground
