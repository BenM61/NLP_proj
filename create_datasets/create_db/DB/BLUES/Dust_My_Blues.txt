I'm gonna get up in the mornin',
I believe I'll dust my broom
I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man you been lovin',
Girlfriend, can get my room

I'm gon' write a letter,
Telephone every town I know
Telephone every town I know
If I can't find her in West Helena,
She must be in East Monroe, I know

I don't want no woman,
Wants every downtown man she meet
Wants every downtown man she meet
She's a no good doney,
They shouldn't 'low her on the street

I believe, I believe I'll go back home
I believe, I believe I'll go back home
You can mistreat me here, babe,
But you can't when I go home

And I'm gettin' up in the morning,
I believe I'll dust my broom
I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man that you been lovin',
Girlfriend, can get my room

I'm gon' call up Chiney,
She is my good girl over there
She is my good girl over there
If I can't find her on Philippine's Island,
She must be in Ethiopia somewhere
