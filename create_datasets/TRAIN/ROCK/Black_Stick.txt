My heart is a muscle and it pumps blood
Like a big old black steam train
My veins are the tracks
And the city is my brain
My stomach is the ocean and it swallows up the sun
At the end of a summer's day
My breast like a breeze
Blows all those storm clouds
Away
Ahhh  (x4)
My head is the city and it houses all the thoughts
And speech that I have
And the mayor of the city says the city seems ain't half bad.
My arms could be weapons or instruments of love
My legs are skyscrapers, they tower
Above you
Ahhh (x4)
My heart is a muscle and it pumps blood
Like a big old black steam train
My veins are the tracks
And the city is my brain
My stomach is the ocean and it swallows up the sun
At the end of a summer's day
My breast like a breeze, blows
All those storm clouds
Away
Ahhh (x4)
I could be your whole world (x4
