Close your eyes
And I will sing a song for you
I will always be there
I will always love you

And while you're dreaming
I will row your boat ashore
I will always be there for you

Across the sky and back again
We get torn and who knows when
My heart had begun to melt
All because of you

I still fall apart
When you are in my arms like this
You gave me the perfect gift

Don't be scared to face your fears
Don't be scared to spread your wings
Don't be scared to share your tears
'Cause love is everything

And when you're dancing
Don't forget to dance alone
I will always be there
If you remember all of this

You'll give me the perfect gift
You gave me the perfect gift
