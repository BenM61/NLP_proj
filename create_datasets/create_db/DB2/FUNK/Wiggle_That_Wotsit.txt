Wiggle that 
Wiggle that wot 
Wiggle that wotsit 

Wiggle that wotsit 
Shakin' that shimmy 
Bring it up to me 
Ring a ding a ling me 
Turn me on 

Wiggle that wotsit 
Shake it up, shake it down 
Serve me up another round 
Rub a dub hug me 
Turn me on 

Lord, you know how crazy it makes me 
You turn my insides out 
The pleasure in the pain is so excruciating 
It makes me wanna shout 
Give me a hard time

Ring a ding a ling me 
Turn me on 

Wiggle that wotsit 
Shake it up, shake it down 
Serve me up another round 
Rub a dub hug me 
Turn me on

My wheel's ain't gonna touch the ground 
Heaven knows how I'm gonna cope with the situation
