I get away from city life
Leave behind trouble and strife
Sweet Lorraine, she's my best friend, she is my wife
We fell in love all over again
On the other side of paradise

My man, Cool Breeze, he take it easy
He buy a castle where it's nice and breezy
He work hard for a long, long time
I think of Iree, got peace of mind satisfied with life
On the other side of paradise

I met my brother, black as coffee bean
His smile is bright and his soul is clean
He had the truest eyes I've ever seen
I knew right then he was my friend
On the other side of paradise

We fell in love under the stars above
The moon shining bright in paradise

My brother said, please buy me Bami
I'm saving up for a ticket to Miami
Don't get me wrong, man, I love my home
But money short, cost of living long
And I dream of lights, I dream of your city lights
On the other side of paradise

I get away from city life
Leave behind trouble and strife
Sweet Lorraine, she's my best friend, she is my wife
We fell in love all over again
On the other side of paradise

On the other side of paradise
On the other side of paradise
On the other side, on the other side
On the other side of paradise

On the other side of paradise
On the other side of paradise
On the other side, on the other side
On the other side of paradise

On the other side of paradise
