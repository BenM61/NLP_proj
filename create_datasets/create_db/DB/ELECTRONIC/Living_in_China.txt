What would Chairman Mao say, if he knew what they're doing to his wife today
What did China do? She ordered out for submarines instead of Chinese food
China fields of rice, modern man no longer evil he's a paradise
What did the Chairman want?

The gang of four, trying to make it as a western band
China, what do you need
You've got everything from your scruffy head to dirty feet
China you want to dance
You're wearing makeup and listening to Adam and the Ants

All the little people that are living in China
