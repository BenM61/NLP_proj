Estimated time of arrival 9.30 a.m.
Been up before the sun and now I'm tired before I even begin.
(Now you're flying) I got so much work in front of me,
(Really flying) it stretches out far as the eye can see.
I can see.

Spend half my life in airports doing crosswords and attempting tosleep,
And when the bar is open then you'll often find me warming aseat.
(Now you're flying) I never find a place where I can stay
(Really flying) I'd rather be a thousand miles away.
Thousand miles away.

Working for yourself sometimes ain't all that it's cracked up tobe.
It can be as lonely at the top as at the bottom of that corporatetree
(Now you're flying) I'm told I'm going places - who can say?
(Really flying) I might arrive but I'll be gone the very nextday.
I must be on my way
A thousand miles away.

Promised to myself someday I'd take the time and try to makesense
Out of all those opportunities I've lost from trying to sit onthe fence
(Now you're flying) But right now I've got no time foryesterday
(Really flying) Yesterday's a thousand miles away.
A thousand miles away.

What was that that you were trying to say ?
I guess I was a thousand miles away.
Sing it again.
