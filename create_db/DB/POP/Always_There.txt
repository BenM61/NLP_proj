Why was it you? I don't understand
And nothing shows me why
Maybe someday I'll see you again
And tell you how much I've missed you.

Things happen and no-one knows why
If I'd raised this moment in time
If I'd have known I would be by your side
If I'd have known I would have said goodbye.

(Chorus):
You were always there
Even though it seems you're far away
I miss you more than words
I'm missin you more everyday.
Where are you in my life?
Where's the song in my heart?
Where's the peace of my mind?
And strength for me to carry on

We will all move on
And you will always stay in our heart
And any minute that passes by
We won't let the memory fade away
Time will heal a litte everyday

(Chorus):
You were always there
Even though it seems you're far away
I miss you more than words
I'm missin you more everyday.
Where are you in my life?
Where's the song in my heart?
Where's the peace of my mind?
And strength for me to carry on

Then the somethin fade to nothin
And the reason's go
Life must go on
Days will pass by
Tears will find happy memories.

(Chorus):
You were always there
Even though it seems you're far away
I miss you more than words
I'm missin you more everyday.
Where are you in my life?
Where's the song in my heart?
Where's the peace of my mind?
And strength for me to carry on

And strength for me to carry on..
