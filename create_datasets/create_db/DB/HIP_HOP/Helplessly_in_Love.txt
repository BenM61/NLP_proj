Never knew the closing of a door
Could open up a heart
Since the day we met I needed you
(needed you)
In my life

To do and say the things that I
Needed to feel and hear
I'm just

Helplessly in love
(ooh)
Don't know what to do, I'm
Helplessly in love
And the love in my heart
Is for you

I've always been a man who took control
But now I'm so helpless
Can't find the nerve, I get emotional
When you're around

And it's hard for me to tell you or
To show you what I feel
I'm just

Helplessly in love
(helpless)
(ooh)
Don't know what to do, I'm
Helplessly in love
And the love in my heart
Is for you
Baby, baby

I just can't understand
No I don't understand
Why my feelings get so confused
Why I'm like that
Why I love you like I do

So I picked out these three words that best
Describe the way I feel

I'm just..
Helplessly in love
(ooooh)
Don't know what to do, I'm
Helplessly in love
(uh, oh)
Don't know what to do, I'm
Helplessly in love
And the love in my heart
Is for you

Helplessly in love
(baby, baby)
(ooh)
Don't know what to do, I'm
Helplessly in love
And the love in my heart

Is for you
