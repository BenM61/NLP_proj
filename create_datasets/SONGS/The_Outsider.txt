Help me if you can
It's just that this is
Not the way I'm wired
So could you please

Help me understand why
You've given in to all these
Reckless dark desires you're
Lying to yourself again
Suicidal imbecile
You're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
Over this, why do you
Wanna throw it away like this
Such a mess, well I don't wanna watch you

Disconnect and self destruct one
Bullet at a time
What's your rush now, everyone will have his day to die

Medicated, drama queen
Picture perfect, numb belligerence
Narcissistic, drama queen, craving fame and all it's decadence

Lying through your teeth again
Suicidal imbecile
You're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
Over this, why do you wanna
Throw it away like this
Such a mess, well I don't wanna watch you

Disconnect and self destruct one
Bullet at a time
What's your rush now, everyone will have his day to die

They were right about you

Lying to my face again
Suicidal imbecile
You're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
Over this, why do you wanna
Throw it away like this
Such a mess, over this, over this

Disconnect and self destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your hurry, everyone will have his day to die
If you choose to pull the trigger, should your drama prove sincere
Do it somewhere far away from here
