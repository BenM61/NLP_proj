Haters, haters, these niggas is haters!
And I made myself so easy to love

Yeah, yeah,
How much they hate it, very
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung but I Springer, Jerry
Don't try to this at home, results may vary
King like T.I. but in the Chi-lary

Whova? Hova, both ofa'
American gangstas you choose whose, colda'
Rappers get nasty in the booth,
But I'm gross, I cant even stomach myself
Ulcer, more realer cause I'm closer
Had girlies in girldles weighing more than they suppose ta
Posera, no sir ,my hustle, so Russell,
I stretch work, yoga
You know I got it down dog,
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off
It ain't nothing for me to knock nails off,
But these M-C's are prayin' for my downfall,
They just, haters
I wave at you, I'm so player,
I'll never be done I'm so rare'r

We killin' the game its not faiyr
You motherfuckers stay right theyre
'cause we too high up in the ayir
We blastin' off just like a layzer
Nigga pewoon, pewoon, pewoon
Give me rap, give me room, room, room
D-B-9 like vroom, vroom, vroom
Young Hov what we doin', doin', doin'

We ballin', bitches, eatin' y'all food leavin' dishes
Why these niggas always talkin' leir talk Ye
Why I never see them at the clear port Ye
Why I always hear they at the airport
Why I fly daily like I'm in the Air Force
Therefore, please stop talkin' my ears off
Millionaire talk, you haters,
You mad at me cause your paper,
"you need to get his mother fuckin' weight up", waita
I ain't done, name one thing that I ain't done
It hurts when you say that I ain't the one, you haters
How do I gain your favor, I need to know cause I cayre
I need you to love me I sweayr, look heyre
See Ye is, runnin' the Chi like Gale Sayers,
I'm runnin' new york, I got the mayor, on my pager
You cant fade us, you hate us
I need you, stay theyre
I breath you, like ayir,
Ayir
Ya, ya, ya, yayer
Ya, ya, ya, yayer
Where are my haters,
I love all my haters
Love all my haters
I love all my haters
Where are my haters, hater
Yayer
