I don't wanna waste a lifetime chasing pots of gold
I don't wanna miss the sunshine standing in the cold
I don't wanna be the one who's left behind
I wanna catch a glimpse of life

C'mon darlin', now we've started something that we've both gotta
want to see right through
But I know darlin' that I would rather give it up than
waste these precious moments with you, baby that won't do

'Cause I don't wanna waste a lifetime chasing pots of gold
I don't wanna miss the sunshine standing in the cold
I don't wanna be the one who's left behind
I wanna catch a glimpse of life
No i don't wanna be the one who lets you down
With you I couldn't bear to live without

C'mon darlin', now we've started something that we've both gotta
See right through
But I know darlin' that I would rather give it up than
waste these precious moments with you,
no baby that won't do, oh baby that won't do

'Cause I don't wanna waste a lifetime chasing pots of gold
I don't wanna miss the sunshine standing in the cold
I don't wanna be the one who's left behind
I wanna catch a glimpse of life

'Cause I don't wanna waste a lifetime chasing pots of gold
I don't wanna miss the good times standing in the cold
No i don't wanna be the one who lets you down
With you I couldn't bear to live without

So c'mon darlin', now we've started something that we've both gotta
see right through
