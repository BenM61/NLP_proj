I I've been watching you 
I think I want to know ya 
I I am dangerous 
Girl I want to show ya 

My jungle love 
I think I want to know ya 
Jungle love 
Girl I need to show ya 

You you've got a pretty car 
I think I want to drive it 
I Drive a little dangerous 
Take you to my crib and rip you off 
Huh 

Oh 
I think I want to know ya oh we oh we oh 
Girl I need to show ya on baby 
Where's your guts 
You want to make love or what 

Jungle Love 

I want to take you to my cage 
Lock you up and hide the key 
 
You are only getting part of pig 
Cause if you're hungry 
Take a bite of me 

My jungle love 
I think I want to know ya 
Jungle love 
Girl I need to show ya 

My jungle love 
I think I want to know ya 
Jungle love oh we oh we oh 
Girl I need to show ya 

Hey Jesse Now Jerome
