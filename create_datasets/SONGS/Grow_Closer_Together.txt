In my hometown lived a quiet girl
Together we always seemed to be
We were just good friends
Then something deep within
My heart kept a-tellin' me

Be closer together
For you might love one another
You'll be closer together
For you might love one another

You must take (?) to your heart
And never let her get too far apart
She's the girl that you love
She's the girl that you love

Closer together, closer together
For the first time I
Looked in to her eyes
Was a-long before I realized
Sincere and true
They said 'I love you'
And at last her heart was saying too

Be closer together
For you might love one another
You'll be closer together
For you might love one another

You've got to take (?) to your heart
And never let her get too far apart
She's the girl that you love
She's the girl that you love

Closer together, closer together
Come on, let's be closer together
Come on, let's be closer together
Come on, let's be closer together
Come on, let's be closer together
