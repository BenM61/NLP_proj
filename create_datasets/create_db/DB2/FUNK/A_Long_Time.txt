Oh, Henry was a renegade
Never liked to play it safe
One component at a time
There's got to be a better way
Oh people came from miles around
Searching for a steady job
Welcome to the Motor Town
Boomin' like an atom bomb

Oh, Henry was the end of the story,
Then everything went wrong
And we'll return it to its former glory
But it just takes so long

It's gonna take a long time
It's gonna take it but we'll make it one day
It's gonna take a long time
It's gonna take it but we'll make it one day

Oh, Barry had a record store
Started up a studio
Oh, West Grand Boulevard
Turned it into solid gold
Oh, people all around the world
Tunin' into radios
Welcome to the Motor Town
Buckle up 'cause here we go

Oh, Barry was the end of the story,
Then everything went wrong
And we'll return it to its former glory
But it just takes so long

It's gonna take a long time
It's gonna take it but we'll make it one day
It's gonna take a long time
It's gonna take it but we'll make it one day

Wherever we're going
It's gonna take it but we'll make it one day
Whatever we're doing
It's gonna take it but we'll make it one day
However you want it
It's gonna take it but we'll make it one day
