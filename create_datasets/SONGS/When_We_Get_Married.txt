Darlin' oh-oh-oh

When we get married we'll have a big celebration
Send invitations to all our friends and relations
We'll have a ball, dancing and all
When we get married.

When the bells ring and tell the world I'm taking your hand
Folks from all over will come to see the wedding we've planned
We'll have a ball, dancing and all
When we get married (when we get married).

(We'll have a time) we'll have a time
(We'll dance and dine) and darling, we'll be oh so gay--mm
(We'll have a ball) we'll have a ball
(Dancing and all) and darling we'll be as one.

Just wait and see--our wedding day is not very far
Old folks will whisper and say how lovely we both are
We'll have a ball, dancing and all-l-l
When we get married (oh) mm-mm-mm (oh, oh, oh, oh)
