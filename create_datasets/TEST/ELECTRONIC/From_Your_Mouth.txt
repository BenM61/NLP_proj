Sometimes life's not fair, I correct myself I mean
All the time I feel like complaining but it only bothers you
The things I do they make your blood run cold

There's a lot of things that no one likes but, I want the
Answers now, must be all confused somehow, did you
Say what I heard about? I've heard a million
Things gossips being sent to me I don't wanna
Believe it, until I hear it from your mouth 

Tell me why are you friendly to my face, what I mean
Is barely nice, when I'm not around hear you like to put me down
Embarrassment is what I get
