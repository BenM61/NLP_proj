In the sea of the night
I was preserved
Kiss the meaning goodbye
If you're wondering
And a key which would be now going
Throughout the bay

When I see it, will I will I know?
I fear no information
I'm following how it seems
In the present dreams and I need more
Of the world, speak of speak of
Moon so full is your reflection
Come and see how it means
This present seems invaluable

How the spruce of the night
You will outlast
The illusory gaze
And its wandering
And a freedom of a certainty
Cell in your brain

When I see it, will I will I know?
I fear no information
I'm following how it seems
In the present dreams and I need more
Of the words, speak of speak of
Bowl so full is your affection
Come and see how it means
This present seems invaluable

When I see it, will I will I know?
I fear no information
I'm following how it seems
In the present dreams and I need more
Of the words, speak of speak of
Bowl so full is your affection
Come and see how it means
This present seems invaluable
