I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl you that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

And if I don't let you know then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
There ain't no other for me it's only you
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
There ain't no other for me it's only you

I know anybodys gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got so much to care for
Maybe all you need is a shoulder to cry on
If thats a fact then I'll be more than you ever could dream of

If all you need is my time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you want me baby
I wanna stay by your side, be there to cool you off
And let you know, know, know

I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
There ain't no other for me it's only you

If all you need is my time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you want me baby
I wanna stay by your side, be there to cool you off
And let you know, know, know

I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
There ain't no other for me it's only you

Feel like something could be going on
Feel like something could be, could be
Feel like something could be going on
There ain't no other for me it's only you
