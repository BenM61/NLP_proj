I ran from my house
That cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
From my mother who haunts me
Even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops
I ran to the sky
Out to the lake
Into the rain
That matted my hair
And soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and ran
I was looking for me
I ran past the churches
And the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards
And the lady that never talks
Up into the hills
I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath
And thought about your death
I ran to the lake
Up into the hills
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All the forgotten names
I tasted the rain
I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels
I tasted my fears
And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
The black sky opened up
Blinding me

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran
I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes
And up to the hill
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I smelt her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay

I ran and I ran
I'm still running away
