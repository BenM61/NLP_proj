All alone, I open my eyes

Wild ride
Hold your fire
I'm not about to die
Keep back
Let in some air I dare lie down
To stare at the sky
I am wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue
I am wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue
Flat mark
High tide
Frantic to stay afloat
Stay calm
Let in some air I dare lie down
To stare at the sky
I am wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue
I am wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue
From above
 I am so small
So fast
I move I move
The light the light
Here comes the tide
I am wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue
I am wide open
Reaching forever
I fly into the blue
With water surrounding me
                I am wide open
                Reaching forever
And I fly into the blue
                Into the blue
I am wide open
                I am wide open
Reaching forever
                Reaching forever
I fly
                I fly into the blue
I am wide open
I am wide open
Reaching forever
                Reaching forever
I fly into the blue
                Into the blue
I am wide open
                I am wide open
