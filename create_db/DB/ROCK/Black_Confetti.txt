Tears at my heart, rips at my soul
Calling you out, lose control
Open your mouth, take my sin
Look at you on your knees again

I didn't want to let you change my mind
So everyone gets everything all the time

Party you had, time of your life
Black confetti filled the sky
Oh, this place, what kind of hell
Have I made for myself?

Catch me as I'm losing focus
Everything's a blur
Wrap your arms around my neck
And turn

Late at night, the party's done
The sad broke mess that we've become
Basking in the afterglow
My whole life's a fantasy show for no one

In my dreams you fade away from me
Through time, through space and emotion
In my dreams you fade away from me
Through time, through space and emotion
