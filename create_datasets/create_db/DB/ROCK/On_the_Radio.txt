Back when I can barley remember
I was tuning in every night
Your mother wouldn't like it was happening
Mixing up a soup so right, it was alright

Next day there was I believing
That I could ride the airwaves too
Heaven knows what I was thinking
Didn't matter what I tried to do

So tell me what i wanna know
What did I do to make it so?
'Cause I know you never gonna
play this on the radio

Record company got me a plugger
A charming man in every way
So I paid him lots of money to tell me
It's been a tough week, what can I say

Were you killed by video?
'Cause I can't get you on the phone
So I know you're never gonna get this on the radio

People come to watch the show
'Cause my aim is straight and true
Twenty years I've made a living at this
No thanks to you and the TV too! F*ck You

I know I never went to art school
I was never in the NME
I got no chance of sleeping with Kate Moss
What the hell is wrong with me?

Who did I forget to blow?
Should I go on a reality show?
Maybe then you'd vote for me
'Cause I can't get on the BBC

The playlist was my Grail of gold
I tried and failed to sell my soul
So I know you're never gonna hear this
playing on the radio

Ain't gonna hear it
playing on the radio
