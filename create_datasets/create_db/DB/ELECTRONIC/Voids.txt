I'm in a cold grey room
With a forty watt light bulb
Sick to death of it all
I've got forty-three channels on this TV
I keep watching science fiction, horror films, animation

Anything to make me feel
Anything to make me feel at all
Anything to make me feel
Anything to make me feel at all

I keep looking at the paint peeling off my walls
I keep looking at the random shape they form
I need stimulation
Visual complication
I gotta get out of this hole

Anything to make me feel
Anything to make me feel at all
Anything to make me feel
Anything to make me feel at all

Under the strip light, in the mirror
I can see my eyes
Recall a new set
I almost want it to happen
Now I know I'm in in control...

Anything to make me feel
Anything to make me feel at all
Anything to make me feel
Anything to make me feel at all
