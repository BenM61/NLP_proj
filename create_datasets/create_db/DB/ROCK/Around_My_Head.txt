Ooh, oh

I don't know why I got these feelings, yeah,
I just can't seem to get away from
Can you dig it?

You may never see it
No, you will find it falling off my tongue
I take it down town, finally lose it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah ah

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair
Do you-oh?
You-oh?

Are you on the flip side?
You know I took the long way round
Cos all I really am is a homemade elevator

Blinded by your sunshine, put you on a plane to Paris
Lay my cards down on the table

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah ah

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair

Can't find a reason for these feelings-
Got enough of them
This guy he told me,
Said he's gonna send me something lovely

But even still at times I wonder
What you're thinking of me
You're prob'ly sure I lost my mind,
Oh mind, Oh mind, Oh mind, Oh mind

I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair

I don't think it's very polite
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair

Ah ooh!

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah ah

Oh!
