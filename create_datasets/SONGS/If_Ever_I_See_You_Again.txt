I've wondered all my life
How I could ever let you go
There's not a lot of change in my life
But one thing that I know

If ever I see you again
Maybe this time it well work out alright
Maybe this we won't say goodbye but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
If ever I see you again

Warm sleepy morning working up next to you
Feeling you close by side
Nothing on earth has ever felt better
Then the feelings I've felt deep inside
Sometimes it seems that I never lost you
And that your not really gone
Cause I had this dream
This wonderful dream
It just goes on and on

And If ever I see you again
Maybe this time it well work out alright
Maybe this we won't say goodbye but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
If ever I see you again...
