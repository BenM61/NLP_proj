A summer love is beautiful
But it's not enough
To satisfy emotions
That are shared between us

A winter love is cozy
But I need so much more
It just intensifies my wants
To have a love that endures

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right

An autumn love is special
At this time of the year
But when the leaves are gone
Does that love disappear

I never underestimate the new love of spring
But I'm glad to say in my heart
I know my love's lasting

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you

With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right

'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season nears
I still love you
With all my heart
And I want to be with you
Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
