You've given into tempation's demands
By a cruel slight of hand, you could lose it all
Cold and alone when your luck leaves you stranded
Walk out empty handed; greed takes is toll
You moved too fast
You spoke too soon
And now it's too late

Fate for the taking; you gamble with love
Got to lose to win what you're dreaming of
Mistakes you're making put my love on hold
While you're out fortune-faking, my heart grows cold
You moved too fast
You spoke too soon
And my love won't wait

People are talking about you
Rumors are spreading; tell me they're not true
I'm tired of waiting, it's too late
You let your love circulate
You let your love circulate
