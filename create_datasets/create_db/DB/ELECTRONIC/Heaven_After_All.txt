You turn me on and off, you're in control
One bite is not enough, I want it all
When you hold me close you make me see
That the best things always come for free

There's no other who can take your place
Take my breath away like in outer space
Can't contain myself when we're skin on skin
Don't you dare to stop what you're doing to me

If you call my name
Wherever you go I'm gonna follow
And we will never have to be alone
Cause this could be heaven after all
After all

The very words you say will start a fire
Spreading sweetness, passion takes me higher
I can't believe that this is really real
All this happiness belongs to me

There's no other who can take your place
Take my breath away like in outer space
Can't contain myself when we're skin on skin
Don't you dare to stop what you're doing to me

If you call my name
Wherever you go I'm gonna follow
And we will never have to be alone
Cause this could be heaven after all
After all

You turn me on and off, you're in control
One bite is not enough, I want it all
When you hold me close you make me see
That the best things always come for free

If you call my name
Wherever you go I'm gonna follow
And we will never have to be alone
Cause this could be heaven after all

If you call my name
Wherever you go I'm gonna follow
And we will never have to be alone
Cause this could be heaven after all
After all
