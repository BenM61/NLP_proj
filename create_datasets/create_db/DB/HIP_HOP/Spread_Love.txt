First of all, we the one and only Infamous
Everybody want to use the name soundin' all lame
We come up in the party with them shanks and things
Have you curled up on the floor feelin' the pain
And nine times out ten we ain't even start the shit
We finish it then they want to press charges
Plus everybody and their mother want to act tough
Till they discover how fast  a nigga leave them under white covers 

Was a thumper till he met the forty thunder
Now I feel strange when I walk by his mother
It's fucked up that's how the ball bounce
The cookie crumbles
That's what the guns do dead you
On the humble, but god fogive me niggas tryin to hit me
What I'm supposed to do you talk about my life 
And a nigga got a lot to loose
So I tuck the heaters then proceed to move
We a mob for real, you an example

[Chorus]
You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin
And I'd be god damned if you shot me 
You need to spread love not war
'Cause you won't feel safe
Comin out your crib, knowin that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids
How they need you alive for they're guidance
You need to spread love not war
'Cause death hurts whole families 
Imagine it's your  moms that grieves

Two in the neck, yes you will, 
if you not feelin me yet outta respect
Can't stand it man, you niggas is set
Sweatin hard ain't do shit, but run your list
When a nigga get confronted 
All he do is take the fifth
Not the long, talk about the four
Niggas is raw you ain't know, now you know
Leakin down on the floor
Never a need for my words 
Believe what you heard
Never flash a gat and go bust it
That shit is absurd cause I be right back 
To my brother say word you got to drive, no doubt 
I cock it bein tougher for herbs
'Cause the plot is power and I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute
Till I move on you cowards
Direct drama to us
Infamous be the ones and we rowdy
Million dollar ballad make an album, get classes

[Chorus]

Look around your surrounded by the M-O-B-D-E-E-P
Infamous niggas rep Queensbridge housing P's
My dunns come through with the big long chains
Plus we got bullets, to blow your brains
Niggas learn when they feel the pain
Know what I'm sayin? Straight like that
Standin ovation with max, we clap niggas for less
Splash niggas for laughs shift the game
Raise your odds
I need 93 thousand for 16 bars
Put out the movie, the hoods rush the stores
700 thousand from out the doors
We the most thorough
Need I say more?
The hoes love the morgue
Cause we so raw
Handcuff you whore
When P come through the scene
Glowin like a black light on white clothing

[Chorus: x2]

You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin 
And I'd be god damned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
'Cause I don't give a f*ck (echoing)
You should spread love not war
