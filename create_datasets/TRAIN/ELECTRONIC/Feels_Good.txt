6:30 come, I'm waiting on the floor
Waiting for me Mary, no, Mary Tyler Moore
I love her, she love no one else
I say, I could be your master, you could serve yourself

I do this thing, I do, I run inside your brain
I know you can't feel it 'cause you feel no the pain
I say a 1, a 1, 2, 3
Diggity-doo, come and watch

Oh, na, na, na
Feels good when it should
Oh, na, na, na
(Another junkie in the neighborhood)

One lost soul drifting out to sea
But if ya got vanilla style
(Bo, bo)
It feels good, that's understood, but don't forget

No love for pepper posse and I'll make that bet
That you ain't got no style, ain't got no reggae
And there are words that I just don't say
Take a pick, you've got a selection
But if you want some of this protection

Oh, na, na, na
Feels good, when it should
Sit back it takes a while

Listen, there are stories tales and lies
Some attract rumors, some attract lies
Got this coffee, so bring me your cup
One more pot so we can stay up

Understand, that there must be more in this band
You think you could, well I know I can
So watcha want, paper or plastic?
Take all you need 'cause we're sick of that shit
