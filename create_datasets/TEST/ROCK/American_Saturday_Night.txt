Whoa whoa
She's got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listen to the Beatles singin' 'Back in the U-S-S-R'
Yeah she's goin' around the world tonight
But she ain't leavin' here
She's just going to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair

It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Spanish moss in the moonlight
Just another American Saturday night

There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi
They've got Canadian bacon on they're pizza pie
They've got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel Light
It's like were all livin' in a big ol' cup
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up

It's a French kiss, Italian ice
Margaritas in the moonlight (whoa)
Just another American Saturday night

You know everywhere there's something they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
My great great great granddaddy stepped off of that ship
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this

You know everywhere has somethin' they're known for
Although usually it washes up on our shores
Little Italy, and Chinatown, sittin' there side by side
Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!

It's a French kiss, Italian ice,
Spanish moss in the moonlight
Just another American, just another American,
Its just another American Saturday night
