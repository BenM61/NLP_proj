Yeah, mon, Reggae night
You live and you love
So turn on your light
Make it shine bright
Now listen to this
Jam it

Reggae night
We come together when the feeling's right
Reggae night
And we'll be jamming till the morning light, 
Mmm, hmm, oh, oh

Many river calls
Got to get my things, got to catch this ride
Got to look my best
Cause I know they'll be mashing it up tonight, 
Mmm, hmm, oh, oh

So don't miss out on this session here, oh

There'll be people coming from 
The north and south and east and west
So you better look your best, man
Now lightening strikes at 8, 
So you better not be late
For this rub-a-dubbing, rockin', 
Jammin' fun, fun loving, yeah
