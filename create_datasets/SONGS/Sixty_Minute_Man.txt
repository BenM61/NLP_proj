Well, listen here, girls, I'm telling you now,
They call me loving Dan,
I'll rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man.

And if you don't believe I'm all I say,
Come up and take my hand.
As soon as I leave you go, you'll cry
"Oh yeah, he's a sixty-minute man!"

There'll be fifteen minutes of kissing,
And then you'll holler, "Danny boy, please don't stop!"
There'll be fifteen minutes of teasing, fifteen minutes of pleasing,
Fifteen minutes of blowing my top (mop! mop! mop!)

Well, if your man ain't treating you right, 
Come up and see your Dan.
I'll rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man.

Sixty (minute man)
Well they call me (loving Dan)
I'll rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man.

Sixty (minute man)
Well they call me (loving Dan)
I'll rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man.

There'll be fifteen minutes of kissing,
And then you'll holler, "Danny boy, please don't stop!"
There'll be fifteen minutes of teasing, fifteen minutes of pleasing,
Fifteen minutes of blowing my top (mop! mop! mop!)

Well, if your man ain't treating you right, 
Come up and see your Dan.
I'll rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man.
Oh yeah! Sixty minute,
Rocking, rolling, ramming, jamming all night long

I'm a sixty-minute man.
