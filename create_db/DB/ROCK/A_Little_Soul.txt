Hey, man
How come you treat your woman so bad?
That's not the way you do it
No, no, no, you shouldn't do it like that
I could show you how to do it right
I used to practice every night on my wife, now she's gone
Yeah, she's gone
You see, her mother and me
We never got along that well, you see

I'd love to help you
But everybody's telling me you look like me
But please don't turn out like me, you look like me
But you're not like me I know
I had one, two, three,
Four shots of happiness, I look like a big man
But I've only got a little soul
I only got a little soul

Yeah, I wish I could be an example
Wish I could say I stood up for you
And fought for what was right
But I never did
I just wore my trenchcoat and stayed out every single night
You think I'm joking?
Try me
Try me
Yeah come on, try me tonight
I did what was wrong though I knew what was right
I've got no wisdom that I want to pass on
Just don't hang round here, no, I'm telling you son
You don't want to know me
Oh, that's just what everybody's telling me

And everybody's telling me you look like me
But please don't turn into me
You look like me
But you're not like me I hope
I have run away form the one thing that I ever made, now
Only wish that I could show you
Wish I could show a little soul
Wish I could show a little soul
