There's times when real people let me down, 
when the temperature falls to zero. 
I curl up by the fire with a good book, 
and for awhile I am a superhero. 
You really need to be a superhero. 
'Cause many times people will hurt you 
and try to mess you 'round 
And anyway, my comic book heroes won't let me down.
Comic Book Heroes...
