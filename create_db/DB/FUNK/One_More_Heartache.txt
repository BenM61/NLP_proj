Oh, one more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like a camel with a heavy pack
One last straw was added
Said it broke the camel's back
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't take it

One more heartache
It would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high
And then let me down
Like the house you built with toothpicks
Stacked upon the kitchen table
One more toothpick tore it down
The foundation was not able
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
No, baby
Oh, believe me

One more heartache
Is too much load
I'm fed up with the heartache
One more and I'll explode
Like a toy balloon that's filled
With as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to break
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
I can't take it
Oh, baby
Don't do it
Oh, honey, ooh, baby
