Open here
Take a peek before tomorrow
It was the best in the shop and the very first one to go
Once you start you never stop

You were once the golden boy of the golden days
Everybody wanted a piece of you
Turning on the city lights like magic
Everybody wanted a piece of you
For themselves

Open here
Take a rest before tomorrow
Too fond of the bar and the very last one to go
Once you start you never stop

You were warned, to play the queen was dangerous
Everybody wanted to be with you
Who could have been there to relieve you from the fame?
When anyone who was anyone, they fell for you
In love with you

Open here
Take a peek before tomorrow
Too fond of the part of the very last one to go
Once you start you never stop
