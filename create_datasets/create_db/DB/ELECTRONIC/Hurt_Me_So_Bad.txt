You hurt me so bad
I was building a palace in my mind
Just for you and me
I made you the center of my world 

Though you couldn't see
I thought we'd walk together
The road would run forever
I can follow no further

Til I get commitment from you 
What ya gonna do?
Oh baby
What kind of answer is maybe? 

Oh, oh-oh-oh
You hurt me so bad
Oh baby
Thought you were the last train to safety 

Oh, oh-oh-oh
You hurt me so bad
In this world of indifference 
I expected so much more from you 

But the more that I listen
The less I believe is true
I've got understanding
Now my heart's commanding

I can follow no further
Til I get an answer from you
What ya gonna do?
Oh baby...
