Way down in the jungle of Bambooland
There's a place so wild you just can't stand
Spider-monkeys swinging in the top of the trees
And the crocodiles are rocking in the Crockodile-creek

Doing the crockodile-tail, bamboo-wail, crockodile-hop it's a rockabillybop
Everybody's doing the crockodile-tail
You better watch out when you're near that place
There'll be nothing left of your pretty face
Gorilla's are stomping on eachothers chests
You better start running and don't take a rest
A blue-nosed baboon started up a fight
He kept on jumping in the pale moonlight
Lions they are dancing with their tail in the air
Well the elephants are bouncing almost everywhere
Deep down in the jungles of Bambooland
There's a place so wild you just can't stand
Spider-monkeys swinging in the top of the trees
And the crocodiles are rocking in the Crockodile-creek
