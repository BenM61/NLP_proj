Home girls, attention you must pay
So listen close to what I say
Don't take this a simple rhyme
'Cause this type of thing happens all the time
Now what would you do if a stranger said hi?
Would you dis him or would you reply?
If you answer there is a chance
That you'd become a victim of circumstance
Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth
Or else I'm-a have to show and prove
You are what you are, I am what I am
It just so happens that most men are

Tramp (What'd ya call me?)

Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude?
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood
I know a guy like that, girl
He thinks he's God's gift to the world
You know that kind, excited all the time
With nothing but sex on the mind
I'm no stunt, on me he can't front
I know the real deal, I know what they want
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!)
'Cause you see I ain't no skeezer
But on a real tip I think he's a

Tramp (What'd ya call me?)

On the first date he thought I was a dummy
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me
But of course, I knew it was a lie, y'all
He undressed me with his eyeballs
Trying to change the whole subject
'Cause everything he said pertained to sex
So I dissed him, I said, "You's a sucker!
Get your dirty mind out the gutter
You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots
You ain't treating me like no prostitute"
Then I walked away, he called me a teaser
You're on a mission, kid yo, he's a

Tramp (What'd ya call me?)
