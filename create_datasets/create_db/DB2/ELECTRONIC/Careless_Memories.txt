So soon,
Just after you've gone
My senses sharpen
But it always takes
So damned long
Before I feel how much 
My eyes have darkened

Fear hangs a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb
With a thought
With a whisper
With a careless memory

On the table
Signs of love life scattered
And the walls break
We go crashing within
It's not as though
As though you really mattered
But being close,
How could I let you go
Without some feeling
Some precious sympathy following

Fear hangs a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb
With a thought
With a whisper
With a careless memory

I walk out into the sun
I try to find a new day
But the whole place
It just screams in my eyes
Where are you now?
'cause I don't want to meet you
I think I'd die
I think I'd laugh at you
I think I'd cry
What am I supposed to do,
Follow you?

Outside the thoughts 
Come flooding back now
I just try to forget you
So easy to disturb
With a thought
With a whisper
With a careless memory
