[Missy]
She's ah, uh uh, bitch
Yo, I'ma tell y'all straight up and down
It's like this for real, it's goin' down like this foreal
She's ah, bitch (tell 'em)
I'm sick of y'all fake Timbaland beat bitin', you know what I'm sayin'
I'ma bring it to y'all like this

By all means necessary
You might catch me somewhere stickin' yo baby daddy
They say oh "Missy you wack" but y'all not ready
Cause I come back like a smack
You hear my gats in yo back (blat-blat-blat)
Huh, like spaghetti
Half of y'all MCs be stinkin' like boobetti
So your record label cut you off like confetti
They you wanna call Missy and beg me, (who) ooh beg me beg me
Dag I'm very scary
Burn a whole club down like I was Carrie
Give a boy French kiss, he wanna marry
See y'all jealous tricks, y'all cannot stand me
Ooh, that's fine and dandy
Hey daddy-daddy
Why these chickenheads, ooh they be so petty
Hey nah nah nah, you best not test me
I keep tellin' you nah you never ready
Nah you never ready

[Chorus:]
Get rowdy
Let me hear y'all loudly
Keep my high niggas 'round me
Let me see y'all work it and work it till y'all can't stand up
Get rowdy
Let me hear y'all loudly
Keep my high niggas 'round me
Let me see y'all work it baby, work work it baby what!

[Missy]
In the club, I see niggas
They think I'm super fly, they blow me sugahs
So I cut them short like some scissors
They trying to take me home, they give me liquor
You know who I am, I'ma bitch
Do you know what I make, filthy rich
Do you know what this mieans, gotta gat
I thought you was a freak, never that
You see me on the road, when I stroll
I float through the toll, like whoa (beep beep)
You just a silly hoe, this I know
You be at every show, for the dough, hear me now (what!)

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Yo, this is Timbaland
Callin' from the Matrix y'all
And this how we do it
Yo Missy, tell 'em how you feel, what

[Missy]
Beat biter, dope style taker, originator
Or just an imitator
Stealin' our beats like you're the one who made 'em
Timbaland's the teacher and I'm the one who grades 'em
Check the verbatim, F is how we rate 'em
How dare you make 'em, jus like we made 'em
And I wont play 'em, and I won't say 'em
Save this for later, so I can tell you straighter

[Chorus]

[Missy]
Now see this one right here (ooh)
This is for everybody (ooh)
This is for my people east (ooh) east, west, south
East (ooh) west, south (ooh)
But you know what before I get up on outta here (ooh)
I gotta say one thing to y'all beat biters (ooh)
It's 'bout to be the year 2000 (ooh) you know what I'm sayin'
And I'm kinda sick of that (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
On everything y'all gotta come up with
Y'all own creativity, y'all own originality, y'all own style
You know what I'm sayin'
Hehe, you gonna be left behind this time
Alright ain't no love lost
All need you to do is stop beat bitin'!

[Timbaland]
That was Missy
Now this is Timbaland signin' off from the Matrix
You heard that
