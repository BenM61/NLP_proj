The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a heart to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, whips like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

It don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it?s sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love, that's the power of love

First time you feed, it might make you sad
Next time you feed, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad, baby when you've found
That's the power, makes the world go round

And it don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you

And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love, can you feel it?

It don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel it when until you feel

You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power and that's the power of love
You feel the power of love, you feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
