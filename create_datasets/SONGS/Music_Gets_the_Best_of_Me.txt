Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

I've got to tell you something
You're not my first ever love
Men come and go I've noticed
But my first love's going strong
He swept me off my feet strong
With melody and simple beat strong
A touch and I feel complete
Music is my love you see
Yeah

Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

Without the beat I'm nothing
Without a song in my heart
I'd be a different girlfriend
But we're all here so let's start
The things her says are always true start
He's never gonna change his tune start
And though you're still the boy me
Music is my life you see

Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

If someone held you with a gun
You know I'd make you number one
I need you both to get along
Music gets the best of me

Oh my baby
You know you make me smile
But it's the music that's really driving me wild
I can't help it baby

Come on
Come on
Come on

Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

If someone held you with a gun
You know I'd make you number one
I need you both to get along
Music gets the best of me
Music gets the best of me
