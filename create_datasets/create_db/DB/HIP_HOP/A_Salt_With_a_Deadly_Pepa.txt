I'm Salt here to resource so start steppin' 
When me and my homegirl Pepa start pepperin' 
Try and dis the girls  try to stand tall shorty 
The girls got naughty   we went Top Forty 
Call in the troops  we're comin' out blazin' 
Ill if you will there ain't no savin' 
The queens have been ordained 
You can't play me boy  I'm no game 

It takes two to dance so c'mon let's tango 
Us on the mics and y'all on the dance floor 
It's a Salt and Pepa affair, yeah 
Never ever no static, beats will come out clear 
Title after title we take 
Rack 'em up we're gonna tally 'em 
And when we're done you're gonna need a valium 
To calm your nerves, after I bomb your nerves 
The quiet comes after the storm is heard 
And I'm stormin' long and strong, I can't go wrong 
Watch me get into this rap song 
Like a river I flow into the mic I'll blow 
Make sure it's on as Spinderella drops the beats so
