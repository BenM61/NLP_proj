Living thing, it's a living thing
Living thing, it's a living thing
Living thing, it's a living thing
Living thing, it's a living thing

Drop the funny line, it's not funny anymore
Make me feel at home like you used to do before
Fill another glass if it makes you more at ease
I could easily act, I usually aim to please

I've grown accustom to grow old
It suits me fine, just fine
Stop wasting my precious time
From now on it's just mine

I'm rented by the hour
And if you can't afford to pay
You gotta keep me bothered, you gotta keep me awake

You don't have to look me in the eye
You don't have to look me in the eye no more
You don't have to look me in the eye
You don't have to love me

It's a living thing, it's a living thing, it's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose

It's a living thing, it's a living thing, it's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose

It's a living thing, it's a living thing, it's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose

It's a living thing, it's a living thing, it's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose

We didn't do it together, and now is it too late?
It's pretty tight around the corners and I no longer have your taste
What is it about a friendship that always keeps the closet closed?
But I can tell it's dusty in here
So I don't even want to think about yours

You don't have to look me in the eye
You don't have to look me in the eye no more
You don't have to look me in the eye
You don't have to love me

It's a living thing, it's a living thing, it's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
