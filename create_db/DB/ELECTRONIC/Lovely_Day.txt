Day

He never expected such a, be sure he'll find you back someday [Repeat: x1]

Lovely day
He never expected such a
Lovely day
Be sure he'll find you back someday
Lovely day
He never expected such a
Lovely day
Be sure he'll find you back someday
Lovely day

She was in the night

It was a lovely day
The day you walked away
Revenge came out to play
When you refused to stay
He walks through empty lanes
Cold anger, bursting veins
Now that I've lost your track
How could I bring you back

Be sure he won't forget
'Cause the last words you said
Disrupt his head with morning quivers
Dissect his heart like golden scissors
Make him regret each moment spent with you
Make him regret what he intended to do
Too late to stop this agony

Please
don't
Ask
Me
For
More

Lovely day
He never expected such a gift

There's too much on my mind
To leave it all behind
Just hoping that I find
There's too much on my mind
Wait now for the night
The prey, the kill, the flight
Return then of the light
Won't reveal any displeasure

Please
don't
Ask
Me
For
More

Don't ask me for more
It will never
Never be like before

See the clouds gather low
He's walking in the lanes
His new life is so cruel
When there's sun it still rains

He never expected such a
Lovely day
Be sure he'll find you back someday
