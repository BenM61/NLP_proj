See the colors of life
The colors of dreams
The colors of life
Wherever you go
Wherever you may go

Trust in hope, trust in your real friends
Planet colors alive, you hold it in your hands
Realize you have to open your eyes
And I've learned everything has always two sides

You're not alone
The world is one family
You're not alone
Find your way to be free
You're not alone
Love is the hope to survive
You're not alone
See the colors of life

See the colors of life
See the colors of life
See the colors of dreams
They are wild and free
See the colors around
See the colors around
The colors you have found
See the colors of life

See the colors of life
The colors of dreams
The colors of life
The colors of life
The colors of dreams
The colors of life

There's a land, there's a place in your heart
Tolerance is the key to make a better start
I've been waiting for my lessons of life
And I've learned everything has always two sides
