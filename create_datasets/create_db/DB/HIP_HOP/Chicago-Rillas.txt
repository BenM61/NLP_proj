Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

Uh, Point Blank Charlie, I'm that nigga
Been killing them Kanye tracks before Jigga
Hooked with no ID when Kanye moved to NY
I was in the hundreds running around totaled semis

Left Cash Money and started my own empire
And we don't do no bird call, bitch, we been fly
And we won't kiss another man in the mouth, we gangsta
But we will run up in your house and stain ya

Close range murder remain ya
Empty the whole clip plus what's in the chamber
And if this won't help you, Joe, you know what we aim for
Lower that ice, boy, you know what we came for, nigga

Act like it we gon' put you to sleep
We'll own everything worth something, even your teeth
And beef, you don't want it, I promise that
This is south homicide of Chicago, honor that

Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

You could never hold this block like I do
You grew up with a house full of women
And let your momma pussify you
Started gang banging in high school
Got your ass whipped and you stopped gangbanging in high school

This is something to ride to, bitch, ho wonderful
Twista, Common and Kanye look real comfortable
Bump, Fest and Mikkey finta snatch it from under you
I'll help a nigga bag depending on how my numbers do

Huh, and this ain't talking greasy, greasy
This is Jeffrey mannerisms and they need me, need me
I'm a gremlin after 12 ho feed me, feed me
Girls, we got, it's too hot for TV, TV

That's right, naw, it ain't Jeezy, Jeezy
Them Chicago-Rillas gon' snatch ya freebie
Wear it around the hood, believe me
And when you want it back the price moved up

Like George and Weezie, I will never sit
I will never tell when the heat is on, I will never bail
I will, never, let a stud extort me
I'll run up in your house with Malik

And we ain't finna spit poetry
I'll put a punk head with a floor beat
I'm like bullets flying through the hood
You can't ignore me, bitch

Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla

My crew is thorough, I see life through a barrel
I'm clean 'cause I make green like blue and yellow
I got a deal, I ain't flash, you'll ball out
I went in cops with crates of guns and passed 'em all out

I'm that hood, make rappers call it quits
I've been good, Atlantic just made it all legit
It's all real, y'all rappers just act hard
And we spend money like it grows in our backyard

The MAC-11 is with me, I'm going well over 80
In that navy blue 760
And I'm headed towards the hundreds, the king of the city
Going to get this money
(With Rhymefest and Mikkey, nigga)

Crossing them, you're dead wrong, I will grab that chrome
Put it on your head like some headphones
You don't want Bump to squeeze till the legs gone
Block bloody murder, redrum
(Redrum, nigga)

Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, and we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah, we came to get that scrilla
