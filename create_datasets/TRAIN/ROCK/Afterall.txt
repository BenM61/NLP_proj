Here's the party where's my friends?
Pulling smoke through soda cans
So who's the people with the peepholes in their smiles
Think I'll skip the party and stay inside

Your house
My home 
Two words
Your alone

I'll leave you waiting

Changing has changed me
And wine isn't change cheap
All that's left is a phone to call
Afterall

Something special in the end
Said the dotted line to the fountain pen
Just stay on course, stay in tune and wait in line
In the basement lost track of time

I know 
It's late
Sometimes shit has to wait

Maybe I'm lazy
Time couldn't change me
I don't need a stair to fall
