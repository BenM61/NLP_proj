Baby, baby let's get together
Honey, honey me and you
And do the things, oh, do the things
That we like to do

Oh, do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight, get down tonight
Do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight

Baby, babe I meet you 
Same place, same time
Where we can, oh, get together 
And ease up our mind

Oh, do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight
Do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight, baby

Do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight
Do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight, baby

Get down, get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby
