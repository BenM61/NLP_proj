Trying to think of us feels like
'Cause I don't really know what it is
I don't know just where to begin and
Tell you are sides to win
Think I'm gonna start right here

Just when I thought about giving up
When I was about to run on me
That's when you pulled up to my heart
And said you wanna ride with me
And it was something about you that I see so different
Something so different, something that I never felt
Something that I never felt
But now it feels like I lost myself trying to find you
Feels like I'm living the life of you
And now it's time to tell the truth

I love me, I love me, more than I love you
Yes I do, hey baby, yeah, yeah
I love me, somebody what I'm talking bout
More than I love you
Tweet you gotta tell me
Sing this song, sing this song

I'm tired of walking a thin line
And hitting walls of regret
It's better that we call it quiz
Think we need to stop right there
Just when I thought about giving up
When I was about to run on me
That's when you pulled up to my heart
And said you wanna come and ride with me
And sharing love with you seemed so innocent
Even heaven sent, everything I ever dreamed
It feels like I ... myself, now I love you
It's like I'm stretching...the truth
It's time to turn

I love me, I love me, more than I love you
I love me, I love me, more than I love you
Yes I do, hey baby, yeah, yeah,

Be'Cause you've changed, I no longer give to you
Love remains here with me, here with me, here with me
And I made it through the pain and now 
I finally see, so clearly, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, I love me so much more than I love you
More than I love you,to love me more
I love me more than I love you
More than you, more than I love you
I know it may sound crazy,more than I love you
'Cause you're a good man, just not good for me
It' my apology, I gotta immediately
Don't worry about the house, you can have it
Don't worry about the cars, you can drive them
I'll got get another one, because I got it
