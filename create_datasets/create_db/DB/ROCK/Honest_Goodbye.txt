Now get up and give in
I'll crack your knuckles again
Supplicate and survive this transubstantiation
And get so mean - I wanna know what it means

(Did you laugh?) You know I did
(Did you cry?) I couldn't get it right
(Did you live?) Always on the edge
(Did you lie?) Causing such a fright
(Did you love?) Oh, to be forgiven
(Did you try?) But it wouldn't be right
God it feels like an honest goodbye

That sick brass boy day dreamin'
Cry baby convict demon
Hands so clean, a sympathetic, cold-blooded, killing machine
How did you get so mean? I want to know what it means

(Did you laugh?) You know I did
(Did you cry?) I couldn't get it right
(Did you live?) Always on the edge
(Did you lie?) Causing such a fright
(Did you love?) Oh, to be forgiven
(Did you try?) But it wouldn't be right
God it feels like an honest goodbye
