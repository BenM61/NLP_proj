Have you ever met somebody that will love you like I do
I'm going crazy, crazy for you
And have you ever loved somebody that would give it all for you
I'm going crazy, crazy for you

I've always been by myself 
Lived life by myself
Never cared for solitude
Just cared for the wealth
Steady stackin'
Never slackin'
With no time to be wastin'
While these other dudes chasin' broads
I was chasin' their paper
But then (but then) came you (came you)
And it was over baby 
I was going crazy for you
And I ain't felt this way in a minute
And I ain't gonna lie to you ma
This shit I'm starting to dig it for real

Everything about you is what I like about you
I go crazy and I lose my mind
Trade my world and I'd give my life

'Cause it feels so right

[Chorus]

And every day you make it clear that you don't want to be replaced
Just by them little things you do, just by them little things you say
Five years done past and we done went through some drama
From court dates to miscarriages to you losing your mama
But now (but now) I see (I see)
That you're my one and only
Baby oh I'm going crazy
I can't eat (I can't eat) I can't sleep (I can't sleep) no more, no more
It's like I toss and turn at night 
Memories ease my pain
I keep hearing you laughin', screamin', callin' my name
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink

[Chorus]

My only sanity in these walls
Is just the thought of you
Paradise up in my mind
Just for a second or two
But then it's gone
And I gotta go too
Because I changed my ways ma
I'm coming home to you, for real
