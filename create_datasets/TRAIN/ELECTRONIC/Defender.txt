Only take notice when
I'm in front of you

Don't stand so close to the edge (I will protect you)
You know I'm a warrior (Stand in the way)
Images fly through my head (I'm a defender)
What's this scenario? (Come what may)
Let me stand near you, attend (Do as you please to)
I'll be your barrier (I'll see that you do)
See that you couldn't defend (Only take notice when)
But you know I'm a warrior
