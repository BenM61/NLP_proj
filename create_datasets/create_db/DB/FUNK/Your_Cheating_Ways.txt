It won't hurt me when you tell me we are through, yeah 
Now I've found me someone just as sweet as you 
He's gentle & he's kind, he won't leave me behind 
So I'm not gonna cry, boy, when you say goodbye, boy 
For I know somehow, somewhere, someday 
You've got to pay, boy, for your cheating ways 

When you feel that you must go, be on your way, yeah 
For the love I had for you belongs to yesterday 
You hurt me, so I know it's better if you go 
Don't worry when you're gone, boy, 'cause I'll get along, boy 
I'm feelin' sorry for you, you'll find out one day it's true 
You've got to pay, boy, for your cheating ways 

(I gave my love to you; you showed me you just won't be true, true) 

After all you've said & done, it's just that I 
Won't wait until you're ready, dear, to say goodbye 
You walked right out that door & left me once before 
Oh but this time it's something new; it's me that's leaving you 
So now you're on your own, & when you're all alone 
You've finally got to pay, boy, for your cheating ways 
I said you've got to pay, little boy, for your cheating ways 
You know that you've been wrong, you've been cheating all along 
...& fade
