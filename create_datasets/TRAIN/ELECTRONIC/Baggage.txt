I know I do some things that make you so confused
One minute I'm so in love and the next I can't stand you
But if you may ask it's just the things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess that I've been through

I got this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me
Everytime I hurt your feelings it's what someones done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

Heartache and pain I just can't do it again
So I look for the worst and brace myself for the hurt
But nobody has ever treated me this way
Please be patient with me 'cause I want you to stay but I got all

This baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me
Everytime I hurt your feelings it's what someone's done to me
I don't mean to hurt you
I don't mean to hurt you

It's no way to be livin' my life
But I can't get it out of my mind
You know I love you yes I do
So don't, don't we get it confused

Don't be confused 'cause boy you know I really do love you
Want you to stay wit me I never meant to hurt you baby
It won't be easy gettin' rid of all this baggage baby

I got all of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay for what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me
Everytime I hurt your feelings
It's what someone's done to me
I don't mean to hurt you
I don't mean to hurt you
