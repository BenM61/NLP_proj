Oh
Oh Oh Oh, yeah

I've been watching you
Just to see how far you would go

You're gonna have to prove
Make a move and let it show

I know it's getting late
And you gotta go home
But before you go
Baby just

Show me
Show me what I got to do

Baby if you love me (you love me)
I'll do anything for you
Show me

It's hard for you and me to put our feelings on this play

But if you look into my eyes
You'll know why I feel this way, baby

I know it's getting late
And you gotta go home
But before you go
Baby just

Show me
Show me what I got to do (My sweet babe)

Baby if you love me (you love me)
I'll do anything for you
Show me

Show me
Show me what I got to do (Show Me)

Baby but before you go
Come on and show me (Show me)

I know it's getting late
And you gotta go home
But before you go baby

Ah...
Open up and let me in baby
Yeah...

Show me (Show me)
