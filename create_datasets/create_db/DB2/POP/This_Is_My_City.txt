This is my city
This is your city
This is our city now

Well I'm back in the land of second chances
And rock'n'roll shows where nobody dances
Back in the land of chicken and chips
Mars bars and roadside tips

And if you don't like it
Then that's too bad
'Cause it's the only city that we've ever had
So when the man says
That you gotta pay
You gotta cancel the cheque and you gotta say...

Well I'm back in the land of cheap incense
Where the favourite sport is sittin' on the fence
Back in the land of pie and sauce
Drinkin' flat beer with no third course

And if you don't like it
Then you gotta fight it
And you gotta fight it now
Ain't no time
For walkin' the line
Somehow the cream's gone sour...

Back in the land of subtle hints
Where the artists are busy painting Picasso prints
Here in the land of all time lows
You can make it big and get your own quiz show
And if you just hate it
Then that's too bad
'Cause it's the only city that you've ever had
So when the cop says
Get outa town
You gotta get it together gotta stick around

This is my city
This is your city
This is our city now

I got it
You got it
We got it now

This is my city
This is your city
This is our city now
