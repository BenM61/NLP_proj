She saw the world through her smile
She held your hand you knew it'd be all right
She spoke of places she'd never been
"Now is the time", she'd say, "to live the dream"

And she told us how she could fly 
And she said "no need for goodbyes" 
For we'd see her there in the skies
Where angels fly, angels fly

She stayed a while that summers day
Spoke through a smile of how she'd go away
I saw in her eyes, her pain 
She took my hand and said "it'd be ok"

And now she's soaring up into the sky 
And she takes us all in her flight 
And she told us the reasons why
Angels fly, angels fly

Some summer days I can see the smile 
And in so many ways she's still alive 
And the love that she gave I keep down inside
I'm keeping it safe 'till I learn to fly

And she's soaring up into the sky 
And she takes us all in her flight 
And I feel she's still alive 
Where angels fly, angels fly

And she told us how she could fly 
And she said "no need for goodbyes"
For we'd see her there in the sky
Where angels fly, angels fly
Angels fly, my sweet angel flies.
