I wonder if the De La Salle brothers got out
And if their holy Lord and jealous fathers ever feel trapped
Dear Mary, like all the attention
And if Jesus ever get detention

I wonder if Caesar ever did his songs
And if Joan of Arc ever slip and sliced her thumb
Chopped in onions and double home economics
And (?) light electronics

Panic stations don't set in
Don't worry if you're not getting
The reward that you think you deserve
Good things come to those who wait
God knows I've waited patiently
Take it, take it
There's a secret next to me

The number seventeen and Steve McQueen
Seem an unlikely combination considering his elevation to Hollywood 
Got him all around (?)
I can't see him settling down in (?)

Would Aldous have been able to adapt?
Would he have come to court over a report, his phone was tapped
Would Priscilla, remain and reside by his side
With the lonely loyalty of being his bride

Panic stations don't set in
Don't worry if you're not getting
The reward that you think you deserve
Good things come to those who wait
God knows I've waited patiently
Take it, take it
There's a secret next to me

Panic stations don't set in
Don't worry if you're not getting
The reward that you think you deserve
Good things come to those who wait
God knows I've waited patiently
Take it, take it
There's a secret next to me
