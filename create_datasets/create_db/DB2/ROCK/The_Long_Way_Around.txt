My friends from high school 
Married their high school boyfriends 
Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes 
Where their parents live 

But I, I could never follow 
No, I, I could never follow 

I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling 
Lived like a gypsy 
Six strong hands on the steering wheel 

I've been a long time gone now 
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down 
But I've always found my way somehow 

By taking the long way 
Taking the long way around 
Taking the long way 
Taking the long way around 

I met the queen of whatever 
Drank with the Irish, and smoked with the hippies 
Moved with the shakers 
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to 

No, I, I could never follow 
No, I, I could never follow 

It's been two long years now 
Since the top of the world came crashing down 
And I'm getting' it back on the road now 

But I'm taking the long way 
Taking the long way around 
I'm taking the long way 
Taking the long way around 
The long...
The long way around 

Well, I fought with a stranger, and I met myself 
I opened my mouth, and I heard myself 
It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself 
Guess I could have made it easier on myself 

But I, I could never follow 
No, I, I could never follow 

Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else 
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down 
If you ever want to find me, I can still be found 

Taking the long way 
Taking the long way around 
Taking the long way 
Taking the long way around
