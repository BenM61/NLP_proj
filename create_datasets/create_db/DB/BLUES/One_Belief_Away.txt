Last night I thought I found you 
I saw it in a dream 
I was tangled in the rushes, baby 
You were caught up in the stream 
And the more I tried to reach you 
The more you slipped away 
And when I woke up in the darkness 
I was callin' out your name 

You and we dance around it 
Why is the truth so hard to say 
We long for true love
Well we've found it
It's just one belief away 

There's a shadow in the garden 
And it's coiled around our hearts 
Won't you help me to believe you, baby 
Won't you show me where to start 

The more I try to reach you 
The more you slip away 
I want to wake up in the darkness 
And hear you callin' out my name 

You and we dance around it 
Why is the truth that so hard to say 
We long for true love
Well we've found it
It's just one belief away 
One belief a

You and we dance around it 
Why is the truth that is so hard to say 
We long for true love
Well we've found it
It's just one belief away 
It's one belief away
It's one belief away
It's one belief away
