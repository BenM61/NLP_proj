Get yo' ass asthma with all that coughing, yeah
Eve where you at? Ayo Trina where you at? Ayo Brat

Picture this, Eve walking down the street with two gats by her side
The one on her right Trina, the one on her left I
In a high holster, studded in rhinestone
Ready to cock back, we bust and your mind blown
Just like that, braggadocios 'cause I'm the dopesest Brat
Most of these niggas focus on the ass that's fat
And I'm just so ferocious to the rhythm of a high hat
Why ask why?

'cause how, whenever I do it I buy what I wanna buy
Do what the f*ck I wanna do 'til I die
Shinin' on everybody for the world to see
My timin' is always perfect, endlessly
I deserve to swerve a little and splurge a lot
With the nerve I got, wearin' these blindin' rocks
Got Chicago, Miami and Philly
A collabo, of three of the illest bitches, really

Gangsta bitch, gangsta ice, gangsta whip
Gangsta clothes, gangsta money, gangsta shows
Gangsta purse, gangsta shoes, gangsta verse
We the bitches that the gangstas thirst
Gangsta song, gangsta brawn, gangsta thong
We the bitches that the gangstas on
Gangsta bottle, gangsta trees
Gangsta Brat, gangsta Trina and gangsta Eve

Miss Purina, Trina the M I A bitch
Them I play wit, eenie meenie meiny mo
Pickin' basically the richest nigga for the baddest bitch
Me, Eve, and Brat, it's bananas shit
We ain't havin' this, I steps on toes
In a pair of hot shorts and eight inch stelletoes
Iced out, drippin' in Channell, Prada, Gucci and all that
I make 'em fall back

Hair done, fresh metti and pedicure, bikini wax
Gotta keep the cat smooth so when my nigga ask for the pussy
It's good and wet, after just one f*ck, you won't forget
I'm made up in the tropics gettin', sunburned
Bare ass out with the diamond thong on
Nigga you thought you got yo' freak on in Japan
But I was gettin', my creep on with yo' man
'cause I'm a hot bitch
Official Ryde or Die bitches, believe that

Gangsta bitch, gangsta ice, gangsta whip
Gangsta clothes, gangsta money, gangsta shows
Gangsta purse, gangsta shoes, gangsta verse
We the bitches that the gangstas thirst
Gangsta song, gangsta brawn, gangsta thong
We the bitches that the gangstas on
Gangsta bottle, gangsta trees
Gangsta Brat, gangsta Trina and gangsta Eve

Yo, when three raw bitches get together it's off the chain
Thought you found a spot to fill, you lost the game
Boss bitches stallion, scream they name
Hate us 'cause our life right, eatin' from the game
Only f*ck with the realest, don't associate with lames
How the f*ck can't you feel us? Three of the illest dames
S E X why, Trina, Brat, and I
Bombshell, other bitches is true lies

I'ma keep it simple, rock how I'm meant to
Pretty with the heels on or shitty with the Tim boots
Do it how I wanna do it, question my mind
You gon' understand from the rest of my lines
Bitch please, you might as well be on freeze, when it's Eve
You ain't really tryin' to f*ck the game up, you just a tease
You don't want it when I really get buck, you wanted peace
Have you hidin' in a hole when my album got released
