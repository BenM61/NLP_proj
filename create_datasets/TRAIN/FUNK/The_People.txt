Ay, you know, as I look around
See the news, hear people talking about what's going on
I can't help but think it's time for a change
But we can't make that change
If we always pointing the finger
We gotta look at ourselves, too

This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white, and latino
But all of the people
This is for the people, all of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me

Many opinions and estimations, while lacking truthful statements
Fantasy living used as tools to escape real life situations
We went from morals and principles, to immoral yet legal existence
Yet wonder why it seems the hearts and minds have died of our children
Stuck in a place where love is distorted and genuity scarce
Where truth is choked for standing and speaking leaving us needing repair
Never once looking in that mirror, willing to make changes
Payin' no mind to the youth therefore we the reason they seemingly crazy
In a world of misconstrued truth, where hate and evil run awry
Masked blind behind digital screens, sowing discord and folly
Promotin' senseless, bitterness, ignorance, just wasting our lives
Losin' our minds here on earth, ignoring her cry

This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white and latino
But all of the people
This is for the people, all of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me
This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white and latino
But all of the people
This is for the people, all of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me

Countless murders continue occurring as the world keeps on turning
Some feel so weighted down and oppressed they seek to bring their death early
Virginity stolen with innocence, leaving folks broken and bitter and
Never quite knowing what living is with a soul flowing with liberty
Imprisoned within a system built off lies and greed
Where the poor steal from the poor instead of unite and succeed
Our children hear our words and grow, from that which we show
Yet we push 'em aside, abuse 'em or raise 'em in the ways deemed wrong
We've assumed roles of sovereignty in spaces we ain't created
Neither has that power given us the authority to rearrange it
We talk bout peace, love, and charity while holding in hate
People we living in spiritual slumber, wake up, we've gone astray

This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white and latino
But all of the people
This is for the people, all of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me
This is for the people, all of the people
Not just black, white and latino
But all of the people
This is for the people, all of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me

Words of doubt and fear proclaimed amongst todays' generation
Parents mourn, children scorned, and others die daily
Crooked laws abusing authority through militant methods
Leaving citizens vexed and stressed to the point of amassing mass weaponry
Our world's crumbling to utter ruin before our eyes
Unmistakable signs more than ever show we in latter times
Living in a paradoxical and troubled state of existence
Objecting truth therefore we lack the jewels to give to our children
Do we not recognize the days and times in to which we've entered
Warfare, against dark forces, in the realms of the spirit
Let us combine so we can find a better route in life
Picking up peace, love, and unity throwing hatred aside

This is for the people (so you see)
All of the people (the balls' in our court)
Not just black, white and latino (the balls' in our court)
But all of the people
This is for the people (it's up to us to make a change)
All of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me (so)
This is for the people (what you gone do)
All of the people
Not just black, white and latino (we gotta start somewhere)
But all of the people
This is for the people (come on)
All of the people
I'm hoping that you hear me, I hope you hear me

Gotta make a change, things can't stay the same
Gotta make a change, things can't stay the same

So come on
Come on, yea yea
Come on, yea yeah
Come on, come on
