Good to see you again Rosy,
I know I've changed a lot since then,
But your looking fine babe

Three years that ain't long Rosy,
But I still remember our song,
When you were my mine babe

Times change
Times change I know 
But it sure goes slow
Down river
When your locked away

Hey why didn't you write Rosy,
I stayed awake most every night,
Counting my time babe

Oh no I ain't mad Rosy,
I know you had to mind your dad,
But just a line babe

Oh sure I remember Ben,
Why we went all through school,
Is that right?
Well he aint no fool,
He's a good man Rosy,
You hold him tight as you can,
Don't ask me why babe

Yeah nice seeing you Rosy,
Me I got things to do,
Well goodbye babe

Times change 
Times change I know
But it sure goes slow
Down river
When your locked away

Times change 
Times change I know
But it sure goes slow
Down river
When your locked away

Rosy hey Rosy
I care
