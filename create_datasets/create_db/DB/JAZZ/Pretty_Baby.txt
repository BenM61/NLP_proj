Everybody loves a baby
That's why I'm in love with you
Pretty baby, pretty baby
And I'd like to be your sister
Brother, dad and mother too
Pretty baby, pretty baby

Won't you come and let me
Rock you in my cradle of love?
And we'll cuddle all the time
Oh, I want a lovin', baby
And it might as well be you
Pretty baby of mine
