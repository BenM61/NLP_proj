Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee byway, one arm on the wheel
Holdin' my lover with the other, a sweet, soft, southern thrill
Worked hard all week, got a little jingle, on a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together with my Dixieland delight

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her uptight, make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right, my Dixieland delight

Whitetail buck deer, munchin' on clover, redtail hawk settin' on a limb
Chubby old groundhog, croakin' bullfrog, free as the feelin' in the wind
Home grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Lucky as a seven, livin' in Heaven, with my Dixieland delight

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her uptight, make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right, my Dixieland delight

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her uptight, make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right, my Dixieland delight

Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee byway, one arm on the wheel
Holdin' my lover with the other, a sweet, soft, southern thrill
