Quarters on the eyes 
Rejected sacrifice 
Cauterized at best 
Failing your litmus test 
I know it's dumb to say 
But turnabout's fair play 
Always knew that you 
Were suffering a fool 
You go ahead as good as dead 
Okay I understand 
But I don't want to be your friend 
I don't need another friend 
I've got too many friends 
If I was Eddie Vedder 
Would you like me any better? 
That's it I quit I don't give a shit 
You go ahead, as good as dead 
Coming to a head
