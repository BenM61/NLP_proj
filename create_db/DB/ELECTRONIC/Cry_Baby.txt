Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry

To stay awake you take a pill
You think you're moving
But you're standing still
You can't see, it's over, kid
You think you're cruising
But you slow down here

Maybe I could put you in a right direction
Only if you can decide
I believe you're beyond correction
Wouldn't be the first time I made you cry

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

This won't hurt, no, not a bit
You'd better take your medicine
'Cause you are sick
Your blood grows cold
You won't be told
You're the bad seed already sowed

Maybe I could put you in a right direction
Only if you can decide
Holding back to me looking for redemption
Wouldn't be the first time I heard you cry

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Who do you think is to blame?
Everybody but you
You couldn't care less
About the things that you do

Sick of hearing you cry
Sick of hearing those lies
Tired of wiping the tears
From your eyes

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
