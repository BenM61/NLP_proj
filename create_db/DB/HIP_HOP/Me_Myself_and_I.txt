All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Ah, ah (there you go, trippin', everything is cool between us baby, I told you that)
(Out on the road with my people, just doin' what i gotta do) oh
See I been goin' on, the shit be goin' on, got to trust me ma

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend
Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend

You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up yo clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend
Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now
I'm gon' my own best friend

(I got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Now I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

(Now I got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I've cried, all the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So now I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woo, woo, ah, hey, yeah 
(I got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(So now I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

(Now I got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you cried a thousand times, ladies you will survive 
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So now I'm about to make it through)
I could see the sun shine if I got me, myself, and I
