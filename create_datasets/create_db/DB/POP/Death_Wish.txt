You change me like hair dye
Then you leave me like a hair tie
I'm pullin' up, no jump shot
I'm in your mouth like a cumshot

So swallow that cigarette and follow my silhouette
And maybe you can be my last kiss
F*ck a Romeo, but tonight you can be my Juliet
You can be my Juliet, you can be my Juliet
You can be my Juliet, you can be my Juliet

But baby, I could be your death wish
Are you ready to die?

You change me like hair dye
Then you leave me like a hair tie
I'm Jim Jones in your Kool-Aid
We ball together like 2K

So swallow that cigarette and follow my silhouette
And maybe you can be my last kiss
F*ck a Romeo, but tonight you can be my Juliet
You can be my Juliet, you can be my Juliet
You can be my Juliet, you can be my Juliet

But baby, I could be your death wish
Baby, I can be your death wish
Are you ready to die?

I feel this cocaine is comin' down
I probably should stop doin' that shit
It really fucks my nose up
You're like my leprechaun prostitute
I keep usin' and usin' you
And I'm runnin' out of fairy dust
So swallow that cigarette and follow my silhouette
And maybe you can be my last kiss
F*ck a Romeo, but tonight you can be my Juliet

Are you ready to die?
Baby, I can be your
Are you ready to die?
