Looking at the world through rose colored glasses,
Everything is rosy now.
Looking at the world and everything that passes,
Seems of rosy hue somehow.
Why do I feel surprise, don't wink your eyes,
Needn't guess I'll confess, certain someone just said yes.
In a bungalow all covered with roses, I will settle down I vow,
That's why I'm looking at the world through rose colored glasses,
Everything is rosy now.

Oh yes, I'm looking at the world through rose colored glasses,
Everything is rosy now.

Yes, everything is rosy now.
