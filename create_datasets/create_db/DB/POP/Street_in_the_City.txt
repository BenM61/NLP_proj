Street in the city. Street in the city on a working day.
Street in the city. Street in the city on a working day.
There's a man up on that ledge. He's only cleaning windows.
What a shame, who's to blame, for the pain with his sin,
Gonna lean back on my wall and pray for him to fall.

See that man going in the bank with a blue suit?
He's carrying a bag full of very important papers.
There's old Mac trying to busk with his new flute.
Did you read about the Cambridge raper?

Street in the city. Street in the city on a working day.
Street in the city. Street in the city on a working day.
Those girls pass every day. They seem to think I'm funny.
It's just a game that they're playing till they can claim their personal man.
Gonna lean back on my wall and pray for her knickers to fall.

See that woman with a bun in her hair?.
Don't she know that ain't still done anywhere?
See that man going in the Wig and Pen?
He was charged with telling lies again.

I see the world go by as I lean against my wall.
I watch as Fleet Street makes new heroes rise and fall.
The news is written in the eyes of us all.
On is a sinner. One is a saint, but most of us worry about showing up late.

I'm gonna lean back on my wall and pray for him to fall.
Street in the city. Street in the city on a working day.
Street in the city. Street in the city on a working day.
There's a man up on that ledge. He's only cleaning windows.
What a shame. Who's to blame for the pain?
