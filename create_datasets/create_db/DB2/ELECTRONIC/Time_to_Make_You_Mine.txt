Only in my dreams
I've seen the way it's gonna be

I've waited for this moment
The moment when we share ourselves
This moment can't be thought about
It has to be felt

We're closer to each other
Closer than we've ever been
Seeing things we've never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips
Now we're together baby now it's time
Time to make you mine
Time to make you mine

The sweet anticipation of hands I know will touch me soon
Two fascinating shadows move in time

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips
Now we're together baby now it's time
Time to make you mine
Time to make you mine

I know what it's gonna be
Me and you, you and me
I thought that it would never be
I only knew it in my dreams
Even though you're here with me
I never thought I'd feel such ecstasy

We're closer to each other
Closer than we've ever been
Seeing things we've never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips
Now we're together baby now it's time
Time to make you mine
Time to make you mine
