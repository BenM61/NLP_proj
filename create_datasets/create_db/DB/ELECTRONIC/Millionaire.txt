I said, her from the city, so her got to be witty
She said, him from the country, so him got to be funky

Mama, I'm a millionaire, but I feel like a bum
Mama, I'm a millionaire, but I feel like the only one
I I I I woke up early this mornin'. I don't think why'all heard me
I woke up early this mornin'. I don't think why'all heard me
I woke up early this mornin', I don't think why'all heard me
I said I woke up early this mornin' but I still ain't see the sun
Uh uh uh oh uh oh (repeat three times)

Papa, I'm a millionaire
But Saks Fifth Ave. don't sell affection
(Saks Fifth Ave. don't sell affection)
Papa, I'm a millionaire
But I ain't moving in the right direction

Where there is cheese, there are rats
Wherever there are rats, there are cats
Wherever there are cats there are dogs
If you got the dogs, you got bitches
Bitches always out to put their paws on your riches
If you got riches, you got glitches
If you got glitches in your life computer
Turn it off and then reboot her
Now you back on
Can't just put the cap on the old bottle once you pop it
That'll spoil it. Go on. Drink it and enjoy it
Mama, I'm a millionaire

What's a girl to do when she just has diamonds. No time. Just pay
What's a girl to do? Instead of me; it's you. Be true
What's a girl to do in a world of greed when you're in pain?
What's a girl to do when she's lost her long time friends
That's life
