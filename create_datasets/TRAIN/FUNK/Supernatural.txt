You stay on my mind, one of a king
Oh we've got a supernatural love (stay on my mind)
Oh we've got a supernatural love (and again)
You stay on my mind, one of a kind

I should have walked away right from the very start, why did I stay?
Ten thousand tiny soldiers marching right through my heart
Couldn't keep me at bay
Oh, how fast I fell, and now I'm under your spell
So tell me, do you feel it too?

There's magic in everything you do, supernatural
I'm in love with everything 'bout you, I wanna stay here

Tell me does it surprise you that behind closed doors it's you I adore?
I tried to fight but I've never been good with war, and it struck to the core
Oh, I love you still, always have and always will
Believe me, I'll always tell the truth

There's magic in everything you do, supernatural
I'm in love with everything 'bout you, oh I wanna stay here

I often wonder why you're running circles in my head
I really wonder why you're running circles in my head
Oh, we've got a supernatural love

And if you feel the way I do
And think that I make magic too
We'll disappear into eternity
