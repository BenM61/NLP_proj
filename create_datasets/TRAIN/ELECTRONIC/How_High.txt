How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?

It's funny
I spent my whole life
Wanting to be talked about
I did it
Just about everything
To see my name in lights

Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserved it

How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?

It's funny
How everybody mentions my name
But they're never very nice
I took it
Just about everything
Except my own advice

Was it all worth it?
How did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserved it

How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Nothing lasts forever
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
Does it make a difference?
Will any of this matter?

Nothing lasts forever

Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?
