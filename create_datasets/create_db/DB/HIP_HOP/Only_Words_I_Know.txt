Ever since I saw you standing there 
I couldn't get you outta my mind 
So I thought I'd come and talk you 
But you couldn't understand my lines 
Girl its like in our chemistry 
There was something that gave me the sign 
From the moment that I saw your spanish eyes 

Couldn't figure out a word she was saying 
But I could see you were looking amazing 
Give me some help I need the translation 
What does te querio really mean? Tell me 

Senorita, la chica bonita are the only words I know 
I wish that I could hold you and darte un beso 
I want to take you home 
'cause I really really like you style 
I can see you want to get buck wild 
Senorita, la chica bonita are the only words I know 
Chico bonito me atraes 

Now the situation stresses me 
'cause I know what I've got in my hand 
There's a millions things I want to say 
Like I really want to be your man 
Anticipation stresses me 
coz I'm trying to get through to you 
Body language is the only thing to use 

Couldn't figure out a word she was saying 
But I could see you were looking amazing 
Give me some help I need the translation 
What does te querio really mean? 

Tell me 

(chorus) 

Her body's calling 
And I think I'm Falling 
But I can't understand what she says 
Chico bonito me atraes 
Dime de donde vienes 
Eres de qui? 
Me gusta tu estilo 
Sabes lo que te digo? 
What does te querio really mean?
