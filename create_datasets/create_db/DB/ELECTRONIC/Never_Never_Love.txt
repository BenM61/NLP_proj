You hurt in my mind
And you burst in my soul
You never never love,never never love
And each time I cry
And my heart is so cold
It's never never love,never never love

Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Don't mind

I've got to let you in
And I've got to get you out
You never never love, never never love
Lyrics thought once that I found
But my baby let me down

I never never love,never never love

Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Don't mind

Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Don't mind

Calling you up from night 'til dawn
Calling you up cause love is gone over me (wooh!)
Calling you up from night to dawn
Calling you up cause love is all over me
Over me yeah yeah babe

You hurt in my mind
And you burst in my soul
You never never love, never never love
And each time I cry
And my heart is so cold
It's never never love,never never love

I wanna say it again!

Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Don't mind

Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Never never love love love
Never never love love love
All the time
Don't mind
