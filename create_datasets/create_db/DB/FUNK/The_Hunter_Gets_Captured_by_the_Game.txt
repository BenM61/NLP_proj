Everyday brings change, and the world puts on a new face
Sudden things rearrange, and this whole world seems like a new place
Oh yeah, secretly I been tailing you
Like a fox that prays on a rabbit
Had to get you and so I knew
I had to learn your ways and habits
Oh, you were the catch that I was after
But I looked up and I was in your arms and I knew that I was captured

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Any time the hunter gets captured by the game

I had to lay such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
Love hit me like a sudden slap
One kiss and then I knew it
Oh, my plans didn't work out like I thought
'Cause I had laid my trap for you but it seems like I got caught

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Any time the hunter gets captured by the game
