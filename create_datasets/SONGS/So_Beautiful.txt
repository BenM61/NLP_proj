(sometimes things don't work out the way they should
The way you thought they would)

you make me beautiful
You make me prettier than all my pretty friends
You make me beautiful
You make me adequate, professional and tense

one night I caught you watching me while sleeping
I guess it's part of me that you are reaping

you make me beautiful
You make me beautiful

you make me beautiful
You make me prettier than all the girls I know
You make me beautiful
You make my enemies come early to my show

one night I caught you stealing my perfection
Your bitterness adjusts to my complexion

you make me beautiful
You make me beautiful

I've grown intelligent
Much more intelligent than suzy in my class
I've grown intelligent
So when she smiles I'd rather kick her in the ass

one night
You said you loved my mild persuasion
I spray it on when I prepare invasion

you make me beautiful
You make me beautiful
