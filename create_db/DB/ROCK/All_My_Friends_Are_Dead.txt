Where are your friends?
Where are your friends?
Where are your friends, man?
What? What? Where are my friends? 

All my friends are dead
All my friends are dead
They got kicked in the head
All my friends are dead

All my friends are dead
All my friends are dead
They got smacked in the head
All my friends are dead 

I always knew that they would end up like today
They bought the bullet and they
Paid with handgrenades

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

All my dreams were lies
All my dreams were lies
Nightmares in disguise
All my dreams were lies 

All my friends are dead
All my friends are dead
They got dragged out of bed
Now they're buried and they're dead

I always knew that they would end up like today
They bought the bullet and they paid with handgrenades 

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

F*ck it! eeh! 

I always knew that they would end up like today
They bought the bullet and they paid with handgrenades

Now they're buried and they're dead!
Now they're buried and they're dead!
Now they're buried and they're dead!

Dead!
