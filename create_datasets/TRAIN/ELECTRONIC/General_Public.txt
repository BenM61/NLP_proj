Come and join the federation
We could have communication
You can have your application
Be inside the battle station
Could this be your fascination
Look out for hallucinations
Stick right to the regulations
Must keep down the population

That's right, you could act so badly
People never notice sadly
All the goings-on behind the backs
Of men left well-deserted

Seek out individuality
Make sure you show hospitality
Face it now 'cause its reality
Watch the change in personality
What's to change humanity?

That's right, you could act so badly
People never notice sadly
All the goings-on behind the backs
Of men left well-deserted

Uh-huh, General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh

Keep your head down, start to fire
Show them you're the terrifier
He claims he's a justifier
Can't you see that he's a liar?
Got to act as if you're slyer
You can be the supplier

That's right, you could act so badly
People never notice sadly
All the goings-on behind the backs
Of men left well-deserted

General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh
General public, uh-huh

Play the white man
Work like a black
General Public striking back, back, back, back, back, back, backbiter, back
