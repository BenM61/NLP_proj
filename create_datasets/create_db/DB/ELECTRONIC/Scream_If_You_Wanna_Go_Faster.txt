Lonely hearts are welcome here
Take my hand let's disappear
Serenity is almost here oh Lord

Don't let life pass you by
Jump on in, get ready to fly

Gimme some, gimme some gasoline
Tell me what you want, know what I mean
And scream if you want to go faster baby
(Scream if you want to go faster)
Scream if you want to go faster
(Scream if you want to go faster)

Leave behind the walk of shame
Take my hand, you're not to blame
Surrender to what you can't change oh God

Don't let love pass you by
Let it in, don't ask why

Gimme some, gimme some gasoline
Tell me what you want, know what I mean
And scream if you want to go faster baby
(Scream if you want to go faster)
Scream if you want to go faster
(Scream if you want to go faster)

Gimme some, gimme some sweet F.A.
Have a nice day as American's say
And scream if you want to go faster baby
(Scream if you want to go faster)
Scream if you want to go faster
(Scream if you want to go faster)

(Scream if you want to go faster)
(Scream if you want to go faster)
(Scream if you want to go faster)

Gimme some, gimme some gasoline
Tell me what you want, know what I mean
And scream if you want to go faster baby
(Scream if you want to go faster)
Scream if you want to go faster
(Scream if you want to go faster)

Gimme some, gimme some sweet F.A.
Have a nice day as American's say
And scream if you want to go faster baby
(Scream if you want to go faster)
Scream if you want to go faster
(Scream if you want to go faster)

Scream if you want to go faster baby
(Scream if you want to go faster)
Scream if you want to go faster
(Scream if you want to go faster)

(Scream if you want to go faster)
(Scream if you want to go faster)
