Uh
Uh
C'mon! Uh!
Firing squad nigga! 
Yeah!
You see it
First family
First family, c'mon

Every night I sit and bask in the memories of Frank and
Sayin to myself what the hell was he thinkin' 
Usage of illegal drugs and heavy drinkin 
Had my old man sinkin' 
Now you never seen the Danze cry
But the day that man died 
My life came crumblin' down like a landslide 
Damn pride, now I'm in the zone 
Wonderin' how long before me and my moms would be alone 
I remember what he said 
Layin' on his deathbed, rubbin' his shiny bald head 
Respect your sister, don't follow your brothers 
Take care of your mother, I love ya [croaking]
He told me he believed in me 
And he has given me
The strength to be as strong as I need to be
That's when I realized he was leavin' me 
It wasn't just my heart or my eyes deceivin' me 
At the age of fourteen 
It was more than just a goal or dream 
To take care of my queen 
It's my turn to stand firm as I could stand 
[Just like your daddy
My father was a good man 

For the Foundation
We have suffered blood, sweat and tears
And cleared all complications 
Put it down, in any situation 
Now, you are the last generation 

I was introduced to shootouts, winos
Dope fiends, 5-0 
Gamblers, scramblers, pan handlers 
Murderers that took lives just to survive, in 1545 
The building, raised as a young nigga 
With thug niggas
Held down drugs for love niggas 
Drug dealers bang out, gun shots rang out 
Besides that EZ house, was the hang out 
Niggas stole cars, and made the spot hot
'cause we parked 'em on the block 
Like we copped 'em off the lot 
Can't forget the older soldiers, Sputnion 
Man mad poppin' be, say Marce' Saratoga!
Motherfuckers knew the block that was poppin' them guns 
They was like the first niggas in the hood wit M-1's 
Some niggas got beat up, them niggas tore the street up
They do dirt, come back, [Slap, put the heat up]
Retaliation, niggas shootin' for dead 
They fucked around and mommy got hit in the leg 
Same night, niggas out to get somethin' 
Malik ran up inside they spot, and hit somethin' 
I learned the game, stay concerned 
So no matter how the world turn I'ma stand firm 
Representin' where I was born and where I was raised 
Brownsville! Still goin' out in a blaze
