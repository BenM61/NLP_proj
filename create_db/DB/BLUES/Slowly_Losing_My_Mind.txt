I've lost the right to say that I love you,
I've lost the right to say that you are fine
Yes, I've lost the right to say that I love you baby,
And I've lost the right to say that you are fine
I've lost the right to say that I need you like I do now baby
And I'm slowly losing my mind

Oh, you once told me how much you love me,
And I said god love us all
Oh, you told me once how much you love me baby
And I said god love us all
Yes, I was young and just a fool then baby,
And couldn't hear the lovers call

Oh, now I'm all alone and here waiting baby,
I have no one to call my own
Yes, I'm all alone and I'm here waiting baby,
I have no one to call my own
Yes, you are just a fool each lonely heartbeat says,
Now I wonder why was I born
