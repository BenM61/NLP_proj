A star fell from Heaven
Right into my arms
A brighter star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was
Only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream.

A fallen star, that's what you are
The twinkle in your eye came from the sky
You must have strayed from the Milky Way
A fallen star, that's what you are

A fallen star, that's what you are
The twinkle in your eye came from the sky
You must have strayed from the Milky Way
A fallen star, that's what you are
