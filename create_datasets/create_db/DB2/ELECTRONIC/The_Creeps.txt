Lately
Been thinking bout you baby
Now everything is crazy
Now I confess the freak in me
Wait and see

So come on in
You get right underneath my skin
I've got a little feeling
I know it's everywhere you've been
But I'm still singing

Now that we got it, get on the dance floor
We're gonna rock it, 'cause that's what we're here for
You were a creep and you've been keeping it nasty
But now you want it and you're ready to ask me

You're looking tasty
I think I wanna take a bite
There's something going on tonight
So tell me is it black and white
Wrong or right

Now that you got it, get on the dance floor
We're gonna rock it, 'cause that's what we're here for
So make a move before I do something drastic
And hit me up 'cause baby you look fantastic

I've been waiting
No hesitating
Now that we got it, get on the dance floor
We're gonna rock it, 'cause that's what we're here for
Now that you got it, get on the dancefloor
We're gonna rock it, 'cause that's what we're here for
I've been waiting
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
No hesitating
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
No more faking
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Show it to me now (now now now)

Now that we got it, get on the dance floor
We're gonna rock it, 'cause that's what we're here for
You were a creep and you've been keeping it nasty
But now you want it and you're ready to ask me

Now that you got it, get on the dance floor
We're gonna rock it, 'cause that's what we're here for
So make a move before I do something drastic
And hit me up 'cause baby you look fantastic
