So naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
Little man, little man
I'm by far your greatest fan

Little man I'm endlessly proud of you
In such a short time span
You've filled my heart with joy
As I grow older, you grow wiser
Watching my mistakes
Memorize where I've gone wrong

If they fall away
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

Little man your head is full of dreams
If only I could spend one day 
Touring your imagination
Now if I live longer, you'll grow faster
At recognizing the traps that cause me such frustration

If they fall away
I'll stay with you
But do as I say, not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

If they fall away
I'll stay with you
But do as I say, not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

So naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
Little man, little man
I'm by far your greatest fan

Ah, vampires are known to sneak around
Don't laugh, please, I actually want to be a vampire when I grow up
She laughed
Ah, vampires are known to sneak around
