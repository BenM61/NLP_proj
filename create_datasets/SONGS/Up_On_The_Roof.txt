When this old world
Starts a getting me down
And people are just too much
For me to face
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares
Just drift right into space

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below
Don't bother me,
Let me tell you now
When I come home
Feeling tired and beat
I'll go up
Where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get far away
From the hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise
Down in the street

On the roof,
That's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish
To make it so
Let's go up on the roof
Look at those stars darlin'

At night the stars
They put on a show for free
And, darling,
You can share it all with me
I keep on telling you
That right smack dab
In the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble proof

And if this world
Starts a getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof
Way up on the roof
