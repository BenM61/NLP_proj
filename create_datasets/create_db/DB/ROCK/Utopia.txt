Its a strange day
No colors or shapes
No sounds in my head
I forget who I am...when I'm with you
There's no reason
There's no sense
I'm not supposed to feel.
I forget who I am, I forget...

Fascist baby, utopia, utopia
My dog need new ears
Make his eyes see forever
Make him live like me
Again and again

Fascist baby, utopia, utopia
I'm wired to the world
That's how I know everything
I'm super brain!
That's how they made me

Fascist baby, utopia, utopia
