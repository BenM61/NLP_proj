Hey kids, get your gear.
This is your vacation.
Climb aboard this yellow bus,
To your destination.
Hey, lift man, lift me up!
It's an occupation,
And I want to have a good time.
At alpintol, the skiings all at night,
With alcohol, your dreams are all in white,
Like idaho.
The wintertime you felt was yours to live,
You felt was yours to live.
The one good time you felt was yours to, to live.
Silver streaks mark our tracks.
A million miles on empty.
Brown baggin' from our packs;
Can I get some gin please?
Double diamond is way too rough.
It's an outside regulation,
'cause I want to have a good time.
At alpintol, the skiings all at night,
With alcohol, your dreams are all in white,
Like idaho.
The wintertime you felt was yours to live,
You felt was yours to live.
The one good time you felt was yours to, to live.
