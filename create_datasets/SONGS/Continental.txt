Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, the Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra-new

It's very subtle, the Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance

It's quite the fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, ooh, it's continental

You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental
You'll know before the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you

You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time

You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time

Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
The Continental
