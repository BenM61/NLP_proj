Want more real attention
At my expense guess you forgot to mention
You talk good, I'll eat glass
I heard you read my mind behind my back

Outside, I'm waiting
By the car when you're hesitating

Take a good look
Take a photo
Write about it in your tiny notebook

Don't you know?
You're out cold
Don't you know?
It's our dance-floor

T.K.O.
Hear it on the radio
T.K.O.
Play it on your stereo
T.K.O.
Watch a live video
T.K.O., T.K.O.

Got your money safe
Want to be "in"
Everyday it just gets closer to you
I'll say my piece
And when it's over you'll be on your knees

I got this soul thing
On the go
Read about it at your Barnes & Noble

Don't you know?
It's our dance-floor
T.K.O
Hear it on the radio
T.K.O.
Play it on your stereo
T.K.O.
Watch a live video
T.K.O., T.K.O.

Night is young
And we all know what's up
Beyond the seventh sun
The ocean calls us

Away from...

Don't you know?
It's our dance-floor
T.K.O
Hear it on the radio
T.K.O.
Play it on your stereo
T.K.O.
Watch a live video
T.K.O., T.K.O.
