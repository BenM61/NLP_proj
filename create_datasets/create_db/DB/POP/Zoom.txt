Zoom Zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby don't rush
You can look but don't touch

You think you know
When you see me in my videos
How the story goes
But that's just the side that I expose

Look through the lens
You see my body, not who I am...
So don't pretend
And try to act like you're my boyfriend

You wanna get somewhere
Then boy don't touch me there
Just get up close and personal, personal

Zoom Zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby don't rush
You can look but don't touch
Zoom zoom in? to my head
Gotta want me and not my bed
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch

You won't behave
Your hands are all over the place
Barely know your name
You're tryin' to score but it's not a game

Boy, get a clue
Yeah, you gotta spend the time, pay your dues
Following the rules
If you want me to want to be with you

You wanna get somewhere
Then boy don't touch me there
Just get up close and personal, personal

Zoom Zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby don't rush
You can look but don't touch
Zoom zoom in? to my head
Gotta want me and not my bed
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch

Zoom Zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby don't rush
You can look but don't touch
Zoom zoom in? to my head
Gotta want me and not my bed
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch

Don't you dare
Touch me there
If you want to get somewhere

Zoom in get to know me, boy, don't rush
Zoom in if you want me, boy, don't touch

Zoom Zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby don't rush
You can look but don't touch
Zoom zoom in? to my head
Gotta want me and not my bed
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch

Zoom zoom in? to my head
Gotta want me and not my bed
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch
