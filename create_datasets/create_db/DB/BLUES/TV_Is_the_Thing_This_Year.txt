If you want to have fun come home with me
You can stay all night and play with my TV
TV is the thing this year, this year
TV is the thing this year
Radio was great, now it's out of date
TV is the thing this year

Last night I was watching old Tom Nix
My TV broke, I was in a fix
I Got on the phone, and called my man, 
Said get here daddy as fast as you can

TV is the thing this year, oh
TV is the thing this year,
Radio was great, but now it's out of date
And TV is the thing this year

Now he turned my dial to channel one
I knew that this was gonna be fun
He turned my dial to channel two
That station thrilled me through and through

He moved one notch to channel three
I said oh how I love what you're doin' to me
He said, wait a minute, let's try channel four
Just about that time someone knocked on the door

TV is the thing this year, oh yes
TV is the thing this year,
Radio was great, now it's out of date
TV is the thing this year

The way he eased into channel five
That man must of had fluid drive
He moved once more to channel six
Then he opened up his bag of tricks

On channel seven the show was late
But we got our kicks on channel eight
He turned my dial to channel nine
Said Baby, your set is workin' fine

He moved on up to channel ten
Then we started all over again
He finally hit channel eleven
I cried mama, he treats your daughter so good!

TV is the thing this year, yes
TV is the thing this year
Yes radio was great, but now it's out of date
TV is the thing this year

Baby my set will need fixin' just about this time every night!
