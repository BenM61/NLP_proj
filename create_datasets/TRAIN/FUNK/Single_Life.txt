Every little thing you do
Makes me smile
And if I had my way, baby
I'd drive you up the wall

I'd take you through the pages
One by one
I don't want to get too serious
I just like having fun

Yeah, yeah
I just like having fun
Oh, sugar

I'm living the single, single, single
Life
The single, single, single
Life

Now I don't want anybody
To get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothing to hide
I want the world to see

Just like a car I'll drive you
Out of your mind
It's always the first step
In us having a good time

Oh, oh, oh, sugar

I'm living the single, single, single
Life
Single, single, single
Life

Single guys clap your hands
Yeah
Oh, sugar
Single ladies clap your hands

Feels so good
And it feels so good
Feels so good

I'm living the single, single, single
Life (Oh, sugar)
Single, single, single
Life

Single, single, single
Life
Single, single, single
Life

Single, single, single
Single, single, single
