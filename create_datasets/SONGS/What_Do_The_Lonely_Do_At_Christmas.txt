'Tis the season to be jolly
But how can I be when I have nobody
The yuletide carol doesn't make it better
Knowing that we won't be together

A silent night, I know it's gonna be
Joy to the world but it's gonna be sad for me

What do the lonely do at Christmas
Oh, what do the lonely do at Christmas time

The children can play with their new toys
While their little hearts burst open with joy
And lovers can kiss beneath the mistletoes
The choirs can sing those glorious songs of old

But what is left, oh, for me to do
Now that it's Christmas and I don't have you

What do the lonely do at Christmas
Oh, what do the lonely do at Christmas time

Oh, what do the lonely do at Christmas'
What do the lonely do at Christmas'
Oh, what do they do, what do they do at Christmas
Oh, what do they do, what do they do at Christmas

Oh, what do the lonely do at Christmas'
What do the lonely do at Christmas'
Oh, what do they do, what do they do at Christmas
