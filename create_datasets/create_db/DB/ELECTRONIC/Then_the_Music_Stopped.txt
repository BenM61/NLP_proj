Then the music stop,all the lights went out
Someone is crying now a time ago
For a moment we wished reality wasn't mend to be hurting so
A falling star music and candlelight
You know where they are so darling lead me through the night
When the music stopped ,we just walked away
Into every day people go 
Cloudy summer nights, dying city lights ,now I know that I need you so 

Please stay by me cause I can still feel the falling rain
I wanna be loved by you and the music starts again

A falling star music and candlelight
You know where they are, so darling lead me through the night
When the music stopped ,we just walked away
Into every day people go 
Cloudy summer nights dying ,city lights, now I know that I need you so 
Please stay by me cause I can still feel the falling rain
I wanna be loved by you and the music starts again

Come along with me I wanna be loved by you and the music starts again
Come along with me I wanna be loved by you and the music starts again
