The way you walk, the way you talk, 
The way you smile, the way you looked at me girl 
For a while, start to blush, 
Like a child, but I'm playing no game now 
I will do anything for your love 
Just say the word now 
You're my day, you're my night 
You're my sun, you're my rain, you're my world now 

I've got to have you, a a 
Got to hold you, oh oh 
I've got to squeeze you 
I'm longing for your love girl 
I've got to have you, a a 
Got to hold you, oh oh 
I've got to win your heart 

You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 

Fire, fire
Fire, fire 
Fire, fire  

The first time I saw your face 
Girl I know that I met my bride now 
Never felt this way for anyone 
So real inside now 
I can see myself taking strolls 
With you in the park now 
Hugging up, kissing up, loving up 
Just chilling on my yacht now 

I've got to have you, a a 
Got to hold you, oh oh 
I've got to squeeze you 
I'm longing for your love girl 
I've got to have you, a a 
Got to hold you, oh oh 
I've got to win your heart 

You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 

My heart is burning, burning, burning for your love 
My heart is aching, aching, aching for your love 
My heart is moaning, moaning, moaning for your love 
My heart is screaming, screaming for your love now 

You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 

The way you walk, the way you talk, 
The way you smile, the way you looked at me girl 
For a while, start to blush, 
Like a child, but I'm playing no game now 
I will do anything for your love 
Just say the word now 
You're my day, you're my night 
You're my sun, you're my rain, you're my world now 

I've got to have you, a a 
Got to hold you, oh oh 
I've got to squeeze you 
I'm longing for your love girl 
I've got to have you, a a 
Got to hold you, oh oh 
You are the one for me 

You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 
You set my soul on fire 

Fire, fire 
Fire, fire 
Fire, fire
