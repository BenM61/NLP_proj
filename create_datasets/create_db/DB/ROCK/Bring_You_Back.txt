It was the middle of the night
When I heard you took your life.
You were slowly changing, slowly changing
To black and white.

In the middle of the night
Our clock was stopped in time.
You were slowly fading, slowly fading from day to night.

I turn around, I turn around
And your not there.
I turn around, I turn around
And your not there.

I'll do anything if it would bring you back.
I'll go anywhere if you would show me the map.
Here I am, you don't have to ask.
I'd do anything if I could bring you back.

If we could have this one more day
I swear that I would find a way
To keep you here, to make you hear
That you mean everything.

Just give me five more minutes.
I'd give the world to have you in it.
My life is empty, if you could see me
Would you have left this way?

I turn around, I turn around
And your not there.
I turn around, I turn around
And your not there.

I'll do anything if it would bring you back.
I'll go anywhere if you would show me the map.
Here I am, you don't have to ask.
I'd do anything if I could bring you back.

I'll go anywhere if you would show me the map.
I'll do anything if it would bring you back.
Here I am, you don't have to ask.
I'd do anything if I could bring you back.

You don't have to ask for anything
Because you are still my everything.
I never feel complete without you.
I'll never heal completely without you back.

I'll do anything if it would bring you back.
(One last time)
I'll go anywhere if you would show me the map.
(One last time)
Here I am, you don't have to ask.
I'd do anything if I could bring you back.

I'll do anything if it would bring you back.
I'll go anywhere if you would show me the map.
Here I am, you don't have to ask.
I'd do anything if I could bring you back.

I never thought I'd ever make it.
It didn't hurt for me to try.
I'll do anything.
I'd do anything if I could bring you back.
I just wish I could bring you back.
