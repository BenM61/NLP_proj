[Chorus]
I got 5000 ones lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club 
I'm lookin' for her I'm lookin' for her 
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp I'm throwin' it up 
I'm lookin' for her I'm lookin' for her 

See me when I walk in ain't nothin' to it 
Brought ten stacks to the back then threw it 
Make it rain 
Ain't a thang 
When it come to money I got it Mayne 
You the next best thang 
I'm the hottest mayne 
You Talk that shit 
I'm bout it mayne 
We way over here 
Up out your range 
Don't try to be G 
That's not your thang 
You try me G 
That glock gon' bang 
K-I-N-G that's not gon' change 
I'm rich bitch I don't care about no fame 
Cause if all else fails I got cocaine 
Still see me all on TV wit it 
Still in da hood what ya need he get it 
Dough low 44 see me wit it 
If a nigga runnin' up best believe he get it 
See us in da club nigga we be trippin' 
Niggas rap bout that shit we livin' 
7 or 8 stacks on 2 or 3 bitches 
Sucka niggas over there hatin' we chillin' 
I ran out of ones so go back get more 
Say shawty bend it over back real slow 
Jack that ass up grab that pole 
Show me you bout that action hoe 

[Chorus]

Stacks so fat rubberbands can't hold 
Stacks so fat rubberbands can't hold 
Stacks so fat rubberbands can't hold it no 
They can't hold it no they can't hold it no 

Eeenie meenie miny moe 
I'm lookin' for the direction this money bout to go 
I'm bout ta blow 
We pop bottles 
Me and the whole clique certified shot callas 
Blow top dollas 
Got this bitch jumpin' off the chain like rottweilers 
5000 ones throw em then stop 
See I'm lookin' for the baddest bitch 
Splurge for a second when I'm done you can have this bitch

Ones in my hand that's good money 
Ones in my fan we get money 
She pop that thang she get that 
That money's fallin' like rain 
I'm VIP that's champagne

And yes indeed I got change 
Or shall I say I got paper 
Stacked money tall as skyscrapers 
Hater's you fly I fly paper 
She pop that thang she get that 
She make it hot like wasabe 
Look at that body on mommy 
She probably stand right beside me 
And I tsunami lil' mommy 

[Chorus]

They call me young 
My money long 
I make it rain 
Now loose your thong 
Now loose your bottoms 
Now loose your tops 
You saw what I just spent 
I could've bought a watch 
I could've bought a car 
Maybe a couple bricks 
I send my hood bitch the fifths on a shoppin' trip 
5000 Ones ya you know young wit it 
So high up in the air she need a flight to go get it 
Still mr. magic city 
You know no replacements 
This is what I do I got a pole in my basement 
If I can make it to onyx I bring onyx to the condo 
Call lil bro bring me 20 grand pronto 

[Chorus]

Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold 
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold 
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it no 
They can't hold it no they can't hold it no

And the muthafuckin' betta' bet not bitch about it

Sip on some that patron

When she come up wit a fatty I gladly tip her Jazze, 
Tell 'em what I got 

[Chorus]
