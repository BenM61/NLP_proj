Cold wind blow this waiting blood
Flow into my ashen arms
Ice stream prick my sleeping skin

She is like the so black time
Race on in and never go away
She's just like the wind

Black car with your creaking wheel
Take away these thoughts of mine

Once there was a crazy man
Staring from his drunken eyes
Staring stony into her elbow's way
Stared at me and telling me
'stead of 'oh poor lonely me
I claw the bed and I claw my hair

Oh black car with your creaking wheel
Take away these thoughts of mine
Pictures sing in rhythm with 'em
Dig the holes for me to sleep inside

She is free
A shadow crossing the sky
Free from hope and this misery
She's beautiful, so beautiful away from me
She is free
She is free

Instead of me is this creaking wheel
Take away these thoughts of mine
Pictures sing in rhythm with 'em
Dig the holes for me to sleep inside

Black car with your creaking wheel
Take away these thoughts of mine
Catch us sing in rhythm with 'em
Dig both holes for me to sleep inside

She is free
Shadow crossing the sky
Free from hope and this misery
So beautiful away from me
She is free
She is free
