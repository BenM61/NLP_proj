Burning sands
Winds of desire
Mirrored oasis
Reflect a burning fire

Within my heart unwatered
Feeding the flame
Welcoming you to my harem

Sing for me
A song of life's visage
Sing for me
A tune of love's mirage

Deep desires
Sleep untold
Whispers that echo
The desert of my soul

I hold your Eastern promise
Close to my heart
Welcoming you to my harem

Sing for me
A song of life's visage
Sing for me
A tune of love's mirage

Time is change
Time's fool is man
Time will escape
The passing sands of time

I hold your Eastern promise
Close to my heart
Welcoming you to my harem
