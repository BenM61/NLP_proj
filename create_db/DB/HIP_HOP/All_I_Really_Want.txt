All I want

Every time I call she just come
Cause every time I call she get to cum
Damn I'm in love again look what this shit done
When I used to keep a roll of them bitches like which one (one one)
(its the boss)

(radio killer)

Its not a dream baby

(radio killer killer killer)

Or is it a dream

She graduated from the school of arts
Now she swimming in a pool of sharks
Roughest niggas with the coolest cars
Sophomore year had a 1st minaj
Better DC like go barrack
Girl drunk it like a Fiji and she blowed my socks
Every night she coming through for me to f*ck that
Found out she had a man I holla f*ck that
Better give that boy a bus pass
I see no competition baby girl a must have
My letters hinted on my mustache
The remy never did or did he get make a bus pass
Good dick may a chick wanna cut class
The way I'm knocking on the door they call it trespass
She my dime not the one I wanna curse at
Looking fine real diamonds on a cutglass

People call you blind (people call you blind)
But all you need is me girl (all you need is me girl)
Your all thats I'm my mind (oh yeah)
All you need is me girl

All a nigga really want is you
All a nigga want is you

All a nigga really want is you
All a nigga want is you

All a nigga really want is you
All a nigga want is you

All a nigga really want is you
All a nigga want is you

Who can hit it more faster
I'm talking authentic orgasms
Film that play it on a big plasma
Back to work just a little bit faster
She say life is a journey
I need mine just like my attorney
I get sued like a nigga switch shoes
Long money but he gotta a quick fuse
Ride slow but I'm in a quick car
Pause for a minute paint em' in a picture
Baby girl my money good
Who turned her on a nigga least kirk wood
Time to give that boy a bus pass
I see no competition girl a must have
She shines like a diamond
Motivation for morining

People call you blind (people call you blind)
But all you need is me girl (all you need is me girl)
Your all thats I'm my mind (oh yeah)
All you need is me girl

Swade pea coat with the Gucci trim
Knew it was him by the Gucci brim
We gotta do it B I G
I'm trying to hit the lottery in V I P
Green leafs in my shot glass
All night soul team had cirrock add
Ain't nothing you can tell me
I'm on them hills like I'm Jonathan Kelsy
Told her friends that she felt me
We mad love through the love hate lp
You my Josephine baker
May need morphine the deeper that I take her
I'm a back breaker another text bracket
Benz Maybach her
Green bay packa
My life a movie so tonight that's where to jack her

People call you blind (people call you blind)
But all you need is me girl (all you need is me girl)
Your all thats I'm my mind (oh yeah)
