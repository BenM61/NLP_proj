Time to get back on the road 
Gonna leave these troubles behind 
Time to carry the load 
What my life is a true design 
You won't reach me by phone 
I'll be moving round between the line 
Time to get back on the road 
Gonna mend this heart of mine 

Don't you cry, when I say goodbye 
Baby, baby, carry on 
Don't you cry, when I say goodbye 
Cause baby, you're not alone 

The love that we shared was grand, 
But not enough to keep me still 
I hope someday you understand 
Music gives my heart, a thrill 

Don't you cry, when I say goodbye 
Baby, baby, carry on 
Don't you cry, when I say goodbye 
Cause, baby, you're not alone 

Since the day that my life began 
A band has been my true life plan 
Time to get back on the road 
Feel the music, take the stand 
You are my true love, 
Still there will be no one, to take your place 
This feeling, I can't erase. 
Got to move and have my space 

Don't you cry, when I say goodbye 
Baby, baby, carry on 
Don't you cry, when I say goodbye
