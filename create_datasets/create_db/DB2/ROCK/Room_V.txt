Not long ago a plan was conceived where all could be revealed
Critical info delivered in secret, but kept out in plain sight

We're underground 'cause we have enlisted
Got data in our groove
Yes, they gave us the guns, they made us the pilots
A battalion of six inside out, it's all for one and one for all

Here we are, we're the band, we got your marching orders
It's in the music and the words that we sing
Sing along, sing aloud, and you'll join the answer
We will rock with the thunder of a thousand mighty horses

Beijing to New York City and everywhere between
Lies the heart of the good, the will of the people
Now shake your cages, shake your cages
In the fields, now hear us
In the cities, hear us
Bend don't break, you can ride out the storms
It's time to fight or die, deliver us from evil
All around the world, you're not alone
We'll be right here and coming to your home from Room V

Here we are, we're the band, we got your marching orders
It's in the music and the words that we sing
Sing along, sing out loud, and you'll join the answer
We will rock with the thunder of a thousand mighty horses
