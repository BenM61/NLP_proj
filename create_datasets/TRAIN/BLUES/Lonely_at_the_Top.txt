I've been around the world
Had my pick of any girl
You'd think I'd be happy
But I'm not
Ev'rybody knows my name
But it's just a crazy game
Oh  it's lonely at the top

Listen to the band  they're playing just for me
Listen to the people paying just for me
All the applause all the parades
And all the money I have made
Oh  it's lonely at the top

Listen all you fools out there
Go on and love me I don't care
Oh  it's lonely at the top
Oh, it's lonely at the top
