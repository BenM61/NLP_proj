It was the sight of you
In those ten dollar shoes
First made me jump for joy
Your foreign kiss in Indianapolis
Is out of my mind hardly any time

'Cause l've been
Burnin', burnin', baby burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby all night long
Burnin', burnin', baby, burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby, all night long

A sight was to be seen in a Ramada Inn
One day late last July
The party up for grabs left
In a Checker Cab
You sweet little thing, I'll give you a ring
'Cause l've been

'Cause l've been
Burnin', burnin', baby burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby all night long
Burnin', burnin', baby, burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby, all night long

I've been

'Cause l've been
Burnin', burnin', baby burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby all night long
Burnin', burnin', baby, burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby, all night long
