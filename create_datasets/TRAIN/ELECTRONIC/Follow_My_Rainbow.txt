I'm not just looking for an answer to my prayers or my dreams
It's just I feel my love needs more consistancy
I'm about out of luck, half out of time I'm just about to lose my mind
I'm starting to lose touch with my reality I never wished on stars

I never thought that dreams came true.
Yet in the midst of all my disbelief
Darlin' now I feel like I am long overdue
I search high and low to find my pot of gold

And that's why, yeah
Some day I'm gonna follow my rainbow.
Some day I'm gonna reach for the sky
By then if you're not ready or able

I'll pack my pride for one last time
Cross my heart and pray our love won't die.
I'm not looking for an angel to make good on all my dreams
It's just I feel our love's not all that it should be

I'm not looking for a miracle. A mircale won't do
The only miracle I need is to be you
I don't believe in wishing wells
Wishes don't come true.

Yet in the midst of all my disbelief
Darlin' now I feel like I am long overdue
I'm searching high and low to find my pot of gold
And that's why, yeah

Some day I'm gonna follow my rainbow.
Some day I'm gonna reach for the sky
By then if you're not ready or able
I'll pack my pride for one last time

Cross my heart and pray our love won't die.
I've searched high and low to find my pot of gold
And that's why, yeah
Some day I'm gonna follow my rainbow.

Some day I'm gonna reach for the sky
By then if you're not ready or able
I'll pack my pride for one last time
Cross my heart and pray our love won't die.

Some day I'm gonna follow my rainbow.
Some day I'm gonna reach for the sky
By then if you're not ready or able
I'll pack my pride for one last time
Cross my heart and pray our love won't die.
