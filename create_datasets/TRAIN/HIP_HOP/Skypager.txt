Do you know the importance of a skypager?

Those who don't believe, see you're laid behind
Got our skypagers on all the time
Hurry up and get yours 'cause I got mine
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine
If you're with a G and you're sippin wine
Eating caccatore with a twist of lime
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Joint by base, then you get your high

If you get your then high, mine is next
The 'S' in skypage really stands for sex
Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
Having bad days like a voodoo hex
Conceptually, a pager is so complex
'Cause I be standing by the phone ready to flex

Uh, so funky, uh, so funky, uh, so funky

The batteries I use are called Duracell
They last for three weeks so they do me well
Don't be going through no phases my joint stays on
24-7, from dusk til dawn
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
You greed for the Phifer, I can be reached
A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code '69", that means you want some (cock)

People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is, 'cause it makes me scoul
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothers know it hurts when you're on the prowl
Grabbing on my joint 'cause I'm an eager owl
Get paged by a G or a business pal
My shit is overflowing, they won't allow
Another page, so I'll just end this now
