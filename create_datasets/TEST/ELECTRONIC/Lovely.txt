Looking back at my life I see
The emptiness and pain that was inside of me
My faded memory only reminds me
How you helped put the past behind be

You are the one like sun
Beaming light rays into my eyes
You are the like the sun
Beaming light rays into my eyes

I can't describe the way I feel
The words escape me it so real
But you're lovely in the best way
Lovely like the rain on a summers day

You wash away my pain in every way
You came along and showed me that I made it
And they say that love is never
For the jaded

I can't describe the way I feel
The words escape me it's so real
But you're lovely
In the best way

Because you're lovely so lovely
In the best way
So lovely in the best way
You came along and showed me that I made it
And they say that love is never for the jaded
