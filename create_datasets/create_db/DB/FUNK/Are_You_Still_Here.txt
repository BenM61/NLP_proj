Are you still here
Are you still haunting me
Are you still wanting me to want you
Although you have gone

Are you still here
I don't know what to do for this
I thought I traded you for Mr. Blues
But you keep hangin' on

I thought you had gone for good
I thought I could make it
Even though I thought I could
I cant take it

You're like a chain, my love
And I cant seem to break it
You're like a chain, my love
And I cant seem to break it

Yes, you're still here
How can you be here when you're there
I feel your presence everywhere
Although you have gone
You keep hangin' on
Although you have gone
