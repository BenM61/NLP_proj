Love's sweet music that I hear
I've found someone to love
All my troubles disappear
I've found someone to love
And I will always want you near
I've found someone to love
I've found someone to love

And when the darkness falls
That's when lover calls
And in the shadow light
That's when I know
That's when I know it's got to be
Got to be so right, yeah

Oh yeah

Listen now baby

She gives me music in my soul
I've found someone to love
And I will never let this go
I've found someone to love
Oh baby she just has to let it show
She found someone to love yeah
She found someone to love

And when the darkness falls
That's when your lover calls
And in the shadow light
That's when I know
That's when I know it's got to 
Got to be so right

I've found someone to love

She gives me music in my soul
Yes I've found someone to love
And I will never, never let go
I've found I've found I've found someone to love yeah baby
