When the culture's drowning in a bad dream
Save myself, save myself and
When the old religion is the new greed
Save myself, save myself and
They sabotaged the levee, killed gris gris
Save myself, save myself and
When the vultures copyright the word free
Save myself, I got to save myself and

Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come

Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come

When the elders all are playing make believe
Save myself, I got to save myself and
When they teach us lessons that they don't believe
Save myself, I got to save myself and
When they build up statues but neglect their seed
Save myself, I got to save myself and
When my love and my hammers all I really need
Save myself, I got to save myself and

Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come

Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come

Slow and steady
Slow and steady
Slow and steady
Slow and steady
Slow and steady
Slow and steady
Slow and steady
Slow and steady

When I live in a country without history
Save myself, I got to save myself and
One that buried it's roots with it's identity
Save myself, I got to save myself and
We still are searching for liberty
Save myself, I got to save myself and
We still are hiding from reality
Save myself, I got to save myself and

Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come

Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
Baby won't you come
