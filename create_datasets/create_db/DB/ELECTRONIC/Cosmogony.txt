Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then our universe
Was an empty sea, until a silver fox
And her cunning mate began to sing
A song that became the world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then our universe
Was a cold black egg, until the God inside
Burst out and from its shattered shell
He made what became the world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then our universe
Was an endless land, until our ancestors
Woke up and before they went back to sleep
They carved it up into the world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then our universe
Wasn't even there, until a sudden bang
And then there was light, was sound, was matter
And it all became the world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
And dance eternal
