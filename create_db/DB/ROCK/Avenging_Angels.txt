Calling all avenging angels

Vengeance you know it tastes so good
Vengeance is cold as ice
When it has you in its sights (x2)

CHORUS
Calling all avenging angels
Angels
Kick-ass angels
REPEAT

You could give a call to Scotland Yard
Or send for help from the FBI
But they won't stop a bomb going off

With only seconds on the clock

REPEAT CHORUS

Angel oh angel
Here to brighten up my darkest day
Take me in your arms
Protect me from my enemies (enemies)

Oh deadly angel
Oh angel
And when they've got on my knees
When they're just about to do the deadly deed
You rescue me (rescue me)
Rescue me (rescue me)

REPEAT CHORUS

Angels angels
Kick-ass angels

REPEAT TWICE
