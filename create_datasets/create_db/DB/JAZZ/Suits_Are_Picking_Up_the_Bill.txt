In a line at a cafe
I overheard a waitress say
'These cats is broke, I knows 'em
Through 'em out the doors and close 'em'

Still look saggy, for so low
This occupation's got to go
Up pulls the limo, up goes the thrill
The suits are picking up the bill

It's alright for them to tag along
It's just one bill their tagging on
I'll find some way to get along
The business suits to the rescue
So nice doing business with you
Do we really hate the clock
When we realize that 'Oh, their selling down for the deal'
The suits are picking up, the suits are picking up the bill

I cannot say from where I'm standing
My friends have passed out on the landing
Yes, one too many has left us high and dry
I've been feeling down, since the suits got back in town
