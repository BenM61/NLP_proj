Under a sky, no one sees
Waiting
Watching it happening
Don't hurry
Give it time
Things are the way they have to be.

Slow down. Give it time.
Still life
You know I am listening
The moment that you want is coming
If you give it time

When you wake up!
When you wake up!
You will find me

When you wake up!
When you wake up!
You will find me

Under a sky.
No one else sees.
You're sure.
Appears in front of me
The sky clears
The sun hits

I am here. Waiting. It's happening
The moment that you want is coming
If you give it time

When you wake up!
When you wake up!
You will find me

When you wake up!
When you wake up!
You will find me
