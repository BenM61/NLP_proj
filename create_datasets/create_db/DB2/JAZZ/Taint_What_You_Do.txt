When I was a kid about half past three
My ma said, "Daughter, come here to me"
Says, "Things may come and things may go
But this is one thing you ought to know"

Oh, 'tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
'Tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
'Tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
That's what gets results

'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
That's what gets results

You can try hard, don't mean a thing
Take it easy, breezy, then your jive will swing

Oh, it 'tain't what you do; it's the place that you do it
'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
'Tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
That's what gets results

You've learned your A B C's
You've learned your D F G's
But this is something you don't learn in school

So get your hep boots on
And then you'll carry on
But remember if you try too hard
It don't mean a thing, take it easy

'Tain't what bring do; it's the way that you bring it
'Tain't what swing do; it's the way that you swing it
'Tain't what sing do; it's the way that you sing it
That's what gets results

That's what gets results, rebop
