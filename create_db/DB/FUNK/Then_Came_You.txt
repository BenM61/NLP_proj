Ever since I met you
Seems I can't forget you
The thought of you keeps runnin' through
The back of my mind

Every time I'm near you
I get that urge to feel you
Just touchin' you and lovin' you
Makes everything right (Tell me how you feel, baby)

I never knew love before (Oh, no)
Then came you, you, then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you, ooh, then came you
You

Now that I have found you
How did I live without you (I don't know, baby)
It's plain to see you're all I need
To satisfy me

I'm so darn proud of you
I want to sing about you (Sing, sing, sing, baby)
So all I know you made love grow
By touchin' my hand

Oh, oh, I never knew love before
Then came you, you, then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you, ooh, then came you
Hey, then came you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I never knew love before
Then came you, then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you, you, then came you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I never knew love before
Then, hey, then came you
I never knew love before
Hey, then came you, you, you, you, you, you

Hey, hey, you know that I never knew love before, no
Then came you, then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you, ooh, then came you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I never knew love before
Then came you, then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you, you, you, you, then came you

No, no, I never knew love before
