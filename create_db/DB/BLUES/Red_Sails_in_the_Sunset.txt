'Twas down where fisher folk gather,
I wander'd far from the throng
I heard a fisher girl singing
And this refrain was her song:

Red sails in the sunset
'Way out on the sea
Oh! carry my loved one
Home safely to me.
He sailed at the dawning
All day I've been blue
Red sails in the sunset
I'm trusting in you
Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We marry tomorrow
And he goes sailing no more.
Red sails in the sunset
'Way out on the sea
Oh! carry my loved one
Home safely to me.

Red sails, the night wind is blowing
And clouds are hiding the moon
Above no bright stars are glowing
It means the storm's coming soon.
