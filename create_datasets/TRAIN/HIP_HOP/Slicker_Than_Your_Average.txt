Yo Craig (yeah)
There's some real jealous people
out there right (uh huh)
Trying to say how you're wack (what)
How your music's soft (what)
And you ain't got nothing to say (what!)
Well it's album number two right (yeah)
So you gotta let 'em know (that's right)
So do your thing (yeah)
Take your time (yeah)
Speak your mind (listen)

Ever since I first stepped up
They thought I wasn't good enough, no
They told me that I'd only last one song

(That's foolish man, what's he got now
7 million albums? Ha!)

They said I wasn't from the streets
When I was working behind the scenes
Shit like this don't happen overnight, no no

Now they're telling me 
Bout my imagery
How I'm so squeaky clean 
Whenever I'm on TV
Too much jealousy 
In the industry
Why are you watching me
When you should just let me be, Craig

Slicker than your average
Tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average
Tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average, hey
Tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average
So tell me what do you want from me

Some people say it's been too long
That's why I'm here to prove them all wrong
So why do imitators want to bit my style?
(Ladies and gentlemen) Eh?
(Will the real Craig David please stand up)
You never had a problem at all
When I was having woman trouble
Somebody fill me in didn't I serve my time?
Remember who gave you rewind

Now they're telling me 
That I'm too are 'n' be	
How I turned my back on
The whole UK garage scene
Now they're stressing me
When I know there's much more to see
Why are you watching me
When you should just let me be, Craig

Slicker than your average
Oh, tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average
Tell me what do you want from me?(Craig!)
Slicker than your average
Hey, tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average
So tell me what you want from me

Everywhere that I go
(Everywhere that I go)
They keep stopping my flow
(They keep stopping my flow) Craig!
Everywhere that I go
(Everywhere that I go)
They keep stopping my flow, yo, check it

There comes a time 
When you've gotta take a stand 
To do it right
As much as I like
I can't possibly please everyone)

Slicker than your average
Singer serving garage
Busy trying to slam me 
'cause I smashed it
What they don't understand is 
I'm getting them established
By taking British music to the masses
Now gold diggers go bananas
The same ones that didn't show me no love
When I was cashless
In the day when it really mattered
When I was penning competition
No publishing hits for damage
Now to go gold to me's a minimal
I'm involved in them platinum plaques
And records sold
Heaven knows that I've battled 
Producers with egos
And there were those who were told
Exactly where to go
Somebody please stop these little kids
That want to pull bumpers off my 206
Shoutin' outside of
The block I used to live
They don't like my records 
So why listen to this?

Slicker than your average
Tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average
Tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average
Hey, tell me what do you want from me?
Slicker than your average
So tell me what you want from me

(Everywhere that I go)
They be telling me that 
I can't rock the shows
(They keep stopping my flow)
Creeping, scheming and screaming
Trying to mess up my flow
(Everywhere that I go)
I want to tell the world
Let them know
(They keep stopping my flow)
So tell me what you want from me, oh

Everywhere that I go
They keep stopping my flow
Everywhere that I go
They keep stopping my flow
