It's time I'm walking to New Orleans
I'm walking to New Orleans
I'm going to need two pair of shoes
When I get through walking to you
When I get back to New Orleans

I've got my suitcase in my hand
Now, ain't that a shame
I'm leaving here today
Yes, I'm going back home to stay
Yes, I'm walking to New Orleans

You used to be my honey
Till you spent all my money
No use for you to cry
I'll see you bye and bye
Cause I'm walking to New Orleans

I've got no time for talking
I've got to keep on walking
New Orleans is my home
That's the reason why I'm going
Yes, I'm walking to New Orleans

I'm walking to New Orleans
I'm walking to New Orleans
I'm walking to New Orleans
