Better be my lover
Underneath my cover
Want to see no other
Here in my bed
You are such a wild guy
Absolutely not shy
You're the one 'cause I
Can't by me love

An' I say-I want you to freshen up my ming
So I pray-that you will be there to spend the time

Come baby,come baby,rock my life
Come baby,you're maybe on my side
I want your sex an' tonight
I hope you're never fadin'-right
Come baby-no lady-rock my life
I'm ready now to have the final drive
You got my lovin' goin'
Now there will be no slowin' down

Can you make me scream again tonight
I'll fulfill your dreams,my boy-all night

Want to see you movin'
Gonna make me movin'
Surely will be losin'
My head tonight
Gotta show some rockin'
There won't be no stoppin'
An? I?ll get your knockin'
On heavens door

An' I say-I want you to freshen up my mind
So I pray-that you will be there to spend the time
