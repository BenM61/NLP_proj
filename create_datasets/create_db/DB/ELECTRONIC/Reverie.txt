From the stage
I see you
In the shadows, staring into space
I'm alone, peddling poems
And the stage lights break across your face

Reverie, reverie you are all I need
Suddenly suddenly only silence sounds inside
Could it be could it be all that I've ever wanted
To be free, to be free with you standing by my side

In the dark
I feel you,
Move in circles, circling the space
When you speak
You flicker your eyelids
And your green eyes glance over my face
