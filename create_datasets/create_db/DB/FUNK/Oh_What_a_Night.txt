You better go join the Campfire Girls 
Take a few piano lessons 
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend 
Do all the things that little girls do 
'Cause if you don't know how to be true 
You better go start over again 

Now you told me you were my girl & that I was your man 
But all you did was play me for a fool 
Now don't you know it's wrong to lie 
& make the one who loves you cry 
I wonder where you missed the Golden Rule 

You better go join the Campfire Girls 
Take a few piano lessons 
Buy a little doll to have for your best friend 
Do all the things that little girls do 
'Cause if you don't know how to be true 
You better go start over again 

You must think that love's a game that you play just for fun 
'Cause you laughed when you broke my heart in 2 
It must've sounded like Chinese 
When you heard about the birds & bees 
You've got a lot of catchin' up to do
