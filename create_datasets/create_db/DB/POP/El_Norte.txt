It's a million miles 
A giant place 
Like a work of art 
Amazing, amazing 

Fast cars that cannot move 
Die for a parking space 
Stuck on a carousel 
Crazy, it's crazy 

When you laugh 
Till you cry 
When you laugh 

[Chorus]
All's well here in El Norte 
Who'd have thought it could be like this 
Big money for a job well done 
I swear to you 
I got a ride from a coyote 
Who sells high on the black market 

So your loved one can be home soon 
So your loved one can be home soon 

Fine women with dress-up clothes 
Say and do anything 
Wake up to work the day 
Tousled and tangled 

Rub shoulders with the downtown gang 
Where the Virgin lives 
Just like a movie star 
Hopeful and graceful 

When she smiles 
Till you laugh 
Till you cry 

[Chorus]

Maybe I don't understand it 
Maybe I won't try 
But nobody seems too satisfied 

[Chorus]
