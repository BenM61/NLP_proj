I'm only sleeping
I'm only sleeping
Woke up this morning going back to bed
Alarm clock ringing in tune with my head
The to leave my boredom
Just 'cause I cannot 
TV is my TV

Because the council after me
And when it's on it's pictures 
I numb to the war in a distant country
I'm only sleeping
So I cover myself my quilt
My power's run down and so is my guilt
At times like this I'm at a loss
Drifting in dreams

My face and I the fact
The dss is on my back
I used to care a lot
Now the world spins before me
These days consist of sleep
Days TV

?
I'm only sleeping
I'm only sleeping
Don't wake me, don't wake me
I'm only sleeping
Don't call me, don't wake me
I'm only sleeping

?
Don't wake me, don't shake me
I'm only sleeping
Don't wake me, don't wake me
I'm only sleeping
I'm only dreaming
