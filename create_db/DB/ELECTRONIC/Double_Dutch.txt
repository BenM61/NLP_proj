All over the world high school girls
Take to the ropes and turn them slow

Starts a beat and a loop
They skip and jump through the hoop

They might break and they might fall
About the gals from New York City

They just start again
Start again
Heh ebo ebonettes
Heh
Ebo ebonettes

Heh ebo
Ebo ebo ebonettes

Heh ebo
Ebo ebo ebonettes

Heh ebo
Ebo ebo ebonettes.
Hmm
The golden angels - aah
The Ford green angels

The five town diamond skippers
The pleasure of rope rippers

Those dark and lovely skippers
Those five town diamond skippers.
Skip they do's the double Dutch
That's them dancing
Skip they do's the double Dutch
That's them dancing

Skip they do's the double Dutch
That's them dancing
Skip they do's the double Dutch
That's them dancing
Swing those ropes round and around

All the teams change your partners now

Somersault through the hoop, leap to beat the clicks
That keep on coming
Heh
Watch your feet to win the double Dutch - stay jumping.

Heh ebo ebonettes
Heh
Ebo ebo ebonettes
Etc.

The mighty motion skippers
The pleasure of rope rippers

Aah
The dark and lovely skippers
Hmm
Mighty motion skippers
The skip they do's the double Dutch
That's them dancing
The skip they do's the double Dutch
That's them dancing
Heh girls
How many skips can you do?
