Do you like concrete agony Kreuzberg on Saturday?
Tell me baby what you need
There's the Zoo alive as the city sleeps tonight
Eternal divided dream

Going down to Potsdamer singing Checkpoint Charlie blues
The 70's brought Bowie baby
Do what you do

You gotta feel Berlin
Baby yeah
You gotta feel Berlin
Baby yeah
You gotta feel Berlin

Do you like punk rock mutiny rock 'n' roll depravity?
Tell me baby what you need
Boys keep swinging Wild At Heart until the morning
Let this baby set you free

Going down to Potsdamer singing Checkpoint Charlie blues
The 70's brought Bowie baby
Do what you do

You gotta feel Berlin
Baby yeah
You gotta feel Berlin
Baby yeah

Just life that's what it is
Don't be afraid of an angel's kiss
Just life that's what it is
Don't be afraid of
A criminal kiss
