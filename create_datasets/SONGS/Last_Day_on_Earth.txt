As I collapsed to watch the movie
A hand reached out and pulled me through the screen
Angels descending from the rooftops
They wanna take me to all these places I've never seen

But I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cause a diversion
And head 'em off at the pass
And this is my last day on earth
This is my last day

Listening to when Ann cries and swears
And kisses all her lover's ex-lover's lips
She's only known the flights of ecstasy (and agony)
And she's never felt lost throughout all of this

But she's really had it this time
She's had it so much it's starting to make her sick
She says lets exit quick
And this is her last day on earth
This is her last day
This is our last day
The is my last day on earth

Now I'm burning for somewhere
I'm gonna tape on these paper wings and fly high
And maybe close and maybe burn but high

This is my last day on earth
Last day on earth
