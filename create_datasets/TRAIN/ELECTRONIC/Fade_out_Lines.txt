(Deeper down)

It's every where I look
From Las Vegas to Richter here
Under your dresser
Right by you ear
It's creeping in sweetly
It's definitely here
There's nothing more deadly
Than slow growing fear

Life was full and fruitful
And you could a take a real bite
The juice pouring well over
You skins delight
But the shadow it grows
And take the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces
To this principles ballet

The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Until the fade out line

The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Until the deeper down

Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust
The clock is ticking, it's last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks

The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Until the fade out line

The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Until the fade out line

Heading deep down
We're sliding without noticing
Our own decline
Heading deep down
We're hanging onto
Sweet nothings left behind
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Down, deeper down, yeah

Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust
The clock is ticking, it's last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks

Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust
The clock is ticking, it's last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks

The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Until the fade out line

The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Until the fade out line

We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
Without noticing we slide down
Deeper down
The shadow grows without ever slowing down
We are heading straight
Into the fade out line
