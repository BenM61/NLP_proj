She's got a roof that don't leak
When the rain's pouring down
She's got a place I can sleep
Where I'm safe and sound

She's got a lock on her door
But she gave me a key
She don't walk the floor
Oh, but she worries about me

Her love has no strings, shackles or chains
But I'm holding on for dear life
She's like rolling a seven
Everytime I roll the dice

She's got a big Oldsmobile
She's got a dog that don't bite
She's got a heart I can steal
Like a thief in the night

She's got a slow burning fire
She keeps the radio low
When she gets inspired
We let the good times roll

Her love has no strings, shackles or chains
But I'm holding on for dear life
She's like rolling a seven
Everytime I roll the dice
