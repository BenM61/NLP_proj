The way the girlies just go to him 
Well ya should've seen 
the guy yeah  he's got style and it's plain to see 
Smooth shoes and cool tattoos 
Hair pomped as tight as can be 
He ain't got a girlfriend 
No one to sing this song to 
He's gotta settle down 
If he meets that special girl soon 
He knows just what to do 
When it comes to the girls 
He writes them poetry 
And he picks them flowers 
He knows just what to say 
When it comes to the ladies 
Knows how to make a girl smile 
How to drive a girl crazy
