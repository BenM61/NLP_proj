Swimming in his sweat, freshly-minted breath
Crashing into bed
I'm getting to the end of the Jameson
Tangled up in all your limbs
Whatever we took is a fate and embrace
Ended up wasted in your hiding place
Just when you wake up I make up my mind
It's the last time

And I smoked all your cigarettes, but I don't feel that bad
You're the Cadillac of black magic, baby
And I take my time to undress
You're looking at the last of your secret stash
Your secret stash, your secret stash
Your secret stash, your secret stash

Your secret, your secret, your secret

This was my plan, heart racing again
Same old song and dance
Fumbling for keys, twisted in the sheets
Something's in control of me
Whatever we took is a fate and embrace
Ended up wasted in your hiding place
Just when you wake up I make up my mind
It's the last time

And I smoked all your cigarettes, but I don't feel that bad
We're the Cadillac of black magic, baby
And I take my time to undress
You're looking at the last of your secret stash
Your secret stash, your secret stash
Your secret stash, your secret stash

Your secret, your secret, your secret
Your secret, your secret, your secret

Your secret, your secret, your secret
Your secret, your secret
Your secret, your secret
Your secret, your secret

And I take my time to undress
You're looking at the last of your secret stash
