Virgin Mary is alone in her room
In the pale light of the moon
She holds the bible in her hand
She is covered with blood
The gates of heaven - opened wide
Everything is clear and bright
This is our wedding night
In this wonderful light

Virgin Mary in her wedding-dress
She's waiting in her golden bed
Frozen dreams in the land of flies
This is our paradise
The gates of heaven opened wide
Everything is clear and bright
This is our wedding night
In this sacred light

If I could believe
My life would be easy
A beggar man, a thief
God loves you all
If I could believe
My life would be easy
I wish you were here
To dry my tears
