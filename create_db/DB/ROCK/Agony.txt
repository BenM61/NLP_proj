Could I break through the walls you put me in?
Can I be sure you really keep me here?
Blood on my fingers seems to testify 
To my imprisonment, but I have my doubts 

My faith is on the wane
I will choose silence
Do I resist when you bring me bread?
Am I not tempted when you promise more?

Silence 
I like the sound of it
If I keep it up 
Then will you let me go?

Blood on my fingers
Jesus was that really me?
Sorry thank you, sorry thank you, sorry thank you, thank you let me go
Keep me here

Keep me here
Am I tempted when you promise the world?
Blood on my fingers
Jesus was that really me

Sorry thank you sorry thank you sorry thank you sorry thank you
