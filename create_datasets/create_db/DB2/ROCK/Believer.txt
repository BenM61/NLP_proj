(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm goin' nowhere

I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go
No
And I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit angry
When everyone's around
But I get a little lonely
When no one's out

I feel my demons misleading me

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
Weights off my shoulders,
It was bringin' me down (Down)

I've never been that lucky
I've never tasted fame (Fame)
I'm always lookin' for somethin'
But I hate changing

Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinnin' and I won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there

'Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

(I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go)

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

I'm just a believer that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go

(Na na na na na, nana na na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na, nana na na na na na na na na)

I don't wanna let it go!
