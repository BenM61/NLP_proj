Ahh, the outdoors, the fresh outdoors 
Word up  it's a beautiful day 
'Bout to go poli' right now that's my WORD 
Aiyyo 
Aiyyo call me a cab it's the Razor Sharp kid 
Dipped everyday my style is po lit' 
I'm out to the Mansion I gots to catch Ghost 
I'm headed to the club tonight  we need toast 
For that wack ass MC  talkin' all the shit 
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split 
It's war with the Gods this year, represent 
The bitch-ass niggaz keep tryin' to repent 
But we still lickin' off, we wild like two cent 
Park Hill Projects, say it witcha lungs 
F*ck y'all cats, we always got guns 
But just in case, we get drunk and can't drive 
We gotta f*ck somethin' up, dead or alive 
Y'all comin with us, we live on the other side 
Of the chart, where your mother met Poppa Wu

Black boyyyeee, in your virtue
Black boyyeeee, no more suffering 
Black boyyeeee, shine the light for we 
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy

After the tour I came back for more 
Comin' correctly, just like before 
Wu-Tang Forever, I was just a pirate 
In the rec room regulatin' with Osirus 
Deep thoughts, I don't take no shorts 
Minds on lease like expensive imports 
Elevate the seed, no lust or greed 
Livin' life long time may continue to breed 
Never gettin' caught up inside the agencies 
For ten long years, but I paid my fee 
Now I'm on the front line with W.T.C. 
Back me down these streets are still ill 
From Brownsville all the way down in Park Hill 
Pack with the beef cause niggaz won't chill 
Cats smoked out like chicken on the grill 
I'm takin' this shit way back to Bill Bill 
In the projects where my man got killed 

Black boyyyeee, in your virtue
Black boyyeeee, no more suffering 
Black boyyeeee, shine the light for we 
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy

Donna Camay, rockin' witch'all all night 
Used to be a little stressed now I'm gettin' it right 
Fresh kicks with the gold watch dipped in ice 
From Shaolin, it's the vainglorious man 
When the world go around these things start to happen 
Wifey in the kitchen, brother still snitchin' 
Bloods accumulatin', we gettin' impatient 
Knowledge and Wisdom, teach the understandin' 
That's how I'm plannin', blow up like a cannon 
Pull my man in, hit y'all again 
Now I make sense, we do this for the rent 
Build with intelligence break your defense 
No hesitation, time gets spent 
Some fall victim, others get bent 
Some recognize, real niggaz represent 
I can't never stop til my heart is content 
Puttin' in the work til I feel confidant 
Blast out darts in the Wu basement 

Black boyyyeee, in your virtue
Black boyyeeee, no more suffering 
Black boyyeeee, shine the light for we 
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy
