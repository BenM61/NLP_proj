Honey dear, want you near,
Just turn out the lights and then come over here!
Nestle close, up to my side,
My heart's afire, with love's desire
In my arms, rest complete,
Never thought that life could ever be so sweet
'Til I met you,some time ago,
But now you know,
I love you so!

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms about you,
I could never live without you.

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart would ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, you beautiful doll!

Precious prize, close your eyes,
Now we're goin' to visit lover's paradise,
Press your lips,
Again to mine,
For love is king of ev'rything
Squeeze me dear, I don't care!

Hug me just as if you were a grizzly bear
This is how I'll go through life,
No care or strife, when you're my wife
Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms about you,
I could never live without you.

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart would ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh, you beautiful doll! Oh, oh, oh, oh
