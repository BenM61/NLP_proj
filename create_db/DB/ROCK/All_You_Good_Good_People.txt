I feel like I meant something you always say you need more time 
Well I'll stay right here and I'll wait for good until I find a love worth mine 
Someday you've got it coming it hurts me when I read the signs 
So loud and clear that I'll make you glad if I'm leaving first and crying 

All you good good people listen to me 
You're just about done with the way that you feel 
When nothing rings home enough to dig your heels in 
You don't have to leave me to see what I mean 
All you good good people listen to me 

And all I want to do is find my name upon the line 
Before I have to lose this I want time 

All you good good people listen to me 
You're just about done with the way that you feel 
Nothing rings home enough to dig your heels in 
You don't have to leave me to see what I mean 
Lose all your fears 
They are keeping you down 
You won't have to fake it while I'm around 
All you good good people listen to me 

Listen to me
Listen to me
