Buonasera signorina, buonasera
It is time to say goodnight to Napoli
Though it's hard for us to whisper buonasera
With that old moon above the Mediterranean Sea
In the morning, signorina, we'll go walking
Where the mountains and the sand come into sight
And by the little jewelry's shop we'll stop and linger
While I buy a wedding ring for your finger
In the meantime let me tell you that I love you
Buonasera signorina, kiss me goodnight
Buonasera signorina, kiss me goodnight
Bop-a-loo-lop a-lop-bam-boo!
