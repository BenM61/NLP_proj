Glamour girl, glamour girl.
I'm cutting out on you
You just a play type of baby.
And I ain't got no use for you.

Seven days you play the races.
Seven nights you stay out late.
Your always caught in funny places.
Every guy you think is great.

Glamour girl, glamour girl
I find you'll never do.
You just a play type of baby.
And I ain't got no use for you.

Twelve o clock is rising hour.
You think that's a crime.
You better find a better place for charlie
Cause I'm through feeding ya mine.

Glamour girl, glamour girl
I find you'll never do.
You just a play type of baby.
And I ain't got no use for you.

Now the fastest train that's leavin
Is much to slow for me.
Now the fastest train that's leavin
Is much to slow for me.
When all these years I tried to believe you,
That was just a foolin me.
