Willingly  I'll be yours
Willingly  I'll wait for you
All my love And all my life
I would give for you
Only you
Wish you were mine
Wish you belong to me

Here and all the time
Wanting you to care for me
I want you to know
I love you so
Oh could it be
You too need me
We're wasting time

Say you'll be mine my love

Willingly  I'll be yours
Willingly  I'll wait for you
All my love And all my life
I would give for you
Only you
Wish you were mine
Wish you belong to me

Night and day you're there
In dreams beyond compare
Giving your love so divine
You could make this dreams come true
If you walk into
My love my life and say you're mine

For I'll be yours
Yes I'll be yours
Willingly
