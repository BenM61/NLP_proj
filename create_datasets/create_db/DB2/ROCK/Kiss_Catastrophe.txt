Why do you kiss goodbye every night?
Giving me every reason to lie
Can I be in your way for a while?
Can I get in the back seat and hide?

Take it down to the street anytime
Lock me out of the sheets for a while
Give us a kiss with sharp little knives
You are the last thing on my mind
I'll be the first you leave behind, everyone knows why

So give it up, give it back to me
Will you be mine while the winners sleep?
Give it up, give it back to me
Open wide kiss catastrophe

Circling over you and in between
Your shiver and my blue restless teen
More lovely than a reason to leave
'Cause you are the last thing on my mind
And I'll be the first you leave behind, everyone knows why

So give it up, give it back to me
Will you be mine while the winners sleep?
So give it up, give it back to me
Open wide kiss catastrophe

Give it up, give it back to me
Give it up, give it back to me
