Hey handsome have you got the time
I've been watching you since the moment you arrived
A white suit from London, and shoes from Paris
Don't'cha wanna spend about an hour with me

The scent and the aroma refuses to breathe
It's more like a haze that is trying to succeed
It's drawing me in and pulling me to you
And every thought I have turns the language blue

All it costs is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true

Don't know why you play hard to get
I'm here to kiss away any thoughts of your regret
The silk tie from Siam shows elegance and class
Handsome as the heavens that a film would never cast

But underneath the mask I see the skin of a man
Smooth and seductive who's really got a plan
It's drawing me in, magnetically to you

All it costs is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true

I'm like the smoke on your fire
Smoldering endless desire
How long will your flame burn

All it costs is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true
