I'm a woman, hear me out
Never claiming to be something I'm not
Don't want what's yours, just want what's mine
Not tryna take over, I just want my spots

How can life go on without me here?
It's impossible
All the pain endured to give life
And we keep giving and giving and giving and that's the

Strength of a woman
Is the (is the) I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman

Not saying move over, I'm just here to help
That's what God made me for, you ain't gotta build by yourself
You got your pride, don't let it make you blind
Don't need to be walking behind, you're better with me by your side

How can life go on without me here?
It's impossible
All the pain endured to give life
And we keep giving and giving and giving and that's the

Strength of a woman
Is the (is the) I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know (you know)
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
Strength of a woman (what I do)
Is the, I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know (I am woman, you know)
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman

We're the wisdom like a guiding light
We're the trees left standing through the storms of life
We've come so high and we've come so far
Can't hold us back

Strength of a woman
Is the (is the) I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do (I am woman)
Strength of a woman (I am, I am)
Is the (the strength) I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know (I am woman, you know, you know)
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman

I am woman
Strength of a woman
