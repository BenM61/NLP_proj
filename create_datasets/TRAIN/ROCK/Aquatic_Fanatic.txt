Riding a crystal shell into the deepest sky
Heading into the abyss, watching the watcher's eye
Drowning in memories, falling eternally
Lord of Aquarium, my tidal fantasy

In search for mystery, we find insanity
The lady of the sea reaches her hand to me

Drifting through the corals of waters unknown in a cosmic submarine
It's so serene
Living in the colors of the ocean, taste the blue and smell the green
You know what I mean

Dragging me under leagues
Exploring hidden seas
Saying I'm sure to please
For I hold the silver keys

Reach the sunken city, hear the silence, see the lights
You know it's right
It must be right

Touch the ancient treasure, feel the pleasure and delight
That's what I like
That's what I like
Alright

Sonic rays are shining through clear water and a rainbow's growing
To the pot of gold that lies beyond this land, the water's flowing
Chase the aqua-dragons way up high to find the sirens dancing
Rise upon the surface of the ocean, see the shores advancing

Let's go
