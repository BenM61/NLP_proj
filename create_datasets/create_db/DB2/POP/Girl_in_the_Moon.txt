How can I sleep tonight?
Tell me how Mars survived
Fallen with stars, she opened her arms
Venus was in my sky

How could it pass me by?
You silently served my time
Even through chains, rust and the rain
You pulled away the tide

Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon

How could I weep tonight?
Touch and our tears collide
Gravity spins me into your wings
And covers me with your light

Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon

You're the silent silver lining my cloud
You're the secret flame that never burns out
Pull away this veil and rise into view
Girl in the moon
I need you, I need you

Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon
Girl in the moon, oh, girl in the moon
