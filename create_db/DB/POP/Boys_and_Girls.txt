I'm looking in the mirror and I think I'm liking what I see,
Big, big lights shining bright like I'm on the TV,
My heart pumps as the bass drum thumps,
You gotta move when the floorboard jumps,
Somethings going on and I think it's going on right now.

All the boys and the girls they've got it going on,
And when the beat kicks in the feeling in your bones,
When the basement packs and the needle drops,
You can't turn back and you just can't stop.

All the boys and the girls (no, you just can't stop)
All the boys and the girls (no, you just can't stop)
All the boys and the girls

I can see the silhouettes dancing up against the wall,
It sure feels good, feels good, yeah we're gonna lose control,
Turn it on, make it strong, a good beat never hurt no one,
Kicking up the dust and we're making every move me know, yeah

All the boys and the girls they've got it going on,
And when the beat kicks in the feeling in your bones,
When the basement packs and the needle drops,
You can't turn back and you just can't stop.

All the boys and the girls (no, you just can't stop) x4

Whoa ooh, baby don't stop,
Whoa ooh, keep the vibe hot,
Whoa ooh, baby don't stop,
Whoa ooh, keep the vibe hot.

Turn it on, make it strong, a good beat never hurt no one, yeah.

All the boys and the girls they've got it going on,
And when the beat kicks in the feeling in your bones,
When the basement packs and the needle drops,
You can't turn back and you just can't stop.

All the boys and the girls (no you just can't stop)
All the boys and the girls (no you just can't stop)
All the boys and the girls (no you just can't stop)
All the boys and the girls (no you just can't stop)
