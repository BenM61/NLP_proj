I paid the clerk and moved right in
A single room with one big twin
There's a chest and mirror
Shower's down the hall
Room 16 ain't got no view
But the hot plate's brand new

I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her

Once again I've been burned
My suspicion's been confirmed
I saw her having lunch
With some new guy
I walked up and said, "Goodbye"
She said, "Wait, can we talk tonight?"

I guess I showed her
Mmmm, I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her that a man, yeah
Has his limits

Another man is where I draw the line
She can have the house
And everything that's in it
I guess I showed her, yeah
I guess I showed her

She will be surprised
When she comes in tonight
Flips on the light
And finds an empty home
Yeah, every time she's lied
Will flash before her eyes

I guess I showed her, yeah, yeah
I guess I showed her
I guess I showed her, yeah, yeah
I guess I showed her

Now she can have the house
And she can keep the car
I'm just satisfied
Staying in this funky, little old motel
I'm so mad
Well I can't stand it
I can't stand it
Nooooooo!
