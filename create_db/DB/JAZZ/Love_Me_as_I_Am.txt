I snore in my sleep, I'm always late for dinner,
And my table cloth doodling is notorious,
Ah but lovely one, keep this matter glorious
And love me as I am.

I dream while I drive, I linger in the shower,
And there isn't much rhythm in that waltz of mine
Ah but lovely one, skip those little faults of mine,
And love me as I am.

And don't try to make any changes, it wouldn't be worth your tears,
Don't try to make any changes, ss my mother's been trying for years.
I sing when I drink, I never cap the toothpaste,

And my company manners are deplorable, ah but lovely one, tell me I'm adorable
And love me as I am.
