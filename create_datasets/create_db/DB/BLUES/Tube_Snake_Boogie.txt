I got a girl she lives cross town
She's the one that really gets down when she boogie
She do the tube snake boogie
Well now, boogie, little baby 
Boogie-woogie all night long

I got a gal, she lives on the block
She kinda funky with her pink and black socks, she likes to boogie
She do the tube snake boogie
Well now, boogie-woogie baby
Boogie-woogie all night long

I got a girl, she lives on the hill
She won't do it but her sister will when she boogie
She do the tube snake boogie
Well now, boogie, little baby
Boogie-woogie all night long
Blow your top, blow your top, blow your top!
