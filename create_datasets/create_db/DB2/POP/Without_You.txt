No, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving, 
But I guess that's just the way the story goes.
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows. 
Yes, it shows.

No I can't forget tomorrow, when I think of all my sorrow, 
When I had you there but then I let you go.
And now it's only fair that I should let you know, what you should know.

I can't live if living is without you. 
I can't live, I can't give anymore

Can't live if living is without you. 
I Can't live, I can't give anymore.
