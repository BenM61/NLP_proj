I know a girl mess with your mind
She'll come to you in the summer sometime
She'll talk about things you don't understand
But you better keep to the matters at hand
Before the whole damn thing unwinds 

She is beautiful, she is small
She don't want to play basketball
There's no tellin' what she might do
Before her doin' days are through
But right now she can't even crawl 

Georgia Rae, okay, Georgia Rae
Georgia Rae, what'd I say, Georgia Rae?

Your mother and I - we did this act
In some hotel 'bout nine moths back
Now it's love that brings you here
A love that will not disappear
Georgia, honey, you can count on that 

Georgia Rae, okay, Georgia Rae
Georgia Rae, what'd I say, Georgia Rae?

(Bridge:)
We were tired, should've been sleepin'
But, like a fire, somethin' came creepin', creepin', creepin' 

Your brother and sister don't understand
How your tiny feet and your tiny hands
Could carry the weight of a thousand Earths
Into our little universe
But, Georgia, we all think it's grand 

Georgia Rae, okay, Georgia Rae
Georgia Rae, what'd I say, Georgia Rae?
