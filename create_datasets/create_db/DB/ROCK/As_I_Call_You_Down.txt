You love like I love
You love like I do
You wish what I wish
You know what I knew
I wish I knew you

You see what I see
I see what we do
You fall when I fall
As we both follow through
As we both follow you

When I fall inside a hole
That I can't crawl out
Better give up my control
As I call you down

As I call you down

You give like I give
You know how I ache
We all became so poor
There's nothing left to take
I break when you break

You fall like I fall
As far as I fall
You call how I call
We're indivisible
Inside invisible

When I fall inside a hole
That I can't crawl out
Better give up my control
As I call you down

As I call you down
