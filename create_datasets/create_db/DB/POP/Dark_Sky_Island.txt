Listen to the waves speak up
The blue voice of the sea
And they whisper as they touch the shore
Come back to me
Come back to me

Boat by boat upon the waves
All come to find the light
In the darkness of the sky above
Come back to me
Come back to me

Capella, Auriga
Eta Carinae, Sagitta
Aquila, Alpha Centauri

Twilight comes to close the day
And let the night break free
And from deep blue skies the heavens rise
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

Capella, Auriga
Eta Carinae, Sagitta
Aquila, Alpha Centaurii

Moonlight brings the ocean's storms
Like waves upon the sea
And the midnight shore calls out once more
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

Come back to me
Come back to me
