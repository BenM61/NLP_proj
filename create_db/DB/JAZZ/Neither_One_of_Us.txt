I can't see the ????????
I keep wondering
To do without you
ooooooooo
????
Neither one of us
At the time I'd thought I'd found the nerve
To say I'm leaving
no sweet memory
precious memories
get in my way
lord knows that it's only me
and I'm receiving
farewell my love, goodbye
it's a simple word that
I just cannot say 
There can be no way
Happy endings
So I guess you'll go on
?????
oooooooooooo
neither one of us
neither one of us
wants to be the first to say
neither one of us 
wants to be the first to say
farewell my love
goodbye
