I hear the barleys calling my name
So I put on my best shoes and head down New St.
Where the welcome mat hurries me in
A pint glass awaits to drown my sins

Looking in the windowpane, looking in the glass
Seeing my reflection, seeing my past
Sitting at the same bar, playing that same game
Drinking that same beer, killing that same pain
