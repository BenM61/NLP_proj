(Fremch T.V playing)

Watch the news on the screen
Is it real or a dream
The whole world at my command
T.V guide in my hand

Every place every time
Politics, sex and crime
I press the key and watch TV
Watch the war on the screen

It is safe, it is clean
Silent movie black and white
Charlie chaplin is on tonight
Science fiction, history

Electric church, comedy
I press the key and watch TV

(T.V soundbite)
"stay with us we'll be right back"
"aus Frankfurt nun, die Wettervorhersage fuer Morgen"
"the satellite picture shows a lot of clouds around over europe"
"das Wetter, das Wetter, das Wetter"
. . . - . - . . ("eure" or "ski")

Weather forecast, happy ends
Computer graphics, electric bands

I press the key and watch TV
I press the key and watch TV
I press the key and watch TV
