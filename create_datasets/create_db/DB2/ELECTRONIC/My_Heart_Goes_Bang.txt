The other night a good friend told me
Never let my heart fall into careless hands
I said thanks that's very nice
Appreciate your good advice
But things don't always go the way that I plan

Oh oh oh
You you you take my heart and shake it up
You you you take my heart and break it up
Get me to the doctor

My heart goes bang bang bang bang
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 

When I get in close to you
I do the things I never do
There's no depression
Doctor put me to the test
I've heard your lovin? is the best
Here is why I know I need attention

Oh oh oh
You you you take my heart and shake it up
You you you take my heart and break it up
Get me to the doctor

My heart goes bang bang bang bang
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 

Doctor doctor give me the cure
Doctor doctor give me the cure

Doctor I'm consultin? you
I wanta put myself into your careless hands
All I need?s your lovin dose
I feel much better when your close
I really hope things go the way that I've planned

Oh oh oh
You you you take my heart and shake it up
You you you take my heart and break it up
Get me to the doctor

My heart goes bang bang bang bang
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 
My heart goes bang bang bang bang 
My heart goes bang bang bang bang
