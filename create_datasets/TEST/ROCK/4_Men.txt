Stars are falling down
Onto this broken-hearted hungry clown
Because he can't get his fill.

Never thought that he would ever
Want this much from a man,
But love is the steepest sharpest slide. 

Oh here he'd lie at your side 
Looking up into the sky
Wondering if this is allowed

But fear rules him easily 
It takes lust and strength 
To turn to you and say

"I want you and I need you"
But I haven't got the fattest chance in hell.

Sun has finally upped and gone 
Being bored of everyone.
I slip of my shirt and shoes.

Time to hate myself again
My small voice and freckled skin
Till the safety of the dark.

Oh here I'd lie between your thighs
Looking up into your eyes
Wondering if this is allowed

But fear rules me easily
It takes lust and strength 
To turn to you and say

"I want you and I need you"
But I haven't got the fattest chance in hell.

So why does the world laugh
And take us on these rides
My dear.

I'll shut my epileptic eyes and 
Daydream of busy nights
My dear.

Because I want you and I'll have you,
I'll crush my arms around
Until I melt inside of you.

Oh god I want you and I need you,
I'll be your son your slave and keeper.

There were four men in this room
Why did you have to go and pick on me?
