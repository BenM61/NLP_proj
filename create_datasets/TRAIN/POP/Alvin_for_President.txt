Hey Simon, Theodore, what's he doing?

He's running for President.

Yeah, President.

Really? Well isn't that president?

Did you call me?

Alvin, you can't be President.

Why?

Well, because you're too young, and-

In addition, when I'm president...

Alvin be quiet and sing our new song. Now here are the words.
"It's nice,"

It's nice,

"It's good,"

It's good.

"When you live like you should,"

When you live like you should,

"In peaceful harmony"

In peaceful harmony,

"Take our,"

Take our,

"Advice,"

Advice,

"The way we live is nice,"

The way we live is nice,

"In peaceful harmony"

I hope you vote for me!

Now quit that, quit it.
"We're so,"

We're so,

"Polite,"

Polite,

"We hardly ever fight,"

"We live in harmony,"

We live in harmony,

That's better.
"Don't care if we live in a tent,"

Don't care if we live in a tent,

"Just as long as we pay the rent,"

I'm your president!

"It's nice,"

It's nice,

"It's good,"

"When you live like you should,"

When you live like you should,

"In peaceful harmony,"

In Washington, D.C!

Stop changing the words!

And with me in the White House-

Alvin!

And, another thing, dear friends. Why shouldn't we have a penny ice cream
Cone?

Uh, I don't know!

Theodore, you can be my campaign manager.

Oh boy, your honor!

And Simon, I believe I'll make you vice-president!

Why not!

Mr. President, will you and your cabinet kindly sing?

We don't care if we live in a tent,
Just as long as Alvin's President!

That's me!

He's nice,
He's good,
Send Alvin,
Yes you should,
To Washington D.C!

And in conclusion, dear friends,

Alvin, will you

I am certain you will elect me the next President of the United States of
America!

We want Alvin!
We want Alvin!
We want Alvin!
We want Alvin!
