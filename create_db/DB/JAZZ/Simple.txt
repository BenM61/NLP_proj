We've got it simple
Cause we've got a band
And we've got cymbals in the band
We've got it simple
Cause we've got a band
And we've got cymbals in the band

What is a band without cymbals?
Ooh ooh cymbals are grand

We've got a saxophone
Cause we've got a band
And we've got a saxophone in the band
We've got a saxophone
Cause we've got a band
And we've got saxophone in the band

What is a band without saxophone
Ooh ooh saxophone is grand

Cymbals and saxophones
Saxophones and cymbals (2x)

We've got Be-bop
Cause we've got a band
And we play Be-bop in the band

We've got skyscrapers
And it seems a pretty tune
Every band needs skyscrapers too

What is a band without skyscrapers
Ooh ooh skyscrapers is grand
