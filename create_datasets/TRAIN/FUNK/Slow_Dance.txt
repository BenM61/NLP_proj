Come here baby, sometimes I just wanna dance with you.
Hold me like this!
Just rock with me.

Put your arms around me boy,
I got something to show you, tonight.
And you know I need your undivided attention baby.
Whoa
Ain't no other girl can rock your world like I
So

Rewind,
Make this moment last forever babe.
Feels like your body is calling me.

But I don't
I don't want to come on to strong,
But something happens when we slow dance.
Something happens when we slow dance.
(when we slow dance)
I try to be lady like
But I got you here tonight
But something happens when we slow dance
(when we slow dance)

Talking with my fingertips,
Yeah, yeah
I got so much to say babe
Words just get in the way baby (the way baby)
Lets see can you read my hips, read between the lines (read yeah)
As we bump and grind just makes it better from behind
So one more time

Rewind,
Make this moment last forever babe.
Your body is calling me

I don't want to come on to strong,
But something happens when we slow dance.
Something happens when we slow dance.
I try to be lady like
But I got you here tonight
But something happens when we slow dance

Got you in my element.
Time to represent who you with.
The whole world is staring at the both of us
And I'm giving you all my love x2

This one for the dance floor, strictly for the dance floor x4

I don't want to come on to strong,
But something happens when we slow dance.
Something happens when we slow dance.
I try to be lady like
But I got you here tonight
But something happens when we slow dance
