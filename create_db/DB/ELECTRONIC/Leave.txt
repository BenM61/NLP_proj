Come pick me up from that bar in Adelaide
You know the place
Two minutes til I self destruct
Light a match and watch the flames, you know the place

I can love you and still be hateful
Only f*ck you and be unfaithful
I'm always blaming you when I know it's me
Shaming you for just being there for me
Being there for me

Don't, don't trust in
Any promises I make, or the shit I'm gonna say
You won't get justice
I can always find a way to make both of us pay
I know
You know, I know
You won't ever leave
I know
You know, I know
You're gonna take more shit from me

You wait up all night in your room until I send a two-word text
And by the time you've woken up to everything I put you through
I will have left
And you'll have to accept that you're complicit 'cause you allow it
If there's a limit, I haven't found it
I'm always blaming you when I know it's me
Shaming you for just being there for me
Being there for me

Don't, don't trust in
Any promises I make, or the shit I'm gonna say
You won't get justice
I can always find a way to make both of us pay
I know
You know, I know
You won't ever leave
I know
You know, I know
You're gonna take more shit from me 
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

Don't, don't trust in
Any promises I make, or the shit I'm gonna say
You won't get justice
I can always find a way to make both of us pay
I know
You know, I know
You won't ever leave
I know, you know, I know
You're gonna take more shit from me
