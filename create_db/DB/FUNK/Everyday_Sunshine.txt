I wish everyday the sun would shine
Take me to another place in my mind
Where everything is beautiful
And no wants or needs
Nor sign of greed
Could rule our soul

How I wish everyday sunshine
How I wish everyday sunshine

If we could fly away on wings
To a place where all could be true
And the skies were blue
And love was true
And me and you

How I wish everyday sunshine
How I wish everyday sunshine
