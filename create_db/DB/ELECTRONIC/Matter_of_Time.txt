So quickly time will come and time will go
It runs on by
It steals your hopes and dreams and one last chance
You never know

I can see it now
I can feel its scolding hand
Saying come on now you've got to run

You wonder can you stop the hands of time
Erase your fate
He's laughing, knowing that he's got control
Just watch and wait

I can see it now
I can hear the whispered voice
Telling me now you've got no time to waste

It's a matter of time
It's just a matter of time

And you've got to see
You have the answer, you have the strength
There's no denying it's in your hands
It's in your hands

It's a matter of time

Living breathing touching feeling
Hoping dreaming still deceiving
Searching finding losing crying
Know the truth you're dying
Oh you're dying

It's a matter of time

Remember who you are and what you have
The time is yours
Your flame is burning down so guard it well
It may go out

I can see it now
I can see the end of time
Holding the answers to all your fears

It's a matter of time
