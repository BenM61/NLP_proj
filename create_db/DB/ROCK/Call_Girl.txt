I'm waiting by the loading dock for you
A TV and guitar in hock for you
Come on, girl
Come on and give me a ring
Come on, girl
Pick up and ring
Come on and pick up and

(Why don't you call, girl?)

I gave up blow and Adderall for you
So I'd have dough and spend it all on you
So call, girl
Come on and give me a ring
Call, girl
Pick up and ring
Come on and pick up and

(Why don't you call, girl?)

I realize it's me who makes advances
All advances
And I realize arrangements come from me
It's me, it's me, it's me who always wants to meet
So come on, girl
Come on and pick up and ring
Come on, girl
Pick up and ring
Come on and pick up and

When I call on you, everything is good again
And everything and everything
I don't need to say anything, it's understood
Again, anything and everything
I don't ask, I don't need an answer
I hear your lies in different answer
Rise and rise, I lead
I lead and then again it's

(Why don't you call, girl?)

So call, girl
Come on and give me a ring
Call, girl
Pick up and ring
Come on and pick up and

(Why don't you call, girl?)
