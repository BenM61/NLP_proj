You're the same old girl
That lived across the street
And you're the same old girl, yeah
That I was dying to meet

Well, now you're running around
And you think that I don't know
And you know if I found out
It's gonna hurt me so

And it hurts me so bad
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah

Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please
Tell me this is a dream

And I remember
When you kissed me
You said you loved me so much, girl
Said our love would always be

Now you're running around
You think that I don't know
And you know if I find out
It's gonna hurt me so

And it hurts me so bad
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah

Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please
Tell me this is a dream

You know, I'm just like a guy right now
That don't want to face the reality
Of the one I love, believe in me

You know, loving you too much
Not wanting you to realize
That you're in love with someone else

Whoa, oh, oh, yeah

Tell me this is a dream
Somebody
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody
Tell me this is a dream

Tell me this is a dream
Somebody
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please
Tell me this is a dream

Tell me this is a dream
Somebody
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody
