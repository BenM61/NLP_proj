I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all, I feel it all
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight

Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold a gun
I know more than I knew before
I know more than I knew before
I didn't rest, I didn't stop
Did we fight, did we talk?

Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold a gun
I love you more
I love you more
I don't know what I knew before
But now I know I want to win the war

No one likes to take a test
Sometimes we don't pull or flex
Put your weight against the door
Kick-drum on the basement floor
Stranded in the thought of woods
Looking like the winter bird
On my head the water pours
Cops stream through the open door
Fly away
Fly away the one who want to make

I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all, I feel it all
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight

Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll end it, don't you start it
The truth lies
The truth lies

And lies divide
Lies divide
