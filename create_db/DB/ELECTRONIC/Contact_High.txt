Touch

If one of these two walls could speak
I'd turn the lights down long enough to hit repeat
(Babe)

Right now my vision is gone
Your magic's to blame
It's silent down here
Hey I wanna get loud again
You'll hold the thunder while I bring the rain

I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with a love that's in the air

Contact high
I'm done dreaming that we can fly
Am I guilty boy, you decide
I've got nothing to hide

Four letter words won't hold any sway
Here in a paradise that shakes the world romantic to the bone

Mystical forces are circling me
While perfect nostalgia is dating the enemy
Lost in the ether with no-one to blame
It's silent down here maybe I wanna get loud again

Contact high
I'm done dreaming that we can fly
Am I guilty boy, you decide
I've got nothing to hide

When we touch I get a
Contact high
I'm done leaving if we can try
Am I guilty boy, you decide
I've got nothing to hide

I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with a love that's in the air

Contact high
I'm done dreaming that we can fly
Am I guilty, boy, you decide
I've got nothing to hide

When we touch I get a
Contact high
Contact high
Contact high
