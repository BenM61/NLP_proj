He smoked a cigarette when he played his song
He was so cool he couldn't do no wrong
Playing his guitar he was a local star
He ran away from love but he ran too far

He's king cool
You know
He's all right
You know
He's king cool
You know
He's no fool
You know
He's king cool
You know
He's all right
You know
He's king cool
You know

He had a chick named merilee
She was the cutest chick he'd ever seen
He couldn't help himself and he fell in love
Between her and his guitar it was push and shove
She wanted him all to herself
She couldn't share him with nobody else

He's king cool
You know
He's all right
You know
He's king cool
You know
He's no fool
You know
He's king cool
You know
He's all right
You know
He's king cool
You know

She doesn't know how she lost her man
Now he's a superstar and she don't understand
How he plays his guitar with a broken heart
Now when his guitar sings it just tears her apart
He's king cool
You know
He's all right
You know
He's king cool
You know
He's no fool
You know
He's king cool
You know
He's all right
You know
He's king cool
You know
