Baby you don't pay me no mind
You act like you don't love me no more
Maybe you need space or some time
Your attitude is unpredictable
And I don't want to make you unhappy
If you're not happy then your free to go on
'cause I don't want you staying around
If I make you so miserable

If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(go ahead to someone else

If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(go ahead to someone else

Time and time again I've tried I tried
(baby don't you know I tried)
But the love I had inside has died
(but the love I had inside)

Won't you be a man if it's over
And just admit that things ain't the same
Instead of making me think it's all good
Between us which ones to blame
I took a lot of too much things to handle
Until I can't take this game no more
This love thing is full of scandal
So you welcome to walk

If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(go ahead to someone else

If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(go ahead to someone else

Time and time again I've tried I tried
(baby don't you know I tried)
But the love I had inside has died
(but the love I had inside)

I had to take it there I had to take it there 'cause I'm tired
Oh yeah

If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself
(go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me
(don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else
(go ahead to someone else

You play games if you don't talk to me
Hay go ahead and free yourself
Baby if you don't want me then don't talk to me
I'll be alright go ahead to someone else
Yeah, yeah
