Old man's ass
Fifty heads wide
Old man's ass
Could stretch a battle ship, 
Side to side to side to side to side to side to side to side

Are we all wrapped up, wrapped up together
Are we all wrapped up, fit for the kill
Are we all wrapped up, stacked up together
Stretch my neck to look up to him 
Are we all wrapped up, wrapped up together
Are we all wrapped up, fit for the kill
Are we all wrapped up, stacked up together
Fit for the kill

There's a flower thief in my back yard again, 
I'll grin my teeth to make him stay,
Trap him in my flower bed and then 
I'll feed him with my paraffin. 
Feed him with my paraffin. 
Stretch my neck to look up to him.

Are we all wrapped up, wrapped up together
Are we all wrapped up, fit for the kill
Are we all wrapped up, stacked up together
Stretch my neck to look up to him 
Are we all wrapped up, wrapped up together
Are we all wrapped up, fit for the kill
Are we all wrapped up, stacked up together
Stretch my neck to look up to him.

Old man got me in the eye again 
Stretch my neck to look up to him.
Stuck his bony finger in. 
Stretch my neck to look up to him.
Turned me round and did it all again.
Stretch my neck to look up to him.
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin

Are we all wrapped up, wrapped up together
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Are we all wrapped up, wrapped up together
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
Now I smell like paraffin
