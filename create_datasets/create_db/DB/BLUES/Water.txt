I'm a dying man won't you give me water
My baby took my love and left me on a desert
I feel the taste of salt and I gotta have air to breathe
That girl she stole my heart and left me in misery

Somebody, somebody will give me water
Why don't you give me water, well

I'm just a simple man and I'm not used to losing love
Somebody help me off this desert, won't you give me water
Now I've heard a many tales about a lonely grounded man
And about him all along you know I'm, I'm living a life that's not the same

Somebody, somebody will give me water
Why don't you just give me water, and I want you, tell them Albert

Just a thought of her you know it drives me all up inside
And I'm numb with pain because I only have tears to taste
The man is all messed up, won't you give me water, water
And I don't know how I can make it, I just can't make a gopher

Somebody, somebody will give me water
Why don't you just give me water and I want you
Water, water, I need some water, hey, water
Need some water, give me water Albert, hey, hey
