I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
Cut the superstition
Let it all hang out
Make a clear decision
And we will work it out
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Crosstalk
And we will work it out
Train the jam session
Turn the beatbox loud
Play the chord progression
Come on twist and shout
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Crosstalk
And we will work it out
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
And we will work it out
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Crosstalk
And we will work it out
Crosstalk
Let it all hang out
Let's have a crosstalk baby
And we will work it out
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
Come-on
Come-on
Come-on
Come-on right now, work it out
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
