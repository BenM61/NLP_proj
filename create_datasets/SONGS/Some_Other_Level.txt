No place like here
On some other level
Imaginary time
Another place of mine

Playing hide and seek
In the palm of your hand
Reality you never
Quiet ?? for understand

What lies ahead
How to define
The movement unchange
On suspended time

Moving forward
To cover different ground
Postcards from another planet
Waiting to be found
Waiting to be found

Sound experience
Everything I see
Impossible to resist
A journey of discovery

No place like here
On some other level 
Imaginary time
Another place of mine

Moving forward
To cover different ground
Postcards from another planet
Waiting to be found
