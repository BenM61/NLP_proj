Ah ha, hmm, gonna get along without you now
Ah ha, hmm, I'm gonna get along without you now

You told me I was the neatest thing
You even ask me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town
You didn't even care if it got me down

Ah ha, hmm, gonna get along without you now
Ah ha, hmm, I'm gonna get along without you now
I got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Thought I'd find somebody who is twice as cute 
'Cause I didn't like you anyhow

You told everybody that we were friends 
But this is where our friendship ends
'Cause all of a sudden you change your tune 
And haven't been around since way last June

Ah ha, ooh, ooh, gonna get along without you now
I got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
So long my honey, goodbye my dear

Gonna get along without you now, ooh, hoo
Get along without you no,wooh, hoo
Get along without you now
Get along without you now

Ah ha, ah ha, gonna get along without you now
I got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
So long (Get along without you now) my honey 
(Get along without you now)
Goodbye (Get along without you now) my dear 
(Get along without you now)
Gonna get along without you now

So long (Get along without you now) my honey 
(Get along without you now)
Goodbye (Get along without you now) my dear 
(Get along without you now)
Gonna get along without you now

So long (Get along without you now) my honey 
(Get along without you now)
Goodbye (Get along without you now) my dear 
(Get along without you now)
Goodbye
