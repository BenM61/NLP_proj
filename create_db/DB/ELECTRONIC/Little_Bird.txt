I look up to the little bird
That glides across the sky
He sings the clearest melody
It makes me want to cry
It makes me want to sit right down
And cry, cry, cry, yeah

I walk along the city streets
So dark with rage and fear
And I, I wish that I could be that bird
And fly away from here
I wish I had the wings to fly away from here, yeah

But mamma, I feel so low
Mamma, where do I go? 
Mamma, what do I know? 
Mamma, we reap what we sow
They always said that you knew best
But this little bird's fallen out of that nest now
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed
So I've just got to put these wings to test

For I am just a troubled soul
Who's weighted
Weighted to the ground
Give me the strength to carry on
Till I can lay my burden down
Give me the strength to lay this burden down, down, down, yeah
Give me the strength to lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down 

But mamma, I feel so low
Mamma, where do I go? 
Mamma, what do I know? 
Mamma, we reap what we sow
They always said that you knew best
But this little bird's fallen out of that nest now
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed
So I've just got to put these wings to test

I feel so low
Mamma, where do I go? 
Mamma, what do I know? 
Mamma, we reap what we sow
Put you one more time
