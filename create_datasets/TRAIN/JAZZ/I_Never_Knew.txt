I always thought that I'd prefer single-blessed-ness
Thought that I'd like to stay free
I never thought my time would come to marry
No wedding bells for me, I've changed my mind after all
You are the one made me fall, for

I used to smile at all the songs that were popular
Nothing but love in each song
I used to think those kind of songs were foolish
Now I admit I'm wrong: love songs are part of my plan
Show me the minister man, for

I never knew I could love anybody, honey, like I'm loving you
I couldn't realize what a pair of eyes and a baby smile could do
I can't sleep, I can't eat
I never knew a single soul could be so sweet
I never knew I could love anybody, honey, like I'm loving you
