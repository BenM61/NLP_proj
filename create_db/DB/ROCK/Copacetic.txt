I'll wait another day so find me
If you are kind
Time to find out time to fly
In every part of the world
I'm trying to hold it on
Feel the best in my doubt
One day you'll find me
Feeling my best
In other parts of the world
Do you like the sadness
But you're nowhere to be found
Feel you walk behind me
Wish I could have made it work
We laugh we smile and fight
