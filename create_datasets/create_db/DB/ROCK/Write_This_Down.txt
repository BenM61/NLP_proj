You said you wanted someone just like me 
You let me read it in your diary 
I'd like to write this out if you still read 
It was an awkward patch 
I had an itch to scratch 

We spent the summer kissing in a basement room 
Learning all the rules 
You made them up as you went along 
And then your passion cooled 
You really had me fooled 

I'm not gonna be around 
You better write this down 
I'm gonna leave without a sound 
You better write this down 

I didn't really need to hear the facts 
But you know me, I couldn't help but ask 
But now you're telling me to relax 
I chose the warmest day to rain on your parade 

I learned to love the sickly sweet 
In order to meet all of my body's needs 
You swore to keep me in your nest 
How could you tell a lie about the birth of a child? 

I'm not gonna be around 
You better write this down 
I'm gonna leave without a sound 
You better write this down (Defy you) 
We assemble it all and then we tear it away (Defy you) 
We assemble it all and then we tear it away 

(You wrote in your diary) 
(I wish you would show me)

Here's an entry for your diary 
Dictation, are you ready? 

I'm not gonna be around 
You better write this down 
I'm gonna leave without a sound 
You better write this down (Defy you) 
We assemble it all and then we tear it away (Defy you) 
We assemble it all and then we tear it away (Defy you) 

I won't always be around 
You better write this down (Defy you) 
I will leave you on the ground 
You better write this down (Defy you) 
We assemble it all and then we tear it away (Defy you) 
I'm gonna leave without a sound 
You better write this down
