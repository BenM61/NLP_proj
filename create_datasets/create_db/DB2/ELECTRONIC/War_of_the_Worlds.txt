If this is the war of the worlds,
Then I don't want to be a part.
If this is the war of the worlds,
Then I don't want to be a part.

Too busy, too busy, too busy
To talk, you said I wouldn't know.
Too busy, too busy, too busy
To understand its time to go.
And so the next time that you need me don't expect a call.

And this is the weight of the worlds,
I think it's time for us to part.
And this is the weight of the worlds,
I think it's time for us to part.

Too busy, too busy, too busy
To talk, you said I wouldn't know.
Too busy, too busy, too busy
To understand it's time to go.
And so the next time that you need me don't expect a call.

And we're willing to waste away, like this.
When everything's gone okay til you've gone a miss.
And all I could be, everything you want me to be.
But we haven't spoke in days,
Yet infact it's been a matter of weeks.
And so the next time that you need me don't expect a call
