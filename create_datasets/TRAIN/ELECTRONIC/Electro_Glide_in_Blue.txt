I'm more dope than heroin, sharper than a needle
I'm more dope than heroin, sharper than a needle

Maybe I'm a loverboy, hooked on an aphrodisiac
Maybe I'm a strange one, maybe I'm a twisted maniac

Hey, you never can tell
Maybe you can touch the taste by the sense of smell
Who's to say that heaven is in hell
Escaping reality's touch
Just in time ? just in time before the bite gets too much

Who's to say that heaven is in hell? Can this be hell?
Maybe I'm a loverboy, hooked on an aphrodisiac

Can this be hell, oh well, oh well, oh well
Escaping reality?s touch, yeah
Now just in time before the bite gets too much

Hey, hey, hey, you never can tell
