Have you ever wondered what happens when you become light?
It happened to me
I travelled between two worlds
Between here and there
Between there

Have you ever wondered what happens when you become light?
It happened to me
I travelled between two worlds
Between here and there
Between there
It was a dream
Except it wasn't like a normal dream
I was awake
Would you like to see what I saw, feel what I felt?
I'll take you there
Try not to think
Just breathe
Try not to think
Now close your eyes

Now close your eyes

Would you like to see what I saw, feel what I felt?
I'll take you there

I travelled between two worlds
Between here and there
Between there
