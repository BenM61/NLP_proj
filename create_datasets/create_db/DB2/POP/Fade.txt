Fade into the distance
Paler and paler and
Fade into the wallpaper
Slowly when i don't look
The more that i will you
The less it hurts inside
Time on my own is like cool fresh air
After summer sunlight

You fade away
Beautifully dissolved
And my profile is clear
Ready to be resolved 

You were my back door key
When there was a queue to get in
Maybe i was a tease to laugh at you
Eating out of that tin
But it's hard not to be who i am
When i feel so at home
There's nothing more sexy
Than watching someone who doesn't know
They are being watched and

You fade away
Beautifully dissolved
And my profile is clear
Ready to be resolved 

Fade into the distance
Paler and paler and
Fade into the wallpaper.
