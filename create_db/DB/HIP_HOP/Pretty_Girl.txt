Si tu supieras lo que siento,
Cada ves que me pongo a pensar en todo los momentos.
All the good times we had me and you you and I,
Hot summer nights making love in July.
The only girl that didn't give it on the first night.
Una mujer incomparable imma love for life.
Me captivaste with your ways and all the things you do.
My pretty girl, I gotta make it work with you.
Tell the world, tell you girls and your family,
Con este anillo te prometo, your my every thing.
Cause nobody's ever made me feel the way you do.
I jus dropped you off already miss you.
Chica bonita, sonrisa sinsera.
I wanna be with you hasta que me muera.
Lets make a pact and always be together,
With you by my side girl I'm down for whatever.

You stood out from the group from across the room.
I had to keep my attention on you.
Something about that pretty face that pretty smile.
You couldn't help but to get lost in those pretty eyes.
Yeah this girl she had it all,
The type of woman you take to mother
Saying look what I found, love and companionship.
Someone to talk through these rough times who ain't afraid to handle it.
And understand that my life is different and accepts it.
This isn't what I expected.
Yeah she's beautiful inside and out.
Something hard to find in the world these days.
Even on my worst day,
She's got me happy like a kid waking up on his birthday.
Yeah this love was different it was based on friendship.
I'm letting you know I'm ready to ride out with you.

I know you don't know me I've seen you around.
Your the hottest looking honey that I seen in this town.
Come on lets conversate, take a walk get together.
Just wanna know you a little bit better.
Beauty incomparable eyes drove me crazy.
She that type I wanna have for my lady.
Something about you don't know what it is.
I know we just met but can I give you a kiss.
Grabbed her hand and she hugged me, acting kinda shy.
Dimples on your face got you looking pretty fly.
Baby this is real talk I wanna be with you.
Little did I know, you were digging me too.
Now I'm down on my knees got you saying I do.
So I had to write a song dedicated to you.
