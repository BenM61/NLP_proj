He's sleeping in his shoes
And dreaming of the worst
Living dirty lies
Believing in reverse
He'd break into the church
To burglarize the father
Gettin' older by the second
If seconds even bother

Oh but the girl

She comes around 
he was lost where she found him
The girl

Though she might get to him
He might never get to 
The girl

He hide behind the look
That's written in the eye
He's lower than the rain
Cause it's falling from the sky
Like a man without a mother
A choice without a chance
He's digging up the dead
Expecting them to dance

Oh but the girl

She comes around 
he was lost where she found him
The girl

Though she might get to him
He might never get to 
The girl

He's not out of his head but he's much better off than before
He's not out of his head but he's much better off than before
He's not ready for bed but he's sleeping it off on the floor
