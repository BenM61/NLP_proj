My sugar is so refined
SHe's one o' them high-class kind
she doesn't wear a hat, he wears a chapeau
she goes to see a cinema, but never a show 

My sugar is so refined
she's got a real high-class mind
she never buys a dress, it's always a frock
she always winds his timepiece up, but never his clock 

she says "tomahto" instead of "tomayto"
she  says "potahto" instead of "potayto"
Well, you should see how she holds a cup of tea
Just two fingers while she sticks out three 

My sugar is so refined
she's one o' them high-class kind
she never shares a kiss, he lets our lips unite
But, oh, it feels like kissin' and each kiss is dynamite
I wonder what he thinks of each time I hold her tight
Oh, she's so refined

My sugar is so refined
She's one o' them high-class kind
she never shares a kiss, she lets our lips unite
But, oh, it feels like kissin' and each kiss is dynamite
I wonder what she thinks of each time I hold her tight
Oh, she's so refined
Oh, she's so refined

She says "banahna" instead of "bananna"
She says "piahno" instead of "pianna"
And you should see how she sits on her settee
With cake and coffee balanced on one knee
