Half awake and half in dreams
On a Sunday
Sunday night.
Walking all alone in the streets
On a Sunday
Sunday night.
But then an angel passed me by

A little angel made me sigh.
Just when I wanted you

A dream came true - called love.

I want to hear your heartbeat

Want to feel what you need.
Let me stay tonight by your side

By your side.
I want to hear your heartbeat

Share your dreams when you're asleep

Let me hold you tight
In the night
In the night.

I don't want to waste one second
Without your loving

Without you
Sunday girl.
You only gotta reach out

Reach out and taste my loving.
Want you so
Sunday girl

Oh
I really want you

Sunday Girl.

Heaven sent you down to me
On a Sunday
Sunday night.
To rescue me from mystery
On a Sunday
Sunday night.
You made me leave the past behind

I've got you always on my mind

Just when I wanted you

A dream came true - called love.

I want to hear your heartbeat 

I want to hear your heartbeat
