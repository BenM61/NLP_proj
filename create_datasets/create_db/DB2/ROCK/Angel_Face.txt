Your picture on my wall, your letter on my bed
And, darling, I recall everything you said
Angel face, angel face, angel face
Darling, I love you

Oh, if you were here once more in my embrace
I'd kiss away each tear from your angel face
Angel face, angel face, angel face
Darling, I love you

It's been so long since I held you so tight
It's been so long since I kissed you goodnight

I don't need a moon to thrill to all your charms
Won't you come back soon and fill my empty arms?
Angel face, angel face, angel face
Darling, I love you
Darling, I love you
Darling, I love you
