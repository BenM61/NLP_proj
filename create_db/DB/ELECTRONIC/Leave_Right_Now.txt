Same streets, same party
Drowning their problems in Bacardi
Same people still talking
Oh, I'm so over it, I'm sorry

Baby, you and me could leave right now
Ditch all your friends, the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone on some old moonlit road
But the two of us could disappear
Just say the word and get out of here
Baby, you and me could leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
You and me could
We could leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could

If not, I get it
That smile on your face, yeah, it says different
One kiss, could just try it
'Cause you never know, you just might like it

Baby, you and me could leave right now
Ditch all your friends, the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone on some old moonlit road
But the two of us could disappear
Just say the word and get out of here
Baby, you and me could leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
You and me could
We could leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could

Same streets, same party
Same people still talking

Baby, you and me could leave right now
Ditch all your friends, the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone on some old moonlit road
