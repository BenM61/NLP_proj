In Nolan time sign 
What does the mind cover?
Are we talking?
White is the winter 

Care-line, care-lines thumbed it up 
What are your stories all about?
Carries a weight on her swing
On her swing

Black waves come
And so fear me, December

Sinking in Nolan time
I lost all my pure feelings
The psychiatrist posing as psychologist
When fear predicts then doubly the mind suffers
Are we talking?
White is the winter 

Care-line, care-lines thumbed it up 
What are your stories all about?
Carries a weight on her swing
On her swing

Black waves come
And so fear me, December
Sinking 
Waltz with me courageously
We're dancing, dancing 

We will not die!
Our days are multiplied
And I'm happy again 

Care-line, care-lines thumbed it up 
What are your stories all about?
Carries a weight on her swing
On her swing
