I guess you better familiarizes yourself
with me 'Cause the weather's all fine
You know there's never no "waiting for the right
kind of breeze" when pleasure all's mine

Always remember to communicate across
memories 'cause yesteray's gone
And now it's almost time to go don't say
no more because the tide's come

Familiarize
Familiarize yourself
Familiarize
Familiarize yourself with me

I guess you know this "familiar" face was
put upon me the night I was born
It was ma destiny that (they said) a star
was above me in a wild storm

I'd like to know how many songs must
an angel sing before an eye's red?
Now it's time to set off don't you know
I wait for you on a saw-see bed?

So...
Familiarize
Familiarize yourself
Familiarize
Familiarize yourself with me

Communicate across memories cuz
yesterday's gone
When it's time to go don't say no more 
Because the tide's come
I say the tide's come
The tide's come yeah
