Take a trip on something else 
I feel exodus, when I feel golden 
There's something deep inside her, when she has spoken 
We have to concentrate to get the feeling right 
If all I had was this, I'd feel so satisfied 
Take a trip on something else 
And it's like everyone finds a home in the afterlife 
I'm not sad anymore
I'm not sad anymore 
Is it me?
Or is it you?
Is it time for something new?
It's not bad anymore
It's not bad anymore
I don't think about anything but you 
When you go away I can't be myself because I'm stuck on you 
Try to oppress this dreaming of you 
What's it gonna take to get on board a basis with you?
Take a trip on something else
