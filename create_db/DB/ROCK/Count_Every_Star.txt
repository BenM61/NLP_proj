Count every star in the midnight sky 
Count every rose, every firefly
For that's how many times I miss you
Heaven knows I miss you 

Count every leaf on a willow tree
Count every wave on a stormy sea
Count every star and darling when you do 
You'll know the times I have cried for you

Count every leaf on a willow tree
Count every wave on a stormy sea
Count every star and darling when you do
You'll know the times I have cried for you
