Oh, what else can I do, oh, what else can I do
Oh, face in a screw oh, racing to prove
You never remember the blossom sender
Still in a rub a dub style

Long time you don't know what I'm doing whoa
Long time see troubles are brewing yeah
Slick to the way you rock it and know that
You'll cope with that 
Not gonna let it sit 'til I say, "how dope was that"
Keep your head pumping 'til you get in the zone
Not giving up not going home 

Stick to the way you rock it just do it real slow 
Nobody can really say 'cause nobody really know 
Only thing that matters if it's funky to you 
You got a choice of what you can do so

Oh, what else can I do, oh, what else can I do
Oh, face in a screw oh, racing to prove
You never remember the blossom sender
Still in a rub a dub style

Stick to the way you rock it just do it real slow 
Nobody can really say 'cause nobody really know 
Only thing that matters if it's funky to you 
You got a choice of what you can do
