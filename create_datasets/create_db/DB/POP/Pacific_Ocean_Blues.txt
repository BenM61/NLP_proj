We live on the edge of a body of water
Warmed by the blood of the cold hearted
Slaughter of otter
Wonder how she feels mother seal
It's no wonder the Pacific Ocean is blue

The flagship of death is an old whaling trawler
The people are rising over whale killing crawlers
You gotta holler more
Wait a minute can't you see
You gotta let 'em be
Yeah it's no wonder the Pacific Ocean is blue

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Water yeah water yeah water yeah

We love you Pacific Ocean blue
Yeah we love you Pacific Ocean Blue
Oh we love you Pacific Ocean Blue
Oh I we love you Pacific Ocean Blue
It's no wonder the Pacific Ocean is blue

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
