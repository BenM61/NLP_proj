Whispers in the dark
Two shadows in the night
So gentle and so tender that every little word
Is like a song of sweet delight

Whispers in the dark
How heavenly they seem
When lips and arms surrender and ev'ry little kiss
Is like a dream within a dream

But soon the breezes whisper to the trees
That dawn is near,
So soon their little paradise of love will disappear
Whispers in the dark

While stars are in the blue
Upon a night like this perhaps I'll hear
A little whisper in the dark from you
