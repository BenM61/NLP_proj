Papoose?
Let me show u all how its posed to be done

Don't get me started
It's getting kinda crowded in here
Back up off me, I'm feeling like I'm suffocated
Now here's my problem
I'm not gonna be your chick on the side
Forget about it
You know damn well it wouldn't be right

[Chorus:]
I dunno what you been thinkin' 'bout me
Did u think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no,u must be going crazy!
(noo-o-oo)Why don't you get outta my life
Get outta my sight
Get off oh my back...
Why don't you go back to your world...
Go back to your girl..
I think you owe her...
I know whats going on
I wont be second to none(noo)
Back up, cuz you crowdin' my space...
You need to get outta my face

Lets be honest
I'm not the type of chick that you use...
And if you want it
If you want it
You'll have to choose
I've been through this
I've been cheated on...
I know how it feels
Would I know that you wouldn't do the same to me

[Chorus:]

Papoose...BK.B..uh..K...they say you can't have your cake and eat it too...
Tell me whats the meaning...
Whats the sense of me having cake if I can't eat it
Cheaters never win, my friend, you like creepin'
But hate when you're girl starts cheatin'
Imagine if you came home to your wife
Opened your door and locked it
Then you found R. Kelly hiding in your closet
I knew you would start cheatin, before you even stopped it
I'm like when you double your money, I'm a profit...
Albert Einstein was smart, but I'm some wiser...
I'm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer
You gotta fight for love, can you make a fist
Since your name is Genie, can I make a wish? (yeaahh)
No minor set backs, every move major
Grown folk behavior, just do me one favor...
He put you on the side, let me be your savior...
Crowded...

[Chorus:]

Get outta my life
Get outta my sight
Get off oh my back...

'Cuz you're crowdin' my space
You need to get outta my face
