Summer's almost here and the evening's getting warm 
Screw my head on a different way 
Hug my pillow and try not to count the days 

Winter's gone away and the morning's aren't so cold 
Rub the sleep out of my face 
Hug my pillow and try not to count the days 
Get your face out of my brain 

I don't believe in being brave (ba ba ba bah) 

Evening's over now and the daylight's on it's way 
Empty bottles on the floor 
Give it a backbeat and try not to lose your head 
No, you won't have to pretend anymore 

I don't believe in being brave (ba ba ba bah) 

I only need my piece of space 
I need to breathe 

I don't believe in being brave (ba ba ba bah) 

Now it's time to say goodnight, so sleep tight
