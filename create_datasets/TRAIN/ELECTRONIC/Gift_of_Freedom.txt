Freedom for what it's worth
A god-given right
So I am taking, taking it
And no one need qualify
The price you pay
Is very low, very low

And will the whole damned world fall down
Before we've learned to share what we've found

Freedom from apathy
A god-given choice
So I am taking it, taking it
And no one dare justify
Shock policies
Run a river dry, river dry

And will the whole damned world fall down
Before we've learned to share what we've found

Freedom for everyone
A god-given right
So I'm takin' it, takin' it
And no one need walk alone
So shake your world
Into believing it, believing it
