It'll all click when the mortgage clears
All our fears will disappear
Now you go to bed, I'm staying here
I've got another level that I want to clear

My skin feels like orange peel
My eyes have been vacuum-sealed
My organs move like a squirm of eels
We should be more adventurous with our meals

They annoy me those who employ me
They could destroy me, they should enjoy me
We eat Chinese off our knees
And look for each other in the TV screen

The sun goes up and the sun goes down
I drag myself into the town
All I do I wanna to do with you

Everyday I'm at my desk
At my desk I'm like the rest
All I do I wanna do with you

On the city's skin they move on mass
Like a rash on the back of a manky cat
Now in I go like a fool
I can't resist dipping in the pool

I watch them watch me, I watch them too
Across the street, across the room
I dress myself like a charcoal sketch
My eyes are brown and my hair's a mess

They annoy me those who employ me
They could destroy me, they should enjoy me
We eat Chinese off our knees
And look for each other in the TV screen

The sun goes up and the sun goes down
I drag myself into the town
All I do I wanna to do with you

Everyday I'm at my desk
At my desk I'm like the rest
All I do I wanna to do with you

The sun goes up and the sun goes down
I drag myself into the town
All I do I wanna to do with you

The cells I am at the moment will soon die
But I will be here, oh, I'll still be here
The cells I am at the moment will soon die
But I will be here, oh, I'll still be here

Oh, the sun goes up and the sun goes down
I drag myself into the town
All I do I wanna to do with you

Everyday I'm at my desk
At my desk I'm like the rest
All I do I wanna to do with you

Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday

Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday

Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday
