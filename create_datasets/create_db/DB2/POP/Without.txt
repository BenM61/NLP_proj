I've been walking in this road 
Time passing me by 
Letting go of what I couldn't hold 
Finding places to hide 

I've been watching you closely 
Every move that you make 
And all the things you've showed to me 
Are getting harder to take 

I wish that we could begin from the start 
I pray that I could be brave enough 
To show you how easily I fall apart 
I can't let you know 
That I can't let it show 
'Cause I'd rather be without than be without you 

I guess I feel like a stranger 
When it comes down to love 
I'm too aware of the danger 
That it can bring upon us 

I wish that we could begin from the start 
I pray that I could be brave enough 
To show you how easily I fall apart 
I can't let you know 
That I can't let it show 
'Cause I'd rather be without than be without you 

I wish that we could begin from the start 
I pray that I could be brave enough 
To show you how easily I fall apart 
I can't let you know 

I wish that we could begin from the start 
I pray that I could be brave enough 
To find out if you'd ever give me your heart 
'Cause you don't let me know 
You don't let it show 
And I want you to know 
That I'd rather be without than without you
