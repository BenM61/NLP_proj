Feelings fly around
Around up in the air
Bouncing off the walls
Getting under my hair
On the carpet in the weave
Up in trees on the leaves
Feelings flying everywhere

I'm on the right track
For what I want to say
I got to get it out
There ain't no other way
To make contact
There ain't no getting away
From how I feel today

Feelings flying around
Around up in the air
Out in the hall
And sitting in my chair
I've seen them on the train
Coming down with the rain
Feelings flying everywhere

I'm on the right track
For what I want to say
I got to get it out
There ain't no other way
To make contact
There ain't no getting away
From how I feel today

Feelings flying around
Around up in the air
Some are really small
They come from over there
Hard to ignore
I see them all the more
Feelings flying everywhere

I'm on the right track
For what I want to say
I got to get it out
There ain't no other way
To make contact
There ain't no getting away
From how I feel today

I'm on the right track
For what I want to say
I got to get it out
There ain't no other way
To make contact
There ain't no getting away
From how I feel today

I'm on the right track
For what I want to say
I got to get it out
There ain't no other way
To make contact
There ain't no getting away
From how I feel today
