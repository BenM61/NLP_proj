Love, make me clean
Love, touch me, cure me

The pure always act from love
The damned always act from love

Every day I think about untwisting and untangling these strings I'm in
And to lead a pure life
I look ahead at a clear sky
Ain't gonna get there
But it's a nice dream, it's a nice dream

Death, make me brave
Death, leave me swinging

The pure always act from love
The damned always act from love
The truth is an act of love

Some day, I swear, we're gonna go to a place where we can do everything we want to
And we can pet the crocodiles

Love
The pure always act from love
The damned always act from love
That's love
The pure always act from love
That's love
The pure and the damned
The pure and the damned
Love
The damned
