Woah!
Woah!
Sowing, sowing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more

My garden's wide of daisys
And it's untouched complete
Check here, my rhythm baby
My sky's been lookin' angry
My garden's wide of daisys
And it's untouched of sin
My root's been craving lately
To soak in your diamonds
Digging, you want it
And I want you laying on me
My flower beds calling your name (n-ame, n-ame)

I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing

Woah!
Woah!
Sowing, sowing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more

Woah!
Woah!
Sowing, sowing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more

My garden's wide of daisys

Check here, my rhythm baby
My sky's been lookin' angry
My garden's wide of daisys
