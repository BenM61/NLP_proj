Yes, I had a woman, woman
She's the nice kind in every way

D-d-doodle, d-d-doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle
Doodle, d-d-doodle

I loved that woman so hard
I couldn't stand to see her go

Yes, my baby, baby, baby
She did everything she said

Yes, my baby, baby, baby
She did everything she said

Yes, I love you, love you, daddy
I'll love you till my dyin' day

D-d-doodle, d-d-doodle

Take my baby downtown now
And bought her fine clothes
Did everything in the world I could

But my baby got somethin'
My baby got somethin'
My baby got somethin'
That I sure do love

D-d-doodle, d-d-doodle

She got me walkin' in my sleep
And talkin' in my dream
Doin' things baby, that I sure don't like

But my baby got somethin'
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
My baby got somethin'
My baby got somethin'
Man, that I sure do love

My baby got somethin'
My baby got somethin'
Man, that I sure do love

D-d-doodle, d-d-doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle
Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle
Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle

Well, look here people
What she'd undone
Got my love and got me on the burn

My baby got somethin'
My baby got somethin'
My baby got somethin'
Man, that I sure do love, aha, aha, ohh
