Tell me the secrets of your soul
Give it up and let go

Give it up
Give it all
Give it up
Give it all
Give it up
Give it all
Give it up
Give it all

I give you it all
I couldn't give you more if I tried
I give you my love
I give you everything I feel inside
I give you my life
It isn't a lie
I tell only the truth
I give you my love
I think I'd even die for you

Surrender your love
Surrender your love to me
Surrender your love
Surrender your love to me

Tell me the secrets of your soul

I give you everything I feel inside
I give you my life
It isn't a lie
I tell only the truth
I give you my love
I think I'd even die for you

Surrender your love
Surrender your love to me
Surrender your love
Surrender your love to me
