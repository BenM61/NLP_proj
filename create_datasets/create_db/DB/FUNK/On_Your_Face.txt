Ain't it funny that the way you feel
shows on your face
and no matter,how you try to hide it'll state your case
Now a frown will bring your Sprits down to the ground
And never let you see, the Good things all around
Everytime we seem to let
Our feelings show, our luck
run out and the wind won't blow

But, that can't make me
That can't make me sad
Cause, I've been there Before
Don't wanna go no more

Sadness bears no remedy, 
for the problems in your life
Won't disappear
This world can't shake me
Bad times can't make me sad
Ole world can't take me
Won't let it drive me mad
While you run your race
keep a smilin' face
Help you set your pace
Life is on your case

Wish upon a sunnyday, it'll turn to rain
Use the sunshine in your heart, to ease the pain
We wonder, how your attitude is going down
Is it wakin' and shakin' and safe and sound
Everytime we seem, let our feelings flow
Our luck runs out.
And the wind won't blow.

You can't shake me, the way I feel today.
Come tomorrow I'll feel the same way
Wake me! My heart us feeling glad
I'll take you with me When you're feelin' bad
