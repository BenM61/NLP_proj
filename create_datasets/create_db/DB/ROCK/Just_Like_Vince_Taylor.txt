She had the whole world in her dress
She put my fingers to the test
She made me grease, my hair
She got me wearing leather
Oh we danced till the music faded
We loved, and the taxi waited

You turn me round and round and round
Got me doing like I never did before
You take me upside down, bring me outside in
Got me going like I never came before
Just like Vince Taylor

You said I was your private monkey
And you smiled when I tried to be funky
And I never knew the score
Just like Vince Taylor

Still got the chains hung down my vest
Since you said I could have been the best
You turn me round and round and round
Got me doing like I never did before
You take me upside down, bring me outside in
Got me going like I never came before
Just like Vince Taylor
