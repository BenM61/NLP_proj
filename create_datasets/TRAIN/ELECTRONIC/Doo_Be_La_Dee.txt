I am the one for you
You always seem a fine lover
This live is new for me

The only way that I feel right
This life is luxury,

Come join me, this world is for real
It just depends on the way you feel
Big chances worth a try
Keep on moving faster, 'till you fly

Every day and night
We try to hold a secret thight
We are exclusively
I think that I'm the one
That surely knows where it comes from
Our lies are justified

I never made you question why
Why I'm always inspired
This live is beautiful
Stars fell on my roof tonight again

Doo be la dee (We're singing...)
Doo be la dee, come do that sexy thing to me
Doo be la dee (We're singing)
Doo be la dee, come do that crazy thing to me
Doo be la dee (We're singing)
