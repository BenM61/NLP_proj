Lies, ties, Mr. Cool disguise
Hang it up, get up on your own
Pill driven skills, weeping whippoorwills
Too much going 'round that you can't hide

Look out for the blind owl
You can only find that you were wrong
No one else around me ever loved me like you do
So I'll be strong

Look out for the blind owl
You can only find that you were wrong
No one else around me ever loved me like you do
So I'll be strong

Days, plays, interviewer's maze
Play the role, sell your soul
Becoming to yourself
A hero who must never lie

Who must never lie
Who must never lie
Who must never lie
Who must never lie
Who must never lie
