I love you girl
You called me up and I came to see you
You say you been awake all night
It hurts me deep inside when I see you cryin'
Whatever's wrong, I'll make it right

If you understand how I feel
You should know that my love is real

Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
So tell me what you want me to do
Tell me girl

There were times when I didn't show it
Just how much I care for you
I'm so sorry
Now don't keep sayin' it's too late...to think
It over baby
After all that we've been through

Girl, I'm beggin' you
I'm down on my knees
Don't walk away baby please don't leave (me)

Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
So tell me what you want me to do
Tell me girl

Girl I know that we can work it out somehow
Isn't that what love is all about
I'm gonna see it through this time
I won't let you slip away
Say you'll stay with me
Stay with me girl
'Cause you're the finest girl that I've ever seen

Tell me, tell me what you want me to do baby
My love is only here for you and only you
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
So tell me what you want me to do
So tell me what you want me to do
