Come make some time today
Jump aboard here on this train
'Cause it leaves- just in time for everyone
Who believes one day we will see the son
Let's take this ride today
Plenty room plenty space
You'll find you'll be in good company
All the time- you'll be free to fly 
From your sorrow
Straight into the light
And your tomorrow
Ever shining bright 
All you high and below
Trying to survive 
Come on down
I know you feel it
But I want to hear it from you now
Say what and I want to hear you sing it loud
Say what I gotta hear you sing it out
It's time for the good life
It's time for the good life 
It's time for the good life
It's time for the good life
Your drama gone
You're light and free I know I want to
Be there when you make your discovery
Yea here comes your victory
Over sorrow
Straight into the light
To your tomorrow
Ever shining bright
Don't you ever let go
'Cause ya finally got it right
Let's sing it down
I know you feel it
But I want to hear it from you now
Say what and I want to hear you sing it loud
Say what I gotta hear you sing it out
Bout time for the good life...
Make time for the good life...
