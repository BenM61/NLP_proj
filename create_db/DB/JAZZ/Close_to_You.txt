Close to you, I will always stay.
Close to you, though you're far away.

You'll always be near as though you were here by my side.
No matter where - in my dreams I'll find you there
Close to me, sharing you're caress.
Can't you see you're my happiness?

Wherever you go, my heart will go, too.
What can I do?
It only wants to be close to you.

Wherever you go, my heart will go, too.
What can I do?
It only wants to be close to you
