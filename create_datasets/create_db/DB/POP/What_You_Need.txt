Hey, here is the story
Forget about the troubles in life
Don't you know, it's not easy
When you gotta walk upon that line

That's why
You need
That's why
This is what you need, I'll give you what you need

Don't you get sad and lonely
You need a change from what you do all day
Ain't no sense in all your crying
Pick it up and throw it into shape

That's why you need, oh that's why
This is what you need, I'll give you what you need
This is what you need, I'll give you what you need
This is what you need, I'll give you what you need
I'll give you what you need

Hey you, won't you listen?
This is not the end of it all
Don't you see is a rhythm
I'll take you where you really need to be
I'll take you, I'll take you where you want to be
That's right, I'll take you
