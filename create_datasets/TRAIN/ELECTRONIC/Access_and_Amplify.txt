Embrace
The wings that they gave you
I know you felt the emptiness
Behind your empty words
Your silent screams confuse me
Behind the mask of pride there is nothing left
But empty words of loneliness
It's hard to select which wounds to heal and which to infect

And now you feel the pain is real
You've got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong

It's been
A while since you pulled the plug on me
I tried to keep it together
Clenched tight as a fist
The harder I hold 
More fragile it gets
Everything you touched went up in flames
I doubt that I'll ever forgive you
The values that I once had
Don't seem to exist

And now you feel the pain is real
You've got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong

And now you feel the pain is real
You've got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong

And now you feel the pain is real
You've got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong

And now you feel the pain is real
You've got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong

And now you feel the pain is real
You've got no one else to blame
Don't let your rain fall down on me
Wish I was there to prove you wrong
