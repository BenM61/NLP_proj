Doctor, doctor you gotta help me yeah
You gotta make it right for me
It seems this other man's name has been following me around
And it just won't let me be
You see I got this name and he's got this name too
And you know they're kinda close only a blind crazy fool
Would think I was him it's like saying green is blue
But let me tell you brother it started being a bother
When he made the cover of Time magazine

I was at this party in the well-heeled hills
Just the other night
Her name was Shelly I introduced myself
She just smiled and said "all right"
Well we got talkin' and drinkin' wine
And she said she liked my music thought it was fine
She said, "Let's make love, your place or mine,"
And in the middle of the passion I was on the borderline
When she called out a name but it wasn't mine

She called me Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her
My name is Rick I'm gonna stick it to ya babe

And there's this kid walking carrying a guitar
You know I told him that I played
He asked me my name you know I told him
I said it plain as clear as day
Well he seemed really, clearly, sincerely impressed
And as he pulled a piece of paper for me to sign from his vest
He said, "I thought Born To Run was one of your best."
Aww wait a minute man, who do you think I am?
He answered, "Mr. Springsteen, your a famous man."

He called me Bruce, Bruce
I can hear him calling Bruce, Bruce
He called me Bruce, Bruce
I can hear him
My name is Richard gonna hit it to you babe

You know my mama called me long distance yesterday
And as she got off the phone I swear I heard her say
Bye bye Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce 
She called me Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her 
My name is Ricky gonna stick it to you babe
She called me Bruce
