So close so far I'm lost in time
Ready to follow a sign
If there was only a sign
The last goodbye burns in my mind
Why did I leave you behind?
Guess it was too high to climb

Give me a reason
Why would you want me
To live and die
Living a lie
You were the answer
All that I needed
To justify, justify my life

Someone as beautiful as you
Could do much better it's true
That didn't matter to you
I tried so hard to be the one
Its something I couldn't do
Guess I was under the gun

Give me a reason
Why would you want me
To live and die
Living a lie
You were the answer
All that I needed
To justify, justify my life

It's only right
That I should go
And find myself
Before I go and ruin
Someone else
