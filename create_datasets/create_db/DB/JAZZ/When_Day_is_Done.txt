When day is done
And shadows fall
I dream of you!

When day is done
I think of all
The joys we knew!

That yearning, returning,
To hold you in my arms,
Won't go love, I know love,
Without you, night has lost it's charms!

When day is done
And grass is wet
With twilight's dew,
My lonely heart is sinking
With the sun!

Although I miss your tender kiss
The whole day through,
I miss you most of all
When day is done!

Although I miss your tender kiss
The whole day through,
I miss you most of all
When day is done!
