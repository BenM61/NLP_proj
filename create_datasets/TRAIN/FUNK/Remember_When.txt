Remember when (dah-doot-doo-doo) 
I first met you (dah-doot-doo-doo)
My lips were so afraid to say "I love you"
Remember when (dah-doot-doo-doo)
To my surprise (dah-doot-doo-doo)
The heaven in my heart leaped into your eyes

Remember how much I cried
Tears of joy to think you were mine
Darling, down deep inside
I still feel that feeling divine

I loved you then (dah-doot-doo-doo) 
And I still do (dah-doot-doo-doo)
I can't remember when I didn't love you

Remember how much I cried
Tears of joy to think you were mine
Darling, down deep inside
I still feel that feeling divine

I loved you then (dah-doot-doo-doo) 
And I still do (dah-doot-doo-doo) 
I can't remember when I didn't love you
