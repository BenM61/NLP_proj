And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say f*ck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see you
I don't know, I think I'm rolling
And yeah, it's way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say f*ck it, keep on going
I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I think I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see him
I don't know, I just keep going

And I got way too many feelings, way too much emotion
All this Xans inside my body, I say f*ck it keep on drowning
Yeah, you can bring a juice I'll match you
Yeah, you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are, but I'd dive into your ocean
And yeah, you say you smoking grams, I'm smoking into the Grammys
Say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
Still you came through so low-key, think you understand, I don't know me
Still I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say f*ck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I think I'm rolling
If I see him, yeah, I see him
I don't know I just keep going

Yeah, way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say f*ck it, keep on going
I got all I need, you don't know what I mean
Yeah we pour up 'til we go up (go-go-up)
And I got way too many feels, not enough to forfeit
Many fuckin' bands, so you know we finna blow it
We be faded when I'm sober, sober when I'm faded
Overscrutinized by all your counterparts there's no debating

You say it's 'cause they jaded, yeah, they jealous that I made it
Do you remember that first time I missed you in the basement?
Back when we really didn't know it, we were searching for some
Now they pay full advance, and there ain't no fucking discussion
At the stage they jumping because it's like that
You see all these checks and now your girl ain't even write back
You drink all my Rose, and you know what to do
Someone dropped up a dose, so we finna get screwed

You know I got like way too many feels, way too much emotion 
Don't know how to make you feel
But I'm sorry, bitch, I'm flowin'
You know I just drop top in that coup, zoom
Don't know where you been at, true
Now I'm searchin' for who, you
Yeah, I'm comin' right back
And I got way too many feels, way too many feels
