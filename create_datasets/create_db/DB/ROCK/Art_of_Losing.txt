Last call now I'm outta time 
And I don't got no valentine 
Singled out, now I stand alone 
The underdog in a modern world 
Suburbia is hot tonight 
But nothing seems to feel alright 
I don't want your sympathy 
I just need a little therapy 
At least that's what they say to me 

Hey ho let's go 
I'm gonna start a riot 
You don't want to fight it 
One two f*ck you 
Don't tell me what to do 
I don't want to be like you 
Can't you see it's killing me 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Knock me down I'll keep on moving 
It's the art of losing 

Fit the mold and do what you're told 
Get a job and start growing old 
9 to 5 can make your dreams come true 
But I don't want to be like you 
I'm not cool and I'll never be 
I break the rules and I guarantee 
I don't want your sympathy 
I just need a little therapy 
At least that's what they say to me 

Hey ho let's go 
I'm gonna start a riot 
You don't want to fight it 
One two f*ck you 
Don't tell me what to do 
I don't want to be like you 
Can't you see it's killing me 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Knock me down I'll keep on moving 
It's the art of losing 

You call me a loser 
Say I'm just a user 
But I'll just keep on moving 
Cause that's the art of losing 

Hey ho let's go 
I'm gonna start a riot 
You don't want to fight it 
One two f*ck you 
Don't tell me what to do 
I don't want to be like you 
Can't you see it's killing me 
I'm my own worst enemy 
Knock me down I'll keep on moving 
It's the art of losing 

Wahhhooo (It's the art of losing) 
Wahhhooo (It's the art of losing)

We're the kids 
We're the kids in America
