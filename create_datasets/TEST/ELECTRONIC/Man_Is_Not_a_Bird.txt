The sky is faint, their tears remain
In me the rain has stopped falling
The fading light, walls barely white
In me the night has stopped calling

I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside

Here in this room, no more a tomb
Thoughts of you conclude without ending
Caution will keep, worries still speak
Fewer the leaves are descending

I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside

Here in this room, no more a tomb
Thoughts of you conclude without ending

The lonely distance and time
The only tears falling outside
I will not lament with the sky
No longer feel night on the inside

The lonely distance and time
The only tears falling outside
