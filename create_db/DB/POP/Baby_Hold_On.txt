When your life is wrong
And your days are gone
And the Night is coming on
Baby hold on
Baby hold on
Baby hold on 

When your race is run
And the prize is won
Make the words to your song
Baby hold on
Baby hold on
Baby hold on

When it feels like no one listens
And it seems like no one hears you call
When your star no longer glistens
I'll be there to catch you
You won't fall
You won't fall

When your day is done
Like a setting sun
And the night keeps coming on
Baby hold on
Baby hold on
Baby hold on
Baby hold on
Baby hold on
