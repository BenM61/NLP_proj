Waking up, with just one thing in mind
Eyes sewed shut, so tear them open wide

I'm on the hunt I'm on the prowl
I can almost taste you now
I'm on your scent I'll track you down
I'm on you now!

Drain your blood
Watch it pour
Drain your blood
Play no more

Please forgive me (please forgive me)
I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me
Start begging for your mercy

Please forgive me (please forgive me)
I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me
Start begging for your mercy

Can you feel your pain
The smell of fear's around you.
Do you want to scream
Let it out cause no one can hear you

I'm on the hunt I'm on the prowl
I can almost taste you now
I'm on your scent I'll track you down
I'm on you now

Drain your blood
Watch it pour
Drain your blood
Play no more

Please forgive me (please forgive me)
I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me
Start begging for your mercy

Please forgive me (please forgive me)
I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me
Start begging for your mercy

Drain your blood
Watch it pour
Drain your blood
Play no more

Please forgive me (please forgive me)
I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me
Start begging for your mercy

Please forgive me (please forgive me)
I don't know what I'm doing
Someone help me
Start begging for your mercy
