I can't be happy, mama
For bein' so blue
When ya keep on worryin'
The way you do

When things go wrong
So wrong, wit' you
It hurts me, too

That man you love, darlin'
He don't want you 'round
Why didn't ya make love with Tampa, darling
And let's jump the town?

When things go wrong
So wrong, wit' you
It hurts me, too

That man don't love ya, darling
Told Tampa, so
He said it was only jivin' you, darlin'
He said he was lovin' a gal next do'

When things go wrong
So wrong, wit' you
It hurts me, too
Oh, but it do

That man'll keep on doggin' you
'Til he goin' make Tampa, mad
An then Tampa goin' get somethin' from him, darlin'
Yo' man didn't know he had

When things go wrong
So wrong, wit' you
Yeah, it hurts me, too

Play it, boy

When things go wrong
So wrong, wit' you
It hurts me, too
