Out on the corner
Money in my hand
I placed my order
To my good friend
Now I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting for him, just to get by, to get by
I'm waiting on a friend
On South Atlantic Ave
I'm waiting on a friend
Just to get by

Body is hurting
Mouth running dry
And he's on his own clock
Never on time
So I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting for him, just to get high, to get by
Waiting on a friend
South Atlantic Ave
I'm waiting on a friend
Just to get by
Waiting on a friend
South Atlantic Ave
I'm waiting on a friend
Just to get by

And I've got a sweet tooth
Oh I've got a sweet tooth

Hear he comes now
I'll make amends
Same time tomorrow
We're gonna do it again
I'll be waiting, waiting
Waiting for him just to get by, to get by
Waiting on a friend
South Atlantic Ave
Waiting on a friend
Just to get by
Waiting on a friend
South Atlantic Ave
I'm waiting on a friend
Just to get by
Waiting on a friend
South Atlantic Ave
I'm waiting on a friend
Just to get by, just to get by
