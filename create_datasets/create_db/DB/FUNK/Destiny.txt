I've never been superstitious
(Superstitious)
Love don't always play fair
(Play fair)
Opportunity so delicious
Like none that I've known anywhere
(Anywhere)

So I take the chance to hold your hand
(Hold your hand)
And I hope that you would understand, yeah
(Understand)
But it all happened so suddenly
(So suddenly)
And now you are in love with me
(Love with me)

It's gotta be destiny, she's taken me
It happened so suddenly, destiny

It's gotta be destiny, she's taken me
It happened so suddenly, destiny

Oh, no, it's no taboo
(Taboo)
This moment is so beautiful, hey
(Beautiful)
But it's more like DeJa Vu
Could it be that I have dreamed of you?
(Dreamed of you)

It's natural the way we bond
(We bond)
Makin' love from 9, beyond
Why don't this seem strange to me, yeah
It's 'cause you're my destiny

It's gotta be destiny, she's taken me
It happened so suddenly, destiny

I never thought this would be
This feeling that came over me
Gotta be my destiny

It's gotta be destiny, she's taken me
It happened so suddenly, destiny

It's gotta be destiny, she's taken me
It happened so suddenly, destiny

It's gotta be destiny, she's taken me
It happened so suddenly, destiny
