A thousand conversations on a never ending theme
Seem to linger in my mind like the fragments of a dream
That was once a part of you and remains a part of me
Its the unreal world we lived in that was born of fantasy

You whiled away the hours, making promises that might
Have just changed the world we knew, if theyd only turned out right
But now Im a little wise
I can even raise a laugh
At the funny face you pulled on a faded photograph

New days replace yesterdays in time
Its well to bear in mind
That new ways erase
Nothing stays the same
And now youve even changed your name

Forever Ill remember as I pass by on the train
Streets of paradise we loved
Now so few of them remain

Guess its finally goodbye
Seems we came so suddenly
To the end of childhood dreams
And the way things used to be

La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la
