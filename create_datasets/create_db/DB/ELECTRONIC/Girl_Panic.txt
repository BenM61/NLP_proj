I came by invitation
To general Chelsea mayhem
Then going on to somewhere
Yes I was going somewhere
A single random meeting
With your eyes and I am beaten
And now I'm going nowhere
I know I'm going nowhere

With all the voices in my head
The clever words I never said
Of all the things to happen

In a girl panic
That's driving naked through my mind
It's a crush panic
She's got me atomized

You beg me to get closer
Dress falling off your shoulder
Then heat is wrapping round us
This city strapped around us
'Cause now I sense your mission
Is my coming demolition
And you just hold me under
I know I'm going under

With all the voices in my head
The clever words I never said
And you just let it happen

In a girl panic
That's driving naked through my mind
It's a crush panic
She's got me atomized
In a girl panic
The midnight traffic in her eyes
Like a hypnotic
And I am mesmerized

You know you know I want you
I know you know I want you

With all the voices in my head
The clever words I never said
And you just let it happen

In a girl panic
That's driving naked through my mind
It's a crush panic
She's got me atomized
In a girl panic
The midnight traffic in her eyes
Like a hypnotic
And I am mesmerized

In a girl panic
A crush panic
She's a hypnotic
It's a girl panic
