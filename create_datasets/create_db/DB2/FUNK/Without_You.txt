Haunted by those that suck you in
That pull you under
Mm tied
And your words are engraved in me
So long as guilt resides here
Carved into the walls in writing
With our broken hearts imprinted
Beside it

I didn't want you to leave me
I didn't want to leave you (you)
I didn't want you to leave me
I didn't want to leave you (you)

No one, what you do to me, no one
No one, what you do to me, no one
No one, what you do to me, no one
No one, what you do to me, no one

I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you

I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
