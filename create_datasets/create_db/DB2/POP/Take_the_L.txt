Watching my head, holding my face
One more evening gone to waste
No longer do I know my place

Killing time and missing my cues
Watching her belong to you
Tears could only change my view

Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over

Growing up has always been tough
Good intentions never good enough
I would take you far away
Do anything to make you stay

Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over

Every drink and cigarette
All those hands we never met
There are things we should forget
Now it's over, over

Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over

Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over

Take the L out of lover and it's over
Take the L out of lover and it's over
