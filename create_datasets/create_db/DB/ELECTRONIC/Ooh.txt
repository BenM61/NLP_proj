(I'm about all)

Ooh catch me if you can
My pappy never could,
See he would smack me with his hands
Damn, now I'm a grown ass man,
Better let it go
Before I go fast man,
Like a po' fat man ooh
Yeah that's what she said
I guess I'll get my head some screws
And get together school,
Whatever that'll do
I don't really know
But I forsho be good at bull,
Shit to get my through

Ooh my, goodness I should do this with a bow-tie
Turn it till its perfect with a bold side,
Sure it won't be worth it but it's so mine

Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small

I'm about it all,
I'm about it all,
I'm about the big I'm about the small

Ooh like it ain't no thang,
'Cause like it really ain't like it's in your brain
I'm amazed that every day is made so plain,
So I'm goin da break the chain,
And stage a fan campaign
Ooh and I feel real good,
Holler if you feel me 'cause I feel real wood
Oh I really kill me though it's really understood,
I'ma really still be really young because I should

Ooh oh my, goodness
I should do this with a bow-tie
Turn it till it's perfect with the bold side
Sure it won't be worth it, but it's so mine

Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small

I'm about it all
I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small

Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
Ooh I'm about it all, I'm about the big I'm about the small
