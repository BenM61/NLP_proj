Am I blue? Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in these eyes, telling you?

Am I blue? You'd be too
If each plan with your man, done fell through

Was a time, I was his, his only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, lordy

Was I gay, 'till today?
Now he's gone and we're through
Yes I'm blue

Am I blue? Oh, you'd be too
If each plan with your man, done fell through

There was a time I was, I was his only one
Oh but now I'm, I'm the sad and lonely one, oh lordy

Was I gay? I was happy until today
But now he's gone and we're through
Yes I'm blue

Now he's gone and we're through
Am I blue?
