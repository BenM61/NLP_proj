You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

You made me happy sometimes
And you made me glad
But there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some love, it's true
Yes I do, deed I do
You know I do

Give me, give me, what I cry for
You've got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
You know you made me love you
