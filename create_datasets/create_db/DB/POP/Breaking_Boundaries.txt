I was hopeful 
Hopeful for us babe 
Trying not to lose my head
Now I'm taking something to forget the pain 

I've been trying
Trying not to go insane 
People gonna think I'm dead 
Haven't been out of bed for so many days 

What am I, what am I to you?
After all that we've been through 
I'm so lost, what am I supposed to do? 

You've got me tangled up in feelings 
I'm breaking through the boundaries of my faith 
Am I a game you're trying to play? 

I am drowning in your sorrow 
Trying not to let go 
Voices in my head that I'm trying to fade away

It hurts to think 
You may never come back to me 
It is so obscene 
To think you'll be with someone else someday

What a tragedy I've come to be 
Trapped in a hole I dug
Filled with outraged souls that ran out of luck 

How useless do you think I am?
I'm just trying to understand 
How broken of a man you

You've got me tangled up in feelings 
I'm breaking through the boundaries of my faith 
Am I a game you're trying to play? 

I am drowning in your sorrow 
Trying not to let go 
Voices in my head that I'm trying to fade away

You've got me tangled up in feelings 
I'm breaking through the boundaries of my faith 
Am I a game you're trying to play? 

I am drowning in your sorrow 
Trying not to let go 
Voices in my head that I'm trying to fade away
Voices in my head that I'm trying to fade away
