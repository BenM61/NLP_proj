Sisters and brothers
This is reverend Satchmo gettin' ready to beat out this mellow sermon for you
My text this evenin's "When The Saints Go Marching In" 
Here come brother Higginbotham down the aisle with his trombone, blow it, boy!

O when the Saints (when the saints)
Go marching in (marching in)
Now, when the Saints go marching in (marching in)
Yes, I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in

Blow it, brother Holmes!

Now when the Saints (when the saints)
Go marching in (marching in)
Oh, when the Saints go marching in (marching in)
Yes, I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
