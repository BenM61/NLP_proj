Your needs are covered by me
Know that I see you weep
Our blood runs deep
Your mind could change the game
I won't let you go insane
With severed veins

And if you only knew
We won't undo
It's always you
And now you know it's true
We said there's never undo
It's always you

You've been a dark story
But don't let it sink right in
Let's just sing
If you got desire to see
A clear idea
We could be the sun down here
We could bring the fun around here

And if you only knew
We won't undo
It's always you
And now you know it's true
He said there's never undo
It's always you

If you're tortured in pain
I could be the one
I could stop the rain from falling
No need to be afraid
Let me be the one
You and I are the same

And if you only knew
We won't undo
It's always you
And now you know it's true
We said there's never undo
It's always you
