Slow dance, slow dance

Hey mr. DJ
Why don't you slow this party down (slow it down)
The ladies in here are fly
And there's one who's caught my eye (one who's caught my eye)
I wanna pull her slow to me (pull her slow to me)
And whisper sweet things in her ear, oh yeah
'Cause tonight I'm full of fire baby, oh yeah (full of fire)
And you're the only one my heart desires, baby

You're the only one I wanna slow dance baby
Girl you're the only one
Hey mr. DJ

You're the only one I wanna slow dance baby
Ooh, let the records spin
Now baby take my hand

Let the music play (let the music play)
'Cause I wanna get it on
Put your arms around me baby, oh yeah (arms around me)
And let's start a slow grind, grind
I'm gonna rock 'n rollin' rock it
All night long baby, baby
What you've given me is a feeling so strong, so strong
Feel my nature rise girl (feel my nature rise)
I'm gonna make you feel good tonight
You are the only one

You're the only one I wanna slow dance baby
