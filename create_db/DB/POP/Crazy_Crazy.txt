I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Feet are liftin' off the ground
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Head is spinnin' in the clouds
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Feet are liftin' off the ground
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Head is spinnin' in the clouds

You're the sun and I'm the moon
Stickin' as one like glue
You're in pink and I'm in blue
When you're 'round, go crazy with you
Tattoo your name all over the room
You make me feel brand new
Tears I cry for you
When you're 'round, go crazy with you

Up, down, I'm runnin' 'round
I'm goin' crazy with you
Feet liftin' off the ground
I'm goin' crazy with you
Head spinnin' in the clouds
I'm goin' crazy with you
We're crazy, goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, me and you
Up, down, and 'round and 'round
I'm goin' crazy with you
Feet liftin' off the ground
I'm goin' crazy with you
Head spinnin' in the clouds
I'm goin' crazy with you
We're crazy, goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, me and you

I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Feet are liftin' off the ground
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Head is spinnin' in the clouds
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Feet are liftin' off the ground
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Head is spinnin' in the clouds

You're the one, it's true
You make my heart go boom
Move in close and zoom
When you're 'round, go crazy with you
Drivin' me wild, it's true
Dynamite, blows off the roof
Tears I cry, for you
When you're 'round, go crazy with you

Up, down, I'm runnin' 'round
I'm goin' crazy with you
Feet liftin' off the ground
I'm goin' crazy with you
Head spinnin' in the clouds
I'm goin' crazy with you
We're crazy, goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, me and you
Up, down, and 'round and 'round
I'm goin' crazy with you
Feet liftin' off the ground
I'm goin' crazy with you
Head spinnin' in the clouds
I'm goin' crazy with you
We're crazy, goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, me and you

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Crazy, crazy, me and you
Oh, oh, oh
Crazy, crazy, me and you

Up, down, I'm runnin' 'round
I'm goin' crazy with you
Feet liftin' off the ground
I'm goin' crazy with you
Head spinnin' in the clouds
I'm goin' crazy with you
We're crazy, goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, me and you
Up, down, and 'round and 'round
I'm goin' crazy with you
Feet liftin' off the ground
I'm goin' crazy with you
Head spinnin' in the clouds
I'm goin' crazy with you
We're crazy, goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, me and you

I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Feet are liftin' off the ground
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Head is spinnin' in the clouds
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
Feet are liftin' off the ground
I'm crazy, goin' crazy
