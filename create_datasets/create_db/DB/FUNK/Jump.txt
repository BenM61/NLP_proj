I get up, and nothin' ever gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches and get what's real

Can't you see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean?

Might as well jump, jump
Might as well jump, jump
Go ahead an' jump, jump
Go ahead and jump, jump

Hey, you! Hey baby, how you been?
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin

So can't you see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean?

Might as well jump, jump
Might as well jump, jump
Go ahead jump, jump
Go ahead and just jump, jump
Knock yourself up

Can't you see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Can't you see what I mean?

Might as well jump, jump
Might as well jump, jump
Go ahead jump, jump
Go ahead and jump baby, jump

Come on jump, jump
Might as well jump, jump
Go ahead Knock yourself up, jump
Go ahead and jump, jump
Come on and jump, jump
Jump
