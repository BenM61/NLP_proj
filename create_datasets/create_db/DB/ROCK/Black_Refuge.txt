Another ending on your story 
Now I'll have to speak to you from a distance 
Because I tend to forget my duty 
When I get to close to your resistance 
Say what you have to say 
I know it isn't you anyway 
Use all the colours that you want to 
I'll use black 
I'll use black 

I tend to forget my duty 
But this time I'll use black 
I tend to forget my duty 
But this time I'll use black 
But this time I'll use black 

This time I'll use black 
This time I'll use black 

I'll use black
I'll use black
