If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life

They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules

That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, for the rest of my life

If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol"

That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey

If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life

I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life

For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
