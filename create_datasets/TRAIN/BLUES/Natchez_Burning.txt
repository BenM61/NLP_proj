Did you ever hear about the burning,
that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town
Did you ever hear about the burning,
that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town
Those buildings got to burning, there's my baby layin'on the ground
Charlotte Jones was there, Luiza was there,
Rosie Mae was there, Louise was there
Did you ever hear about the burning,
that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town
I stood back, was lookin', and the old building come tumble down
