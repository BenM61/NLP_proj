I really don't know much better
There's nothing I can tell you
But that's something for me to know
And something for you to do

Put yourself in my position
Think about it everyday
Give you solid facts, I want to hear the words
I want to hear what you have to say

You know my situation
The reality is true
But it's leisure time for the pleasure boys
And the pleasure boys are you

? Leisure and conversation
All the boys are on the phone
Pleasure and relaxation
Everyone for everyone

Put yourself in my position
Think about it everyday
Give you solid facts, I want to hear the words
I want to hear what you have to say

You know my situation
The reality is true
But it's leisure time for the pleasure boys
And the pleasure boys are you

You know!
This is a fun house
Some say a mad house
It's leisure, pleasure
And the boys are out the front
