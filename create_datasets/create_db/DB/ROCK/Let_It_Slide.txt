You say you get a feeling about it
I'm starting to know what you mean
I only have to look at somewhere you've been walking
It's like I know every place that you've been

You say you thought you'd just live without it
Nobody falls in love anymore
Well, I say that they do 'cuz I'm in love with you
And I know I've never been here before

And it's not too late for us
We've still got hope and trust
We can still hang tough
And let it slide
And when it's all too much
We'll leave it in the dust
Climb up on that bus
And ride

Remember that day when I met you
And the first thing we did was to fight
Then we played all the songs that we both ever knew
And we ended up talking all night

So this is me saying 'Baby, don't doubt it'
And this is me saying 'Baby, it's time'
'Cuz the heart's gonna see what it wants to believe
And my heart's always willing to try

And it's not too late for us
We've still got hope and trust
We can still hang tough
And let it slide
And when it's all too much
We'll leave it in the dust
Climb up on that bus
And ride
