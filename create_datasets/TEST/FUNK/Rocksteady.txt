Tell me how, baby 
Could it open my eyes 
For the night
It took me by surprise 
Oh what you said to me 

Love me do 
Whatever you want back darlin' won't be good 
That is why I woke and cried out 

Rocksteady can't break my world 
Nobody's gonna ever think twice 
Oh how I, how I often try
Rocksteady can't make that change 
Nobody's gonna ever rearrange (oh yeah) 
As time moves slippin' fast 
Love just won't become you 

Now my mind, baby 
My mind is free 
Oh you played it hard, lady 
So hard and deep 
Oh when you said to me 

Love me do 
Whatever you want back darlin' won't be good 
That is why I woke and cried out 

Rocksteady can't break my world 
Nobody's gonna ever think twice 
Oh how I, how I often try
Rocksteady can't make that change 
Nobody's gonna ever rearrange (oh yeah) 
As time moves slippin' fast 
Love just won't become you
Love just won't become you
Love just won't become you
