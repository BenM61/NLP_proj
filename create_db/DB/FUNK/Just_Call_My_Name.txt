Just call my name
And I'll come running
Just call my name
And I'll come running

Ever had a love
That you could call on when you were in trouble
Ever had a love
Who comes to you on the double
There's no need to look no look no further
I'm waiting here for you

Just call my name
And I'll come running
Just call my name
(When life's got you feeling low)
And I'll come running

Never have to fear
That I won't have time for you when you worry
If you need me near
Just call and I'll be there in a hurry
All you have to do is snap your fingers
And I'll appear for you

Just call my name
(Just call my name)
And I'll come running
(Whoa sugar)
(I'm gonna be right there for you if you just call my name)
Just call my name
And I'll come running

You're crying all alone
(Crying all alone)
Dial my number on the telephone
(All you have to do is dial my number)
And I'll be there
(Before the next teardrop falls)

Just call my name
(Please don't be afraid, oh no)
And I'll come running
Just call my name
(I'm waiting)
And I'll come running
(You can believe that I will, yes you can)

You're crying all alone
(Why are you crying?)
Dial my number on the telephone
(Don't you know, don't you know baby?)
And Ill be there
(Before the next teardrop falls)

Just call my name
(Just call my name)
And I'll come running
(Ooo-hoo yes I will)
Just call my name
(Nobody can love you like I will boy)
And I'll come running
(I'll be there)

(I'll be there until the end)
Just call my name I'm gonna be there for you darling yes I will
(Chorus repeats till end)
It doesn't matter where you are
You could be near or you could be far, boy it don't matter to me baby
Oohhhh
Don't you know, don't you know I searched all over?
I know there's none like you nowhere, nowhere
I'm so glad, so glad
That I know, that I know, that I know, that I know, that I know that I have your love
Whoo, you make me feel so real
(If you ever need a friend)
Nobody in the world does it like you do darling
And it's all on you
Just pick up the phone don't worry 'cause you know I'm home
Waiting for you baby
Always gonna be there
I dare you to try it for yourself
'Cause you know it's there
(I'll be there until the end)
'Til the end, 'til the end
If you ever need a friend
