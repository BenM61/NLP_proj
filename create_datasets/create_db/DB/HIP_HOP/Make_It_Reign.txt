[Verse 1: Peter Gunz] 

It took a long time sittin in your one and only 
Niggas said they comin in a month or so 
But they run though  
How they really want it  want all the rain and thunder shit 
Niggaz talkin this hocus pocus  focus 
On the lyrical  lyrical content 
From the Bronx to Compton  say enormous 
Hit the CD stay sober  listen tell we smoke a blunt 
Listen get sound  give it to you  give it to you 
Don't be alarmed, sound affects normal 
And I'm a MD not a MC, 
Step a head said of that shit in your walk in 
You singin I give you somethin to bounce to and think about 
That the same crew, with the same lou 
On the same rhyme, step on education at the same time 
Play mine, it'll bite you like a K-9, obey mine 
Like Sprite nigga, get it right nigga, with the right nigga 
Tight for the calm shit, it be bomb shit, 
Every day, all day, his way, ya'll way 
See you in the hallway, the floor way, 4-4 way 
Did you call before me, now give me 

Verse 2: Lord Tariq 

Yo L-o-are-d you gunz done block scared me 
You all be smokin Bob Marley 
Soft nigga Harvey, stress me want to step in me 
Test me strap you best a be 'cause I'm a blessy 
Under estimate he, who take the cake and weed 
Lord & gunz, see the 44 then run 'cause there more 
To come, blastin all you niggaz, quick fast, I'm harassin 
Laught at you nigga, bust a cap in all you fake rap actor 
Want to be, thug bus want to see, slug nigga what 
I'm from Soundview I'll pound you down to the ground 
To the earth shake earth quake and the best is the first 
To make platinum what's happenin, soft he or nothin 
Sweet here, no slappin the name is ever lastin, 
I'm romindom fastin with the passion 
I'm askin give me mine, I get the 9. 
See me on the streets got beef, want to get me fined 

"REIGN" fades out
