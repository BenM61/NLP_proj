You've always amazed me,
You're making me crazy.
I can't hide my frustration, I don't like generation.
We don't need your imitations, somebody save me.

We're out of control, digging a hole,
It's making my head spin, just let it sink in,
There's no stress, no stress.
You're driving me crazy,

I could've be pushing daises.
I can't hide my frustration, I don't like generation.
We don't need your expectations, somebody save me.
We're out of control, digging a hole,

It's making my head spin, just let it sink in,
There's no stress, no stress, no stress.
We're out if control, digging a hole,
It's making my head spin, just let it sink in.

There's no stress, no stress, no stress.
You've always amazed me,
You're making me crazy, crazy.
We're out of control,

It's making my head spin, just let it sink in,
there's no stress, no stress, no stress.
I'm out of control, digging a hole,
It's making my head spin, just let it sink in,

I'm out of control, digging a hole.
It's making my head spin, it's making my head spin,
We're out of control, digging a hole.
It's making my head spin, it's making my head spin,

I'm out of control, I'm out of control, I'm out of control.
