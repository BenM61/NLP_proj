Could have come through anytime
Cold and lonely, your return
What are you fighting for?
It's not my security

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

Lose your father, and your husband
Your mother and your children
What are you dying for?
It's not my reality

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?

Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
