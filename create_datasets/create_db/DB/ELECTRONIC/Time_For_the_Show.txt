Every day's another chance
Each night the curtain falls down
And you're asking yourself did I do enough
Did I show His love

You could be the difference
Not just a face in the crowd
Push it to the limit
Keep on reaching out
'Cause right here and right now

It's time for the show, turn up your light
It's time for the show, let it shine
Because you know who you are
And know who your heart belongs to, oh
They need to know this perfect love
It's time for the show, it comes through us
Don't wait another minute, let's go
It's time for the show

There's a stage we're standing on
Whether we know it or not
No more waiting in the wings
Step out and let them see
That you are free

Deeper than a feeling
More than words we say
We can be the real thing
It's not a role we play
So right here and right now

It's time for the show, turn up your light
It's time for the show, let it shine
Because you know who you are
And know who your heart belongs to, oh
They need to know this perfect love
It's time for the show, it comes through us
Don't wait another minute, let's go
It's time for the show

Time for the show, time for the show
You are the light of the world
A city on a hill that can't be hidden
You are the salt of the earth
Glorify your Father in Heaven
A billion tiny flames breaking through the dark
Show His love, show His mercy, show His heart

It's time for the show
It's time for the show
Because you know who you are
And know who your heart belongs to, oh
They need to know this perfect love
It's time for the show, it comes through us
Don't wait another minute, let's go
It's time for the show
