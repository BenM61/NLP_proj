Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise. 
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 

Another dollar, another day.
Some old routine in my way.
My eyes are achin', my body tired.
I'm all strung up you know I feel so wired.
And then you walk into the room.
Time stops, everything drops, boom boom boom.
Vision of love, heavens above.
I feel your body like a velvet glove.
Because...

You're a sight for sore eyes.
As a mater of fact at the drop of a hat,
You're my love surprise.

So radical, so very chic.
But without you I feel so weak
When lover boy comes into sight.
I don't know why but it feels so right.
Need energy, a vitamin shock?
No way for me, you're what I got.
Don't need no drugs to make me high,
I just need to look you baby right in the eye.
Because...

You're a sight for sore eyes.
As a mater of fact at the drop of a hat,
You're my love surprise.

Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise. 
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.

Surprise me baby. 
Surprise me baby.
Surprise me baby.
Surprise me baby.

You're a sight for sore eyes.
As a mater of fact at the drop of a hat,
You're my love surprise.

You're a sight for sore eyes.
As a mater of fact at the drop of a hat,
You're my love surprise.

Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise.
