Mine was a simple story
Never a thought of glory
I did what I did and what I had
I was glad to posses

But you changed my whole direction
And now that I've seen perfection
How could I settle for less?

I was the shyest lover
Ready to run for cover
But look at me now
I'm not the same, I aim to impress

You gave me a glance at heaven
And given a change at heaven
How could I settle for less?

Could Caesar span Cleopatra's door?
Columbus turn once he saw the shore?

I, I don't want fame or treasure
Miracles made to measure
The beautiful things that people
Rate the greatest success

I only want you forever
And you and I close together
How could I settle for?
How, how could I settle?
How could I settle for less?

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me daddy, how could I settle for less?
I wanna know, I want to know
How could I settle for?
