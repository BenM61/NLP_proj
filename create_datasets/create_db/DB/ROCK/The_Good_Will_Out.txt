I saw you sing out your praise
Come on and lay
The sunshine of my life's been burned
And I didn't see the way

Swallow down your pride
It's wrong and I'll
Help you hide
I feel sincerely you're too much
You're too much
All at the same time

Oh I
Know much more
Of what I can
Than what I can't do

If I should fail
I'm gonna nail
The blame on you
All my blame on you

Get it wrong and it makes you sore
But you're
Never right
I see it clearly you're too much
You're too much
We're all on the same side

There must be a time
Between the well meaning
When the good will come out
And start the healing

You won't know
How well you've played
Until you've won

And if at first you find
You can't imagine
How good can heal
When you've got nothing worth healing

You won't know
How well you're made
Until you're done
All you have is gone

The good will come out
The good will come out
The good will come out
Na na na na na
