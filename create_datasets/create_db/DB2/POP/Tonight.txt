He already knows
That there's something on her mind
And he'd give her the world
But she stumbles every time
It's so hard 'cos he wants her always
She believes him says
Maybe someday

I'll get an answer for you baby
I'll get an answer for you soon
No one should settle for a maybe
I'll get an answer for you soon

I've made my mistakes
I've played for high stakes
And I know when I make up my mind
And I've made up my mind

When I do 
I'll not waver
When I do 
They'll be true
If I do

He's used to it all
Still he's lonesome tonight 
She's been burned before
But that doesn't make it right
Time is drifting still
She won't tell him
He'll just walk on by
As she tells him

I'll get an answer for you baby
I'll get an answer for you soon
No one should settle for a maybe
I'll get an answer for you soon

I've made my mistakes
I've played for high stakes
And I know when I make up my mind
And I've made up my mind

When I do 
I'll not waver
When I do 
They'll be true
If I do
