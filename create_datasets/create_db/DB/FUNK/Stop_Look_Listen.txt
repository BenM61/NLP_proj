You're alone all time
Does it ever puzzle you, have you asked why
You seem to fall in love, out again
Do you ever really love or just pretend

Why fool yourself
Don't be afraid to help yourself
It's never too late, too late to

Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying
Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying
Love, love, love

Though you try, you can't hide
All the things you really feel, this time decide
That you will open up, let it in
There's no shame in sharing love you keep within

So jump on in
Head over heels, and fall right in
It's never too late too late to

Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying
Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying
Love, love, love

Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying (Listen to your heart, can't
you see it's not too late)
Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying (La, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying (Listen to your heart, can't
you see it's not too late)
Stop, look
Listen to your heart, hear what it's saying
