I know I may have made mistakes before
But now I understand what those mistakes were for Throughout my travels girl I realized
What you see, what you get don't always coincide
A bird in the hand beats two in a bush
But just one look was all it took
Could it be thayt we're the only ones thinking of
Harmony, ecstacy, there's something about this love

We, we have something in common
Girl (Boy) you mean so much to me it should be plain to see That we... We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together

Now I'm the type of girl who understands my man
I'll be strong when he's weak, I will hold his hand
Now I believe old fashioned rules and old fashioned ways Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days
You're my man and I'm your girl
There's nothing better in this whole wide world
I'll stand by your side till the very end
All in all, best of love, we are friends

We, we have something in common
Girl (Boy) you mean so much to me it should be plain to see That we... We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together

Bobby Brown: Girl you know it's you that I adore
Whitney: And there's no one in this world that I love more
