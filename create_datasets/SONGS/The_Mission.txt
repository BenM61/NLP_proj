"Move along it takes too long,you're holding back the line!"
I tell you -we've been waiting here forever
"Go ahead,don't worry-yet-'coz everything is fine"
A brand new world for us-it's now or never

We'll change the rules for those native fools
Hail intervention-we're under one flag
'coz we are on the mission and we'll never go back

Now we're on the mission-the average man
is down on his knees,so he won't understand
Above the suspicion and fear of the law
we do what we do what it takes to continue the war
The mission's right over your head
"It's not what you think"-as it's always been said
No visible victims-we're very discrete
There's no turning back 'til the day when the mission's 
complete

"Hurry up and check the map,there must be something left"
Nobody's getting rich by moving slower
"Torch their towns,forget the clowns accusing us in theft"
Remember how it works-we're taking over!

It could be strange and will need some changes,so...
Hail intervention-we're under one flag
'coz we are on the mission and we'll never go back
