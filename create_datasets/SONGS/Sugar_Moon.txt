When it's sugarcane time
Long around about June
I'll be walkin' with sugar
'Neath that old sugar moon

Gonna drop her a line
To expect me soon
Saccharine and some sugar
'Neath that old sugar moon

I can see us right now
She'll get the calendar down
Scratch your circle around
Day we're altar bound

When it's sugarcane time
Long around about June
Wedding bells will be chining
'Neath that old sugar moon

When it's sugar moon shines
Long around about June
I'll be walkin' with sugar
'Neath that old sugar moon

All the kisses I missed
I'll be gettin' 'em soon
Sugar kissed from sugar
'Neath that old sugar moon

Oh, I'm dreaming sweet dreams
All the lovin' I'll get
When I get back to my pet
Lordy how I, my friend

Til it's sugarcane time
Long around about June
And I'll be walkin' with sugar
'Neath that old sugar moon
Walkin' with sugar 'neath that old sugar moon
