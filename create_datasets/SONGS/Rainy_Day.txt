On bended knee
I've looked through every window then. 
Touched the bottom, 
The night a sleepless day instead;

A day when love came,
Came easy like what's lost now found.
Beneath a blinding light 
That would surround. 

We were without, in doubt, 
(and now) we were about saving for a rainy day. 

I crashed through mirrors,
I crashed through floors of laughter then. 
In a blind scene, 
No ties would moor us to this room. 

A day when love came,
Came easy like what's lost now found. 
And you would save me, 
And I held you like you were my child.

If I were you, defiant you,
Alone upon a troubled way. 
I would send my heart to you
To save it for a rainy day.
