I-I-I-I-I need you
I-I-I-I-I need you
I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No baby
But desperate lover, I can't keep it to myself
Oh no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Oh baby
My body's burning so come on heat my desire
Come on come on

Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you, I need you
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
Come on, come on

People get jealous 'cause we always stay together
Yeah baby
I guess they really want a love like yours and mine
Together forever
I never thought that I could ever be this happy
Yeah baby
My prayers were answered, boy you came in the nick of time
Oh

I got this feeling that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was falling apart
But now at last I really know we're made of

Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you, I need you
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
Come on, come on

I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No baby
But desperate lover, I can't keep it to myself
Oh no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Oh baby
My body's burning so come on heat my desire
Oh

I got this feeling that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was falling apart
But now at last I really know we're made of

Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you, I need you
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
Come on, come on

Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you, I need you
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
Come on, come on
