Every little tear you cry
Leaves your heart so heavy
Every time you hear goodbye
You wonder will it ever end

There's nothing I can tell you
The world moves on and on
But I still believe in love

Follow your heart
Wherever it takes you
Nobody knows
Where the wind blows
No one can say

Follow your dreams
Wherever they find you
Lost and alone, the light in the storm
Will always be with you
If you follow your heart

When the world's a little crazy
The truth's so hard to find
But I still believe in love

Follow your heart
Wherever it takes you
Nobody knows
Where the wind blows
No one can say

Follow your dreams
Wherever they find you
Lovers and friends, they fade in the end
But the love that's inside you
Grows stronger inside you

Will always be with you
Follow your heart
