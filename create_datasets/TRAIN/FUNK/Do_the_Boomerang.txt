Now, you step to the left, baby
You step to the right, now
Do the Boomerang, now
Do the all new thing around

Get yourself together, now
Get on and soul, now
Dance like you never danced
Woo!

Get down on your knees, now
Baby, do the Sweet Pea, now
Step to the left, now
Step to the right, now
Do the Boomerang, girl
Do the all new thing around

I said, step to the left, now
Step to the right, now
Woo!
Do the Boomerang, girl
(Said)
Do the all new thing around

Hey!

I said now
Left-left-left-left
Step-left, right now, girl
That's what I say

I said now
Left-step, left-step
Left-step (left step)
Hear 'bout what I say.
