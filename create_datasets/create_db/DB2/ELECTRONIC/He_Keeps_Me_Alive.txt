I said, I wish you never knew how I feel for you
It's hard to be just friends now after all
I said, I wanted more
He said, "How can you be so sure"
I'm not sure I'm faithful after all

But I'm still happy when I get to hold his hand
He says, I can hold it but remember we're just friends
And I try, and I try, and I try to be satisfied
After all he keeps me alive

I'm happy when he smiles if only for awhile
It's hard to just ignore a face like that
I wish he was everywhere, I wish his hand was in my hair
I would have been less lonely for awhile

But I'm still happy when I get to hold his hand
He says, I can hold it but remember we're just friends
And I try, and I try, and I try to be satisfied
After all he keeps me alive
After all he keeps me alive

But I'm still happy when I get to hold his hand
He says, I can hold it but remember we're just friends

But I'm still happy when I get to hold his hand
He says, I can hold it but remember we're just friends
And I try, and I try, and I try to be satisfied
After all he keeps me alive

And I try, and I try, and I try to be satisfied
After all he keeps me alive
After all he keeps me alive
After all he keeps me alive
After all he keeps me alive
