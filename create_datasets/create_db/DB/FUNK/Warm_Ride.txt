Oh
Come to me baby, I got something to say
I've been changing your direction every step of the way
I bring you motion and I bring desire
And I bring the potion to set you on fire

I know you need me, there can be no doubt
You've got me held inside your love and I can't get out
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me

Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
Baby that's the way you are (that's the way you are)
Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
We can reach the highest star (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Now I warn you woman, we are two of a kind
And we both know what's comin', we got one thing in mind
I give the pleasure, satisfaction you learn
And I got the strength to make you burn, burn, burn

Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
Baby that's the way you are (woh-oh-woh-oh-woh-oh)
Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
We can reach the highest star

Why are we waiting for this love on the ri-i-ise
Why am I searching for the magic, it's in your eyes
We must surrender to the powers that be-ee-ee
The angel in you and the devil in me, Hoh

Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
Baby that's the way you are (it's just the way you are-are)
Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
We can reach the highest star

Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
Baby that's the way you are (the way you are-are)
Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
We can reach the highest star (the highest star-ar)
Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
Baby that's the way you are (just the way you are-are)
Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
We can reach the highest star (yeah-eah)
Warm ride, war-are-arm ride
Baby that's the way you are (just the way you are)
