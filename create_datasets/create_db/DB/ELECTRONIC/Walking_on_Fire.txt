My fingers burn in the breakdown
This part of everything behind me
I fade into off the headlights
Crushing every feeling that's in me

These walls you've built never come down
One's a crowded number when you're one
Lights flicker still in your eyes
All across the ground I own

You hear things that you can't see
Echoes on and off
Thoughts spinning out of me
What's your impulse for me?

Time never leaves until it's over
Shadow falling never stay
Deep treble lights that they cover
Softly slipping down my face

You hear things that you can't see
Echoes on and off
Thoughts spinning out of me
What's your impulse for me?

I'm walking on fire
I'm walking on fire.

Time's never still in my mind
Stay where I belong in your fumes
I'm pushing back deeper lies
Still wait, open to you

You hear things that you can't see
Echoes on and off
Thoughts spinning out of me
What's your impulse for me?

I'm walking on fire.
