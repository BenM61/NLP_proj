I burn your clothes, you put your fist through the wall
You make me bigger and I make you crumble
Pretend I'm sleeping when you come home late
I know you want it but I make you wait

I'm talkin' 'bout love, I'm talkin' 'bout crazy love
I'm talkin' 'bout love, it's just a little bit dangerous
I'm talkin' 'bout love, I'm talkin' 'bout crazy love
Yeah we cry, sometimes fight like we're wrong, but we're right but it's all in love

I'm talkin' 'bout love
I'm talkin' 'bout love

You think it's funny when you drink too much
You call me weak then use me as a crutch
I followed you and then you broke my heart
But you took the time and you fixed every part

I'm talkin' 'bout love, I'm talkin' 'bout crazy love
I'm talkin' 'bout love, it's just a little bit dangerous
I'm talkin' 'bout love, I'm talkin' 'bout crazy love
Yeah we cry, sometimes fight like we're wrong, but we're right but it's all in love

I'm talkin' 'bout love
I'm talkin' 'bout love

I remember that day that I met you
Knew then I would never forget you (I'm talkin' 'bout love)
Still here after all that we've been through
Everybody needs a little bit of crazy (I'm talkin' 'bout love)
I remember that day that I met you
