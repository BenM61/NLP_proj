I sit and wait for you like so many others do
Just like they do for me, well, so I do for you

I carry fire for you
Here in my naked hands
I bare my heart to you
If you will understand

I was a stranger here inside your promised land
That turned me inside out and turned me upside down

I carry fire for you
Here in my naked hands
I bare my heart to you
If you will understand

Just like, just like, just like I scar you
Just like, just like, just like I scar you

I'm reaching out for you across broken days
All through the gathering years beyond these lonely ways

I carry fire for you
Here in my naked hands
I bare my heart to you
If you will understand

Just like, just like, just like I scar you
Just like, just like, just like I scar you

Just like, just like, just like I scar you
Just like, just like, just like I scar you (just)
