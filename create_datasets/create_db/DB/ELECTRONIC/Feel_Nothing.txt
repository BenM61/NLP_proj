We are alone
You're not the only one
You're like the rest of us
Oh, you will become undone

We are alone
Alone with every one
We want our soul to burn
We want to tell the hurt

'Til we don't feel nothing
Why should we try so hard
Let's get numb
'Til we don't feel nothing
There's comfort in the dark
Let's get numb
'Til we don't feel nothing

Here alone
We didn't choose to be born
Under a dying sun
Just let us cool the burn

'Til we don't feel nothing
Why should we try so hard
Let's get numb
'Til we don't feel nothing
There's comfort in the dark
Let's get numb
'Til we don't feel nothing

'Til we don't feel nothing

Our life for us to sleep at night
We tried so hard our whole lives
Just for us to sleep at night

'Til we don't feel nothing
