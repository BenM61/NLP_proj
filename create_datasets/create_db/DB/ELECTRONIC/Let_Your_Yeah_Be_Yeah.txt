You keep telling me yeah, babe, but you don't mean it
You keep telling me no and tryin' to leave it
You giving me buts and maybes
You know that this is driving me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is?
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no now, darling
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no now, darling
Because I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe, you know
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no
You wear a plastic smile I know by your eyes
You speak with a definite style, you're telling me lies
You've got to face reality
What is wrong with you and me?
Why can't you take your honesty?
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no now, darling
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no now, darling
Because I'm on my guard and I'm watching you from head to toe, you know
Let your yeah be yeah and your no be no
