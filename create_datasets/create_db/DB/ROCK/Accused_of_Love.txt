You speak to me in natural harmony 
 Like we both grew up with nothin' 
 And I can't believe my own memory 
 But it one day could be coming 

 And I don't even know the wrong I've done 
 And I don't even care anymore 
 All I know is I believe that you and me 
 Forever will stand accused of love 

 Watched the sun go down behind London Town 
 I was burnt, stood up in Mayfair 
 I caught a train, black car through the rain 
 From the trust that hung betrayed there 

 And I don't even know the wrong I've done 
 And I don't even care anymore 
 All I know is I believe that you and me 
 Forever will stand accused of love 

 Well, the attorney grins, the witness is drug in 
 With his face half hid in shadow 
 Sworn to God and State the truth arrives too late 
 And defense goes out the window 

 And we don't even know the wrong we've done 
 And we don't even care anymore 
 All I know is I believe that you and me 
 Forever will stand accused of love 
 Will stand accused of love 
 Will stand accused of love
