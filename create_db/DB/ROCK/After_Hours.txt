How in the world will I make it to work
In the morning?
I've been drinking since we clocked out
And now it's four a.m.
But they're such a generous couple
Alfredo and Pauline
When they offer a late night session,
You don't want to offend.

The shutters come down
And that's what they're for
We don't want to invite in the law
It's not often the case that we're forced
To sacrifice the jukebox.
But the plug always has to be pulled
On the quiz machine
So you imbibe all you can
Cause you're partaking in something forbidden
And time after time you'll wake up
Face down in the latrine.

We speak in hushed tones
And dim down the lights
We're staying after hours tonight

Where am I now?
Where am I now?
Where am I now?

I don't remember a thing,
I don't remember, remember a thing

Lord only knows what kind of poison I'm drinking
I can't read the label
So I'll just dance off my cares like Fred Astaire
Up here on the table

The shutters come down
And that's what they're for
We don't want to invite in the law
We speak in hushed tones
And dim down the lights
We're staying after hours tonight!!
