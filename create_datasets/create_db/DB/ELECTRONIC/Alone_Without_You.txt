alone without you
a hot room
septembers gloom
lick my lashes
kiss my cheeks
remembered lines in between the sheets 

alone without you
pass the phone
someone pass the phone
shall we try to make july 

you're like the sea to hold
impossible and cold
but your taste lingers on
on my hands and on my tongue 

alone without you
pass the phone
someone pass the phone
shall we try to make july
shall we try to make july

when you called me at home
You said you lived on your own
just dreaming of me
When I called you at home
someone else picked up the phone
It wasn't you
