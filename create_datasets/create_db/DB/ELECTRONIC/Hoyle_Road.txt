Another day slips away
It scares, disintegrates
You would have thought by now
I would've somehow escaped this house
And ventured out
But I wanted to stay

Another day slips away
It scares, disintegrates
You would have thought by now
I would've somehow left this house
And ventured out
But I wanted to stay

Yesterday's so far away
Today is nearly gone
Tomorrow's looming

Yesterday's so far away
Today is nearly gone
Tomorrow's looming

Yesterday's so far away
Today is nearly gone
Tomorrow's looming

Yesterday's so far away
Today is nearly gone
Tomorrow's looming, looming, looming, looming
