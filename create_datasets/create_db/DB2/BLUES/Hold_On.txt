Bless my heart,
Bless my soul,
Didn't think I'd make it to twenty-two years old.
There must be someone up above saying
Come on Brittany,
You got to come on up,
You got to hold on.
Yeah you got to hold on.

So, bless my heart and bless yours too,
I don't know where I'm gonna go,
Don't what what I'm gonna do.
Must be somebody up above saying come on Brittany,
You got to come on up!
You got to hold on.
Yeah you got to hold on.

Yeah, you got to wait,
Yeah, you got to wait,
But I don't wanna wait,
I don't wanna wait.

So, bless my heart,
Bless my mind,
I got so much to do,
I ain't got much time
So, must be someone up above
Saying come on girl,
You got to get back up.
You got to hold on.
Yeah you got to hold on.

Yeah, you got to wait,
I don't wanna wait.
Well I don't wanna wait,
No I don't wanna wait.

You got to hold on
You got to hold on
You've gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
