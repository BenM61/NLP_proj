Like Isabelle Adjani
She glides by upon a bank of violets
With those eyes that see it all
And then she smiles

Like a bee with honeyed thighs
A living hell, a slice of heaven
She is Jekyll and Hyde
Every truth and every lie

She holds a candle to my shame
I take everything but blame
When it comes to naming names
I'll name J, forever J

Uncertain, coy and hard to please
She kisses me through gritted teeth
But when I'm weak, she whispers dreams
She says "Oh well, you're no Mel Gibson 
But that's okay"
Today could be your lucky day
And I collapse into a heap

She's a bee with honeyed thighs
A living hell, a slice of heaven
She's good, she's bad
It makes me mad
She's all I'll ever have

She holds a candle to my shame
I take everything but blame
When it comes to naming names
I'll name J, forever J

Like a bee with honeyed thighs
A living hell, a slice of heaven
She is Jekyll and Hyde
Every truth and every lie

She holds a candle to my shame
I take everything but blame
When it comes to naming names
I'll name J, forever J

She laughs and sunshine hits her face
Cries and tears pour down like rain
When it comes to naming names
I'll name J, forever J

When it comes to naming names
I'll name J, forever J

And she says kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Forever J
Kiss me, miss me, kiss me
And she says kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Forever J
