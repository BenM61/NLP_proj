Good enough to eat thing 
And it's just a-what I'm gonna do

Sweeter than sugar

Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy 
And as silly as it may seem 
The lovin' that you're givin'
Is what keeps me livin' 
And your love is like peaches and cream

Kind-a like spices 
Kind-a like, like what you do 
Kind-a sounds funny 
But your love honey

Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy 
That your love can satisfy
