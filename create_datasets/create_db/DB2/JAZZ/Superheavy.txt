On the rise and fall like the storm
We stand on Jah man we set the bar
Because we're heavy, superheavy
Yo, surprise the cosmic and keeping armed
Outside the enemies of thee, keep so far
Because we're heavy, superheavy

You better watch your step keep your distance
You gotta understand a'fore it gets too dangerous 
It's two steps back and the dog won't bite
And all hell will stop don't matter if it's day or night
On the rise and fall like the storm
We stand on Jah man we set the bar
Because we're heavy, superheavy

Yo, surprise the cosmic and keeping armed
Outside the enemies of thee, keep so far
Because we're heavy, superheavy
Yo, unto the war we don't know what line of star
Give us a loan from your old style of car
Because we're heavy, superheavy

From Argentina to Zanzibar
Not go no place with me strum on guitar
Because we're heavy, superheavy
We gonna rock yourself and take no prisoners
You got no choice and it's none of your business
When the walls come down we know we got love
It's a gift to us from the heavens above

On the rise and fall like the storm
We stand on Jah man, we set the bar
Because we're heavy, superheavy
Yo, surprise the cosmic and keeping armed
Outside the enemies of thee, keep so far
Because we're heavy, superheavy
Yo, unto the war we don't know what line of star
Give us a loan from your old style of car
Because we're heavy, superheavy

From Argentina to Zanzibar
Not go no place with me strum on guitar
Because we're heavy, superheavy
We're superheavy in love, we're superheavy trusting
Superheavy in love, yes we are
Yeah, it's about real heavy, it's about mercy
Large amount, you understand?

Excess heaviness, heaviest
Heavyweight title holder
Heavyweight contenders, you understand?
Ha, huge, yeah, pep up, pep up, pep up
Heavy, superheavy
