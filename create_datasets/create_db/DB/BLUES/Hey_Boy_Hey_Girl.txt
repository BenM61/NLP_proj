(Aha)
Hey boy, you're much too much
(Aha)

So let's get together, baby
Let me going see us on time
(Aha)

I look in your eyes and my knees get weak
When you're in my arms I can hardly speak
I hear crazy music when I called your name
Baby, baby, baby, do you feel the same?

Hey girl
(Aha)
How about to kiss
(Aha)
Hey boy, I can't resist

And I'll never, never let you go

Oh boy
(Oh boy)
All right

I look in your eyes and I'm glad you're mine
When I'm in your arms you're so divine
I hear pretty music when I called your name
Baby, baby, baby, do you feel the same?

Hey girl
(Aha)
Tell me what's the score
(Aha)
Hey boy, I love you more and more
(Aha)

Now that we're married
I'll never, never, never, never, never, never
Never, never let you go

Hey girl
