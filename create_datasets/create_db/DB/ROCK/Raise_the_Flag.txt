The battle ain't over
The fight goes on
We'll never surrender
We're still standing strong
As long as you're alive and we're alive
Rock-'n'-roll will never die
From the southern stars to northern lights
Rock-'n'-roll will survive
We're stocking the flame with high octane
We'll never weaken of all
Now is the time for you and I to answer the call

Raise the flag
Raise the flag
Come on, raise the flag
Raise the flag for rock-'n'-roll
Raise the Flag

We're taking ground
Every night and day
We got the pedal down
Yeah, we're going all the way

As long as you're alive and we're alive
Rock-'n'-roll will never die
From the southern stars to northern lights
Rock-'n'-roll will survive
We're stoking the flame with high octane
We'll never weaken or fall
Now is the time for you and I to answer the call

Raise the flag
Raise the flag
Come on, raise the flag
Raise the flag for rock-'n'-roll
Raise the Flag

The war ain't over
The fight goes on
We'll never surrender
We're still standing strong
We're stoking the flame with high octane
And we'll never weaken or fall
It's a way of life: defend or die
We'll answer the call

Raise the flag
Raise the flag
Come on, raise the flag
Raise the flag
Come on, raise the flag
Raise the flag
Raise the flag
Come on, raise the flag for rock-'n'-roll
