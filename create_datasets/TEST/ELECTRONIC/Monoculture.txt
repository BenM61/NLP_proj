Why don't I just give up
And do myself a favor?
My life is slowly turning grey
And losing all its flavor
Everything the same
Again and again and again
Everything the same
Again and again and again

Over and over and over
Again and again and again
Monoculture
Over and over and over
Again and again and again
Monoculture
No change
The world has gone insane
Everything that's old
Is new again

Monoculture
Monoculture
Monoculture

Why don't I just give up
And submit to the great God of Bland?
All my exotic gestures
No longer in demand
Everything the same
Again and again and again
Everything the same
Again and again and again

Over and over and over
Again and again and again
Monoculture
Over and over and over
Again and again and again
Monoculture
Monoculture
It's the same
Monoculture
Monoculture
Mediocre
Monoculture
Monoculture
Mediocre

Over and over and over
Again and again and again
Monoculture
Over and over and over
Again and again and again
Monoculture

No change
The world has gone insane
Everything that's old
Is new again

Monoculture
Mediocre
The same
Ordinary
Boring
Mediocre
The same
Ordinary
Boring
Monoculture
