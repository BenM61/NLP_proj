I have walked through the fire as an ordinary man
And if I die, I die in peace, part of all that god has planned,
'Cause I believe in you and the best is yet to come,
You've been alone it's true, daddy's work is never done.
In my dreams, every night, I see the waves upon the sand
And you and I walk alone and there's a ring upon your hand.
Yes I believe in you and if my prayers are answered now,
I'm coming back , to you, I'm gonna find a way somehow.

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day.

Where you are is all there is, the only place I want to be
And love is war and war is cold, when you're so far across the sea.
Still I'm alive, still in love, I hope this letter finds you well,
Through the blood, through the flames, I can hear those wedding bells.

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day.

Darling you know the winds of peace are blowing,
(They say the answers written in the wind)
Still I can hear the fallen angels singing,
(Our love is stronger than the million miles that separate us)

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day...
