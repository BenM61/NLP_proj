So the sea has gone to take me
Maybe now I'd fell it fall
I tell myself I won't get astray
I believe it's going be hard
So I look across the mane
To a point far out of sight
Over me comes the rain
And I be gone
But then a night

I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways to go
I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways back home

I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways to go
I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways back home

I ain't afraid of leaving
And all those things I left behind
Most of them ain't meant to last
None of them ain't even mine
Too tired of marking time
Giving too much away
Not a single dime is left
So I'm calling better days

I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways to go
I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways back home

I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways to go
I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways back home

I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways to go
I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways back home

I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways to go
I'm looking for ways over water
I'm looking for ways back home
