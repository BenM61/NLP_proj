The door slams, dust falls down between the cracks
Some ran, some promised they'd be back
Saigon all gone, ashes to dust, a solo dance, a solo dance

And when we leave, we leave our dust, we slap our clothes, we shake it off
Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam

Out of the dust reach tiny hands to touch their fathers in other lands
Love is locked in these lost eyes, love is lost in these cold eyes
And in these wounds too raw to touch, lie ashes ashes, dust to dust

And when we leave, we leave our dust, we slap our clothes, we shake it off
Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam

We are free, we are not alone, listen to our sound
Take these hands of flesh and bone, reaching out for love
Discards settle where they must, never knowing who to trust
And in these dreams that lie in rust, ashes ashes, dust to dust

And when we leave, we leave our dust, we slap our clothes, we shake it off
Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam

We are free, we are free
