What is there to say
When all the love has slipped away in half a minute
There is always something we can blame
But in the end, it's just the same

Suddenly, you find yourself alone

Half a minute
Half a minute

What is there to say
When all the dream just fades away in half a minute
Every explanation we can find
Will never change it, we are through

Suddenly, you find yourself alone

Half a minute
Half a minute

Suddenly, you find yourself alone

Half a minute
Half a minute

Half a minute
Half a minute

Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
