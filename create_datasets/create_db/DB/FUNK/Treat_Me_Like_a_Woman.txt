Girls like tea
Girls like me
Some girls like everything that they see
Some will chase
Some like the wait
With me there's something
You should get straight
I'm not like the others
Won't keep it under cover 

I'm all up in your face
With everything I say
And I don't give me away
I'm all up in your face
With everything I say
I won't give up 

So come on down
From those clouds
You've been hangin' with the
Wrong damn crowd
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman
Throw those hands in the air
Do something so I know you care
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman 

Don't get too comfortable
That ain't good
F*ck me the way a real man should
Stay with me
Play with my hair
Always remember to stop and stare
I'm not like your mother
Don't treat me like your brother 

So get up in my face
I want you in my space
And I don't give that away
Get up in my face
I want you in my space
I won't give in 

So don't be scared
But beware
Your gonna get it if you're not
Right there
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman
If I'm in love I would die
For the man that gives me
Chills inside
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman 

Treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman 

Girls like tea
Girls like me
Some girls like everything
That they see 

So come on down
From those clouds
You've been hangin' with the
Wrong damn crowd
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman
Put those hands in the air
Do something so I know
You're there
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman 

So don't be scared
But beware
Your gonna get it if you're not
Right there
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like o woman
If I'm in love I would die
For the man that gives me
Chills inside
Better treat me like a woman
Treat me like a woman 

Girls like tea
Girls like me
Some girls like everything
That they see
