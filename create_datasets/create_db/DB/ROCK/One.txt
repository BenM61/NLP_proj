One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one, its the loneliest number since the number one
No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes is the saddest experience you'll ever know

'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever know
One is the loneliest number even worst then two
Yeah
Its just no good anymore since you went away

Now I spend my time just making up rhymes of yesterday
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number

One is the loneliest number
Since you went away
Since you went away
(One is the loneliest number since you've gone away)

One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
Since you've gone away

It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making up rhymes of yesterday
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number

One is the loneliest number
Since you went away
Since you went away
