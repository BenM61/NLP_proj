Murderer
Man of fire

Murderer
I've seen the eyes of living dead
It's the same game, survival
The great mass play a waiting game
Embalmed, crippled, dying in fear of pain
All sense of freedom gone

Black sun in a white world
Like having a black sun in a white world

I have a son
His name is Eden
It's his birthright
Beyond estranged time

Give me 69 years
Another season in this hell
It's all sex and death as far as eyes can tell

Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock of a brave new world
Our godforsaken lot
And I feel that's all we've ever needed to know
'Til worlds end and the seas run cold

Give me 69 years
Another season in this hell
There is sex and death
In mother nature's plans

Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock of a brave new world
Our godforsaken lot
