You come short?  I'ma wet your shirt nigga
It's like Vietnam on the ghetto in these streets
You die how you live, the strong eat the weak
Red and blue rags for the souljas that be bangin
And warriors on the wall for the souljas left hangin
Twenty-one gun salute, for the souls on the street
And the souljas up in heaven, may you all rest in peace (Ya heard me?)
UNNNNNNGGGGGH!
