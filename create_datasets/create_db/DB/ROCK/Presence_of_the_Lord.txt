I have finally found a way to live just like I never could before.
I know that I don't have much to give, but I can open any door.
Everybody knows the secret, everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a way to live in the color of the lord.

Everybody knows the secret, everybody knows the score.
I have finally found a place to live in the presence of the lord.
In the presence of the lord.

Everybody knows the secret, I said everybody knows the score.

In the color of the lord.
