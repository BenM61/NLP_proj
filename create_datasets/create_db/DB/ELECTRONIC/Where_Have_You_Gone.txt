Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?

On my window I can see the rain
My empty room is filled with hurt and pain
And I listen to the wind blowing cold outside
This is the night when love died

Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?

My heart inside feels like a dying flame
I close my eyes, I think of you again
And I see you walking by. Walking in the night
This is the night when love died

Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
