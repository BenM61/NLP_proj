Can't believe the things I see
That happens in the state
By a mortal distance that I can't believe
Self destructive infernal 

To save us from the breed
But I know that it is all a lie
Star wars begin now
His bombs come exploding

To bring back the death of the night
No mercy he's knowing
How strong he must show us
For the last film you all get a part

Be by my side
Or you've to die
Believe what I do is the right
Soon Armageddon

Last hours are running now
The final solution begins
The words of a madman
No children to tell them

For what they'll not see in the light
Choose by your voice
He kills and destroys
At the end you must die for the night

In earlier chess games
We're playing the part of a soldier
But now we are not qualified
To save our own life

The traps are all placed by command
They are ready to strike
We live and we'll die 
By the lies to believe

Try to escape from this suicide dreams
Or past time will come back again
Hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
At the end of the game we all die
Die now

Battalions of fear
They search and they scream
For the American dreams
Battalions of fear
The way of R.R.
To show he is the star
Battalions

Star wars

With hands full of blood
He talks about peace
With snake poisoning tongue
He's praying
El Salvador and Vietnam
You soon fast forget
But you satisfy on Afghanistan
You've been the master
You kill with a laughter
Your screams of peace are wrong and loud
Cause so we are and here we are
We scream and shout!
Your laughing about all the fools
Scream and shout!
With power of evil they stand
