Took a trip down Anita Way
Had to go on the 1st of May
Didn't have much to celebrate
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Get yer kicks all around the world
Give a tip to a geisha girl
Fit your bit with a piece of pearl
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Sold the ground to a PLC
Moved the club out to Newbury
Sod the fans and their families
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi

Picture-house built in '23
It's a place out of history
Pulled it down for your cash money
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do
