I think that you don't care, 
And its more than I can bare, 
I don't know baby, 
Maybe its all in my mind, all in my mind.

I know that I've been true, 
But honey sweetie baby what about you? 
I don't know baby, 
Maybe its all in my mind.

We've been going steady so long, 
I'd never dream you would ever do me wrong, 
I knew I was yours and I thought you were mine, 
And that every little thing was so fine.

Whoa darling Id hate to see, 
Someone else with you other than me, 
I don't know baby, 
Maybe its all in my mind, 
All in mind, 
Oh, hum, hum, 
Oh yes, its all in my mind.

I don't mean to think so mean and evil baby, 
Please tell me, tell me 
It's all in my mind.
