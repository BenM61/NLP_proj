Alot of people around here lost the white in their eyes
See the lust inside your heart, so why do you go and touch the sky?

Think with their head argue with their gut
Draft did you leave the door open it might encourage customers in
I wish the barmaid shut
Look like shit, down on my luck
Two world wars and one world cup
Scream by the desperate divided crutch
Used to have an Empire then we grew up
Lost everything who gives a f*ck
Money in the jukebox rocks all night
Same shit bands too much hype
Everyone knows, everyone sees fights
Everyone drinks in the corner, right
Everyone knows hes a C blood type
Same rematch to much delight
I love her she loves me to that's why we get together

Alot of people around here lost the white in their eyes
See the lust inside your heart, I don't want to touch the sky

He's dizzy for Lizzy
I'm dizzy generally
Scapegoat hit by a girl befriended me
Not that I care it's the only use to me
She bouncing off walls through doors
Pretend to be everything I wanna be and everything less
(? )

Your leaving alone but you came together
Who made the sun turn to stormy weather
Leaving alone but you came together
Who made the suns turn to stormy weather

Alot of people around here lost the white in their eyes
See the lust inside your heart, I don't want to touch the sky

She said tonight Jay I'm gunna teach them a ballad
An English man in every coward
I was kinda impressed by the way she dressed
I scoured this land to find a girl empowered
Ask her again why her heart turned sour
One of the ones that the boys devoured
If your gonna learn a song you gotta sing along
There's an English man in every coward
I got money in the jukebox rocks all night
Same shit bands too much hype
Everyone knows, everyone sees fights
Everyone drinks in the corner, right
Everyone knows he's a C blood type
Same rematch to much delight
Well I love her, she lovin' me too that's why we get together

Alot of people around here lost the whites in their eyes
See the lust inside your heart I don't want to touch the sky
Alot of people around here lost the whites in their eyes
See the lust inside your heart I don't want to touch the sky
