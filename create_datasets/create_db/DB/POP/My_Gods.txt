My gods seem to need some time off.
These instant prayers seem to be too much
For them to take.

I ask for more than life can give.
These crimes are too big to forgive.

My darling needed some fresh air.
These unsteady eyes were just too much to bear
Despite her love and care.

My darling told me to change or go away.
You should only know how hard I've tried.
Still I failed.

My darling told me to change or leave.
Sorry there's no magic up my sleeve
That could help us out of this.

I'll leave.
