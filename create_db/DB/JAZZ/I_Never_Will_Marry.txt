Some say that love's a gentle thing
But it only brought me pain
'Cause the only girl I ever did love
Is gone on the midnight train

I never will marry
Never take me a wife
I expect to stay single
For the rest of my life

The train pulled out, the whistle blew
With a low and a lonesome sound
She's gone, she's gone like the morning dew
And left me here alone

I never will marry
Never take me a wife
I expect to stay single
For the rest of my life

For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
