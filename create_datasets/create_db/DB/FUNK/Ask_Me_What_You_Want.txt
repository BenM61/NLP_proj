Come to me before your friends tell you
They can't help you
I'm your woman I should be the first one to know
If you want something
If you need something
Why do you think I work so hard 
And do all the things I do
Because I don't want nobody else to do a thing for you

Baby, baby please ask me what you want
And I'll try my best to get it, get it, get it, get it
Ask me what you want 
And I'll try my best to get it, get it, get it, get it

You've shown me that a woman's place
Is right beside her man
This I can understand
That foolish pride keeps pushing aside
All the things I want to do for you
I'm on your side
Don't you know that when you're down
I'm the one you should turn to

Don't be ashamed because it's the same
Thing I expect of you
Baby, baby please
Why should my giving you things make you feel insecure
I'm also giving you all the love anyone can endure
