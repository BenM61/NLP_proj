No I'd never, thought I'd see the day
When you would get up out of here
So, long time friends
We remain the same
Until you return one day, I will say

I would never fade-away on you,
I would never fade-away
I would never fade-away on you,
I would never fade-away

I'm still thinking, when we used to chill
And reason till the morning sun, so,
We'd talk of places
never seen before
who would think you'd be the one, to go

Out there, over, mountains, oceans, highways, byways
Still your thinking I'm there 
With you, tag team, us two, straight through,
that's why I stay strong to you, so I

I would never fade-away on you,
I would never fade-away
I would never fade-away on you,
I would never fade-away
