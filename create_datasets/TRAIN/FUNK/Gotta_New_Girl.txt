Hmm mmm...

Oh, oh, oh...

Well, I went to the dance
It was half past eight
My little girl had put me down

When I walked through the door
I was glad I wasn't with her
Because I saw her just in time

I started singing (oh, oh...)
Gonna find me a new girl tonight

She was sitting in
The corner all by herself
She was looking all around

I asked a little chick
I says, who is that
She said, her, she's new in town

I winked at her
She blinked her pretty eyes
Cold chills ran down my spine

I moved closer and closer
Step by step
I couldn't believe
She was so doggone fine

I started shouting (oh, oh...)
Gonna find me a new girl tonight

When I asked her her name
I could hardly see cause
Her beauty had made me blind

She whispered in my ear
With a real sweet voice that
I could make hers
The same as mine

(Oh, oh...)
Everything is gonna be all right
Then she kissed me
I got a new girl now

Everything is gonna be all right
Cause I got a new girl now
