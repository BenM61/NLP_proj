I'm a thousand miles below 
I'm in a hole waiting for you, 

with filthy streets and trucks, outside 
I dress, then I undress, and look, outside 
I'm in a hole and waiting, 
here for you... 

Between the lights downtown 
In the back of a cab, 

you are looking for kicks, to make your kicks 
and just like the trick, that goes like this 
and just like the prick, 
that you are... 

I'm a thousand miles below 
pulling ribbons from my hair, 

low rates and color T.V. 
money on the bed, left there for me 
and one of these days I'll kill you, 
while you sleep... 

(solo: Kid Congo) 

Between the lights downtown 
in the back of a taxi, 

you are getting misty-eyed, beneath the adult world sign 
just like little children, in one screaming line 
I'm in a hole and waiting, 
here for you... 

I'm a thousand miles below 
why do you leave me here? 

I was strong enough to admit that I was weak 
you take and give alot, but you don't give to me 
one of these days I'll kill you,
