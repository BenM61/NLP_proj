I have seen daybreak and sunrise and dawnt imes before
But never in time and in motion I've fall to the floor

Join my crowd
We're one and the same
We put our best move forward
Again and again
We're the people
Feel outsiders to life
But now we've come to realize
We've got to get the fire ignited

And we're gonna keep on keep on, don't
We're just gonna make the record rock
Yeah we're gonna keep on keep on
Don't, never stop, never stop, never stop

(So c'mon now) C'mon now lets make a scene
(C'mon now) Queen and king and king and queen
(C'mon now) From the chandelier
(C'mon now) Make a scene
(C'mon now) As the sun is coming up
(C'mon now) Be the ones to say don't stop
(C'mon now) 'Cause I'm not afraid of this
(co..co..co..co..co..co..) Scene

All of the hierarchies broken, now we're not at school
Roles are reversed so go on everyone break a rule

One by one
We start something new
We're gonna find our rhythm
Enjoy the view
Where's the party?
Let's go get our fix
Get all our friends in the mix
We're gonna get the night excited

And we're gonna keep on keep on, don't
We're just gonna make the record rock
Yeah we're gonna keep on keep on
Don't, never stop, never stop, never stop

(So c'mon now) C'mon now lets make a scene
(C'mon now) Be queen and king and king and queen
(C'mon now) Swing from the chandelier
(C'mon now) Lets make a scene
(C'mon now) As the sun is coming up
(C'mon now) Be the ones to say don't stop
(C'mon now) Cos I'm not afraid of this
(co..co..co..co..co..co..) Scene
