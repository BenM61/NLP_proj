A long day alone
Emptiness is so real
Never having peace of mind
Running from what I can't take
And there is nowhere left to hide
Turn and face these empty lies
All alone, heart unturned
Trying to find

Break me down replace this fear inside
Take this nothingness from me
I want to fight
I want to shine
I want to rise
Break me down

I try to find myself
I find the stranger trapped inside
And I'll take one more step away
From the face I used to recognize
Familiar shadows closing in
Suffocating fear descends
You killed a life, uncovered eyes

I'm trying to find
Break me down replace this fear inside
Take this nothingness from me
I want to fight
I want to shine
I want to rise
Break me down

Replace this fear inside
Take this nothingness from me
I want to fight
I want to shine
I want to rise
Break me down

Break me down
I want to fight
I want to shine
I want to rise
Break me down
Break me down

Break me!
