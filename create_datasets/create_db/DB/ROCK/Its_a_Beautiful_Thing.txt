Sonny went and flipped away and said he had to go
How can you ever say he never stayed alone?
And how could i belong with anyone you know?
Come on every line's a line i'll never know

Oh... It's a beautiful thing
Oh... It's a terrible thing

Sometimes i can get along alone enough
Backing everyone away and never have enough
And how could i be playing every line for you?
Look at the things today that i can never choose

Oh... It's a beautiful thing
Oh... It's a terrible thing

Sometimes i could never ever ever fade again
Sometimes i could never ever ever fade again
Sometimes i could never ever ever fade again

And how could I be playing every line for you?
Look at the things today that i can never choose

Oh... It's a beautiful thing
Oh... It's a terrible thing
