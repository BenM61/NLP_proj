Goodnight my love
Pleasant dreams and
Sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright,
And bring you closer to me.

Before you go
There's just one thing
I want to know
Is your love still warm for me,
Or has it grown cold?

If you should awake
In the still of the night
Please have no fear.
For I'll be there
You know I care
Please give your love
To me dear, only.

Goodnight my love
Pleasant dreams and
Sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me.

Before you go
Please remember I need you so
