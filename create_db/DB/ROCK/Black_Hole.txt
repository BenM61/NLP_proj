American black hole.
The life's too sweet to eat like candy.
Drain is now king.
King with a sampler.
Hook me up.
Eat like candy.
Shut the freak up and dance.
I'm only on this ride.
I'm only in your eyes
To see if I'm lucky.
Hook yourself inside.
One way only to ride.
American black hole.
Go be a movie.
Your stars are all in line.
Go be a movie.
After all this...
After all this time.
In the realm of the value neutrals,
Out here puffin' crazy lies to infinity.
American black hole.
The life's too good to eat like candy,
And I want more than you can give me.
