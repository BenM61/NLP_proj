It seems to me that you're not the kind
That falls in passing fantasies.
It seems to me that you're not the kind
That floats with passing clouds.

It seems to me that you're not the kind
Who wavers in them breezes.
It seems to me that you're not the kind
That changes with the wind.

Please fall;
Please fall in love with me.
Please fall;
Please fall in love with me.

It seems to me that of every meeting
That changes with the weather;
All that we try, the tears that we cry,
That fall just like the rain.

Please fall;
Please fall in love with me.
Please fall;
Please fall in love with me.

I want to fall in love with the world;
I want the world to fall in love.
I want to fall in love with the world;
I want the world to fall in love.

I want to fall in love with the world;
I want the world to fall in love.
I want to fall in love with the world;
I want the world to fall in love.
