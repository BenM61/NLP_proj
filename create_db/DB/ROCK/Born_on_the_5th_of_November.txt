There was November in your eyes
There'd be no pennies for the guys
There were fireworks over London
But you weren't among them anymore

When it got darker the nightmares came
I lit a sparkler to write your name
There were fireworks over London
You weren't among them anymore

Because you're too beautiful
Gunpowder is louder, that's all

You should never play with fireworks
You might get your fingers burned
The blue touch paper brings a touch of violence
But you'll never learn

Because you're too beautiful
Gunpowder is louder, that's all

Beautiful, that's what the fireworks are for
Yes, you're beautiful, you're so beautiful
Too beautiful for such an ugly world
