I'm just a normal man
I wouldn't hurt nothing at all
But here we are

Our leaders have a plan
I'd only kill if it's for them
Now here we are

I drove in a car and flew in a plane
To come to your house and kick your door in
Now it's down to this, it's just you and me
I'll blow your fucking head off for my country

I go to church and tithe  
I go to work in a suit and tie
But this is war
I'm really not sure why
But the TV says that you are wrong
Now here we are

[Chorus: x2]
My feet hurt from the sand
But still I march on gun in hand
Cause this is war
This isn't what I planned
I wanted to be so much more
But this is war
