This is my same old coat
And my same old shoes
I was the same old me
With the same old blues
And then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
And oh I look in the mirror and see
Brand new girl, I got a brand new voice
A brand new smile
Since I found you
I've got a brand new style

Just because of you boy
Just because of you
Just because of you boy
Just because of you

I've got the same old friends
They got the same old sins
I tell the same old jokes
Get the same old grins
But now the joke's on you
And the laughter does too
Every day of my life
As as fresh as morning dew

Just because of you boy
Just because of you
Just because of you boy
Just because of you

Just because of you boy
Just because of you

I go to the same old places
To see the same old faces
Look at the same old skies
See them all with brand new lives
