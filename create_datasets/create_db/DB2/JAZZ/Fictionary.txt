She's lost in coma
Where it's beautiful
Intoxicated from the deep sleepdeep sleep
Do you wonder what it's like

Living in a permanent imagination
Sleeping to escape reality
But you like it like that
Guilty by design

She's nothing more than fiction
She dreams in digital
Because it's better than nothing
Now that control's goneit seems unreal

She's dreaming in digital
Because it's better than nothing
Now that control's gone
It seems unrealthat she's dreaming in digital

She dreams in digital
And your pixel army can't save you now
My finger's on the kill switch
I remember I used to compose your dreams

Control your dreams
And don't be afraid to expose yourself
Before I shut you down
You made some changes since the virus caught you sleepingguilty by design

She's nothing more than fiction
She dreams in digital
Because it's better than nothing
Now that control's gone

It seems unreal
She's dreaming in digital
'Cause it's better than nothing
Now that control is gone

It seems unreal when she's dreaming in digital
She dreams in digital
She's guilty by designnow that control's gone
It seems unreal she's dreaming in digital

She's nothing more than fiction
'Cause it's better than nothing
Now that control is gone 
It seems unreal 
She's dreaming in digital
