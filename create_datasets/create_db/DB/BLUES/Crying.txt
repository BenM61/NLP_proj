Every time I see you, 
All that you do
Crying, crying, crying
You've been shedding them tears 
For too many years
Crying, crying, crying

You've been lonely too long, 
Something went wrong
Did he leave you again 
With them blues
Your sun don't shine, 
Your day's no round
Crying, crying, crying

You've been lonely too long, 
Something went wrong
Did he leave you again 
With them blues
Happy your day, 
I'm comin' your way
No more crying, crying, crying
