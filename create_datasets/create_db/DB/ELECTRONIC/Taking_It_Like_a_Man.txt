I thought of your perfect limbs.
I thought of your mind,
I woke up hungry,
I woke up blind.
I thought of your flaming lips,
I thought of your smell,
I woke up choking,
Drowning in hell.

Too weak to make the stand,
Just taking it like a man.

I thought of your breathing head,
I thought of your voice,
I lost my reason,
I lost my choice.
I thought of your beating heart,
I thought of your touch.
I thought of screaming.
I thought too much.

Too weak to make the stand,
Just taking it like a man.

Too late to heal the madness,
Too late to understand.
