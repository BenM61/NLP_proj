What have I done?
I broke your heart
Now there's no sun
Just cold and dark
Without your smile
I can't laugh
Without you baby 
I'm just a half
I didn't know just what I had
I didn't know I'd feel this sad

But I feel
Naked without you
I feel naked without you
I feel naked without you
What have I done?
I broke a vow
But I'm the one
Who's crying now
Without your touch
I can't feel

Without forgiveness
I can't heal
Nobody else
Can take your place
And if I don't see
Your angel face
I feel naked without you
I'm still crazy about you
I feel naked without you
I hurt the one 

Who really loved me
Don't look at me
I feel ugly
I'm naked without you
Oh my my my
Oh, I'm so tired
But I can't sleep
I threw away
A love so deep
I'm naked without you

I'm still crazy about you
I feel naked without you
Oh, now now
I'm naked without you
In my bed
I'm naked without you
In my head
I'm naked without you
Oh, I'm naked without you
Oh, crazy without you

I feel
Yeah yeah
Oh my my my
Oh, crazy about you
So naked without you
Yeah
