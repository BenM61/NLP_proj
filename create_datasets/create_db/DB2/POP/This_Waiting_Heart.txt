O Leon, O Leon, O Leon, Wellahiya,
O Leon, O Leon, O Leon, Wellahiya,

Out on the water I can hear them call,
I feel the rhythm inside of me,
This is the moment I've been waiting for,
When I'm hearing the drums in the night,
When I'm seeing the river of light, hey, hey;

Out on the water it's another world,
I feel the power inside of me,
The flame is here and now it has to burn,
You can live but you cannot survive,
And it's something you cannot deny,
To the waiting heart, this waiting heart,
To the waiting heart, this waiting heart;

Oh I'm holding on, I'm just holding on,
Holding on, Wellahiya,
Holding on, I'm just holding on,
Holding on, Wellahiya;

And maybe tonight, tonight I'll go 
I'll go down to the river where my love will be,
This time, this time I know 
She will lay down beside me, 'cause everything comes,
To the waiting heart, this waiting heart,
To the waiting heart, this waiting heart, hey, hey;

Out on the water I can hear them call,
I feel the rhythm inside of me,
This is the moment I've been waiting for,
It is here, now I'm breaking away,
And it's fortune that favors the brave,
And the waiting heart, oh the waiting heart,
This waiting heart, oh the waiting heart,
This waiting heart, oh yeah the waiting heart,
This waiting heart, oh this waiting heart,
This waiting heart;

Mamana Mamana Mamana Mamana Mamana Mamana,
This waiting heart
Holding on I'm just holding on
Out on the water I can hear them calling
This waiting heart.
