Looking for my place 
On assembly lines 
Fake prizes 
Risin' out of the bomb holes 
Skeleton boys hyped up on purple 
Smoke rings blow from across the disco 
Bank notes burn like broken equipment 
Lookin' for shelter readjust your position 
Thought control ghost written confessions 
Two dimensions dumb your head down 
Duck don't look now company missiles 
Power is raunchy rent-a-cops are watching 
Makin' their dreams out of paper mache 
Cliche wasted hate taste tested 

Hell yes I'm movin' this way I'm doin' this thing 
(please enjoy) 
Hell yes I'm turnin' it on 
I'm workin' my legs hell yes 
I'm callin' you out I'm switchin' my plates 
(please enjoy) 
Hell yes 
I'm cleanin' the floor my beat is correct 

Stretched to the limit attention spans 
Snap back retract collapse into laugh tracks 
Noise response applause and hand claps 
Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow 
Breaking points on the verge of pointless 
Fools anointed to the followers fanfare 
Look for the common not superficial 
Code red cola war conformity crisis 
Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles 
With magic markers running out of their ink 
Lives in white out 
Turn the lights out 
Fax machine anthems get your damn hands up 

Hell yes I'm movin' this way I'm doin' this thing 
(please enjoy) 
Hell yes I'm turnin' it on I'm workin' my legs 
Hell yes I'm callin' you out I'm switchin' my plates 
(please enjoy) 
Hell yes 
I'm cleanin' the floor 
My beat is correct
