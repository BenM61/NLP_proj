Long as you know what's in goin' down at the local rodeo

Well, I'm brown as brown can be.
Don't let it get on me.
You talk about money, honey
And then you pray child.
But I don't wanna be alone no more.

Think about all you have
And let it last.
I can't take no more teardrops from you,
But that don't give you no right to shout
