All is determination,
To make it make sense
All is determination,
You can find it if you

Just let go, just let go, just, let it go

Stripped to the core.

Robbed of ration,
Instinct gives rise.
Robbed of ration,
Audacious and precise.

The body lunges forward
Defeating time

You can find it if you

Just let go, let it go, just, let it go

Make it make sense
The violence of the gesture
Make it make sense
Cutting through space
Make it make sense
The face
The effort to be made
The face, the face, the face
The enemy

Just let go, let it go, just, let it go
