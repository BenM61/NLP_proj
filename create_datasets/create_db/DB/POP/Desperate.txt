There you go, walking away like you did before
But I know, I know you'll be back, back for more
And the game, the game will go on as it was
Nothing's changed, we'll know when we're closer to love

[Chorus]
Aren't we desperate, aren't we afraid
We're just two lost and lonely people, scared to be alone again
Aren't we desperate, aren't we afraid

Can't you see that there are no victims, just volunteers
We won't change, we won't change until we face our fears
We're alone, even though we are together right now
Love remains, just out of reach somehow

[Chorus]

I know we can make it, take up that look into my eyes
We'll take the future for you and I, yeah!

[Chorus]

Desperate
