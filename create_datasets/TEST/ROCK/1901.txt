Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present, they don't matter
Now the future's sorted out
Watch, you're moving in elliptical pattern
Think it's not what you say
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute thought I couldn't tell how to fall out

It's twenty seconds 'til the last call, going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down, you know it's easy like we did it all summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more, going hey hey hey hey hey hey
It's not a miracle we needed, and no I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Girlfriend, you know your girlfriend's drifting away
Past and present, eighteen-fifty-five to nineteen-and-one
Watch them build up a material tower
Think it's not gonna stay anyway
Think it's overrated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out

It's twenty seconds to the last call, going hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down, you know it's easy, like we did it all summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more, going hey hey hey hey hey
It's not a miracle we needed, and no, I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
