Why pretend that this isn't happening
When this is the way I feel?
Nothing in that we don't want
And my feelings won't disappear.

On a plane, window seat, looking down at you
All the same, can't compete with the thought, everything to lose.

Picture the moment you felt the same way
And I'll picture the moment that I let go.
Hold it a moment, don't throw it away
Oh, the love that's between us has grown so close.

Sometimes, sometimes is hard to breathe
Sometimes it's hard to think about anything but you, baby.

Picture the moment you felt the same way
And I'll picture the moment that I let go.
Hold it a moment, don't throw it away
Oh, the love that's between us has grown so close.

All this time I been wanting you
Now's the time I'll be loving you.
This right here, baby, is all I know
Yes, it's all I know.
You and I together, love,
Take your time, take it slow.
