Scarred, scourged, tattered
Vessels frayed and frail
The shield of faith is battered
But it will not lie down
To let defeat prevail

Pounding with a vengeance
Hearts that beat with light
For shining in the distance
A glimpse of the tower
Through the blood and fog

Belfry, Belfry
Belfry, ring victory's chimes for us
Belfry, ring victory's chimes for us

From the coldest mountain
To the deepest brine
Burst the shutters open
And let the glorious sound
Rip apart the sky

Belfry, Belfry
Belfry, ring victory's chimes for us
Belfry, ring victory's chimes for us

Belfry, Belfry
Belfry, ring victory's chimes for us
Belfry, ring victory's chimes for us

Belfry, hope has returned for good
Belfry, ring victory's chimes for us

Ring it, ring it
Ring it, ring it
Ring it, ring it
Ring it, ring it
Ring it
