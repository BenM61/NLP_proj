WIRED UP FOR SOUND
THIS IS 1999 
GOT MY SPACE-BOARD I FEEL FINE
DROP A TAB LET'S GET HIGH
C'MON C'MON SURF TO THE SKY

CHORUS
BE A SPACE CADET
BE A SURF CADET
BE A SPACE CADET

CALL OF THE WIRED
DON'T SLEEP 'CAUSE I NEVER FEEL TIRED
CALL OF THE WIRED, WIRED UP FOR SOUND

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING 
WHO GIVES A F*CK, WHO GIVES A DAMN
CALL OF THE WIRED
WIRED UP FOR SOUND
CALL OF THE WIRED, CALL OF THE WIRED

CALL OF THE WIRED
WIRED UP FOR SOUND
CALL OF THE WIRED
DON'T SLEEP 'CAUSE I NEVER FEEL TIRED
GOT MY SPACE-BOARD ON MY BACK
GONNA GIVE GRANDMA A HEART ATTACK
DOWN THE PARK, ROLL A DRAW
GET ON MY SPACE-BOARD AND SURF SOME MORE

CHORUS

CALL OF THE WIRED
DON'T SLEEP 'CAUSE I NEVER FEEL TIRED

CALL OF THE WIRED, WIRED UP FOR SOUND
NO MONEY, NO CIGARETTES
NO MONEY TO PAY MY DEBTS
GOT A BUZZ GOING THROUGH MY BRAIN
DAMN NEAR DRIVING ME INSANE

CHORUS

CALL OF THE WIRED
DON'T SLEEP 'CAUSE I NEVER FEEL TIRED
CALL OF THE WIRED, CALL OF THE WIRED

I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOIN'
WHAT PATHWAY SHOULD I TAKE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING 
OH GOD FOR FUCKS SAKE
CALL OF THE WIRED
WIRED UP FOR SOUND

CALL OF THE WIRED, CALL OF THE WIRED
DON'T SLEEP 'CAUSE I NEVER FEEL TIRED
