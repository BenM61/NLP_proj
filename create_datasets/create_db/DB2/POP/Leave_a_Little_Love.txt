If I'm just a toy, you're gonna play with.
If I'm not the girl, you're gonna stay with.
Then don't take all my love,
Don't let me give you all my love,
Oh, no no no,

Cause I want you to Leave a Little Love
In my heart,
Yeah, Leave A Little Love
so when we part,
If I meet someone new,
someway, someday,
Baby then I'll have a Little Love
to give to him right away.

If I'm just a clown, you're having fun with.
You'll just put me down, when I am done with,
Well darlin' that's ok, but there is one thing I must say,
Oh darlin' please,

Well I want you to Leave a Little Love
In my heart,
Leave A Little Love
so when we part,
If I meet someone new,
someway, someday,
I'll have a Little Love
to give to him right away.

I'll have a Little Love
to give to him right away-------
