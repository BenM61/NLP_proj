I have just one regret in life
That change I wasted
When you said goodbye
And to be honest, at the time
Though I could see
I must have been blind
Oh what I'd give to have you back
Relive those moments once again
I'd take your hand
And we would fly
Just you and me
My love and I

I pray to god that there will be
An end to all this hatred
People are showing
If seems you cannot even breathe
Without the fear of bombs exploding

Whatever happened to our world
Where making love
Meant holding hands
Remember how we used to try
Just you and me
My love and I
My love and I

We used to meet after work
Me all covered in dirt
And you with your hair all scattered
But it didn't matter

Oh for those days of present, past
Those happy moments we would share
Above the clouds beyond the sky
Just you and me
My love and I
Above the clouds beyond the sky
Just you and me my love
Just you and me
My love and I
