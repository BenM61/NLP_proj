When roses bloom in December,
When pears grow on an apple tree,
When snowflakes fall in the Summer,
You'll be true to me!

When moonbeams shine in the morning,
When sparrows don't know how to fly,
When snowflakes fall in the Summer,
When you won't make me cry!

You'll never change, I know it,
And there'll never be a Summer snow;
And darling, it's just as impossible
For me to ever let you go!

When Spring rain comes in the Autumn,
When lemons taste like honeydew,
When snowflakes fall in the Summer,
I'll stop loving you!
