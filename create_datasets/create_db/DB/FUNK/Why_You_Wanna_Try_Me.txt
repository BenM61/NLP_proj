Why you want to try me, baby
Why you want to do me this way 
Why you want to try me, baby
Why you want to do me this way

So many nights, so many days, baby
I've been hurt by your love
I don't know why I still love you like I do, baby
But you're a star in my world

Oh, how you got down and lonely
Ooh, yeah, my heart is in your hands
I don't see why you won't let me
When you know I'll be your number one man, yeah

Why you want to try me, baby
Why you want to do me this way 
Why you want to try me, baby
Why you want to do me this way

Tell me, yeah
Oh, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa

I want to know just how you feel about me
I can't pretend anymore
My love for you just keeps on gettin' strong
Don't make me walk out the door

This can't go on forever
We've played this love game too long
I've tried my best to understand you
Please love me, girl, and don't do me wrong

Why you want to try me, baby
Why you want to do me this way
Why you want to try me, baby
When I'm the one you want
Just tell me where I am
Ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell me, tell me
Please don't go
Oh,

Stop right there, hold on
Why you want to try me 
Stop right there, hold on
Why you want to try me



Stop right there, hold on.
