Life is just complex cimplicity
Thug it out

(Verse 1)
Everybody's worried about tomorrow
Will they see tomorrow
I'm just tryna get mine off today
Momma said tomorrow ain't promised
So i'm tryna live like it's my very last day

You can't live your life
Being in fear of all that may be
You gotta press on
You gotta be free
you gotta breathe
inhale exhale
come on

Bounce ohh, with me tonight
Get bold, with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's, gonna be alright

(Verse 2)
Everybody's worried bout the negative
Looking at the worst of things
I'm just tryna celebrate my life
Momma said be young while you can be young
Life only gets rougher
I'm just tryna keep my youth alive

I won't be held down
With all the things that happened in the past
Daddy he wasn't there
Momma she's gone now
I gotta be grown
I need you to hold me down

Bounce ohh, with me tonight
Get bold, with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's, gonna be alright
Bounce ohh, with me tonight
Get bold, with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's, gonna be alright

(Bridge)
Party
All night
Don't let it get you down
It's just life

Party (oh come one and party)
All night (all night)
Don't let it get you down babe(don't let it get you down)
It's just life
Oh, yeah

Bounce ohh, with me tonight
Get bold, with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's, gonna be alright
Bounce ohh, with me tonight
Get bold, with me tonight
Put the choke up in the sky
Wave your glasses high cause
We ain't got no choice but to party
Party it all away
We're gonna party for brighter days
Party cause everyday's, gonna be alright
