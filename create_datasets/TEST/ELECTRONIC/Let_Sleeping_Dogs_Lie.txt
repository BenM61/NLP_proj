I don't wanna talk about it, do we have to bring it up again
Let sleeping dogs lie, bring the subject to an end
Your sights are on history, leave it alone, let it be
Water under the bridge, let it flow out to the sea

I said I was sorry, I know that I made a mistake
Won't you please, again, give me a break
Won't you get beyond it, I'll be straight
I'll be good, watch and see, don't go bringin' it back to me

I don't wanna talk about it, do you have to bring it up again
Let sleeping dogs lie, bring the subject to an end
You got a little letter to grow that thought, but you don't know what hurt you
Well the first time I'd done that you had to catch me in the act

I said I was sorry, I know I made a big mistake
Won't you please, again, won't you give me a break
Won't you get beyond it, I promise I'll be straight

Don't be so suspicious, don't go looking for a but
Damned can we clear the air and get back to us
I'll be good, watch and see, don't keep bringin' it back to me

I said I was sorry, I know that I made a mistake, oh
Again, I wish that you would give me a break
Can't you get beyond it, gimme a chance to be straight
Don't be so suspicious, show a little trust
Can we clear the air and get back to us
I'll be good, watch and see, don't keep bringin' it back to me

(Look, it happened, I can't pretend it didn't, I saw it with my own eyes)

Let sleeping dogs lie, let sleeping dogs lie
Let sleeping dogs lie
