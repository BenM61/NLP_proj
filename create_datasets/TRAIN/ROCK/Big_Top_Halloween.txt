If I had a heart attack
Here upon your floor
Drape my arms around your neck I know
Would you care at all?

I saw you back last Halloween
And I swung from your trapeze
Just to see if you would catch me should I fall
Just to see if you would catch me
Scaring
Start scaring

Well you stain like vanilla
And your eyes look like 2 jack o' lantern holes
You've got a Nazi for a grandma
And a braid behind your neck
You've got away
You got away

But if I was as stupid as I look
To follow you around
All for you to knight me with a kiss
Same vein same ass same hole

I saw you back last Halloween
You couldn't wait to turn around
Under the Big Top you will see me crawling
On my hands and knees
The Big Top you will see me
See me
See me
