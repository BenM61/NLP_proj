Hey baby Its you I truly adore 
I finally found the peace of never wanting more 
Singin' a sweet song of who and where I belong 
I see a vision of a love that's more than strong 
I feel so fine, truly divine 
My dream has come to life, hey yeah 
You're always there on my mind 

'Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight 
A tender loving kiss that can make it right 
Someone to chase the darkness into the light 
I know its true Baby, there's none better than you 

'Cause my love is true, oh 

Oh my dear I cant say the way that I feel 
You're more than words, you're more than Pictures can reveal 
Sugar is sweet but with you its hard to believe 
There's nothing to compare, you're all I want and need 
Eternally I'm gonna see all that love can be 
Yeah yeah Heaven has given to me 

'Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight 
A tender loving kiss that can make it right 
Someone to chase the darkness into the light 
I know its true Baby, there's none better than you

'Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight 
A tender loving kiss that can make it right 
Someone to chase the darkness into the light 
I know its true Baby, there's none better than you 

And I know in time Our hearts will be together 
I see your smile and I see forever 

Baby, baby 
And our love is true 
Oh! There's no one better, oh 
There's no one better than you 

'Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight 
A tender loving kiss that can make it right 
Someone to chase the darkness into the light 
I know its true 
Baby, there's none better than you
