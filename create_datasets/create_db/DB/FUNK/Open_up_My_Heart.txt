I'm gonna open up my heart
To the world this morning
See if I can help a friend

I'm gonna pull back the shades
Of my fear this morning
And let the light of
The world come in

Ever how much I'm down
I'm gonna go
I'm gonna go another round
Try to bring somebody happiness

As I look about me, I can see
All the blessings given to me

A baby boy
A woman who loves me
Oh, yeah

I'm gonna open up
Open up my heart this morning
And see if I can help a friend

I'm gonna give all my heart
Make a new start
In the world this morning
See if I can help a friend

If they scorn me today
Turn me away
No matter what they say
I'm gonna be just a friend

I'm gonna try it once more
Knock on every door
Of the world this morning
See if I can be a friend

Right on, brother, right on

I'm gonna give, give up my heart
I gotta make, I gotta make a
New start in the world this morning

If they scorn me today
Turn me away
No matter what they say
I'm gonna be her friend

Oh, I'm gonna try it
Try it once more
I gotta knock on
Each and every door
I gotta see if, I gotta
See if I can be a friend

I gotta say it one more time
I'm gonna give it all my heart
I gotta make me a new start
In the world this morning
I gotta see, can I help a friend

If they scorn me, scorn me today
Don't you dare turn me away
I'm gonna be just a friend

Oh, I'm gonna try it
Try it once more
I gotta knock on
Each and every door
Of the world this morning
I gotta see, I gotta
See if I can be a friend

Everybody, sing with me
I'm gotta give it all my heart
You know we gotta make a new start
In the world this morning
I'm gonna find me
I'm gonna find me a friend, oh

Scorn, scorn me today
They cannot
They can't turn me away
I'm gonna be just a friend
I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your friend

I gotta try just one more
You know I gotta knock on
Each and every door
I wanna see if I can be your friend
I wanna help somebody
I wanna helpo everybody

I gotta give up my heart
I wanna make
I wanna make a new start
Oh, in the world this morning
