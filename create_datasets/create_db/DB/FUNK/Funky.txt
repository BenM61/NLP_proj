Mama's in her kitchen
She's stirrin' in a pot
Daddy's sittin' waiting to see what she's got
He's sitting by the fireplace with his hands on his
Knees
He looked around at mama said, "Hey, you better come
See about me."

Let's get funky
Yea, get it on
Right on

Now every time I see you
You know you're lookin' cool
You're lookin' like you want to do it
But, you ain't got the tools

I wanna teach you somethin' that's not from the Golden
Rule
This is something baby that you can't learn in school

Let's get funky
Yea, get it on
Right on

Let's get funky, yea
Baby, get it on
Right on
Right on
Get it on, get it on
Right on
(Incomprehensible)
Right on
(Incomprehensible)
Right on
(Incomprehensible)
Right on
(Incomprehensible)
Right on
Do it, do it, do it.
Right on

Da da da dat dat dat dat da da dat
Da da da dat dat dat dat da da dat
Da da da dat dat dat dat da da dat
Whooo

I know you had your trip down on funky broadway street
But this is a diff'rent thing with a whole diff'rent
Meaning
It matters not where you been
But where you wanna go
If the music moves you just get on the floor

And let's get funky
Get it on
Right on

Let's get funky
Baby, get it on
Right on
Right on

Let's get funky
Get it on
Right on
