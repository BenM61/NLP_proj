Always said I would know where to find love
Always thought I'd be ready and strong enough
But sometimes I just felt I could give up
But you came and you changed my whole world now
I'm somewhere I've never been before
Now I see
What love means

It's so unbelievable
And I don't want to let it go
Its something so beautiful
Flowin' down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been
Forever a part of me
And it's so unbelievable
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be

In my heart in my head it's so clear now
On my hand you've got nothin' to fear now
I was lost and you've rescued me somehow
I'm alive I'm in love you complete me
And I've never been here before
Now I see
What love means

It's so unbelievable
And I don't want to let it go
Its something so beautiful
Flowin' down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been
Forever a part of me
And it's so unbelievable
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be

When I think of what I have
And this chance I nearly lost
I can't help but break down and cry
Oh yeah break down and cry

It's so unbelievable
And I don't want to let it go
Its something so beautiful
Flowin' down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been
Forever a part of me
And it's so unbelievable
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be

Now I see
What love means
