(humming)
When you rate give me some
It's not too late to be someone
You're at home so cozy
I am waiting for you

(humming)
You are so authentic
Throw yourself away
You remind me of something
And I'm waiting for you

I am here
Nothing much, going nowhere
In the in and out and in to something
I forgot give me some personality
Having fun way below the radio
(humming)

In my room so teeny
In my own capsule
You're at home receiving
Comfortable transistors

I am here
Nothing much, going nowhere
In the in and out and in to something
I forgot give me some personality
Having fun way below the radio
Take me there anywhere
Out of this one
In the off and on and on in out there
I forgot give me some personality
Having fun way below the radio
(humming)
