Trilla, boss, yeah, Trilla, feels good, baby
Boss, I done took over the game, nigga
Hoppin' out the blue gotti with my bellys on
No underwear nigga, my jeans tight fitted, too nigga
Jay-Z, wuddup nigg? Yeah, let me f*ck with 'em right now

Niggas want to kidnap, leave me in the trunk
Walk away with big stacks
They jealous of the fortune
Glitz and the fame, my cocaine mortgage

In the game like Tony Parker
Snow white range and my partner pocket
I'm back on them thangs that's my only problem
Homie, I put that on my only mamma

Still rollin' with the 4, 5th, now that I'm rich
Got these broke niggas so sick
And my daughters college pre-paid, she straight
Say thanks to the D game

In that phantom on that Tupac
Ridin' through the ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot
Naw, but I'm well established
I f*ck with heroin 'cause it sells the fastest

I'ma ride 'bout mine and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

A bitch try to stick me
'Cause you f*ck me don't mean you can kiss me
Naw, I only f*ck with the OG's
The ones that won't turn you in to the police

On the run, I'm through' wit nigga four keys
ID's, passports, it was so sweet
Front yard still a car show, blue gotti to gotti, I'm a rocko
I won't let the roof up, kingdom come, princess Amunda

To be loved, to be loved, oh, what a feeling for me to be loved

Haters want to murder me and I can smell a hit
So it's music to my ears every time I feel a clip
I'm a card shark up in a hard rock
Twenty grand a hand, baby, jamin' the ipod

I'ma ride 'bout mine and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

Boss, hit a hundred grand in a day damn
Whip that white girl just like K-Fed
Got me a white girl, I f*ck till her face red
Yeah, her food tastes bad, but she givin' great head

Please, let me say that, I really love her fat ass
[Incomprehensible] to the dealership, and she can, she can get that
My heart in the ghetto, I'm married to the projects
I ride with are, in case a nigga start shit

I'ma ride 'bout mine and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

Triple see, when y'all stoppin' me
Told you all niggas in '95, I was worth two million
Now it's a way and I got ten in the bank nigga
What else y'all got from Nick? I wanna see
I need yours to own, God, niggas gettin' washed out

And that's alright, I've been lettin' it be slightly
Like that they will prob'ly like
Tryna make some kinda moves, man

Yes, I got a Vuitton, four shades, nigga
I gotta all new look, alright, you know
Ever since I got my W2 bracket, fear me
I got plans for you niggas, man

Murder's not a problem
I'm the boss, still comin' down, 183rd, nigga
They gave you up on the 305, 47 A6, it's all the same game
Posted up in front of Papa's
