Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel
Can you feel the heat?
Don't it make, don't it make
Don't it make you wanna move your feet

Feel what I'm feeling
Feel what I'm feeling

A time to worry
A time for sleep
A time to laugh
A time to weep

But right now it's party time
Get on down, relax your mind
Don't let the wheel fall off your wagon
And catch you with your whole life dragging

Let yourself go, hey, feel what I'm feeling
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling loose
Ooh, kick off your shoes and stay awhile
Just hang loose, like your style

A time to go
A time to stay
A time to work
And a time to play

Don't be no fool and blow your stack
'Cause once you leave, you ain't coming back
Join right in with the finger popping
Party hearty, till the whole joint's rocking

Let yourself go, hey
Feel what I'm feeling
Float like a feather
Get it together

When you hear the drummer
That funky beat
When you hear the rhythm
Loud and sweet

And you let yourself go

Let yourself go
Oh, feel what I'm feeling, yeah

Let yourself go
Feel what I'm feeling

I'm feeling good I'm feeling loose, uh, huh
Take off your shoes and stay awhile
Just hang loose, I like your style

Let yourself go
Feel what I'm feeling

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel
Can you feel the heat
Don't it make, don't it make
Don't it make you wanna move your feet

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel
Can you feel the heat
Don't it make, don't it make
Don't it make you wanna move your feet

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Feel what I'm feeling
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Feel what I'm feeling

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel
Can you feel the heat, oh yeah
Don't it make, don't it make
Don't it make you wanna move your feet

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel
Can you feel the heat, oh yeah
Don't it make, don't it make
Don't it make you wanna move your feet, all right

Hey

Feel what I'm feeling
Get on down
Feel what I'm feeling
Oh, oh yeah

Feel what I'm feeling
I feel it baby
Feel what I'm feeling
I feel it baby, oh

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
