( VERSE 1: Ganxta are?dd )
This rhyme is mine and I lived it to give it
So that the New Funky Nation can get with it
Understand the plan that's programmed
For all nations to slam this jam
'One Nation Under a Groove' was the first move
So now it's time to get with the New
Funky Nation, the new formation
Turn up that bass for more connection
We must get along in order to live long
So keep bumpin that Boo-Yaa song
So maybe then you can understand the game
The Gangsta draws out the picture to frame
In your mind you think, understand and learn
You play with fire, you're gonna burn
Gangsta know cause I been through
Always lookin for somethin to get into
This, into that
Into my pocket, I pulls out a gat
Cause I'm a hardhead, and I'm down
This is one MC that don't be fuckin around
Takin care of the issue is what I get into
So now it's your time to step to
This jam to be craved for the new generation
Here, this is for the New Funky Nation

And it could be better
(It could be better)
The New Funky Nation
(New Funky Nation)
It could be better
(It could be better)

( VERSE 2: Ganxsta are?dd )
Another nation I'm pimpin, lyric clip clippin
The bomb is tickin while the hour glass is drippin
Wastin time at the scene of a crime
It was your rhyme that put MC's in line 
Or on queue, I can rock a cue in pool
Put yo ass on quiet, send yo ass back to old school
Step back while I reach for the rack
Grab my brim and tilt it back
I gots to funk this cause I invented it
Another message from the Gangsta who's sendin it
Let it be a lesson for those who don't know
Boo-Yaa soldiers packs the O
(Tell them who's O)
One Mobsta Bass who can funk a show
Hang a MC off the cliff and let him go
We can get to it, do it, play Russian Roulette
Show us a trigger and we'll pull it
No time to waste once upon the mic
(So what you think, Ridd?) 
This is for is the Nation's delight
All together, we must come as one
Turn up the drums, jealous can't get none
Of Godfather, K.O.D., E.K.A.
Roscoe, the Ridd, and the O makes the other trey
So here's your invitation
This is for the New Funky Nation

And it could be better
(It could be better)
The New Funky Nation
(New Funky Nation)
It could be better
(It could be better)

( VERSE 3: Ganxsta are?dd )
We must go on
Cause the New Funky Nation is ready and armed
Straight from the Funk Farm
Yes, we know you can't get with it
But I see your head can move to it
So let's face it
This is for the nation to taste
O, bring in the New Funky Bass
Lights - camera - murder
It was the Riddler who put it together
Understand my demands, another funk band
Pulled you down like quicksand
Don't let it fool you - damn!
Another goddamn preview
I have the message to give to the people
And it's about this New Funky Tempo
They gots to have it, break the old habits
Or another nation will sneak up and grab it
Realizing the nation I'm facin, but we must go on
The New Funky Nation has just been reborn
Bring on the funky horns, we're ready to go
Is the New Funky Nation ready to go?
Yes, we're ready to roll, so now you know
Life has their limitations
Here, this is for the New Funky Nation

And it could be better
(It could be better)
The New Funky Nation
(New Funky Nation)
It could be better
(It could be better)

( OUTRO: all )
I pledge allegiance to the Funk
Of the United Funky Nations
And to the public for which it stands
The New Nation is now in our hands
Individuals with liberty and funk for all
