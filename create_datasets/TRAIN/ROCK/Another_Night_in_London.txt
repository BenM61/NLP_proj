Laying down the law, listen to the hammer
Mouth of madness, watch the wicked gather
Streets of stone, underneath the grey skies
Nights come, they speak of devils in disguise

It takes people like you, to make people like me
It take people like me to make like you

Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young

Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young

While the night is still young!

Shadows of light, not a glimpse of the sun
Going 'til morning, 'til the battles won
Streets of stone, underneath the grey skies
Nights come, they speak of devils in disguise

It takes people like you, to make people like me
It take people like me to make like you

Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young

Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young

Shots fired, the sound of a new generation
No future, no revolution

For you!
For you!
For me!
No fucking revolution you!

Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young

Let's start a riot, another night in London
Let's start a riot, while the night is still young

Shots fired, fights!
While the night is still young!
