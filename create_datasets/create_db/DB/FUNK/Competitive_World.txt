Adjacently we stand keeping out the cold
Emotions flowing through us, are we being to bold
To say we're in control
Time is moving on soon well be gone
The wall will crumble and fall, it had to be that way

'Cause this competitive world, may let you down
Hearts and souls and minds, they get churned around
People tread on your heart and they don't fear
That brave look in your eye, which says you care

Clouds that float on by, furnishing the sky
So beautiful you want to be there too, oh you can make it there
Stones may block your path people they may laugh
Say your acting like a fool, this fuels your will to prove

So don't ever let go, when someone says its so
Don't give up the flight, 'cause you know its right
That brave look in you eye, says your dreams won't die
This formulates your key

Don't let the wall crumble and fall
Build it up, keep it up
'Cause this competitive world may let you down
Rise up and defend yourself

This competitive world, this competitive world
Rise up and defend yourself
