Frankie, wherever you are, I love you

Though you've found a new love, I still miss you so
I just can't forget you, but you'll never know
Frankie, my darling, I'll never let you see me cry

Once I was your sweetheart, now I'm just a friend
Once you really loved me, now I just pretend
Frankie, my darling, I'll never let you see me cry

Oh, Frankie (Frankie) I'd rather hide
These teardrops (teardrops) deep down inside
I'm crying (crying) but you'll never see
I'd rather cry than have you pity me

Though my nights are lonely since we've been apart
I'll always keep this secret deep within my heart
Frankie, my darling, I'll never let you see me cry

Frankie, wherever you are, I love you
