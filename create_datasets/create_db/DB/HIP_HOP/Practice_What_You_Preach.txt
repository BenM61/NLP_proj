So what do you want to do, I'm here baby
I'm ready baby, I'm waiting on you
Believe me, I am patiently waiting on you

Girls there's something wrong with me
Every time I'm alone with you
You keep talking about you loving me
Hey babe, your foreplay just blows my mind
So why don't we stop all the talking girl
Why don't we stop wasting time?

'Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

Girl it's just you and me, so many things 
I could do to you and so many ways I can please
Hey, hey, hey it's your move girl
Why don't you start turning down the lights
And show me what you can do?

'Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

Ladies, baby, baby, baby
We're wasting time, precious time
All this talk about what you're gonna do
And how you're gonna do it to me
Come on, practice what you preach

'Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach
