I'm the obsessor
Holding your hand
It seems you have forgotten
About your man
Alone in the darkness
My bed's a different land
Your touch intensifies
And I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand

You're the up-settor
Stroking my hand
What's my position?
I don't understand
Am I your position?
Am I enigma?
Oh, when you turn to me
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand

You, you moved into to my mind again, oh
You, you're walking around again and free, oh
Oh, I can't let you stay
But I'm walking on broken ground again
Oh, when will I learn?
All you do is push me back in the dirt

Ah, ah
I'm in the quicksand
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm in the quicksand
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm in the quicksand
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm in the quicksand
