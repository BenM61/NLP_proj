Life is a moment in space
When a dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside
You know we never know why

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong

I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right that I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Live in each other's hearts

We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say
The truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
but I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right that I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

H-e-why, why-e-a-h
I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right that I defend
Over and over again

I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right that I defend
Over and over again
