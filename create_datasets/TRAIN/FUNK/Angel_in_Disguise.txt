Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you

I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
It's more to this than what you say
Cause in your sleep you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then cause the rain began

Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you

She seemed so familiar the day that I met her
Who was she foolin' I had a clue what she was doin'
Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention
I fell in her game I'm so lost
Please stop the rain

And when my music stops
And when my tear drops
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again

Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you

Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
