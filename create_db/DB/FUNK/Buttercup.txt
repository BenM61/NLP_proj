There's a chance for everybody
So I took my chance on loving you, yeah
But no one man can make you happy
You wanna have your cake and eat it too, yeah

You won't give up your buttercup
You say you love to but one is givin' up
'Cause he can't stay, no, no
Aw, you won't give up your buttercup
You're plenty for one but two, you're not enough
And I can't stay

Rump, pump, pa, pumpah, pah, dahbah

I've a right to my opinion
Feeling we'd be better off as friends, yeah
'Cause you can make no one man happy
When you're spreading yourself much too thin, aw

You won't give up your buttercup
You say you love to but one's givin' up
'Cause he can't stay, no, no
Aw, you won't give up your buttercup
You're plenty for one but two, you're not enough
And I can't stay

Rump, pump, pa, rump, pump, pa, dah

Dit, dit, dit, dit, di, dit, di

Oh, buttercup, well, give it up
Na, na, na, na, na, no

You say you love to but one is givin' up
'Cause he can't stay, no, no
Aw, you won't give up your buttercup
You're plenty for one but two, you're not enough
And I can't stay

Rump, pump, pa, rump, pump, pa, dah

There's a chance for even losers
'Cause I will find a love that's pure someday
Yeah, ee, yeah, you will be the one who's bluer
Because your game of love no one will play, ya

You won't give up your buttercup
You say you love to but one is givin' up
'Cause he can't stay, no, no
You won't give up your buttercup
You're plenty for one but two, you're not enough
And I, I can't stay

Rump, pump, pa
Rump, pump, pa, dah

Won't give up, well, give it up
No, no, no, no, no, no, won't give it up
You've gotta give it up
You gotta give it up
Or you're gonna loose it

Won't give it up
Oh give it up, you gotta
Give it up woe
Woe, woe, woe, woe now
Give it up, oh no, no

Won't give it up
Don't wanna give it up
Won't give it up, oh
I'm in love with you, oh
