Drinking there's no tomorrow
Drowning sins and sorrows
I've passed this way before
And just drank some more 

I woke up with a red face 
And war paint
And a loss of grace
I won't be back in second place
By taking something with bad taste 

I catch it every time 
I don't know why but I like this feeling
Part of something higher
And I'm not just bleeding you dry 

Daylight is a mystery
When quoting lines from history
Of famous drunks that used to be
But now all this is lost to me 

Their contributions used to grate
As I explained away their fate
With deadlines I'll never make
And the fact I'm doing nothing 

I catch it every time 
I don't know why but I like this feeling
Part of something higher and I'm not just bleeding
Don't know why, why, why but I like this feeling
Part of something higher and I'm not just 
Bleeding you dry 

Faster, faster my chemical master
My problem solver, my powered saint
Give me the power to go forever
And make my blood just red wet hate 

I don't know why but I like this feeling
Part of something higher and I'm not just bleeding
Don't know why, why, why but I like this feeling
Part of something higher and I'm not just 
Bleeding you dry
