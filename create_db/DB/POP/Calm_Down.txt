I thought we figured out how not to spill blood
I thought we figured out to walk away
I thought we found that love was not a failure
Decided that the sea would have no waves

And it kills me 'cause I get worked up and you get worked up
And we get worked up for nothing, yeah
I get worked up and they get worked up
And we get worked up for what?

Calm down, calm down
Calm down, oh, calm down

Is this the way it is for other people?
I wonder if they feel it like I do
I know there is more love than than there is evil
A war is just a waste of me and you

And it kills me 'cause I get worked up and you get worked up
And we get worked up for nothing
I get worked up and they get worked up
And we get worked up for what?

Calm down, calm down
Calm down, oh, calm down
Oh, calm down
Calm down, oh, calm down
Oh, calm down

Time to figure it out, when people living in doubt
Brother, look further, take care of each other
Stressing over, about if you need it, then you can shout
My sister, look further, yeah, you're the preserver
Time to figure it out, when people living in doubt
I get worked up and you get worked up and
Stressing over, about if you need it, then you can shout
We get worked up for what?

Calm down, calm down
Calm down, oh, calm down
Oh, calm down
Calm down, calm down
Oh, calm down
Calm down, calm down (Oh, my brother, sister, my mother)
Calm down, oh, calm down (Got to get together, oh, calm down)
Oh, calm down
