You crawled into my bed
Like a cockroach
The things you said
Made me lose my head
Like a waterfall
You've got a mouth
Like a DC ten
But I love you

You've got me in your arms
And your special charms
My yeah ah yeah
You got my head in circles
Uh, loved ya
But I don't want nobody but you

You fucking laugh at my inolations
You made a fuss 'bout my eating purse
By my mothers's side
You feel away like a sherman tank
But I love you

You're gonna take me there
I don't really care
My yah ah yah
You got my head in circles
Uh, loved ya
I don't want nobody but you

Turn you on to me to bring your Mama
The way she freaks gives me the creeps
She's a mainline ma'am
You've got to know
what you're doin' to your Daddy
'Cos I love you
You've got me in your arms
Ooh your precious charms
Ah yeah ah yeah

You got my head in circles
Uh, loved ya
I don't want nobody but you
