(This is...)
(This is...)
Ha ha ha ha
Yeah, I know what this is
Listen
Yo, Joe, I tell them girls like this...

I say my love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on
My love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on
My love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on

Yo, Joe, talk to 'em
(Ow)
Listen
Yeah

My love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on
My love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on tonight
Mmm

Look, I gotta get this money, girl
You know I gotta get this stolen
'Cause I can't take us living out here strugglin' no more
(No more)
(No more)
Hoo

Listen, baby
Your ears and your neck gotta glisten, baby
And this is crazy
But this the way it's gotta be
Baby, you're a queen
Plus I ain't fit to be a man
So the plan for me
It's to get the cheese
By any means
Listen to me

[Chorus]
Every thing's gonna be all right
So relax yourself, baby
Please cycle down
Relax yourself
Please cycle down

(It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice now
Said, it ain't nottin' nice now
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice now)

And when we make it
I'm gonna fly you to the moon and back
Visit the stars
Yes, you are
(You are)
So beautiful to me
Beautiful as can be
Good God sent you to me
You're and angel
And I hope these streets don't take me
Down the wrong road we gonna make it
Trust in love 'cause it's amazing
Yes, it is
So please
Just trust in me
Listen to me, girl

[Chorus]

It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice now
Said, it ain't nottin' nice now
It ain't nottin' nice
(Listen, I said)
It ain't nottin' nice
(It ain't nottin' nice)
It ain't nottin' nice now

My love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on
My love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on
My love's the bomb
Girl, you gotta put me on
My love's the bomb
Listen
Listen

I got one hand in the pot
Other holding you tight
This life, girl
You know it ain't right
But we livin' it
Something we're fighting for
You know it ain't nice
It's why the chrome keep it
Nice for me killin-ish
I do it for us
I pray the Lord forgive it-ish
One day we be out the hood
God willin' it

It ain't nottin' nice
It ain't nottin' nice
(Say what?)
(I said, it ain't nottin' nice)
It ain't nottin' nice now
(It ain't nottin' nice)
Said it ain't nottin' nice now
(Wooo)
