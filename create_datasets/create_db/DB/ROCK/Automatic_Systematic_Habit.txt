The lies lies lies
You love those lies,
You tell them straight,
Straight to my face
They feel so right
They keep you safe
And you're so...

Good at it, oh it comes automatic
Lies more lies
I can tell they're lies
I can see right through,
You have see-through eyes

Knocked down like a?
This time I won't be your dirty little secret
Not for you, not for me, not for your other lover
I won't be your dirty little secret

Oh a man like you
Keep me up at night
You want your women at home
And your bed on the side
You've got a telephone girl that you carry around
In your jean back pocket with a?
And you're so...

Sly about it, oh it feels automatic
Yeah, you're so good at it
Oh it feels automatic
Sly about it, oh it feels automatic
Yeah, you're so good at it
A systematic habit

Knocked down like a?
This time I won't be your dirty little secret
Tell mother, tell your father, tell your friends, tell your teacher
I won't be your dirty little secret
I won't be your dirty little secret

Automatic systematic habit x10

Knocked down like a?
This time I won't be your dirty little secret
Not for you, not for me, not for your other lover
I won't be your dirty little secret
I won't be your dirty little secret

Knocked down like a?
This time I won't be your dirty little secret
Tell your mother, tell your brother, tell your friends, tell your teacher
I won't be your dirty little secret
I won't be your dirty little secret
I won't be, I won't
I won't be, I won't
I won't, I won't
I won't be knocked down
