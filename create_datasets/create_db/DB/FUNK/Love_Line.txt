Beaten down to an inch of my life by ignorant people
Came close to making me believe I was nothing but evil
No one has the authority to tell us who we give our life to
You have the right to be loved
By everyone who's willing to love you

They say blood is thicker than water
I say love is thicker than blood
They say blood is thicker than water
I say love is thicker than blood 'cause
You and I are bound by a love line
By a love line you and I
You and I are bound by a love line
By a love line you and I
Are bound by love line

It's what you find out for yourself and not what you're fed
It's what you feel down in your heart and not put in your head
Everyday I pour myself into you hoping that in time
You'll pour yourself back into me
Solidly this love line

They say blood is thicker than water
I say love is thicker than blood
They say blood is thicker than water
I say love is thicker than blood 'cause
You and I are bound by a love line
By a love line you and I
You and I are bound by a love line
By a love line you and I
You and I are bound by a love line
By a love line you and I
You and I are bound by a love line
By a love line

We'll walk together down this love line
I'll keep you safe and sound on this love line (I'll keep you safe and sound on this love line)
Don't ever doubt the power of this love line (Don't ever doubt the power of this love line)
We are bound to be free on this love line 

Ooh you and I are bound by a love line
