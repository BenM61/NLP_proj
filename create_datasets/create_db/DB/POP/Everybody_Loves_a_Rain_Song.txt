I heard about it raining on a Georgia night 
Never saw clearly in the morning light 
I was walkin', just walkin' in the rain 

She was a rainy day woman 
She made me love her 
Took my soul and I soon discovered 
I was searchin', searchin' for rainbows 

Everybody loves a rain song 
Cause everybody's been rained on 
It's like a shoulder you can lean on 
One time or another 
Stormy weather 

Everybody loves a rainbow 
From San Francisco to Chicago 
And no matter where I go 
It's still raining in my heart 

So play me a song 
Just for a feeling 
Cause it's the only thing 
That keeps you warm 
When your memories get too cloudy to see 

So rain me back home 

Oh, I was walkin', just walkin' in the rain

She was a rainy day woman 
She made me love her 
Took my soul and I soon discovered 
I was searchin', searchin' for rainbows 

Everybody loves a rain song 
Cause everybody's been rained on 
It's like a shoulder you can lean on 
One time or another 
Stormy weather 

Everybody loves a rainbow 
From San Francisco to Chicago 
And no matter where I go 
It's still raining in my heart 

Everybody loves a rain song 
Cause everybody's been rained on 
It's like a shoulder you can lean on 
One time or another 
Stormy weather 

Everybody loves a rainbow 
From San Francisco to Chicago 
And no matter where I go 
It's still raining in my heart
