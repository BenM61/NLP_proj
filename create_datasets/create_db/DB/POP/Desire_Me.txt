Desire me, desire me
As I desire you
Desire me and want me
That's all I'll ever ask of life
That you will someday come to me
And say that you love me as I love you

Hm, desire me, and tell me
That you are mine and mine alone
Desire me, and love me
And be the queen upon my throne
For I will always worship you
No matter where you go or what you do

Hm, there comes a time in the life of every boy
When one and only one girl will do
So now the time has come 
And I know that you're the one
And all that I will ever want is you, so

Desire me, desire me
That's all I'll ever ask of you
Desire me, and love me
And tell me that you want me too
For nothing else will matter in the world
As long as I am close to you
