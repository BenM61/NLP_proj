Jenny, it's alright
Somebody loves you tonight
Tomorrow we'll make a start
Smoke all them cigarettes

You are the star that sits in the sky
The fire that burns when the battle is high
The feeling that yearns when the yearning is all
In his heart, yeah, in his heart, yeah, in his heart

I know you wanna get away
I know nothing ever stays the same
Jenny, I've been thinking things over
I know thinking never got me far

The bottle gets me further
So come stand a little closer now
We'll try breaking the ice again
We'll try breaking the ice again

You were the first one
You were the first to try
And baby, you stole me
And maybe I needed that

You are the star that sits in the sky
The fire that burns when the battle is high
The feeling that yearns when the yearning is all
In my heart, yeah, in my heart, yeah, in my heart

I know you wanna get away
I know nothing ever stays the same
Jenny, I've been thinking things over
You said thinking never got you far

Bottle gets you further
So come stand a little closer now
We'll try breaking the ice again
We'll try breaking the ice again

We'll try breaking the ice again
We'll try breaking the ice again
We'll try breaking the ice again
We'll try breaking the ice again
Breaking the ice again
