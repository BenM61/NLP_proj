Days are growing shorter
The night is closing in
Time is so much older
And hope is getting thin

We seem quite content believing
Nothing can go wrong
So we go on
We go on

Lost in some euphoria
We dream our lives away
Certain that tomorrow
Will be better than today

We seem quite content
To do exactly as we please
Let it set our minds at ease
And we go on

So we look to the miracle of love
So we look to the miracle of love

Truth is our deception
And pleasure is our friend
Just around the rainbow
Lies a treasure at it's end

Could it be that what we seek
Is all within our hands?
Only no one understands
And we go on

So we look to the miracle of love
So we look to the miracle of love

Panic screams for order
But no one hears the cry
Film is on the water
Hate is in the sky

Organized confusion
Is working out it's plan
Though we try to stop it
It spreads throughout the land

And we who understand it all
Do nothing more than say
That there is no other way
And we go on

Will we look to the miracle of love?
Still we look to the miracle of love

Will we look to the miracle of love?
Still we look to the miracle of love

Will we look to the Miracle of Love?
Still we look to the miracle of Love.

Will we look to the miracle of love?
Still we look to the miracle of love

Will we look to the miracle of love?
Still we look to the miracle of love
