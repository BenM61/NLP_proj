Here we go with another one
Cold for the winter
Keep it hot when the summer comes yeah
And it's all when the summer's done
But we all gotta represent him dawg cause the summers
done
Nope, we ain't slaves no more
We don't follow our sinful ways no more
You don't see us in the purple haze no more
Them days no more, them ways no more
Folks was looking at me like I'm crazy
Yep that's my name, that's the way God made me
Get your word out if you're a spiritual baby
And open up the book so you can roll in the day with me

Beyond belief!
Hey get your hands up high
Get 'em in the air try to touch that sky
Y'all know we gon' rep the most high
Yeah, we gon' rep the most high
Go ahead get low
Get ya hands down
Try to touch that floor
Y'all know that's the way that we roll
Yeah, that's the way that we roll

Hey I hope this works
There's more to life in Christ than just church
God made Adam by breathing into the dirt
Then we all sin and fallen into the curse but
You think you got it, to get it, you gotta live it dawg
You gotta read it, believe it, then go and get it dawg
Spit it how you live it
If you got it, you can give it
But I never seen a lazy boy grow
And I know a couple of 'em
Who be sayin'
That they love him
But they never really get out there and go
So back to the fact
That we out to relax
And say: hey, I'm saved
No need for me to act
Instead of growing in Christ
And learning to reenact
That lifestyle he lived
I'm like homey you seeing that?

Beyond belief!
