Aaah

The information is laughing at us
The ticker tape feeds the night
Looking for a lost transmission
A heaven that we left behind

When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
High rise eyes see through you

Say hello to a mannequin
The ghost of an automaton
The witching hour is summoning up
Armies where they don't belong

When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
High rise eyes see through you

She's the sister of avarice
The wife of a poisonous tide
She's the eye of a battle of storms
That sees where the atoms collide

When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
Highrise eyes see through you
