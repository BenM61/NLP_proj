Wish that I could come
With the mornin' sun
Shinin' through your window
I could be the one

To open up your day
Ooh, words can't begin to say
Feelings that are hidden in
In such a special way
And they're just for me and you.

Nighttime comes searhin' blindly
Been needin' some lovin'
I find me followin' my heart
Back to you

Ooh, how it reminds me
That I need no other lover
This feelin' is like no other
And though I can't be with you now

Let this song be another one
That's just for me and you.

So let my heart go on a-singin'
Let my song go on a-bringin'
To you lovin' that you know
Is in my heart and clingin'

To days that passed on by
Need we stop, though, to wonder why
You know I love you, baby
The tears in my eyes are
Just for me and you.
