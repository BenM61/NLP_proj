Over the railway lines
Under the bridge where we met first time
I'm comin' across town
Walkin' to your house

Yesterday weighs you down
Oh, lonely girl, won't you come on out?
I swear, it'll be alright
On this holy night

Put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Say goodnight to your sister
We're gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leavin'
In St.George's bay

And when I look into your eyes
There's one thing that I can say
No one loves you this way
So put on your red dress baby
And one more time let me see you smile
See you smile tonight

There's the abandoned train
Where we sheltered from the rain
Somehow I knew someday
We'd come here again

Put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Say goodnight to your sister
We're gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leavin'
In St.George's bay

And when I look into your eyes
There's one thing that I can say
No one loves you this way
So put on your red dress baby
And one more time let me see you smile

See the candles burnin' on the Saturday night over rainy town
All over rainy town, see them smile tonight

Here on this empty road
We stare at ourselves in a shop window
Funny we seem so right
On this holy night

So put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Close the door right behind you
Gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leaving
In St.George's bay

And recall the tenderness
As we sit by the waterside
Oh, I can never forget
That I was the man who let you
Slip out of his life
So put on your red dress, baby
And let me one more time
Make you smile tonight

See the candles burnin' on the Saturday night
Oh, see the candles burnin' on the Saturday night

Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile
Put on your red dress
Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile
Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile
