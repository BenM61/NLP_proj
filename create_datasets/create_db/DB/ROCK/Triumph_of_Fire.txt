Fall with me, the condemned to be
The heavens bleed, a sight to see
The pleasures of pain, before this night
My dark and hateful
Entity

To see them scream
To stand the suffering
The shattering of their dreams
Hail him our majesty

Ignite the fires
Blaze the skies
Stain their souls
God is dethroned

Lies, spit unto your
Mind, of the fallen
Death, we will see who conquers who

Chaos, the wind whispers
Order, enslaved by the
Trance, you will do what your new god has told you to

Kill, life
Cold, void
Rise, in Anger
Greet the gates

I have seen the shades of shadows The tales of past
The triumph of fire

Of fire
Shall rise
Come summon
The horned one

I have seen the shades of shadows
The tales of past
The triumph of fire

I will see the dead and wasted land
Hang the whore that provoked the autumn storm
What will be, the slave of night
Will cry for my black destiny

To death, to pain, the hungry, flames of eternity
