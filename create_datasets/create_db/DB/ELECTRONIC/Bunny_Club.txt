Call me a fake sir
You can call me a fraud
You can spit on my french knickers
You can call me a whore

If you
Roll in, roll out, roll up to the bunny club
You'll have the
Ride of your life underneath these
Pink fluorescent lights
And I hope that you
Roll in, roll out, roll up to the bunny club
You'll have the
Ride of your life underneath these
Pink fluorescent lights 

And I hope that theres
No love lost
There
'No sir. there is no love left in here"
Just oh. just wander in
There's no love lost
Knots in her hair
And all lines
All lines are stripped bare
Just oh just wander in
There's no love lost

Finger my pigtails as you
Deal me some cards
As you tell me what the sunset looks like
From your brothers backyard

But you see 
With me they take one look and they run
I've got a dog and a gun
And I am living in London now
Living in London

So

Roll in, roll out, roll up to the bunny club
You'll have the
Ride of your life underneath these
Pink fluorescent lights
And I hope that you
Roll in, roll out, roll up to the bunny club
You'll have the
Ride of your life underneath these
Pink fluorescent lights

And I hope that there's
No love lost
There
"No sir there is no love left in here"
Just oh. just wander in
There's no love lost
Knots in her hair
And all lines
All lines are stripped bare
Just oh. just wander in
There's no love lost

Call me your princess as you
Do me a line
As your searching for my savior
At the bottom of a packet of tobacco

With me they take one look and they run
I've got a dog and a gun
And I am living in London now
Living in London

So

Roll in, roll out, roll up to the bunny club
You'll have the
Ride of your life underneath these
Pink fluorescent lights
And I hope that you
Roll in, roll out, roll up to the bunny club
You'll have the
Ride of your life underneath these
Pink fluorescent lights

And I hope that there's
No love lost
There
"No sir there is no love left in here"
Just oh. just wander in
There's no love lost
Knots in her hair
And all lines
All lines are stripped bare
Just oh. just wander in
There's no love lost

You see 
With me they take one look and they run
I've got a dog and a gun
And I'm living in London now
