You come around my door just about midnight
Well I can't say no to somethin' feels so right
I don't care who knows or who sees
I just want to feel you wrapped around me
On my bed, on the floor
All the time she's screamin' more, more, more! 

Scratch my back
Givin' me a heart attack
Scratch my back
Givin' me a heart attack

Girl you're gettin' under my skin
You know that's when the fun begins
Do you want to be my under cover lover
You know that one good turn deserves another
So I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine
When we're through we'll both feel fine 

Scratch my back
Givin' me a heart attack
Scratch my back
Givin' me a heart attack 

Come around my door just about midnight
You make me feel so good you know you make me feel just right
Just right!
I don't care who knows or who sees
I just want to feel you wrapped around me
On my bed, on the floor
All the time she's screamin' more, more more! 

Scratch my back
Givin' me a heart attack
Scratch my back
Givin' me a heart attack 

Scratch my back givin' me a heart attack
Whatcha doin' whatcha doin' to me
Scratch my back givin' me a heart attack
I don't know but it sure feels good
Scratch my back givin' me a heart attack
Whatcha doin' whatcha doin' to me
Scratch my back givin' me a heart attack
Scratch my back givin' me a heart attack
And baby, you know what I like!
