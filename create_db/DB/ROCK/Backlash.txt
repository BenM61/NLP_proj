I had it made, I never strayed
From a course that somebody else laid
I clenched my fists, I never miss
One night (one night) you find that ya can't turn back
So it's goodbye to the past
Here it comes, here it comes feel it comin'
Backlash, backlash, backlash
Oh yea, it's too bad now it's a backlash
Your time ain't long you don't belong
Maybe so but you hope that they're wrong
Thin skin gets thick it happens quick
Like a baby turn her very first trick
Hold tight (hold tight) hold tight for the ride of your life
And the lovers go by so fast
Here it comes, here it comes feel it comin'
Backlash, backlash, backlash
Used to love me used to care (do you care?) used to want me
Here it comes, here it comes I guess that's fair
Now, do you love me, do you care, do you want me
One night (one night) we find we're outta, outta time
Here it comes, here it comes here it comes a see'mon
Backlash, backlash, backlash
