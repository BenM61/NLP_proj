The galaxy is open 
So paint me on your right hand 
Now let's fly off Superman style 
You know it would be so good 
I'd never look back 
With every bit of breath I take 
My thoughts say I want you 
And there is nothing I can do 
To control these natural instincts 
If you're ready we can take it to the heights 

And the Air We Breathe will take us 
The Air We Breathe 
And no, the loneliness won't break us 
Coz I know all we need 
Is the Air We Breathe 
The Air We Breathe 

Apollo's turned and twisted 
(oh my god) 
As you take me in your arms tonight 
(take me in your arms tonight) 
Oh, it feels so quiet 
In turbulent times 
(tur-bu-lent times) 

Well I, I think I'll build a stairway 
And like a Roman in your heart 
I will climb and we can start 
To journey on past all these satin sheets 
And lift it past all of our control 

And the Air We Breathe will take us 
The Air We Breathe 
You know the loneliness won't break us 
Coz I know all we need 
Is the Air We Breathe 
The Air We Breathe 

Look up to the sky 
Ask yourself why 
Coz this enchanted evening 
wouldn't get you any higher 
Will the colours fade 
On all the crimson hearts we made 
Broken them before 
So it's time to take a flyer 

(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(breathe it in, breathe it out) 

And the Air We Breathe will take us 
The Air We Breathe 
And no, the loneliness won't break us, no 
Coz I know all we need 
Is the Air We Breathe 

(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(breathe it in, breathe it out) 

The Air We Breathe 

(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(breathe it in, breathe it out) 

And the Air We Breathe will take us 

(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(breathe it in, breathe it out) 

The air we breathe 
And no, the loneliness won't break us 
Coz I know all we need 
Is the air we breathe 

(breathe it in, breathe it out) 
(repeat to fade)
(repeat to fade)

Is the air we breathe 

And the Air We Breathe will take us...
