It takes a minute to photograph
Pays her money well spoken class lost son
Cleverly thieves the fun
Cleverly leaves the sun
Girl with black guns lion's odours
He sees faces in the skies
Girl with black guns lion's odours
He sees faces in disguises

He lays an infinite holograph
Days are sunny swell-open grass lost sun
Heavenly bleeds the sun
Heavy the beads of sun
Girl with black guns lion's odours
He sees faces in the skies
Girl with black guns lion's odours
He sees faces in disguises
Please leave me soulful sunshine

The million bright ambassadors of morning
The million bright ambassadors are dawning
(May mourn lasso the same in my dream)
(She left the air in my dreams)

As she waves
Imitate
Better days
As she's watching the watcher
Slowly sighs
Be aware
Leather eyes
Slowly questions the piper
As she waves
Imitate
Better days high
Slowly sighs
Be aware
Leather eyes fly!
As she waves
Imitate
Better days high
Slowly sighs
Be aware
Leather eyes fly!

Underneath
Ripening
Wandering
Under nervously thunder
Marigolds
Slow and sweet
On retreat
Marry me I see trembles
Underneath
Ripening
Wandering sky
Marigolds
Slow and sweet
On retreat why?
Underneath
Ripening
Wandering sky
Marigolds
Slow and sweet
On retreat why?

The million bright ambassadors of morning
The million bright ambassadors are dawning
(May mourn lasso the same in my dream)
(She left the air in my dreams)
