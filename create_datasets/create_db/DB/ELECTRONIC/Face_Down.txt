Face down - to the ground
I'm walking away, towards my goal
So far, so

Eyes towards the son, I hear i listen
Ever so slow, I'll take a chance

Victory, I won't let that wheeler-dealer
Follow me, time runs out
Authority, I can't let those interferers
Pull me down, get one up (on me)

Face down to the ground, 
Who's laughing now?
Never say never , 
I'm hearing you say
Take it or leave it, 
I carry the key

Chorus

Break

Chorus

Face down to the ground, 
I'm walking away
Ever so slowly
Ever so slowly
