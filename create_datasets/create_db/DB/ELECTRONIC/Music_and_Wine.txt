Valentine
Hard to find
Love is blind
Acquaintances can be unkind
State of mind
Show a sign
Hope divine
Just making love to pass the time
Used to get high just to pass the time
Music and wine were the only friends of mine
Used to make love just to have a laugh
Music and wine were the only friends I had (here's that lovin' 2x)
Bitter break
Hard to take
Hearts'll ache
This loneliness is hard to face
Hollow soul
Freezing cold
Feelin' older
And poverty will take it's toll
Used to get high just to pass the time
Music and wine were the only friends of mine
Used to make love just to have a laugh
Music and wine were the only friends I had (here's that lovin' 2x)
Gin and lime
Summertime
Starry nights
And memories of better times
Ocean breeze
Wind in leaves
Waking dream
Alive with possibility
Here's that lovin' here's that lovin'
This love's for real that lovin' here's that lovin'
