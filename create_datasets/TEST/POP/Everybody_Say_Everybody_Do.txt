It would be good just think about it
To think aloud sometimes let it go
God knows we've got it all, God knows, let's get ourselves together
Everybody say, everybody do, we've got so much to shout about
Everybody say, everybody do, let it in and let it out
You can fly, in your mother's eyes
Just look at me now
No compromise, no doubt about it
So don't keep it in just let it hang out
God knows we've got it all, God knows, let's get ourselves together
Everybody say, everybody do, we've got so much to shout about
Everybody say, everybody do, let it in and let it out
You can fly, in your mother's eyes
Just look at me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To think aloud and let it go
Everybody say, everybody do, we've got so much to shout about
Everybody Say, everybody do, let it in and let it out
Everybody Say, everybody do, we've got so much to shout about
Everybody say, everybody do, let it in and let it out
