I want you 
To understand, ooh baby 
I've been waiting so long 

Now I want 
You to know, ooh baby 
Exactly how I feel 

Tell me, tell me baby 
Tell me, if you'll be my love 
Tell me, tell me baby 
Tell me, if I'm strong enough 
Strong enough to be the only one 

Still believing 
Still I'm grieving 
I wrote so many love letters 
But you never wrote at all 

I've been waiting 
Anticipating 
That you will get in touch with me 
And dance the night away 

Let me hear you say 
Call me 
Hold me. Uh-uh-uh-yeah 

There must be 
Someone else 
Who wants this heart of mine 

Tell me, tell me baby 
Tell me, if you'll be my love 
Tell me, tell me baby 
Tell me, if I'm strong enough 
Strong enough to be the only one 

I want your lovin' 
I want your lovin' now 
I want your love 
I want your lovin' now 

I want your love 
I want your lovin' 
I want your love 
I want your lovin' 

Still believing 
Still I'm grieving 
I wrote so many love letters 
But you never wrote at all 

I've been waiting 
Anticipating 
That you will get in touch with me 
And dance the night away
