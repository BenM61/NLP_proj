We got to have peace
To keep the world alive
And war to cease

We got to have joy
True in our hearts
With strength we can't destroy

People hear us
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice

We're begging to save the children
The little ones
Who just don't understand

Give them a chance
To breed their young
And help purify the land

People hear us
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice

And the people in our neighborhood
They would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land

Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

He'd say, "We got to have peace
To keep the world alive
And war to cease

We got to have joy
True in our hearts
With strength we can't destroy

People hear us
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice

And the people in our neighborhood
They would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land

Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

We got to have peace
We got to have peace
Let the world know

Peace, peace, peace
We got to have peace

People hear us
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice

Save the children
Save the children
Save the children

And the people in our neighborhood
Who would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land

Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

We got to have peace
We got to have peace

Let the people singin'
Peace, peace, peace
We got to have peace

I sing peace, peace, peace
We got to have peace
Peace, peace, peace
We got to have peace
