A coyote ran across the road
On the move without a home
A flash of light reminded me of you

This could well be your last stand
Hold the sunlight in your hand
Spread your fingers
Feel the sand fall through

I've done all I can do, now it's up to you...

You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, and maybe
Time, baby, is catching up with you

Shadow men talk a real good game 
Every punch line has your name
You cried out and no one came to you

I've done all I can do, now it's up to you...

You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, and maybe
Time, baby, is catching up with you

Should be more to learn from this 
Can't say I know what it is
No difference 'tween a hit or miss, it's true

I've done all I can do, now it's up to you...

You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, and maybe
Time, baby, is catching up with you
