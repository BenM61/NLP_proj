It's because I love you
Not because we're far apart
It's because I love you
And because your near my heart
It's because I miss you
Oh how long it seems to be
It's because I miss you
Thoughts of you come back to me

Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah

Once we walked together 
From the field up to the hill
Promised love forever
I remember that is still
It's because I love 
I'll come home to you one day
It's because I love you
In my thoughts you'll always stay

Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
Do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be yeah
