You came in from the darkness and held the door open wide
You stood there like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I believe in what I see and also what I hear
But did the night play tricks on me or were you really there.

Am I being hypnotised
Feeling like I'm hypnotised
Am I being hypnotised
Feeling like I'm hypnotised

Fear has gripped my heart and I am whispering out your name
Can you hear the silence screaming do they sound the same

Am I being hypnotised
Feeling like I'm hypnotised
Am I being hypnotised
Feeling like I'm hypnotised

Am I being hypnotised
Feeling like I'm hypnotised
Am I being hypnotised
Feeling like I'm hypnotised

Am I being hypnotised
Feeling like I'm hypnotised
Am I being hypnotised
