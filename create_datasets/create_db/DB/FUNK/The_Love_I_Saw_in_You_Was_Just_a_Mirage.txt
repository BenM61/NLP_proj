There you were beautiful
The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on with untrue kisses
You held me captured in your false embrace

Quicker than I could bat an eye
Seems you were telling me goodbye
Just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartache's camouflage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

You promised that happiness we'll ever share
But all I have are memories of love that was never there

We used to meet in romantic places
You gave the illusion that your love was real
Now all that's left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel

And now our meeting you avoid
And so my world you have destroyed
Just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
The way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

You brought me up just to throw me down
you love me and my dreams shattered all on your ground

You only filled me with despair
By showing love that wasn't there
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

To you I gave true love from deep within
You made me hungry for your love
When it was not deeper than your skin

Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into, into something I should have dodged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
