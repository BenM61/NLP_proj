I know I ain't the first to tell ya
I sure bet I won't be the last
I know your in a hurry baby
So let me make this fast

[Chorus]
I got a lotta money
I don't wanna spend it on me
I like pretty things
You're just as pretty as you can be

So if you ain't busy later
And you want some company
I ain't trying to be a hater
I'm the one, the one, the one you wanna see

Look around you baby
You know you've seen it all before
Every nickel in this club lookin' for a dime
Nothing less nothing more

Too tall to be talked down to
To over it to be put under
Any spell a blind fisherman could cast
That's why I came like thunder to tell you

[Chorus]

You don't need to fix your hair
For somebody you don't care for
You don't need to shave your legs
If it ain't me that's knocking at your door
I know you ain't a concubine
I know you ain't a one night stand
I don't wanna waste your time
If you wanna get creamy
I'm the one you wanna see

Oh the one you wanna see baby
Oh the one you wanna see
I'm the one you wanna see
[repeat]

Coming on you like thunder
I'm the one you wanna see
