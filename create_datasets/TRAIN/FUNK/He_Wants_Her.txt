He's a tom cat, a stallion
After a lusty mare
She kicks and bolts
With love big eyes
He just hangs on in there

He wants her, and it's simple man
He wants her, cause she's his kind
He wants her, he wants her, he wants her

He's a rat, a fighter
They're a match
What he wants he means to get
You better understand

And he want her, to bear his child
He wants her to love her man
He wants her, he wants her, he wants her

He wants to be a lion to her lamb
You know he means to love her all he can
He want to be a lion to her lamb
You know he means to love her all he can
He wants her, he wants her, he wants her

He's a fox, a rooster
After a broodin' hen
Watch out ma'am he says you can't
Rough on this male man

He wants her, with all her frills
He wants her, to give him thrills,
He wants her, he wants her, he wants her, he wants her
