The great depression everyone is in depression
No one knows exactly what's their role
Totally confused, depressed 'cause of the news
Watch TV, more bad is what you see

Everyone's lost and were looking for a savior
Everyone's blind and were looking for a leader
We've lost our faith so we need someone to guide us
Right now, it's so easy to be deceived

I'm climbing my soul to reach to newer levels
Reach the mountain top so I can better see
Step back and see the whole mighty picture
Gain control of my destiny

I'm climbing my soul so I can picture a solution
'Cause once I picture this it can be
I cannot leave my life within this uncertainty
I call on the red, and the black and green
And the black and the green

United we stand, united we fall
United we plan as a united front
United we stand, united we fall
United we plan as a united front

I walk the streets and try to pass energy
Put the gun down, black man give me a pound
Save those rounds for a real confrontation
Understand who you are as a man

Everyone's lost and were looking for a savior
Everyone's blind and were looking for a leader
We've lost our faith and we need someone to guide us
Right now, it's so easy to be deceived

I'm climbing my soul to reach to newer levels
Reach the mountain top so I can better see
Step back and see the whole mighty picture
Gain control of my destiny

I'm climbing my soul so I can picture a solution
'Cause once I picture this it can be
I cannot leave my life within this uncertainty
I call on the red and the black and green
And the black and the green

United we stand, united we fall
United we plan as a united front
United we stand, united we fall
United we plan as a united front

United we stand, united we fall
United we plan as a united front
United we stand, united we fall
United we plan as a united front
