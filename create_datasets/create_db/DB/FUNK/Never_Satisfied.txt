Starts from the back of your head
Shifts to the front of your head because of the vibrations

Ain't got no girl to kiss on, what I got
Ain't got no face to sit on, what I got
Ain't got no star to wish on, what I got

I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied until it ends in tears

I've gotta have more and more, what I got
That's what they make money for, what I got
I sold my soul like a whore, what I got

I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied until it ends in tears
No, I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied until it ends in fire

The world spins round and round and round
My life's in pieces on the ground
Some hearts just can't be bound, no
I feel like I'm going to drown

I got no hopes, no dreams, what I got
I've got no ways and means, what I got
What I have is this scheme, that's what I got

Well, I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied until it ends in tears
No, I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied until it ends in tears
No, I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied until it ends in tears
No, I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied until it ends
