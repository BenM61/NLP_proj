I should have known you didn't have the time my dear 
To let this twenty something bring you down with his list of fears

It's just my inability to think outside the box I know! 

She was signed, sealed and lost in the post, 
Gone where all the letters we write to Santa go 
(Go to Santa go!) 

I could see your interest wane my dear

Yes we've had some spills shall I say 
And I thought you were going to leave, but not that you'd evaporate 

She was signed, sealed and lost in the post, 
Gone where all the letters we write to Santa go 
(Go to Santa go!) 

Please go to Santa go to Santa go go go

She was signed, sealed and lost in the post, 
Gone where all the letters we write to Santa go 
(Go to Santa Go!)
