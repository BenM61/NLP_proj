Native these words seem to me
All speech directed to me
I've heard them once before
I know that feeling

Stranger emotions in mind
Changing the contours I find
I've seen them once before
Someone cries to me


O O O O
The look and the sound of the voice
O O O O 
They try, they try
O O O O
The shape and the power of the voice
O O O O
In strong low tones

Forceful and twisting again
Wasting the perfect remains
I've felt it once before
Slipping over me


Sweetly the voices decay
Draw on the lines that they say
I'd lost it once before
Now it cries to me
