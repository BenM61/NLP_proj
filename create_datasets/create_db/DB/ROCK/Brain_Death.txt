You lie deathly still
In your hospital bed
Soon to go under the knife
The white walls are gleaming
The smell is so clean
You shiver in fear for your life
Uneasy with your surroundings
You wonder if you'll get out alive
The doctors walk in
And he smiles at you
Your sergery is scheduled for five

Help me
Save me
As I take my last breath
From these
Madmen
Licensed to give death

Watching the clock
As the hour draws near
Nervousness making you sweat
Now comes the time
And you're given a shoot
You wonder if that's all you'll get
You are wheeled into
The room where you'll die
A thought that is morbid but true
The last thing you see
As you're slipping away
Is the scalpel they're sticking in you

Help me
Save me
As I take my last breath
From these
Madmen
Licensed to give death

Safe from the monster
Safe from it all
You watch but you no longer pain
The body you've left
Is a pile of guts
It's obvious that they're insane
And as your spirit
Is leaving this plane
You know that they cannot be stopped
The practice you thrive
The deaths will continue
And what they don't eat just will rot

Help me
Save me
As I take my last breath
From these
Madmen
Licensed to give death
