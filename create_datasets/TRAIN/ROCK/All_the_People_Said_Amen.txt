You are not alone, if you are lonely
When you feeling frail, you're not the only
We are all the same, in need of mercy, to be forgiven and be free
It's all you got to lean on but thank God it's all you need

And all the people said Amen
And all the people said Amen
Give thanks to the Lord for His love never ends
And all the people said Amen

If your rich or poor, well it don't matter
Weak or strong, we know love is what we're after
We're all broken but we're all in this together
God knows we stumble and fall
And he so loved the world he sent His Son to save us all

And all the people said Amen
And all the people said Amen
Give thanks to the Lord for His love never ends
And all the people said Amen

Blessed are the poor in spirit 
Who are torn apart
Blessed are the prosecuted and the pure in heart
Blessed are the people longing for another start
For this is the Kingdom
The Kingdom of God

And all the people said Amen
And all the people said Amen
Give thanks to the Lord for His love never ends
And all the people said Amen

And all the people said Amen
And all the people said Amen
Give thanks to the Lord for His love never ends
And all the people said Amen
And all the people said Amen
