You can call me the sheik of tomorrow
Sleeping on the burning sand
You can call me the king of the cowboys
'Cause everybody shakes my hand
You can call me the soft shoe banana
You can peel away my skin
You can call me The Last of The Teenage Idols

You can hang me in the morning
Sell my ball and chain
You can sink me in the ocean
And I'll swim back home again
You can make love to my secretary
You can steal my money too
You can call me the last of the big time spenders..aahh

Grab your partners come inside. Outside there's no place to hide
Tell your story to the man next door. He has heard it many times before
Stayin' out late to play that thing. Ah, do that diddy dah dah a ding ding ding
Hold my hand, here we go, come on baby don't be slow

'Cause I'm The Last of the Teenage Idols!
The Last of the Teenage Idols!

Sixteen ducks, only one drake
All flocked together in the middle of the lake
They all had boats and row-a-thon
A big sand castle at the bottom of the moat
Rock three, who, me?
I wouldn't be at all surprised
Hold tight, all night, keeping me satisfied

A big fat mama on her hands and knees
Cryin' out baby, baby please, please, please
I gotta keep going. I can't keep still
I gotta get to the top of the hill
Ok, Alright, I wanna stay out late tonight
Hold my hand, don't be slow
Come on baby here we go

I'm the Last of the Teenage Idols
The Last of the Teenage Idols
The Last of the Teenage Idols
Last of the Teenage Idols
I'm the Last of the Teenage Idols
The Last
