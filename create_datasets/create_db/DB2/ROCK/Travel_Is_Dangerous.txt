Who might know of this
The notes we left
Our final thoughts
And we knew they'd get ours out

Sink
Sink

Drowned by our country
Old machine, is cursed
And forgotten
Never surface again

The air runs out
The captain is first
So we take to memories
And layers of clothes
Up there the family waits
And outside we heard hammers
Noises sound like the end
And we will never see them

Sink
Sink

Drowned by her country
Failed machine is cursed
Old and rotten
Never surface again
