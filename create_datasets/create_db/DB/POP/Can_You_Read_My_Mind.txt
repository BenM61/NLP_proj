Can you read my mind?
Do you know what it is you do to me?
Don't know who you are
Just a friend from another star.

Here I am, like a kid at the school
Holding hands with a god or a fool
Will you look at me, quivering,
Like a little girl, shivering,
You can see right through me.

Can you read my mind?
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?
Wondering why you are
All the wonderful things you are.
You can fly, you belong to the sky
You and I could belong to each other.

If you need a friend,
I'm the one to fly too
If you need, to be loved
Here I am, 
Read my mind!
