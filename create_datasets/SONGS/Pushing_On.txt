Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my, riding high
Till my, riding high

Till my dying day I will give it all away
I'll be pushing on
Till the rivers run dry I've got to try, try, try
I'll keep pushing on
When my soles wear through I won't be feeling blue
I'll keep pushing on (pushing on)
Till the rivers run dry I've got to try, try, try
I'll keep pushing on (pushing on, push, pushing on)

Till my (pushing on)
Till my (pushing on)
Till my (pushing on)
Till my (pushing on)

Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my (pushing on)
(Pushing on, pushing on)
(Pushing on, pushing on)
(Pushing on, pushing on)

(Pushing on) till my soles wear through I won't be feeling blue
I'll keep pushing on (pushing on)
Till the rivers run dry I've got to try, try, try
I'll keep pushing on (pushing on, push, pushing on)

Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
Till my stone cold grave I'll be pushing on
Till my blood runs dry I'll be riding high
