I knew Mary when she was a baby
One little girl and one big little man
Five years younger, she cried like the thunder
I watched her reach ten and never saw her again
From one boys home to one prison cell
Mary I've known this world's bitter hell
But come this winter I'll see my parole
And watch the heads turn, down the aisle we stroll

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
Your mama used to come here, she don't come no more
But she left a picture of you at seventeen
And every day since then, Mary you have been my dream

For years I've waited, alone in the dark
Thinking of you through a young boy's heart
Over and over, the price that I've paid
Was watching you cry as they drove me away

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
So many times I've wondered, behind these doors
Will we be together, the way it used to be
Now that you are older, Mary do you think of me

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
Your mama used to come here, she don't come no more
Just this worn out picture that carries everything
But there's no way of knowing, Mary do you think of me

Do you think of me Mary
