I don't want to waste my time sleeping
And I sure don't,
Want to waste my time away
Spent too long a time running round
Waiting for a lucky break
I've done the same old trick, so many times
Looking for a way to make it new
And I'm still searching for the warm glow
Of the limelight
That I used to know with you

I never knew if I could be a star
But I felt like one
When you held me in your arms
Even on the roughest nights
The thought of you
Would lead me through to dawn
I would chase the sun a thousand miles
To find a way to make it disappear
But the days are getting shorter now
And the limelight
Seems so far away from here

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la

I would chase the sun a thousand miles
To find a way to make it disappear
But the days are getting shorter now
And the limelight
Seems so far away from here
Away from here

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
