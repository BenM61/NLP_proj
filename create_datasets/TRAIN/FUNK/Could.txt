Lying alone in my room 
Don't know what I'm gonna do 
Trying to figure out 
If this is it  this time 
Just can't stop thinking 
About the way you make me feel inside 
I just can't get you off my mind 
No matter how hard I try 
Could you be the one for me 
Could we dance the night away 
I want to give you everything 
Though I don't have much 
Could you fall in love with me 
Could you love me the rest of my life 
Could you forever be 
The one for me, this time 
Verse 2 
I walk around in a daze 
The ice is melting from my heart 
Can I ever know if you feel the same 
Are you the sunshine that's begging me 
Come in from the rain 
Or have you come into my life 
To turn around and take your love away 
Could you be the one for me 
Could we dance the night away 
I want to give you everything 
Though I don't have much 
Could you fall in love with me 
Could you love me the rest of my life 
Could you forever be 
The one for me, this time 
Verse 2 
I walk around in a daze 
The ice is melting from my heart 
Can I ever know if you feel the same 
Are you the sunshine that's begging me 
Come in from the rain 
Or have you come into my life 
To turn around and take your love away 
Bridge: 
When I look into your eyes 
(Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh) 
They tell me that you're mine 
but I keep asking myself 
Could you be the one for me 
Could we dance the night away 
I want to give you everything 
Though I don't have much 
Could you fall in love with me 
Could you love me the rest of my life 
Could you forever be 
The one for me, this time 
Verse 2 
I walk around in a daze 
The ice is melting from my heart 
Can I ever know if you feel the same 
Are you the sunshine that's begging me 
Come in from the rain 
Or have you come into my life 
To turn around and take your love away 
Bridge: 
When I look into your eyes 
(Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh) 
They tell me that you're mine 
but I keep asking myself 
Could you forever be 
The one for me 
This time
