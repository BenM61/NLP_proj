Hawaii U.S.A. Hawaii U.S.A.
We're flyin' comin' your way
Aloha Hawaii u.s.a.
 
Gee it's great to be in that fiftieth state
The land of enchanted dreams
What an isle where it's heaven tropical style
Where love weaves a spell it seems
 
Hawaii u.s.a. Hawaii U.S.A.
We're flyin' comin' your way
Aloha Hawaii u.s.a.
 
Gee what fun just to swim and surf in the sun
While the trade winds caress the sea
What a sight those exotic scenes of delight
Are waiting for you and me
 
Hawaii U.S.A.
Hawaii U.S.A.
