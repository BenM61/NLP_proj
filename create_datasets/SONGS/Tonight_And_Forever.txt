You know you're gonna have to face up to the facts
You're just another face in a big crowd
You know we gotta try hard to relax
We can laugh - but not too loud

It's never like you see in a magazine
And you don't even know what you mean to me
And I don't understand this feeling
But I want to be with you tonight

I want to be with you tonight
I want to be with you tonight
Tonight and forever
You drive me crazy and you say that you'll never change

And I could never do what you want to
Don't you find the whole thing a little strange
I don't even know if I like you
It's never like you see on a movie screen

But there's something that you do to me
And I'm not sure that I believe it
But I want to be with you tonight

I want to be with you tonight
I want to be with you tonight
Tonight and forever

I want to be with you tonight
I want to be with you tonight
I want to be with you tonight

Tonight and forever
Tonight and forever
Tonight and forever
