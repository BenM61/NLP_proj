They say women cry when walls retire,
They say dead men die when walls retire, 
When walls retire

Unconventional deconstructive conversations
Teach us how to eat,
I, will never let you go
Conversational reconstructive demonstrations
Teach us how to speak,
Why, confess the final blow

Teach us how to eat from your broken hands,
'Cause nothing seems to grow,
Teach us how to speak, 
The language of your only dreams

No one seems to understand that,
We are falling to our knees.

I forgot to pray, you forgot to say please,
Kill me, I, will never let you go,
I forgot to go, you forgot to know me,
Teach us how to speak, why confess the final blow

Teach us how to eat from your broken hands,
'Cause nothing seems to grow,
Teach us how to speak, 
The language of your only dreams

No one seems to understand that,
We are falling to our knees,
Blindness serves not god nor men,
So we are falling into disease

I'm falling into disease,
I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling 
I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling
We're falling we're falling we're falling we're falling
Into, into disease, disease, disease, disease
Disease disease disease disease disease
Disease disease disease
We've fallen we fallen we fallen
We've fallen we fallen we fallen

No one seems to understand that,
We are falling to our knees,
Blindness serves not god nor men,
So we are falling into disease,
Disease.
