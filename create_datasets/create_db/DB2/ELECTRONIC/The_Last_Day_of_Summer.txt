Yeah it's a snow white original mix and she's fixing me 
And the heartless thing she does is everything I love 
It's all I ever need 

Yeah it's a skin tight sensational strip and she's tripping me 
And the shameless way she turns... 
Is all I ever dream 

You ask me why I use it 
It could be just a way to pass the time 
I never really choose it 
It's just another play to lose... 
My mind... 

Yeah it's a bright light promotional taste and she's wasting me 
And the tearless time she breaks is everytime I ache 
It's all I ever feel 

You ask me why I need it 
It's maybe just a way to pass the time 
I never really mean it 
It's just another play to lose... 
My mind... 

Yeah it's a big night emotional kill and she's thrilling me 
And the careless way she hurts... 
Is all I ever scream 

You ask me why I take it 
It could be just a way to pass the time 
I never really make it 
It's just another play to lose... 

I'm coming up in the dark 
And every part of me is bruised and raw and pained 
I'm coming up in the dark 
And every part of me is loose and sore and stained 
And so I play it when I use it if I need it then I take it 
And I play it all again... 
And then I hold you... so cold you... like I know you... 
Yeah like I always know and like I always lose... 
My mind... my mind... 

Yeah I play it when I use it if I need it then I take it 
And I play it all again... and then I hold you... so cold you... 
Like I know you... 

Yeah like I always know and like I always lose 
Yeah like I always lose 
Like I always lose... 
My mind
