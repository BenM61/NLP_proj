Trash men didn't get my trash today
Oh, why
Because they want more pay
Buses on strike want a raise in fare
So they can help pollute the air

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The up and down, the carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground, young man
People make the world go 'round

Wall Street losing dough on every share
They're blaming it on longer hair
Big men smoking in their easy chairs
On a fat cigar without a care

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The up and down, the carousel
Changing people, heads around
Go underground, young man
People make the world go 'round

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The up and down, the carousel
Changing people, heads around
Go underground, young man
People make the world go 'round

People make the world go 'round
People make the world go 'round
People make the world go 'round

People make the world go 'round
