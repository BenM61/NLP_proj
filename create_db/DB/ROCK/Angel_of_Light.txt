I have seen Him there
Master of Light, Master of the night
Master of all the things that shine

[Chorus]
Oh I believe
I believe in all that I have seen
And I have seen the Angel Of Light
I have seen the Angel Of Light, Lucifer

I have seen Him there
Deep down where the Devils dwell
Deep down in the darkest well

[Chorus]

I will make a second deal with the Prince Of Light
Never will break the Oath I gave that night

Shine in all your glory, shine your light on me

I have seen Him there
Deep down where the Devils dwell
Deep down in the darkest well

[Chorus]
