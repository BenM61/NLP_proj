Don't want you to lead me to the dark
Don't need you to tear my heart apart
Don't do that,
Though people say that you're my enemy
I know you can set me free

Don't want you to come so close to me
Don't need you to blow my fantasy
But I know
That you are living far beyond those lies
I can see the danger rise, in your eyes

Cool vibes,
Why don't you kill me?

Cool vibes,
Why don't you turn your eyes away?
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes,
All we can do is fight and pray

Cool vibes,
Why don't you thrill me?
Cool vibes,
Why don't you kill me?
All that I can see
Are shadows of my destiny

Don't want you, to make me feel afraid
Don't need you, to take away the hate
But I know
That you will break the seal of mystery
Leave it to my fantasy, what will be

Cool vibes,
Why don't you kill me?

Cool vibes,
Why don't you turn your eyes away?
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes,
All we can do is fight and pray

Cool vibes,
Why don't you thrill me?
Cool vibes,
Why don't you kill me?
All that I can see
Are shadows of my destiny

Stay close to me, infinity
Enigma's what we share
But I don't care
You'll be there...

Cool vibes,
Why don't you kill me?

Cool vibes,
Why don't you turn your eyes away?
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes,
All we can do is fight and pray
(For some broken heroes)

Cool vibes,
Why don't you thrill me?
Cool vibes,
Why don't you kill me?
All that I can see
Are shadows of my destiny
