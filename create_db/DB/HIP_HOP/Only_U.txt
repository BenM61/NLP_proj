Oooh
I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh
I just can't leave you alone

Boy you got me doing things that I would never do
And I can't stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to
I'm crazy 'bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you I would probably go insane

'Cause only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)
Only you can make me feel (only you, only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)

Oooh
I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh
I just can't leave you alone

Boy you stay inside my mind, ain't no denyin' that
And only you could do them things that got me coming back
It's gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I do what I gotta do to keep you to myself

'Cause only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)
Only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)

Crazy 'bout the way you feel
I just gotta have you here
And I wanna let you know
I won't ever let you go

And only you can make me feel (only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)
Only you can make me feel (you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there (only you can take me there)

Oooh
I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh
I just can't leave you alone
