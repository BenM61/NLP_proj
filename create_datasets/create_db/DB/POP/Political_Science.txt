No one likes us
I don't know why
We may not be perfect 
But heaven knows we try
But all around 
Even our old friends put us down
Let's drop the big one 
And see what happens

We give them money 
But are they grateful
No, they're spiteful
And they're hateful
They don't respect us  
So let's surprise them
We'll drop the big one 
And pulverize them

Asia's crowded 
And Europe's too old
Africa's far too hot
And Canada's too cold
And South America stole our name
Let's drop the big one
There'll be no one left to blame us

We'll save Australia
Don't want to hurt no kangaroo
We'll build an all American amusement park there
They've got surfing, too

Boom goes London
And boom Paris
More room for you
And more room for me
And every city the whole world round
Will just be another American town
Oh, how peaceful it'll be
We'll set everybody free
You'll have Japanese kimonos, baby
There'll be Italian shoes for me
They all hate us anyhow
So let's drop the big one now
Let's drop the big one now
