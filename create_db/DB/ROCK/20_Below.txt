I'll never let you strip me to my skin
You've come too close and you ain't getting in

'Cause I'm so sick of bleeding out
These wounds will heal themselves
Even tho the cuts you've had to make
Sent me to an early grave

Don't you know you've got me 20 below
20 below

Don't you know you've got me 20 below
20 below

I'm the light that burns your eyes and blinds you
And every crack you try to hide appears

I'm strong enough to save myself
From faith that I've been dealt
I've had enough of your charade
I'll send you to an early grave

Don't you know you've got me 20 below
20 below

Don't you know you've got me 20 below
20 below

Here comes the rain
Frozen dark to liquid sun
Here comes the rain
I can feel it pumping through my veins

And even if you strip me to my skin
Your broken soul will make me whole again

Don't you know you've got me 20 below
20 below

Don't you know you've got me 20 below
20 below

Don't, you know, you've got me 20 below

My life is slowly rising up, burning down ain't high enough

Don't you know you've got me 20 below
20 below
