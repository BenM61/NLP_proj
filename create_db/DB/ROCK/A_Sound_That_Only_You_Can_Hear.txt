The thought of you and me and me and you 
It's clear  it's blurry 
Your head  my mind  your mind  my head  as one 
It's real  the foolish worry 

I feel you and you feel me as I feel you 
It's good  it's scary 
The speed  the heat  it's deep  and steep 
It's light but hard to carry 

Listen when I'm silent there's a 
Sound that only you can hear 
Listen when it's quiet I know 
You can hear it  cover up your ears 

Cover up your ears 
Your hands, my mouth, your mouth, my hands 
The weight of what we're thinking 
No words, the air we breathe 

It's not liquid, but we're drinking 
Listen when I'm silent there's a 
Sound that only you can hear 
Listen when it's quiet I know 

You can hear it, cover up your ears 
Cover up your ears 
Listen when I'm silent there's a 
Sound that only you can hear 

A sound that only you can hear 
A sound that only you can hear 
A sound that only you can hear
