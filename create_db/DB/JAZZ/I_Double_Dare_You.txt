I double dare you to sit over here
I double dare you to lend me your ear
Take off your high hat and let's get friendly
Don't be a scared cat; say, what do you care?
Can't you take a dare?

I double dare you to kiss me, and then
I double dare you to kiss me again
And if that look in your eyes means what I'm thinkin' of
I double dare you to fall in love with me
Hot mama, I double dare you
