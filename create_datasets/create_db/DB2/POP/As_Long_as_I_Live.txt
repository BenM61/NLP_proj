As long as I live
You'll always be part of me
You'll live in the heart of me
As long as I live

As long as I love
I'll share it with you, my own
And want to be loved
By you alone

How sure am I
Of all the things I say
As sure as night 
Will fall at close of day

You're all that I need
So answer this love I give
And whisper "I'm yours"
As long as I live
