Needed Mr. Right
The man of my dreams
The one who showed me true love
Or at least it seems

With brown cocoa skin
And curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me
That gentle loving stare

Finally, you've come along
The way I feel about you
It just can't be wrong
If you only knew
The way I feel about you
I just can't describe it

Finally
It has happened to me
Right in front of my face
Feelings can't describe it

Finally
It has happened to me
Right in front of my face
I just cannot hide it

(I just cannot hide it)
(I just cannot hide it)
(I just cannot hide it)
Finally you found me

Finally

Seems so many times
You seemed to be the one
All he ever wanted
Was to have a lil fun

Now you've come along
And brightened up my world
In my heart I feel it
I'm that special kind of girl

Finally, you've come along
The way I feel about you
It just can't be wrong
If you only knew
The way I feel about you
I just can't describe it

Finally
It has happened to me
Right in front of my face
Feelings can't describe it

Finally
It has happened to me
Right in front of my face
I just cannot hide it

(I just cannot hide it)
(I just cannot hide it)
(I just cannot hide it)
Finally you found me

Finally

Finally
It has happened to me
Right in front of my face
Feelings can't describe it

Finally
It has happened to me
Right in front of my face
I just cannot hide it

(Finally)
(Finally)
Finally you found me
(Finally)
(Finally)
Finally you found me
