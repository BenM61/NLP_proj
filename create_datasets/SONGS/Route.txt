Reality, it burns
The way we're living is worse
The pillars of inspiration are all falling down
The clean-up won't work while the fallout goes on.
And it's now or never, too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts.

Standing in the neutral zone
Living on sleep deprivation
The rural route sleeps while the city bleeds all over itself
Over the falls in a barrel is where the answers have gone
And it's now or never, too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts
And it's here for now, transient tomorrow
We're all living proof that nothing lasts.

Another road remains, but it provides no more
It can only take us away
Southbound, you can taste the weather
It feels like home
And it's now or never
Too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts
And it's here for now, transient tomorrow
We're all living proof that nothing lasts.
