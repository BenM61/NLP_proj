I sure like to party deep into the night
I sure love the music, it sounds so nice
But was it my imagination
When I heard the song I heard? 
The DJ played this one jam
That makes you want to kiss somebody

This is the mistletoe jam
I like to party all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody

Glad I got big feet
'Cause they're so good for dancin'
Glad you got big legs
'Cause they're so good when we're romancin'
You still got the flavor
And I'm hungry for your love
So I'm gon' play this one jam
That'll make you wanna kiss somebody

This is the mistletoe jam
I like to party all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody
This is the mistletoe jam
I like to do it all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody

Jam jam jam

This is the mistletoe jam
I like to party all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody
This is the mistletoe jam
I like to do it all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody

This is the mistletoe jam
I like to party all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody
This is the mistletoe jam
I like to do it all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody

This is the mistletoe jam
I like to party all night

Everybody kiss somebody

I like to do it all night
And dance to the mistletoe jam
Everybody kiss somebody
