If I must live alone
Id rather do it by my self
For Ive never known a man
To shake his head and turn and walk away
Lookin' at myself and all the things
That i believe in
Left dying in the silence
Of the things you never say

Sleepin' by myself
Somehow Ive never held you
Oh I wish I needed a reason
Cause surely there's an answer to it all

Talkin' to myself
Is something else that Ive grown used to
One sided conversation
With a narrow minded wall

Talk to me
Oh cant you see
That I cant bear to give my dream to someone
Who would stand and let it fall
Lately to myself

I'm the only one that holds me
One sided conversation
With a narrow minded wall
One sided conversation
With a narrow minded wall
