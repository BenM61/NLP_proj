I got bread for you when to get hungry
I got water for you when you run dry
I got good time when you get lonesome
I got Heaven before you die

I got all you need!
And if you wanna have fun, 
Baby please make it to me!

I got heat for you, when you get cold, babe
I got air conditioning when you are warm
I got youth when you get old, baby
I got protection, you get alone

I got all you need!
I got all you need!
And if you wanna have fun, 
Baby please make it to me!

I got rhythm when you wanna dance, babe
I got a tailor when you need some clothes
I got love for you when you get lonesome
I got money when you are broke!

I got all you need!
I got all you need!
And if you wanna have fun, 
Baby please make it to me!

I got all you need!
I got all you need!
I got all you need!
I got all you need!
And if you wanna have fun, 
Baby please make it to me!
