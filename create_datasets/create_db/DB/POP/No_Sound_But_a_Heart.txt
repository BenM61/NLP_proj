You hold me like a flower, afraid that I won't last
Then you touch me like I'm glass
But I don't shatter all that easily, if I cry it's not for me
What you see are sweeter tears, they fall

I hear no sound but a heart, beating softer every breath
Growing stronger every touch, I listen for the love
And hear no sound but a heart, thunder through the shadow room
When I lie with you and listen to the love
No need to hurry now, love takes the time it needs, it opens from a seed
To tangle two of us in twisting vines, passion grows like roses climb
Praying that the morning sun won't rise

I hear no sound but a heart, beating softer every breath
Growing stronger every touch, I listen for the love
And hear no sound but a heart, thunder through the shadow room
When I lie with you and listen to the love
No need to hurry now, love takes the time it needs, it opens from a seed
To tangle two of us in twisting vines, passion grows like roses climb
Praying that the morning sun won't rise
Say no words, I can hear your beating heart, that's all I need to know
So say no words
But I don't shatter all that easily, if I cry it's not for me
What you see are sweeter tears, they fall

I hear no sound but a heart, beating softer every breath
Growing stronger every touch, I listen for the love
And hear no sound but a heart, thunder through the shadow room
When I lie with you and listen to the love
No need to hurry now, love takes the time it needs, it opens from a seed
To tangle two of us in twisting vines, passion grows like roses climb
Praying that the morning sun won't rise
No sound but a heart, no sound but a heart
I hear no sound but a heart - beating softer every breath
No sound but a heart - growing stronger every touch
No sound but a heart - when I lie with you
No sound but a heart - I listen for the love and hear
No sound, no sound...
