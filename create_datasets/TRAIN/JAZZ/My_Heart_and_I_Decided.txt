My heart and I decided
If you like it, we'd like it too
Secluded with you

My heart and I decided
We'd find heaven, blue heaven too
Secluded with you

Up on the Prairie or out on a desert
Where tumbleweeds stumble around
High on a mountain or deep in a valley
Or some little alley in town

My heart and I decided
It's just too, too good to be true
Secluded with you

My heart and I decided
We'd find heaven, blue heaven too
Secluded with you

Up on the Prairie or out on a desert
Where tumbleweeds stumble around
High on a mountain or deep in a valley
Or some little alley in town

My heart and I decided
It's just too, too good to be true
When I'm secluded with you
