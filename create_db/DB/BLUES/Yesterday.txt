I had enough heartache and enough headache
I've had so many ups and downs
Don't know how much more I can take
See, I decided that I cried my last tear yesterday

Either I'm going to trust you or I may as well walk away
'Cause stressing don't make it better
Don't make it better, no way
See, I decided that I cried my last tear yesterday

Yesterday, oh, yesterday, I decided to put my trust in you
Oh, oh, yesterday, yesterday, I realized that you would bring me through
There ain't nothing too hard for my god, no
Any problems that I have
He's greater than them all, so
I decided that I cried my last tear yesterday
