You walk tall, got your head in the clouds
You talk soft, but you're thinking aloud
And you know, exactly what you want
You box shy, you're hard to get
You got the face that I can't forget
And I know, I know the heat goes on

I know that the heat goes on
I know that the heat goes on

You play tight, you're nobody's fool
You're not cold, but I know that you're cool
Look at you, I know the heat goes on
Now tell me, with your hand on you're heart
That you knew, you were right from the start
And you're sure, you felt it all along

You know that the heat goes on
You know that the heat goes on

Times to decide, times that I've lied
Problems will never be solved
Which way is wrong, which could be right?
This heat will always go on, on and on

You walk tall, got your head in the clouds
You talk soft, but you're thinking aloud
And you know, exactly what you want
You box shy, you're hard to get
You got the face that I'll never forget
You and I know, we know the heat goes on

You know that the heat goes on
You know that the heat goes on

You know that the heat goes on
You know that the heat goes on
