I know everyone's a good person inside
Everyone wants to be loved inside
So whenever I think how you wasted my time
I try to remember the good things inside

Well, you haven't killed anyone as far as we know
And you seem very nice to your sister
You have very good taste in clothes and guitars
And very young girls

I know everyone's a good person inside
Everyone wants just to be loved inside
So whenever I think what a dick, what a liar,
I try to remember the good things inside

Well, your smile is as wide as Montana
And your eyes as deep as the Caspian Sea
Well, I guess these don't count as the things from inside
But these are the things that made me blind
These are the things that made me blind

What was I thinking? I wasn't thinking at all
If I knew what I did today, would I make the same mistake?
Probably.

'cause your hands are as big as Montana
And your lips as sweet as red vines
Well I guess these don't count as the things from inside
But these are the things that made me blind
These are the things that make me blind

You're as sharp as a tack, you're as loyal as a cat
You were great in the sack, even if you have hair on your back
You made me weak at the knees, gave me no disease
What more could I ask, I won't dig deeper than that
