On the way down, a fall from grace
I was in for a heavy one when I could feel you pull away
On the way down, it was too much to take
Even though I tried, it was never enough for running in the same damn place

But I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent, I was innocent
I let you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I got something to tell you, but I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye

Heavy was the sound I could not lift
I could run for a million miles and never get away from it
But knowing that now, I couldn't be content
Even when it was looking up for us, it was difficult to pretend

But I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent, I was innocent
I let you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I got something to tell you, but I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye

I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, (I was innocent)
I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, baby, (I was innocent)
I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent, I was innocent
I let you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I got something to tell you, but I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
But I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye

Never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
