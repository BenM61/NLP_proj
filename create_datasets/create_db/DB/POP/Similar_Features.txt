Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

You never had to wait for nothing in your life
I guess wanting me must have been a steel blue knife
And when night after night the scent of passion would linger
You had to have the jewels wrapped around your finger
Now you keep running down the road in your midnight state of mind
Curiosity kills if you can't read the signs

Go on and close your eyes, imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Dancing with the wall made you bitter and sweet
There ain't much you can do when they just lay it at your feet
But you could tell by the song I wanted to be the one
Did you listen again when the damage was done
Now the paint's still wet in your do-it-by-number dream
Are you gonna tell me how it felt, will you tell me what it means

Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Was it want with no desire?
Was it smoke with no fire?
Did I say it doesn't rip me apart?
I lied
I'm sorry dear my hands are tied

Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Close your eyes, imagine me there
She's got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

It shouldn't bother you
Hey, hey, hey
It shouldn't bother you
Hey, hey, hey
It shouldn't bother you
Shouldn't bother you
