I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth 
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than givin' birth 
My first verse explains some of the game she was playin'
I'm blamin' myself cause in my wealth was where her pain would haven 
Behavin' like a money hungry hooker, funny how the money took her 
From a average honey to a stunning looker 
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss 
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ' 
She got too big for her britches but The Britch is Over 
Not the one in Queens I mean the one she dreamin' wasn't sober 
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help 
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fuckin' belt 
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow 
Shoulda drowned ya when I found ya crushin' in my boy's Camaro 
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead 
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

[Chorus]
Come back come back come back come back to me, Punisher 
Punish me, ah I've been so bad, so bad 
Won't you come back?

Nah baby, I'm not gon' be able to do it, you blew it 
Threw it all the way cause you was stupid, girl why'd you do it? 
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby 
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me 
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends 
But we're only hurtin all of us for certain by forsakin' him 
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe 
The way you were, preserve, these words so you won't play the herb 
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father 
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother 
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age 
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days 
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resistin' 
I'm insistin' you chill for real before you come up missin'
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right 
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

[Chorus: x2]

I gave you everything, love letters and sweaters with leather seams 
Feathered wings, and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's 
Simple dreams a dream fulfilled, the green DeVille Cadillac 
To mack, matter 'face redeem the bill
I mean for real I can play it mami how you wanna stay 
At Monty Frask, givin' the next nigga my punani 
You want me back cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on 
With the Long Don, word bond my shit is strong (come back) 
Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon 
And get your hands off my six button Cardigan 
This ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned 
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dyin' to burn 
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect 
It's better to have loved and lost than live with regret

Come back, to, me 
I want you to

[Chorus: x2]

To me, yeah yeah 
Alright, don't go, no 
Oh ah oh ah oh, hm oh hm hm 
Yeah, take my hand, and punish me 
Hm, been so bad, come punish me, yeah 
Take my hand, and punish me, oh 
Been so bad, come punish me
