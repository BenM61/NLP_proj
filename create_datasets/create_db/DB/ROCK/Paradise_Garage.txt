I went down to Paradise Garage
And took my place in line
The cashier said
"Are you alright?"
I said "I'm feelin' fine"
I'm a stranger to Nirvana,
I don't box outside my weight
But when I stepped out of the taxi
I did not anticipate this feelin'
(Oh excuse me, sir
Oh, no, no, after you)

Baby's got a dream and she can boogie
Daddy's got a groove that's coming clean
Jemie's got a vision of a permanent position
Me, I'm oiling up my dance machine
And it goes like this
And it goes like this

Well, I'm from Plainsbro, New Jersery,
And I didn't bring a date
I guess I wasn't really sure
If you'd be boogeyin' this late
I can't think were I put my wallet
Naive suburban fool
You wouldn't think that I'd spent hours outside
French polishing my cool
And feelin' so strange
(I said after you
I'm a gentleman
Well, by implication)

Baby's got a dream and she can boogie

And it goes like this
And it goes like this
And it goes like this
And it goes like this
And it goes like this

Gotta boogie!

And it goes like this
And it goes like this

Well, I really only stepped inside to vary my routine
You see, I read about this discotheque
In New York Magazine
(Hey Baby,
What's your sign?
And haven't we met before?)
I really must suggest
That we've achieved a rare rapport
Hit the ceiling

(Where are you?
Come on,
Come on
You're usually so punctual)

Gotta boogie

(Uh, no, I had a little trouble at the door,
But, anyway, twenty bucks took care of it
Do you come here a lot?
Do you have a professional hairdresser or did you do that yourself?
Oh, well, you must have a lot of free time.)

Gotta boogie
