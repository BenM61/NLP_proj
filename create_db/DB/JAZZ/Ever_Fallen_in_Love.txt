You spurn my natural emotions
It makes me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
If I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame?
What a shame and we can't be together
Until we realize that we are the same

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

You spurn my natural emotions
It makes me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
If I start a commotion
