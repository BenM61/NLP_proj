It's one on one I'm talking
I'm talking me and you
Do you believe I love you
And you say I know you do
I'll never leave you lonely
I'll be there I know you will
And when you learn to trust me
I'll take you somewhere far away
No need for memories, yesterday's gone

Celebrate new life
Beyond the Milky Way
Leave your cares behind
There's a song that rings
Sing oh happy day
Ain't it good to know
Love is here to stay
