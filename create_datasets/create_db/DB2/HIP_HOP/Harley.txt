It's Lil Boat
All my diamonds go bling, blang, blaow
Lil Boat

Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm balling hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no
Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a barbie
And I'm balling so damn hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no

Late night with the report like Colbert, aye
Left hand iced out look like a Kid Cuisine
Lil Boat in the magazine
Big bro keep the magazines
Charged up like an Alkaline
Bet she feel dick in her spine

Oh, ridin' like a Harley
My bitch a Barbie
Can't no one guard Boat

Harley Harley Harley Harley Harley
Ridin' like a Harley Harley Harley Harley Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm balling hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no
Harley Harley Harley Harley Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, aye
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm balling so damn hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no

Ain't nobody flexing like me
Ain't no nigga flexing like me
18, got the brand new AMG
Yo baby daddy tryna ride front seat, no
Stop hating on a young nigga 'cause I'm getting cake
Right wrist so dipped look like a Frosted Flake
Top of the building, athletes be my neighbours
These niggas soft like Life Savers
These niggas be bitches
Most of these niggas be hoes
Guess that that's just how it goes

Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm balling hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no
Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm balling so damn hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no

Oh, like a Harley
Can't no one guard me
Can't no one f*ck with Boat
