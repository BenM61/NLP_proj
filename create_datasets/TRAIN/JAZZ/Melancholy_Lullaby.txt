Melancholy lullaby, 
Coming from a trouble sky 
Ringing through the clinging vine 
Right into this heart of mine 

Melancholy lullaby, 
Listen to the nightwind sigh, 
How can I expect to sleep 
When I lay me down to weep? 

Your love has cooled 
From flame to ice 
And I've been fooled 
Into a fool?s paradise... 

Hear the music of the rain 
Beating on my window pane 
Wish that I could say goodbye 
To my melancholy lullaby...
