Come on, let's break it down, let's cause a commotion
Come on, let's bring the noise restrainer to Bremerton
So what's it gonna be and who's comin' with me?
It's time to make a choice on what was never easy

So let's roll with this role remodeling
I refuse to be, I refuse to see
To this role remodeling

Come on, let's smash the glass
Into a thousand words of light
'Cause we're all soldiers here
And yet we haven't learned to fight

The history of our fathers
Hasn't taught us what we need to learn
If we could see the future
Would we see the buildings burn?

So let's roll with this role remodeling
I refuse to be, I refuse to see

there's nothing in the bomb to put the fire in these eyes and burn
We're gonna break the rules but we don't see it as a crime
We're here to change the world and finally this is our time

So let's roll with this role remodeling

So let's roll with this role remodeling
I refuse to be, I refuse to see
To this role remodeling
