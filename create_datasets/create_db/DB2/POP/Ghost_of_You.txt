Summer's ended and without a trace
Time goes by - while you remain
Funny how I thought I walked on through
With my heart in one


How I tried to get you of my mind
But you return - all the time
I believed I could just let you go
Like the fool I am


I've been trying to release you
To get my feet back on the ground
Still I need my hope to hold on to
Even if I know I should back away
It's just a part of me that I can't erase


Baby, baby why
Anyway I try I'm still reminded
(the ghost of you)
Anywhere I go I keep coliding with
(the ghost of you)
I've given up I just can't fight it
(the ghost of you)

Everytime I look away I see
The ghost of you
