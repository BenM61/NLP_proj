Has nobody asked you how you are?
You look like you might not last the day
I wouldn't have made it very far
So we'd make a good team right away

I've not made amends for yesterday
My lip won't get me out of it
Waking up dreading hearing tales
Of all of my nightmares being true

I've not made amends for yesterday
My lip won't get me out of it
Waking up dreading hearing tales
Of all of my nightmares being true

I take a breath and grab the phone
Secretly hoping you're not home
I'd leave a message, I was out
Out of my mind on drink and drugs
