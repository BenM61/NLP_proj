Can't you hear me sigh
when it's time for us to say goodbye?

I wanna linger a little longer,
A little longer dear.
see that moon a-shinin' up above,
There's no time like this for makin' love!

I love your lovin', your lovely lovin',
I hate a-leavin' you!
Let me linger just a little,
A little longer with you,
A little longer with you.

I wanna linger a little longer,
A little longer dear.
Come look at that moon a-shinin' up above,
There's still time for makin' love!

I love your lovin', your lovely lovin',
I hate a-leavin' you, believe me!
Let me linger just a little,
A little longer with you,
A little longer with,
I wanna linger with,
A little longer with you.
