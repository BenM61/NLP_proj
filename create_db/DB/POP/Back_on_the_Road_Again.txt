Back on the road again, seems like I've always been.
Back on the road again, singing my song again.

Travellin' is all I've known. Anywhere is my home.
Livin' the life I live is giving me life to live.

Love and laughter, pain and tears.
All those people, all those years.

Faces that never end, loving to see a friend.
They seem to know me well, just like I'm there to sell.

Love and laughter, pain and tears.
All those people, all those years.

I'm back on the road again.

Back on the road again.
