Maxine, drama queen
Prettiest thing in life that I've seen
Gonna go down in history
When I take her our of her misery
Liesel from Laos
Likes to vacation in her house
Moved from Barbatos to the country
Won't pay tax until she's 83

The Girls - They're the one's making us Breakfast

Pam see's a quick stitch
Sharp as a tack yet slick as witch
I know where her mind's at
She'll take all I own and then smile right back
Kristen's a Christian
Telling all her friends she's a lesbian
Gonna make a speech to the President
Ask him why he's so negligent

-chorus-

Dee wants to sing R&B
Make a million dollar video for B.E.T.
Do a remixed version for MTV
Get shot and come back to lie in 5 movies
Ms. Cry teaches English
To high school delinquents
Feels like somethings still missing
Wants to get it on with Kristen

-chorus-
