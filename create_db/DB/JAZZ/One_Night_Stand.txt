Job done, want to have fun
Gonna call my girls gonna get my hair done
So I dress tight, with my heels high
And I think about the moves I'm a pull tonight
When I roll up, out front
Guys looking over like they want some
Make way, sexy
For me and my ladies

[Chorus]
Hear the sound of the DJ playing our jam
Glass down, grab a man
Move to the floor, it's time to get down
Ding ding, first round

Hand on my hips as we start to dip
Close range, full clip
Temptation, sensations, vibrations
My one night stand

Act wild but I got style
Cause I ain't sipping if it ain't crystal
High class, nice ass
Spend your money but I got my own cash
Good vibes, so right
Thank you for the dance tonight
Feel free, baby
Keep looking 'cause you can't have me

[Chorus]

Hand on my hips as we start to dip
Close range, full clip
Temptation, sensations, vibrations
My one night stand

Hey why'all get up get up it's a one night stand
Here I come again with my rhyming slang
I said ride to the rhythm as I flip this sound
Flip this sound we're gonna move around

Mis-Teeq we're coming back again
Love of the music inside your membrane
Yo, I'm gonna burn you with my lyrical flame
Start the game
Come follow me it's time to play

Now don't you get the wrong impression
It's just a dance
I'm with my girlfriends hanging out
To mislead wasn't my intention
Nothing more to say

[Chorus: x2]

Hand on my hips as we start to dip
Close range, full clip
Temptation, sensations, vibrations
My one night stand

[Chorus]

Hand on my hips as we start to dip
Close range, full clip
Temptation, sensations, vibrations
My one night stand
