Just the thought of you around,
Gets my head spinning in circles
Just the way you say my name
Gets my heart turning in circles

You got me spinning like a wheel
Oh how you make me feel
It's more than gold on my finger
It's six feet down and forever
'Cause where I am
Is where you begin
You picked up the pieces
And put me together
You're the only part of me unbroken
And I'm going in circles

Every crooked little lie
Bended, connected circles
Every star up in the sky
Every hello and goodbye
Every moment by your side
Is the meaning of my life

You got me spinning like a wheel
Oh how you make me feel
It's more than gold on my finger
It's six feet down and forever
'Cause where I am
Is where you begin
You picked up the pieces
And put me together
You're the only part of me unbroken
And I'm going in circles
In circles

Just the thought of you around
Gets my head spinning in circles
Just the way you say my name
Gets my heart turning, turning, turning
Around and 'round again

You got me spinning like a wheel
Oh how you make me feel
It's more than gold on my finger
It's six feet down and forever
'Cause where I am
Is where you begin
You picked up the pieces
And put me together
You're the only part of me unbroken
And I'm going in circles
In circles

Just the thought of you around
Gets my head spinning in circles
