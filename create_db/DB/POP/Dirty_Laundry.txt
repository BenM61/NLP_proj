I don't believe in saints
They never make mistakes
I know it's not my place
Who am I to tell you that you need to change?

Her closet's such a mess
Filled up with all the skeletons she's kept
Nobody's perfect I confess
But she's perfect enough without ever dressing up, yeah

Dirty laundry is piling in her room
She's got her secrets, yeah I got mine too
I don't care about what you did
Only care about what we do
Dirty laundry
Looks good on you

Now here's some honesty
Sometimes I trip over your history
Wish I could change my mind
But it's the things I shouldn't see that always catch my eye

Dirty laundry is piling in her room
She's got her secrets, yeah I got mine too
I don't care about what you did
Only care about what we do
Dirty laundry
Looks good on you

Looks good on you
