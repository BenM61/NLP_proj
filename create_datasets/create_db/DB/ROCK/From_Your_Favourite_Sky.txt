Do you dare
Take a breath
Do you dream of a tragic death
I know you do

do you wail, do you weep
Do you sing yourself to slepp
You delicate flower

and so what is love?
And who am I?
To dare to pull the stars from your favourite sky

you were born
Forth from joy
You're every girl and boy
You know you are, you know you are

and you dress
Like a dame
And you burn on a catholic flame
By the hours, by the hours

and so what is love?
And who am I?
To dare to pull the stars from your favourite sky

you possess, s'avoir faire
Put cheap bleach on your hair
You know you do
You know you do

do you dare
Take a breath
Do you dream of a tragic death
You delicate flower

and so what is love?
And who am I?
To dare to pull the stars from your favourite sky

and so what is love?
And who am I?
To dare to pull the stars from your favourite sky

from your favourite sky
