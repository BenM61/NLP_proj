Do yourself a favor
Wake up to your mind
Life is what you make it
You see, but still you're blind
Get yourself together
Give before you take
You'll find out the hard way
Soon you're gonna break

Hey hey hey
Smiling phases
Showing traces
Even if they bust you
Keep on smiling through and through
And you'll be amazed at the gaze
On their faces as they sentence you
You don't need a lawyer
When you're in a fix
Someone gets to pay up

Your friends are full of tricks
But happiness is something
That you just can't buy
Own up to the truth girl
Your love has gone on by
Smiling Phases bring you flowers
You can line 'em up
And you can watch 'em grow for hours
And you'll be amazed at the way that they stare

As they walk by your door
Do yourself a favor
Wake up to your mind
Life is what you make it
You see, but still you're blind
Get yourself together
Give before you take
You'll find out the hard way

Soon you're gonna break
Hey hey hey
Smiling phases
Going Places
Even if they bust you
Keep on smiling through and through
And you'll be amazed at the gaze
On their faces as they sentence you!
