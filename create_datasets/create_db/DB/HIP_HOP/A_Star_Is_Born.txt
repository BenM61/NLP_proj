Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em

Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em
Hey

I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it,
X came through, caught lighter fluid,
Still I came through it,
Clap for 'em,
But I'm the blueprint,
I'm like the map for 'em,
I dropped another classic,
Made Puff pass it,
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it,
Wayne scorching, I'll applaud him,
If he keep going, pass the torch to him,
50 came through like hurricanes do,
Thought I'd finished his ass at summer jam too,
I had the Illmatic on bootleg,
Shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead,
Wayne did a millie, 50 did a millie,
Ye too, but what Em did was silly,
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him,
His flow on Renegade, fucking awesome,
Applaud him

Hey

Snoop Dogg did, Nelly came down,
The Face Mob, kept it ghetto for the H town.
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches,
Drake's up next, see what he do with it,
Rule had a run, couple movie parts,
T.I literally wanted to shoot up the charts,
What up Jeezy, what it do,
Y'all remind me of us in early 92,
Outcast landed, 3 thou' was ill,
Like a male version of Lauren Hill,
Mobb Deep shook it but Prodigy took it a lil' too far,
Can't f*ck with Brooklyn,
Wu Tang gang bang, Meth ate,
Rae' took on the date with the Purple Tape.
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface,
They had a hell of a run,
Standing ova, ay

Hey

And I am one of one,
Can't you see just how long my run,
My reign new lou' sun shine
Been a star since I was back in one time,
One time give it up for him,
December 4th a star was born,
Clap for him,
He went from moving that corner
To this corner office is so enormous,
Hey, Pres Carter,
Watch him get a Monica on all day,
Hey,
Got so many different monikers but only one Jay
They come they go,
Some real some foe,
Some friends some hoes
But no I goes nowhere this Hov

Everyday a star is born (can you say New York City)
Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em
Everyday a star is born (can you say New York City)
Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em
Hey

And could I be a star,
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life,
Just to make it in this Broadway lights,
Now shining in the broad day light, go figure,
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the Ville,
Got a deal a real life saver,
Dreams of being behind the Will like Jada,
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later, Cole you go the glow like a lil' light saber,
So clap for him, then applaud Hov, he gave him the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him,
No sir,
The flows cold as a shoulder of a gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches,
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you motherfuckers soak it in
And clap for 'em

Everyday a star is born (can you say New York City)
Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em
