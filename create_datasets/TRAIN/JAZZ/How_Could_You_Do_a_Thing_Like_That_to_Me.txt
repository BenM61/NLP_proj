Baby you went and broke your faithful, promise
How could you do a thing like that, to me
Didn't I give you everything, I'd promised
How could you do a thing like that, to me

Never thought - you'd be untrue
When my back - (it) was turned on you

If someone gave me all the world (the whole wide world), to hurt you
I wouldn't do a thing like that, to you
(no mam - I wouldn't (couldn't) do a thing like that, to you)
(so how could you do a thing like that, to me)
