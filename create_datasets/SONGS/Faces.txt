Every day awaken, in my mind, you're always there
Photographs have been taken, of the crimes,
It's not really fair, we're jiving a He
See the things that I've lost, as they hide, in the center of my mind
Seems we all have been crossed, test of time
It's not really fair, the leader he lies

Life has faces, faces that lest
Faces of truth, his face is a mess
Faces of love and faces of hale
Faces of death, I can't wait!

Every day he's pretending, in his mind, he really is not there
Every move that we're making, puppet minds
It really isn't fair, the kingdom it dies, it dies!

Life has faces, faces that test
Faces of truth, his face is a mess
Faces of love and faces of hate
Faces of death, I can't wait!

Feel the danger upon you, open wide, it's always calling
I'm no stranger to hatred, it's mankind
He's not really fair, we're living a lie 'til we die!

Life has faces, faces that test
Faces of truth, his face is a mess
Faces of love and faces of hate
Faces of death, I can't wait!
