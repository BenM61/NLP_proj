'Cause I'm free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys
All looking at me
And the world keeps on buzzing the sound of my heart
Going hmm hmm hmm
And this is only the start

Did you ever want something so bad
You could feel it to the end of the fingertips
They're reaching out for something to grab
And someone smacks your hand
And it becomes so hard to see
The end of the line

But I'm free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys all looking at me
And the world keeps on buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going hmm hmm hmm
And this is only the start

I feel like a little kid again
No worries for me to understand
Fall in love each night and then
Waking up with the feeling that I cant
Describe I love this life
It just gets better

But I'm free as a bee and flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys all looking at me
But the world keeps on buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going hmm hmm hmm
And this is only the start

Free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys all looking at me
And my world hears on buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going hmm hmm hmm
And this is only the start

Cause I'm free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys all looking at me
And my world hears on buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going hmm hmm hmm
And this is only the start

'Cause I'm free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys all looking at me
And my world hears on buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going hmm hmm hmm
And this is only the start
