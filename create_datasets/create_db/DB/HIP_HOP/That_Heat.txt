[Will.I.Am]
One for the treble
Two for the bass
3 for the ladies
And four for the blaze
Yo yo yo
It's that heat, that heat, that heat, that heat
It's that heat yo

The heat comin' thick down from sao paulo
Bankin' new york shakin' up the apollo
Rhyme like night people bite and swallow
But the way to recite it is soundin' raw hollow
Hollow like empty 40 ounce bottles
Holla at ya boy if you wanna date models
Brazilian beauties wit booties that wobble
Booby like tooties that fog up ya goggles
Yea I keep it hot full throttle
Beats bang out and keep yea head on bobble
Instrumentally I'm rich like lotto
Fundamentally I just can't follow
Or get sentimental when witnessing my bro's
Divin, duckin, dodgin from hollow
Point bullets that turn bodies into john does
I stay positive and rock mics cause I go

[Chorus]
One for the treble
Two for the bass
Three for the ladies
And Four for the blaze

[Repeat: x4]
That Heat

So take off ya clothes
Relax yea soul
Unwind yea spine

It's that heat, that heat, that heat [Repeat: x3]
It's that heat yo

It's that heat comin' in slow motion
Barbecue yea body keep yea body straight roastin'
Light skin hunny's get the sun tan lotion
Dark skin hunny's in the summer no commotion
You can catch me chillin' by the ocean
Wit Brazilian feminines sippin' on potions
Girls lookin' like cinnamon toast
And I got a little chocolate for yah cinnamon toast
I got the notion to get real close
That's a little ? motion don't mind if I boast
Baby I can be yea favorite host
Break yea off wit a single or a freaky double dose
Just don't catch no emotions
I bring heat from coast to coast and
Beats and rhymes is my devotion
I'm turnin' MC's into ghosts
When I talk about

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
It's that heat, that heat, that heat [Repeat: x3]
It's that heat so
