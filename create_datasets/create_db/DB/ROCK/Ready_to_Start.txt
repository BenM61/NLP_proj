Businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
And I guess I'll just begin again
You say you, can we still be friends

If I was scared
I would
And if I was bored
You know I would
And if I was yours
Well I'm not

All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But to bow to down to them anyway
Is better than being alone

If I was scared
I would
And if I was bored
You know I would
And if I was yours
But I'm not

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying please come out against tonight
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say you can still be friends

If I was scared
I would
And if I was pure
You know I would
And if I was yours
But I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

If I was scared
I would
And if I was pure
You know I would
And if I was yours
But I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Your mind surely opened the door
To step out into the dark
Now I'm ready
