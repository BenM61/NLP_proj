I know a place where the sun's always shining
With lovely flowers around everywhere 
Come take my hand, I'll show you I'll guide you 
I know this place it's deep down inside you 
I know a place where people not fighting 
With smiling faces around everywhere 
Come take my hand, I'll show you I'll guide you 
I know this place it's deep down inside you 

Come take my hand, I'll lead you just follow me 
To wonderland, it's deep down inside of you 
Come take my hand, I'll lead you just follow me 
Come take my hand, come take my hand 
Come take my hand, I'll lead you just follow me 
To wonderland, it's deep down inside of you

Fantasize, energize, only you can rise, rise 
If you really want to do it, get in to it, baby move it 
Slip slide to the place, bring a happy face, bass 
Treble rebel is what I am, I boogie in the wonderland 
It's up to you to find, what you're looking for, 
As I rock, rock, rock to the rhythm, I can give you more, more
From the soul, take control, find yourself never to old 
Come, come take my hand, and I will take you to this land 

I know a place where the sun's always shining
With lovely flowers around everywhere 
Come take my hand, I'll show you I'll guide you 
I know this place it's deep down inside you

With smiling faces around everywhere 
Come take my hand, I'll show you I'll guide you 
I know this place it's deep down inside you

To wonderland, it's deep down inside of you 
Come take my hand, I'll lead you just follow me 
Come take my hand, come take my hand 

Take a chance, to enchant, on the floor as you dance 
Come, come take my hand, travel with me to a land
Of happiness for everyone, run, run here I come 
Pick it up, pick it up, don't be late, feel the groove don't be late
To go inside take a ride, now you now you can't deny 
What you feel is it real, let it go and you will know
What to do it's up to you, follow me it's nothing new 
Come, come take my hand and I will take you to this land 

I know a place where the sun's always shining
With lovely flowers around everywhere 
Come take my hand, I'll show you I'll guide you 
I know this place it's deep down inside you 
I know a place where people not fighting 
With smiling faces around everywhere 
Come take my hand, I'll show you I'll guide you 
I know this place it's deep down inside you 

Come take my hand, I'll lead you just follow me 
To wonderland, it's deep down inside of you 
Come take my hand, I'll lead you just follow me 
Come take my hand, come take my hand

To wonderland, it's deep down inside of you 
Come take my hand, I'll lead you just follow me 
Come take my hand, come take my hand
