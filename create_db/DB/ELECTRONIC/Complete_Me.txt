Is this really what we want
Is this really want we need
Six billion people staring at their feet

You could drop them to the floor
And they would hope for more
And it's hard I know
We're all scared but what for?
When maybe we would all survive
Like service with a smile

So you can tell me what you think you'd do
If you ruled the world for second or two
Maybe you could change things and
Tell me would it be worth the fight
When you can see that they're
All givin' up in their eyes
Tell me would you change them

Just give me a name, give me a right
Take all I know from out of sight
For now I am all that I need
Can you complete me?
And give me a war
Give me some peace
Give me some one I'd rather be
But all the same you can take it away
Cause there's no one else to blame

The smallest things are
Our biggest cracks
And is it a wonder we all collapse
And we strive for more in life

So tell me what you think you'd do
If the world really needed you
Maybe you would help it
But tell me what you think you'd do
If I rule the world for a second or two
Would you and could you help me?

(When When) When you can give me a name
Give me a right
Take all I know from out of sight
For now I am all that I need
So just complete me
Give me a war and give me some peace
Give me some one I'd rather be
But all the same you can take it away
Cause there's no one else to blame

So give me a name
And give me a right
Take all I know from out of sight
For now I am that I need
Can you complete me?
