I love my Dinah (Dede Dinah)
Love my Dinah (Dede Dinah)
There ain't no girl that is fine-ah
Than my rockin', rollin' Dinah
Dede Dinah, Dede Dinah

Love to squeeze 'er (Dede Dinah)
Love to tease 'er (Dede Dinah)
No one else can have my Dinah
'Cause my Dinah is-a mine-ah
Pretty Dinah, pretty Dinah

Bony Maronie, Peggy Sue
Ain't got that love so very tru-ue
But, with my Dinah, I sure knew
There's nothing for me she wouldn't do, do-do-do-do

Oh, that's my Dinah (Dede Dinah)
My own Dinah (Dede Dinah)
There's no girl I know can beat 'er
When it comes to bein' sweeter than my Dinah
Dede Dinah

Bony Maronie, Peggy Sue
Ain't got that love so very tru-ue
But, with my Dinah, I sure knew
There's nothing for me she wouldn't do, do-do-do-do

Oh, that's my Dinah (Dede Dinah)
My own Dinah (Dede Dinah)
There's no girl I know can beat 'er
When it comes to bein' sweeter than my Dinah
Dede Dinah

Dede Dinah, Dede Dinah
Dede Dinah, Dede Dinah
