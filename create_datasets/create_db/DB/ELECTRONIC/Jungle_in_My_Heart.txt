I really don't know the games that you play.
I don't know if you mean every word that you say.
And I don't care
If you tellin' me lies.
''cause I was falling for you by the look in your eyes.
You turn my world chosen upside down.

Jungle in my heart
Burning jungle fever

Burnin' when I see you in the night.
Jungle in my heart
Loosing my attention

Loosing when you came into my life.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway.
There's a jungle
Jungle in my heart.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway

But that I've break we will never part.
I'm gonna loose my control every night.
A million butterflies running around in my mind.
My heart is beating as wild as a drum.
I'm in danger and that's what a Lady has done.
You turn my world chosen upside down.

Jungle in my heart
Burning jungle fever

Burnin' when I see you in the night.
Jungle in my heart
Loosing my attention

Loosing when you came into my life.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway.
There's a jungle
Jungle in my heart.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway

But that I've break we will never part.
You turn my world chosen upside down.
Jungle in my heart
Burning jungle fever

Burnin' when I see you in the night.
Jungle in my heart
Loosing my attention

Loosing when you came into my life.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway.
There's a jungle
Jungle in my heart.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway

But that I've break we will never part.
Jungle in my heart
Burning jungle fever

Burnin' when I see you in the night.
Jungle in my heart
Loosing my attention

Loosing when you came into my life.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway.
There's a jungle
Jungle in my heart.
I've got a run a runaway
I've got a run a runaway

But that I've break we will never part.
