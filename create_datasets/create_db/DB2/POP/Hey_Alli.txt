Says she wants to move to California
To chase down her dream
Says she wants to roll in some big movie
Or be a drama queen
Well, I'll roll with her
So she won't get hurt

Here it is
I'll lay it out for you
Here it is
I'm telling you the truth

Hey Alli
I'm falling faster all the time
It's all for you
This heart of mine
I'm in too deep
I fall to my knees
She's the girl of my dreams

Says she wants to move to New York City
And dance on the stage
On the crowded street, you look so pretty
Or in the pouring rain
Well, I'll roll with her
So she won't get hurt

Here it is
I'll lay it out for you
Here it is
I'm telling you the truth

Hey Alli
I'm falling faster all the time
It's all for you
This heart of mine
I'm in too deep
I fall to my knees
She's the girl of my dreams
She's the girl of my dreams

And if I fall apart
Just know these words are true
(Know these words are true)
And if I fall

Hey Alli
I'm falling faster all the time

Hey Alli
I'm falling faster all the time
It's all for you
This heart of mine
I'm in too deep
I fall to my knees
She's the girl of my dreams
(Hey Alli)

Hey Alli
I'm falling faster all the time
It's all for you
This heart of mine
I'm in too deep
I fall to my knees
She's the girl of my dreams
