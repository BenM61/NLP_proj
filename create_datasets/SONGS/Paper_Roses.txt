I'm picking petals off of paper roses
The clock is ticking and the waves are rollin'
No, I don't wanna live on the wayside
Yea, I feel how I feel even if I
Try to tell myself I'm only hoping

Truth is I don't wanna lose
What we have is fine but I know what I wanna do
Even just tonight

You got me under your waters
Your riptide pulling me farther
There's no saving me, I'm gone
What are we waiting here for?

Breathing's getting even harder
I can't take this any longer
You and I are all we want
What are we waiting here for?

Let's sneak away, this party ain't our style
You make me laugh so hard, it hurts to smile
You should know all it takes is a moment
Yea, my heart's on the line, don't you notice?
Why keep living in denial?

Truth is I don't wanna lose
What we have is fine but I know what I wanna do
Even just tonight

You got me under your waters
Your riptide pulling me farther
There's no saving me, I'm gone
What are we waiting here for?

Truth is I don't wanna lose
I know what I wanna do
Even just tonight

You got me under your waters
Your riptide pulling me farther
There's no saving me, I'm gone
What are we waiting here for?

Breathing's getting even harder
I can't take this any longer
You and I are all we want
What are we waiting here for?
What are we waiting here for?
What are we waiting here for?
What are we waiting here for?
What are we waiting here for?
