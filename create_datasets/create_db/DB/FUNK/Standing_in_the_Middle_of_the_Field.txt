Find love, build it on sand, build it on bricks
build it on land
Find love swinging in the wind, watching it some more, build it back again
Find love lying on the shore drifting out to sea
lost forever more
Find love strangest of thing
But chaos inside
Peace that it brings

Oh, oh, oh watch me slowly fall apart
You've gotta give up the things you love to make it better
Holding on but holding on is hurt
You've gotta give up the things you love to make it better

Find love, build it on sand build it on bricks
build it on land
Find love swinging in the wind watching it some more build it back again
Find love lying on the shore drifting out to sea
lost forever more
Find love strangest of thing
But chaos inside
Peace that it brings

Oh, oh, oh watch me slowly fall apart
You've gotta give up the things you love to make it better
Holding on but holding on is hurt
You've gotta give up the things you love to make it better
