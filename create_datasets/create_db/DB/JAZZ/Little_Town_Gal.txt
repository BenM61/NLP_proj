You're just a little town gal,
Don't you go to the city,
The buildings are tall
And the folks got no pity,
There'll be no one there you know just to say hello,
Little town gal.

Folks don't care
If you're blue or unhappy,
That's when you'll miss
Your maw and your pappy!
You'll be wearing out your shoes with a case of blues,
Little town gal.

And when you wake up in the morning,
How you'll miss the sights that used to greet your eyes,
Oh, of the country you were born in,
You'll miss those southern sunny skies.

You're just a little town gal,
Don't you go to the city,
Stay home with your folks
And you'll be sitting mighty pretty,
So listen here to me and be proud to be
A little town gal.
