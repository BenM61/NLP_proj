I talk for a reason
Sing for a reason
Some may say I lost my mind
Trust for a reason
Fight for a reason
Look around there ain't much time
To say what you wanna say
Do what you wanna do
Live your life all the way
Oh my God
Got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way open up your eyes
And see that all is new to me
Oh my God
Got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way open up your eyes
And see that all is to be me
Oooh it looks so fake
Stop looking away
It's all in you
Oooh it's all in you
Baby
It's all in you
Oooh it's all in you
I walk all the season
Change all my reason
An open mind an open heart
Try with them visions
Them but my intuitions
Never feel me never hurt
Just feel how you wanna feel
The deeper the real
Die to spend that wheel
Oh my God Got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way open up your eyes
And see that all is new to me
Oh my God
Got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way open up your eyes
And see that all is to be me
Oooh it looks so fresh
Stop looking away
It's all in you
You, you, it's all in you
Baby
It's all in you
You, you it's all in you
Oh my God, cards are on the
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh my God, cards are on the
Oh my God, cards are on the table, quick
Got to play the game, no, no, no
Oh my God, cards are on the table
We just got to play the game
No way, open up your eyes
And see, oh
Oh my God, cards are on the table, quick
Got to play the game
No way, open up your eyes
And see that all is to be me
All is to be me
All is to be me
All is to be me
All is to be me

Don't look so fresh
Stop looking away
It's all in you
You, you, it's all in you
Baby
It's all in you
You, you, you, you, you, you
Baby
Baby
Baby
