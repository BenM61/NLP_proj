Yes, be careful with a fool
'Cause someday he may get smart
Well, be careful with a fool
'Cause someday he may get smart
Well, he'll treat you so cold and chilly
Till it will hurt you to your heart

Well, I hate to remember
What a fool I used to be
Well, I hate to remember
How foolish I used to be
Well, you know the way I used to love you, baby
And how bad you treated me

I used to cry about you baby
Yes, and walk the streets late at night
Oh, I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
Well, if you love me a little bit, darlin'
Why in the world don't you treat me right?

Yes, look out

Well, it's finally over, baby
Baby, I know this is the end
Well, it's finally over, woman
And I know this is the end
Well, I've got you off of my mind
Babe, and I'm doing all right again
