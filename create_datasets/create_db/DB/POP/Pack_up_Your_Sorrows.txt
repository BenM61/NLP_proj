No use cryin', talking to a stranger
Namin' the sorrow you've seen
Too many sad times, too many bad times
Nobody knows what you mean

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use ramblin', walkin' in the shadows
Trailin' a wanderin' star
No one beside you, no one to hide you
Nobody knows where you are

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use gamblin' runnin' in the darkness
Looking for spirit that's free
Too many wrong times, too many long times
Nobody knows what you see

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use roamin', lying by the roadside
Seekin' a satisfied mind
Too many highways, too many byways
And nobody's walkin' behind

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me
