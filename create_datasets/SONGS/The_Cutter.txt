Brewing alternatives 
What's in the bottom drawer 
Waiting for things to give 

Spare us the cutter 
Spare us the cutter 
Couldn't cut the mustard 

Conquering myself 
Until I see another hurdle approaching 
Say we can, say we will 
Not just another drop in the ocean 

Come to the free for all 
With cellotape & knives 
Some of them six feet tall 
We will escape our lives 

Spare us the cutter 
Spare us the cutter 
Couldn't cut the mustard 

Conquering myself 
Until I see another hurdle approaching 
Say we can, say we will 
Not just another drop in the ocean 

Am I the happy loss 
Will I still recoil 
When the skin is lost 
Am I the worthy cross 
Will I still be soiled 
When the dirt is off 

Conquering myself 
Until I see another hurdle approaching 
Say we can, say we will 
Not just another drop in the ocean 
Ocean 

Watch the fingers close 
When the hands are cold 

Am I the happy loss 
Will I still recoil 
When the skin is lost 
Am I the worthy cross 
Will I still be soiled 
When the dirt is off 

Am I the happy loss 
Will I still be soiled 
When the dirt is off
