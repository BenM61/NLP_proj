Seems like yesterday
We were still children with all our dreams
Tomorrows dreams
Only yesterday you and I promised each other love
Forever love
But now you're gone
And our dreams are scattered like the leaves of fall
And I wish I knew what happened to them all
Cause no matter where I go or what I do
There's always you
No one but you
Its always you um hum
Things change
People change
Growing up lovers can grow apart
So far apart
We dreamed different dreams
There I was watching you drift away
So far away
But I believe
That a love like ours was somehow meant to be
And I'll see the day when you come back to me
Cause no matter where I go
Or what I do
There's always you
No one but you
All, all always you

There's always you
Oh,oh,oh yeah ooh hoo
Its always you
But I believe
That a love like ours
Was somehow meant to be
And I'll see the day when you come back to me
Cause no matter where I go or what I do
There's always you
No one but you
Its always you
Oh oh oh ,oh yeah,yeah
Always
Yeah,yeah, always

Seems like yesterday
Um hum
