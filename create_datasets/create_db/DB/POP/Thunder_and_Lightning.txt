Yeah
Aww
I never ever thought I'd ever get tired of playing games
Ooh, but I've been holding back for too long
Now the time has come I'm gonna get it right
Now's the time to show them all that they're wrong 

Oh oh 'cause they said thunder and they said lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, then why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, oh it feels alright 
Feels alright, alright

I never ever did believe in guiding lights
'Cause what you didn't hold, slipped away
Oh but there's a feeling deep down in my shoes
'Cause things look like they're going my way 

Ah ha, 'cause they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, then why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, so nice, it feels alright 

Yeah
Oh
I never ever did believe in a second chance
You get, just one crack of the whip, that's all
If you played the game, you got treated right
Oh, but I'm not playing the game, no more

Ah ho, and they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh, but if that's true, then why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice
Ah ho, and they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh, but if that's true, then why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice
So nice
When they say thunder, they say lightning
It would never strike twice
