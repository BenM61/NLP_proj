Forward yesterday makes me wanna stay
What they said was real makes me wanna steal
Living under house guess I'm living I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time got no meaning just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be 

Feeling uninspired think I'll start a fire
Everybody run Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 'guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be 

Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 'guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be
