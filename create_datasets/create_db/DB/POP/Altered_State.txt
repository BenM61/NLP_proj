So far things have been all right 
No complaints, oh, this is the good life 
But sometimes I need more 
Just to get up and out the door 

I like to live in an altered state 
It makes me love all the things I hate 
And I'm happy to be alive 
Don't want to come off too straight 
I like to put on my happy face 
While I cry on the inside 

Is it so hard to be happy 
That I struggle to feel just okay
And I need a lift just to get through 
Just to get up to normal with you 

I like to live in an altered state 
It makes me love all the things I hate 
And I'm happy to be alive 
Don't want to come off too straight laced 
I like to put on my happy face 
While I cry on the inside 

Yeah, sometimes I need more 
Just to get up off the floor 

I like to live in an altered state 
It makes me love the things I hate 
And I'm happy to be alive 
Don't want to come off too straight laced 
I like to put on my happy face 
While I cry on the inside
