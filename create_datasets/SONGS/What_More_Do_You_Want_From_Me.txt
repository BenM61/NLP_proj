What more do you want from me
I just about given you all of me
More than your eyes can see
After all I've done for you, oh baby
You gave me to 

What more do you want from me 
What more do you want from me 
What more do you love about me
After all that you've done for me
I love you yes-sir-e

I tried to do my best
We can't stand the test
Forget all about the rest
Your love is more than truth, oh baby
I just want the best for me and you

What more do you want from me 
What more do you want from me 
What more do you love about me
After all that you've done for me
I love you yes-sir-e

You won, you won my heart, baby
Where do, where do we start
What more do you want from my heart
After all you've done for me
Oh baby I love you yes-sir-e

What more do you want from me 
What more do you want from me 
What more do you love about me
After all that you've done for me
I love you yes-sir-e

Think it about it baby
One more
Think it about it baby
One more
Think it about it baby
Oh
