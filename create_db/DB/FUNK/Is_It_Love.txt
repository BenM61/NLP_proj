Got an angel at my bedside
Watching over me tonight
Smiling from a photograph
And everything's just right

Been dreaming of you before
And now it's true
My heart is beating just for you
Baby I want to know

[Chorus]
Is it love?
Is it love?
Is it why I fall everytime you call?
Is it love, really love?
When you say it's forever
Is it love?
Is it love?
That I'm breathing
When I dream of you tonight

Tell me how can I imagine
Something brighter than your eyes
No-one ever came this close
You made me realize

Been dreaming of you before
And now it's true
My heart is beating just for you
Baby I want to know

[Chorus]

Is it always gonna be
Will you always care for me
Is all that I want
All that I need
Is it all I ever hoped for
Baby

[Chorus]
