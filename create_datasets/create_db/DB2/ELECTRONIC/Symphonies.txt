I come disguise I was hypnotized
Lost a track, struggled back
I wanted easy stuff to please me
Something in the dark began to squeeze me
Seen it, there, then there in the mirror
Totally focused, no hocus pocus
Dare I give in to this thing gripping my skin
To win, thinking how to
As

The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams
Come out

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

I lie down in the dust just under your eye
A scrap of paper, thin as vapor
Filling my clothes like smoke
A couple of the wires in my heart are broke
I throw, I miss, something, nothing
But dreams, schemes, moments wasted
Taste I tasted
Fate I'm fated
Re-edited again then copy pasted
As

The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams
Come out

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

When I wanna quit, I suffocate it
I chew bubblicious, stress repetitious
Vicious, I'm one outsider
Up above the streets on the DCY-er
Higher, fire in my guts
In a rut, but what I've got
Is in no can, no other human
But I do get lonely, scared I'm phony
As

The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams
Come out

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
