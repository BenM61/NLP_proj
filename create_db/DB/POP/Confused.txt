Confused, confused every time I'm lost in your arms
Confused, confused by the way my heart sounds alarm
Are all your dreams for me alone
Or is there one who shares my throne

Abused, misused, tell me why you must hurt me so
Oh it's wrong sweetheart you know
There may come the day
When I hear you say
That you too have been confused

(Confused, confused every time I'm lost in your arms
Confused, confused by the way my heart sounds alarm)

Abused, misused, tell me why you must hurt me so
Oh it's wrong sweetheart you know
There may come that day
When I hear you say
That you too have been confused
