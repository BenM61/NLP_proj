Do you wanna be a poet and write
Do you wanna be an actor up in lights
Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love
Do you wanna travel the world
Do you wanna be a diver for pearls
Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above

Be anyone you want to be
Bring to life your fantasies
But I want something in return

I want you to burn
Burn for me baby 
Like a candle in my night
Oh burn
Burn for me burn for me

Are you gonna be a gambler and deal
Are you gonna be a doctor and heal
Or go to heaven and touch God's face
Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps
Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps
Or an angel under grace

I'll lay down on your bed of coals 
Offer up my heart and soul
But in return

I want you to burn 
Burn for me baby 
Like a candle in my night
Oh burn
Burn for me burn for me

Laugh for me, cry for me
Pray for me, fly for me
Live for me, die for me

I want you to burn
Burn for me baby
Like a candle in my night
Oh burn
Burn for me burn for me
