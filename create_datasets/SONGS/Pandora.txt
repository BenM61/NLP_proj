Our room, a hot and big and kick and burn our group 
Attack our tacky home
(I'm in the lights with him)

I feel I'm cheating when I sing shudder 
And can I and mourn and tis an arm for us

I feel I've been

(Ferdinand and was sad a lot in her house)
(Falling over hers)
Feed me you've pretended if I were you 
To fall for her for little Ferdinand fast kettle

(Ferdinand and was sad a lot in her house)
For good for better Fred is dead will flee ill feef
Aloof from waft a coffee effort
(I'm at home in lance)

Falled on yanks
(Ferdinand and was sad a lot in her house)
