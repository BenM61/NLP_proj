Thinkin' ?bout cha baby all of the time
I wake in the mornin' with you on my mind
I think I must be dreamin'  - too good to be true
It's so amazin' just what love can do

Baby you've given me the sweetest emotions
And now that I've found you I'm never gonna let you go

Because I'm with you
My dreams have come true
And baby I'm oh so happy with you
I feel so alive
?Cause this love is so right
And that's why I'm oh so happy with you

Whenever you're around me I need your touch
Ooh you drive me crazy - I want ya so much
Keep doin' what you're doin' ?cause it feels so good
It's so amazin' - that's what love can do

Baby you've given me the sweetest emotions
An now that I've found you I'm never gonna let you go

Because I'm with you
My dreams have come true
And baby I'm oh so happy with you
I feel so alive
?Cause this love is so right
And that's why I'm oh so happy with you

Make me happy, so happy, do do do do, baby I'm so happy with you 
Make me happy, so happy, do do do do, baby I'm so happy with you

Baby you've given me the sweetest emotions
An now that I've found you I'm never gonna let you go

Because I'm with you
My dreams have come true
And baby I'm oh so happy with you
I feel so alive
?Cause this love is so right
An' that's why I'm oh so happy with you
