I had a similar dream
My dream was real though
I left my body in the bed.

I took my clutch and pipe
Climbed out the window
And I was something else instead.

Automechanic, I never worry
I have a garden and a radio.

Made all my own tools
Minding my business
Trade you a tune for some gasoline.

Out in the country I met a good man
Found my body in the bed.

We traveled far and wide
In some of my favorite rides
Working on engines and making them run again.

Now I'm a farmer
Praying for rain
But we have the children and the radio.

Made all my own tools
Minding my business
Trade you a tune for some gasoline.

Automechanic, I never worry

Made all my own tools
Yeah, I can machine
Trade you a tune for some gasoline.
