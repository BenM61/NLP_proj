Though I owe you,
I owe you no allegiance
But I still feel guilty for the things that I have done 
These past fifteen days

It was easy
To just let it happen
I've been with people who sing gorgeous songs
While you're just ringing in my ear

And filling with envy
Who will you turn to now?
It was your decision I won't hear you 
With hating and screaming still ringing in my ear

You threw me away
Away to the jackals
But the jackals they showed me a good time
While you're just ringing in my ear

I toasted marshmallows
While you burned our bridges down
And I looked at landscapes that I had forgotten
Lit up by the fire

And filling with envy
Who will you turn to now?
It was your decision I won't hear you 
With hating and screaming still ringing in my ear

It's a sunny September
The colors are bright here
And the birds sing of beautiful places
While you are just ringing in my ear
