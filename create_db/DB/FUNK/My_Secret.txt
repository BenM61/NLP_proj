Whoa, I've got a secret
Nobody knows
The thrills and the glows
The ebbs and the flows

Whoa, I've got a secret
It's staring in me
It won't let me free
My future to be

Yes, I've got a secret
It changes me as time goes by
It's strange that no one knows why
But I

What's happened to me is wondrous to see
My future will be married to me
That is my secret

(Nobody knows)
Nobody knows
(The thrills and the glows)
The thrills and the glows
The ebbs and the flows

Whoa, I've got a secret
(It's staring in me)
It's staring in me
(It won't let me free)
It won't let me free
My future to be

Yes, I've got a secret
It changes me as time goes by
It's strange that no one knows why
But I

What happens to me is wondrous to see
My future will be married to me
That is my secret
