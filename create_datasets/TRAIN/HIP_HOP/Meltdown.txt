I was hesitant at first 
Thinking it ain't the right time 
Egg shell hearts just cracked 
Crying on the train 

Fearful of the facts 
The sorrows and the morals 
And the Chinatown whispers that would 
Obviously be muttered by the dogs 

Now compassion I don't lack 
Just heart filled with runner beans 
And feet like in running shoes 
And yes it was just you and me 
Just fly 

Trap doors are bound 
No turning round
Set course for the rocks mate, chin up 
Watch us sink without a sound 
Watch us sink without a sound 

I think we're on the meltdown 
I feel it in my bones, you know 
I don't feel right 
I don't feel right 
I think we're on the meltdown 
I feel it in my bones, you know 
I don't feel right 
I don't feel right 

So now I'm second guessing yes and no 
Blood pumps regular 
But skin feels icy cold 
And flights old, are melting with the past 

So it won't be forever then 
I can't do forever friends 
Cause something in my character just takes a hold 
And throws me out the car 

Maybe if I looked afar 
I could stop the catastrophe 
But you and me weren't meant to be 
And someone somewhere knew it from the start 

Now it's love that soaks my heart 
I contemplate the dark 
And superglue the memories and better days 
The times that made you laugh 
The times that made you laugh 

I think we're on the meltdown 
I feel it in my bones, you know 
I don't feel right 
I don't feel right 
I think we're on the meltdown 
I feel it in my bones, you know 
I don't feel right 
I don't feel right 

I think we're on the meltdown 
I feel it in my bones, you know 
I don't feel right 
I don't feel right 
I think we're on the meltdown 
I feel it in my bones, you know 
I don't feel right 
I don't feel right 

I don't mean to disappoint and tear apart 
But baby it's my heart 
This time I got to follow it 
I don't mean to disappoint and tear apart 
But baby it's my heart 
This time I got to follow it 

This time I got to follow it 
This time I got to follow it 
This time I got to follow it 
This time I got to follow it
