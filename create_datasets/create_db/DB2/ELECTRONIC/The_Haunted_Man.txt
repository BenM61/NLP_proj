I couldn't sleep last night
'Cause I tried to forget you
In the suffocated air
I resolved to let you go

Twisted all our dreams
Til you became the nightmare
Close it off inside
Or else the hurt is gonna rise

I couldn't sleep last night
'Cause I tried to forget you
Heard the old man and the sea
Singing low

And the silver fir she cried
Never forget had gone and died
And the babes that clung to her
Had all let go

My dear she touched my skin
And oh did the skin
Set a burning
My dear she touched my skin

Where once we kissed and ran
The memory scorched the man
I have to tell you dear (ask me to hold you and I)
Death has become my breathing (far away gone and I)

My dear she touched my skin (ask me to tell you I)
And oh she did, she touched my skin (holding the ghost of a man I)
Where once we kissed and ran (ask me to tell you I)
This madness haunted the man (holding the ghost of a man)

Still I'm holding out my hand
Standing by my haunted man
Yes, your ghosts have got me too
But it's me and you
I can't run

Still I'm holding out my hand
Standing by my haunted man
Yes, your ghosts have got me too
But it's me and you
I can't run
