Is anybody there?
I mean I hope somebody out there can hear this right here.
Just listen.

You're gonna drive me crazy (don't do that).
You're gonna drive me mad (don't do that).
Better things are coming.
I said there's truth in that.

Yo, what better things can you hear them sing?
Ain't this like a celebration?
Swiss gears to the top we steer,
Notice my acceleration.
I do it for the have not's,
For the boy playing ball on the block.
Xaphoon told me that this was the shot,
So I stopped skipping math
And I came with a plot, plot.
I've prolly moved onto my next axis.
And if she calling, I don't care about what my ex asks.
Why, cause I'm in a lab like Bill Nye the Science Guy.
Flyer than fly,
I could jump over top of the Empire State building,  just glide.

Harder to fail.
You see a train, don't be the fool that jumps on the rail.
High on the scale, if a nail girl said it.
I am well endowed like Harvard and Yale.
Ladies man, Jesse Katsopolis.
I'm getting shows booked, I be the noblest.
Superman, metropolis.
I profit off my topic hits.
Periodically, I'm in my element, phosphorus.
I'm prosperous, say we loud and too rockerish.
Pro, how long are you lockin' this?
I say until apocalypse, I got this shh'

You're gonna drive me crazy.
You're gonna drive me mad.
You've got an angel on your shoulder.
Making hairpins out of glass.
Baby, don't be unhappy.
Baby, don't be sad.
Better things are coming.
I swear there's truth in that.
Don't do that.
