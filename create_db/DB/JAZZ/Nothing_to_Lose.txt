Nothing to lose
If we are wise
We're not expecting rainbow-colored skies
Not right away

Nothing to lose
It might be fun
No talk of spending lifetimes in the sun
Although we may

Both you and I have seen what time can do
We'll only hurt ourselves if we build dreams that don't come true

What can we lose
We know the score
Let's wait before we talk of evermore
One day we may

Nothing to lose
But much to gain if love decides to stay

[repeat the last three sections]

Nothing to lose
