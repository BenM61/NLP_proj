I've been silent partner, I've been your shrink
I have heard you say: "look misfortuous speech"
But I'll have sympathy when you get off your seat
Before "there's been a mess" becomes a disease

I have cracked the code on this old machine
Ten thousands hours to be released
But I've been wondering, why can't you see?
If the door opens up we go where it leads

I have been waiting
For you to find
That all of this could be yours
Be yours tonight

Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!

You were packing up but I gave you a bed
You would rather crash then go straight ahead
I wrote this years ago but it's finished today
With the help of a friend who is finished the same

And I have been waiting
But you need a sign
That all of this could be yours
Be yours tonight

I have been patient
But you've got to try
Then all of this could be yours
Be yours tonight

Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!
Could be yours!

All this could be yours
And all this could be yours
And all this could be yours
And all this could be yours, could be yours
All this could be yours
