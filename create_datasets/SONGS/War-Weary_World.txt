Well, it only took a moment
For the cages to explode
I say it must be released
From corruption of the soul, but oh

Have you heard the latest cry?
Yeah, we've heard it all before
A weapon falls from the sky
Yeah we've seen it all before

Buildings live and people die
War weary world

It's the song of quiet courage
From the children of the night
That learned the price of freedom
They've learned to live to fight

Have you heard the reasons why?
Yeah we've heard it all before
But have you seen the nation cry?
Yeah we've seen it all before

Many times, many times
War weary world
War weary world

Love breaks a man
Sends him ruin
Love rebuilds him
Brings him ruin

It's a time of strange teaching
Hear the moanings of regret
From the schools of revolution
The stages have been set
Oh, but listen

It seems wars are meant to happen
And pain is meant to be
But if hope is eternal
Then a hiding place for you and me

Have you heard the latest cry?
Yeah we've heard it all before
A weapon falls from the sky
Yeah we've seen it all before

Buildings live and people die
War weary world
War weary world
