I'm never strong on my own, but you and I, we belong
We are young and we are free
I'm never strong on my own, but you and I, we belong
We are young and we are free

Oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh oh

I could never live up to you
And I could never really answer
And I could never live up to you
I really need you, I really need you

We walk alone on our own, you can't deny, we belong
We are young and we are free
We talk a lot about home, but tonight, we will run
We are young and we are free

I'm fine, I just need time, I gotta get you right off of my mind
Ooh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh oh

I could never live up to you
And I could never really answer
And I could never live up to you
I really need you, I really need you
I'll raise my cup and strip it to you
I'll take my drink and toast it to us
But I still never live up to you
I really need you, I really need you
