Burning down Neverland, scatter the ashes
White lines, black tar, the matches
Is this another dead by misadventure?
Tell me what you got, what you really got, hey, hey

We'll rest in our graves
Lexington, course your veins
Sleepers can't just wake the dead
When needles and lovers collapse on guilty beds

Fall asleep
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep

They lied when they said that the good die young
They lied when they said the good die young, whoa, oh, oh, oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight

Burning down bridges now, scatter the ashes
Godspeed to all you're after
Is this a life left just to remember?
Tell them who you were, who you really were, hey, hey

Kill yourself slowly over time
Fashion statement suicide
She's still asleep in the Chelsea hotel
Bad turns to worse and the worse turns into hell

Fall asleep
Don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep

God saved the eyes that are dim tonight
They lied when they said the good die young, whoa, oh, oh, oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight

Whoa, oh, oh, oh

They lied when they said the good die young, whoa, oh, oh, oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight
They lied when they said the good die young, whoa, oh, oh, oh
They lied when they said the good die young
Stay with me, stay with me tonight
