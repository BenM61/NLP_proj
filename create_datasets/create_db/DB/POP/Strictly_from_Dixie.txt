I didn't get my Dixie drawl
A-drinkin' out of a Dixie cup
Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
And when I say, "I loves you all"

It's meant to be on the up-and-up
Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
When I came up from the South
I felt so down in the mouth

Then I took one look at you
And thought about Dixie skies of blue
I thought about sweet magnolias too
I never missed a cotton bowl

I like my tulips a trifle tall
Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
