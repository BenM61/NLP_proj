There's a mountain
Which I wanted to climb
With tears on my mind
And there's a love song
That I needed to write
For someone so right
And I have seen a million fading stars
They were shining so bright
Through a steamy night
There's more that could be put in words
Somethings that's true
And that's what I got from you

You are the one
Who's taking me there
You are the one
Breathing despair
You are the one
Who's shining on me
You are the one
Savin' my life
You light up my mind

And love was a good thing
When I needed to feel
That I always believed
Now I'll be holding on
To all the things that we have got
And get sadness for free
And there were stars that lead me far away
Now once I've turned the page
And now I keep holding on

You are the one...

Will you still believe
When I run out of rhyme
A streets of reason
I just can't deny
I'm still believing
In the truth of our rain
'Cause in the corner of my history
I'm hiding my pain

You are the one
Who's raising my care
You are the one
Breathing despair
You are the one
Who's taking me there
You are the one
Breathing despair
You are the one
Who's shining on me
You are the one
You gonna take me there
You are breathing despair
You're shining on me
You've savin' my life
You are the one
