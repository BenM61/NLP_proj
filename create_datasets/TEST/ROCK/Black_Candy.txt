Drip my blood,
Fall in love,
To my see you,
Mess my head,
Crush my heart,
Molten led,
Read my palm,
Give me some,

Black candy
Black candy

Spinning straw,
Into gold,
As she strikes,
Every soul,
Joan of Arc,
Upon hay,
Fallen chain you'll break,

Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy

Jack hammer,
Can't stand her,
Can't live unless I have her,
Sin, drippin' down my chin.

Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy

Burn baby, burn baby, burn baby, burn, baby burn, baby burn, baby burn, baby burn.

Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy

Suck my blood,
Join the club,
Breakfast dud,
Cross my heart,
Hope to care,
Pull my hair,
Take me there, (take me there!)

Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
Black candy
