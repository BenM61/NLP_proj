Well I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long

Where I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, I'm going out west
Out on the coast
Where the California girls
Are really the most

And I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

Well, the girls are frisky
In old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick
Wherever you go

And I'll walk
And they walk
I'll twist
And they twist
And I'll shimmy
And they shimmy
And I'll fly
And they fly
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
