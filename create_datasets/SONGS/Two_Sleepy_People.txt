Here we are, out of cigarettes, 
Holding hands and yawning; look how late it gets, 
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light, 
Too much in love to say good-night. 

Say, here we are, in this cozy chair, 
Picking on a wishbone from the Frigidaire, 
Two sleepy people, with nothing to say, 
Much to much in love to break away. 

Do you the remember the nights we used to linger in the hall? 
Papa didn't like you at all, 
But I was crazy 'bout you, baby! 
Do you remember the reason why we married in the Fall? 
To rent this little nest, and get a bit of rest! 

Well, here we are, just about the same, 
Gawky little fellow, dizzy little dame, 
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light, 
Much to much in love to say good-night. 

Good-night!
