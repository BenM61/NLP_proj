Waiting, we were waiting
As the traffic moved through all our hearts and our heads
But things were different then
For the quiet men

Shifting, things were shifting
Through the walls and hall, there were no walls at all
For the quiet friends
Of the quiet men

Oh, the quiet men
Oh, the quiet men

Springtime, there was sunshine
Through the window panes, down all the English lanes
Where they walked again
The quiet men

Talking, they were talking
Of the times to come, and all the time that's gone
And they smiled again
The quiet men

Oh, the quiet men
Oh, the quiet men

Listening, they were listening
As the season changed and all the reasons changed
And people came and went
By the quiet men

Walking, they were walking
Through the rainy days, looking at all the faces
But no-one ever noticed them
The quiet men

Oh
Oh, the quiet men
Oh, the quiet men
Oh, the quiet men
Oh, the quiet men
