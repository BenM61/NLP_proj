My sweet man's left me
And I've got a torch I must lose
I may have to die some
And surely I'll cry some
But I've gotta sing away these blues

It's heartbreak time now
And so it's a sad song I choose
You may find it dreary
But, Lord, I'm so weary
I've gotta sing away these blues

I thought my road was certain
He was mine, he was mine, he was mine
But then fate rang down the curtain
And all I have left is a heart that's bereft

And now it's over
And I'm still payin' love's dues
My heart was a glad thing 
That turned into sad thing
I've gotta sing away these blues

Yes, I've gotta sing away these blues
These blu-u-u-u-es
