Spread these wings open wide
Open wide to my grave
Spread these wings open wide
Open wide shed these braves

We only know our love is for you
We only know our love is for you

In the end you?re a page
Of words laying across the sky
Even the airplanes gaze away
Ah, but they never look down 
To read what you say

We only know our love is for you
We only know our love is for you
