I'm gonna wake you in the morning for hoe down time
You're gonna hear me come a-knockin' right on time
Forget about your sister, don't need her
I'm gonna wake you in the morning for hoe down time
I'm gonna get you now
Got what you're lookin' for
You'll never get it better, come o

I'm gonna dress you up in rubies, shine, shine, shine
And everybody's gonna love you at hoe down time
Gonna take my lover dancin' in dancin' shoes
And everybody's gonna know you at hoe down time
I'm gonna get you babe
You'll never get it better
Got what you're lookin' for

No use hiding or running away because I'll know where you are
Gypsy lady says you're in my future and I've wished on a star
