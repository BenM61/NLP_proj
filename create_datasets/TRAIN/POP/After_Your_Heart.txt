Can I have your attention?
What are we starting here?
Just look around you 'cause the answer is clear
Listen, listen and hear the coming sound
All of the children are singing it loud

Let's be the revolution
That lives for holding nothing back, nothing back

We're after Your heart, after Your heart
All of the walls now are breaking apart
Live like we see it, love like we mean it
This is the start we're after Your heart

Start the ascension, begin the holy climb
Up to where heaven and the earth collide
Bring your affection all that you have inside
Enter the kingdom and become alive

'Cause love with no condition
It lives for holding nothing back, nothing back

We're after Your heart, after Your heart
All of the walls now are breaking apart
Live like we see it, love like we mean it
This is the start we're after Your heart

Oh, let's go higher and higher
Hear the sound of the free
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Lift your soul join with the choir
Sing the song, let it ring
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

We're after Your heart
Never going to stop until we reach You

We're after Your heart, after Your heart
All of the walls now are breaking apart
Live like we see it, love like we mean it
This is the start we're after Your heart

We're after Your heart
Never going to stop until we reach You
