I couldn't tell you a thing about that night
Between the drinks and the blinding lights
But even if just for a moment or two
I danced with you, I danced with you, I danced with you
Stumbling onto an empty street
Almost escaping my memories
But in the morning when I came to
I thought of you, I thought of you, I thought of you

Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable

Unforgettable
Unforgettable

Of every beautiful lie that I've been told
Yours is the one I like the most
Yours is the one that I hold so close
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost, give up the ghost
It was just one night, it was just one night
Now I can't get you off of my mind
It was just one time, it was just one time
Even if you'll never be mine

Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable

Unforgettable
I see your face, unforgettable

I see your (unforgettable)
I see your
Unforgettable
I see your face, unforgettable

Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable
Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable
