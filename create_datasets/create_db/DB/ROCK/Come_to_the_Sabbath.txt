Come, come to the Sabbath
Down by the ruined bridge
Witches and demons are coming
Just follow the magic call
Come, come to the Sabbath
Down by the ruined bridge
Later on the master will join us
Called from the heart of Hell
First we light up the fire
And then we hail our Lord
Two candles, a black and white
Are placed upon the altar
North, South, East and West
And so we clean the air
High priestess invoking the Devil
Infernal a names are spoken

Come to the Sabbath, Sabbath
The ceremony's proceeding
It's time to grant your wishes
And evil curse on the priest
Who took the life of Melissa
Now we must close up the ritual
Lead the Enochian key
And so it will be done, Amen, now come
Come to the Sabbath, Sabbath

If you say heaven I say a castle of lies
You say forgive him I say revenge
My sweet Satan you're the one
