Candy-O, I need you
Sunday dress, ruby ring
Candy-O, I need you so
Could you help me in?

Purple hum, assorted cards
Razor lights you'll bring
And all to prove you're on the move
And vanishing

Candy-O, I need you so
Candy-O, I need you so

Edge of night, distract yourself
Obstacles don't work
Homogenize
Decentralize
It's just a quirk

Different ways to see you through
All the same in the end
Peculiar star, a-that's who you are
Do you have to win?

Candy-O, I need you so
Candy-O, I need you so

Candy-O, I need you so
(Candy-O)
Candy-O, I need you so
(Candy-O)
