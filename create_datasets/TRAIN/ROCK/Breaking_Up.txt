A handful of sand 
Is all that you grab
As you're watching the money fall
Right through your hands
It took such a long, long time now
To build on demand
But this is a war in the cradle of
This modern man

Does this mean we're breaking up? (x3)
Like stones again? (x2)

A mouthful of glass
That cuts up your words
You better watch that nothing's falling out
Watching nothing is heard

Does this mean we're breaking up? (x3)
Like stones again?

It took a long, long, long, long time 
To reverse, like a curse
It took a long, long, long, long time
Took long, long, long, long time

And these are the words in the pages of
And this is the law of unspoken love
And this is a war in the cradle of
This modern man

Does this mean we're breaking up? (x8)
Like stones again? (x8)
