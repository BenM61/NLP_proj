Na na na na

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend

Where would you be, be without me, we'll never find out
What would I do, do without you, we'll never know now

Talking bout the lights, the dirt, the shit, that hurts
We're not gonna turn around
We're doing this for good, for worse, the gift, the curse
We're not gonna back down

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

I wanna feel the sun, the waves, the wind in my face
The speed, the chase, na na na na
I wanna feel the sun, the waves, just run across states
Making up as we go

That's how's gonna be, young wild and free, not gonna slow down
Up to the max, until we crash, we're not gonna stop now

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

Na na na na (me and my girlfriend)
Na na na na (me and my girlfriend)

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride till the happy end
Is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
