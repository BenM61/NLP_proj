I took a breath onto a canvas
I could not have cared less
About the words spilling out of my mouth in blue and green
It was the nicest sound I'd ever seen
To come stumbling out of my frozen mouth

Sitting in a corner
Smoking a half-drug cigarette
Sitting in a corner
My half-imagined statuette

And with my hand upon my heart
I'll say that she's perfect
And with my hand upon my heart
I'll say that she worth it
And we all go...

Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going up, up

(Oh, (???) coming on the ceiling
Oh, (???) it's easier than feeling real)
(unfortunately, this is not in the lyrics. Help! -Minstrel)

Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, I'm up
