I know what lies beneath, I've seen the flash of teeth
Conspiring with the reef to sink our ship
The wind's a cheating wife, her tongue a thirsty knife
And she could take your life with one good kiss

Can you see the sky turn red?
As morning's light breaks over me
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea

I know the ocean speaks, I've heard her call to me
And smiling in my dreams she whispers this:
"The stars retreat behind their veil
The clouds are clinging to your sail
The storm is coming, can you see?"

Look and see the sky turn red
Like blood it covers over me
And soon the sea shall give up her dead
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea
