The Big Payback, whoo
Please, sir, get back, uh

Get down with my boyfriend, that ain't right
You holler and you cuss, you want to fight
Payback is the thing you gotta see
Ever do any damn thing to me
Sold me out for chicken change (yes you did)
Said my man had it all arranged
You handed me down, and that's a fact
And now you punk, you gotta get ready
For the big payback
 
I can do wheeling, I can do dealing
But I don't do no damn squealing
I can dig rapping, I can do scrapping
But I can't dig that backstabbing, no, uh huh

Better get ready, that's a fact
Get ready you mother for the big payback (the big payback)
