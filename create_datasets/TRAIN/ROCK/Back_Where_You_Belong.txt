I heard you're asking how I'm feeling
I guess I'll play it day by day 
I'm still around now, my heart is healing
But something's never gonna change 
'Cause now I know love ain't easy to find 
I let you go, now I'm changing my mind 

I know that love, it don't come easy
It took so long, it's been hard to find 
So love, you must believe me
Ain't gonna let it slip away
I know I was wrong
I want you back where you belong
Want you back where you belong
Back where you belong 

I played around now, I've done some dealing 
I found that love should be with you 
And so you're gone now, my head is reeling
Don't wanna be with someone new 
And so I go, with a feeling inside me
'Cause I know what I'm leaving behind 

I know that love, it don't come easy
It took so long, it's been hard to find 
So love, you must believe me
Ain't gonna let it slip away
I know I was wrong
I want you back where you belong
Want you back where you belong
Back where you belong

I guess in time I stop and think it over
Everything that we've been through 
This heart of mine may never find another
Who loves me just the way you do
Hey girl

I heard you're asking how I'm feeling
I guess I'll play it day by day
I'm still around now, my heart is healing
But something's never gonna change 
'Cause now I know love ain't easy to find 
I let you go, now I'm changing my mind 

I know that love, it don't come easy
It took so long, it's been hard to find 
So love, you must believe me
Ain't gonna let it slip away
I know I was wrong
I want you back where you belong
Back where you belong, hey, hey 

I know that love, it don't come easy
It took so long, it's been hard to find 
And so love, you must believe me
Ain't gonna let it slip away, baby
