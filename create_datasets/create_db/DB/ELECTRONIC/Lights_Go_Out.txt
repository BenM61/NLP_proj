I've got my red dress on
And my high heels too
A pleasure that's forbidden
I save it just for you

No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
I stand guilty, loving you again
No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
Lights go out, here I go again

And how further you talk
I'll put a spell on you
How can this be wrong
When it feels so good

No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
I stand guilty, loving you again
No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
Lights go out, here I go again

No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
I stand guilty, loving you again
No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
Lights go out, here I go again

I'll be your perfect lover
I'll be your guilty pleasure
Your dirty little secret
And you never, never ?

No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
I stand guilty, loving you again
No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
Lights go out, here I go again

You said you wanna set my soul free
But I'm just an object of your fantasy
You broke the promises you made to me
And I've learned the hard way
There's no guarantees

No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
I stand guilty, loving you again
No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
I stand guilty, loving you again

No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
I stand guilty, loving you again
No mercy, no pleasure, no sin
Lights go out, here I go again
