I get so lonely when I think of you
I get the feeling our love is never new
We watched each other going many different ways

Come with me let's meet at the station
Where we first started
Then we make love, life in the world
Seems like we're living on rainbows

Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express
Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express

You're dreaming of me, I am dreaming of you
How long will it be till the dreaming is through?
Take me now let's go for a ride

Come with me let's meet at the station
Where we first started
Then we make love, life in the world
Seems like we're living on rainbows

Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express
Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express

Come with me let's meet at the station
Where we first started
Then we make love, life in the world
Seems like we're living on rainbows

Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express
Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express

Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express
Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express

Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express
Take a ride
On the Honeymoon Express
