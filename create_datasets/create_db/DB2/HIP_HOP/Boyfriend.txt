Always hatin' on me when you talk, talk, talk
Be steppin' to me on the block, block, block
But I don't want your boyfriend
I don't want your boyfriend

Hatin' on me when you talk, talk, talk
Be steppin' to me on your block, block, block
But I don't want your boyfriend
I don't want your boyfriend

Oh yeah, come on girl
All this hate you have has really got to go
'cause we both get phat, and he ain't all that
And you don't seem to know
What's wrong with you?
Take a look around, see I got men to spare
I'm doin' my thang, sorry 'bout your man
But he just can't compare

Girls we need to stop doin' this
All this mess has got to end
I don't want your boyfriend

No, no, no, no

Always hatin' on me when you talk, talk, talk
Be steppin' to me on the block, block, block
But I don't want your boyfriend
I don't want your boyfriend

Hatin' on me when you talk, talk, talk
Be steppin' to me on your block, block, block
But I don't want your boyfriend
I don't want your boyfriend

Come on girl, what's it gonna take
To make you realize that
I'm in your shoes, I ain't hatin' on you
So there's no need to fight
And you see these guys, they be rollin' tight
They're ?? you can't divide
But a guy walks in and we can't be friends
And it just isn't right

Girls we need to stop doin' this
All this mess has got to end
I don't want your boyfriend

Always hatin' on me when you talk, talk, talk
Be steppin' to me on the block, block, block
But I don't want your boyfriend
I don't want your boyfriend

Hatin' on me when you talk, talk, talk
Be steppin' to me on your block, block, block
But I don't want your boyfriend
I don't want your boyfriend
