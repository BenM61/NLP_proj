I'll take the plans this time
And I'll change them all, da-da-da-da-da
I'll take the plans this time
And I'll take control

It's alright now
Alright now

Strength alone in the steel and the backbone
Strength alone's by and by
All alone in the steel and the stone, it's
All alone by and by

I'll take the plans this time
And I'll change them all, da-da-da-da-da
I'll take the plans this time
And I'll take control

It's alright now
Alright now

Strength alone in the steel and the backbone
Strength alone's by and by
All alone in the steel and the stone, it's
All alone by and by
