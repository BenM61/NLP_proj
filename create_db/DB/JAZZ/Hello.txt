Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello

I tried to tell them that I didn't want to sing
But I'd gladly write a song instead
They said okay and everything was cool
Till a camera tried to get in my bed

Hello, my bed, hello, hello

I was sittin' pretty with a beautiful friend ("oh, darling")
When this man tries to get in the car ("'ey Prince, c'mon, give us a smile, eh?")
No introduction, "how you been?"
Just "up yours, smile, that's right, you're a star!" (star)

You call 'em bodyguards but I call 'em my friends
I guess I'm used to havin' 'em around
And cameras, by nature, like rewards
That's the trouble I get when I'm uptown

I'm not afraid to die (don't be afraid)
('Cause there's a better place to go) oh no, there's a better place
I eat what I want (you can eat what you want)
Whole-wheat toast (anything is cool in moderation)
And I'm happy, and that's for sure

We're against hungry children
Our record stands tall
But there's just as much hunger here at home

We'll do what we can
If y'all try and understand
A flower that has water will grow
And the child misunderstood will go

Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

Everybody we're against hungry children
Our record stands tall
There's just as much hunger here at home

We'll do what we can
Y'all try to understand
A flower that has water will grow
And the child misunderstood will go

Our record stands tall, you know
Give us time and love will show

Hello
