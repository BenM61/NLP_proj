[Don Omar] 
Saquen los habanos, que se juntaron el boricua why el cubano, my life's en la mano, 

(Chorus) 
Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui))x3 

[Cuban Link] 
(verse one) 
Yeah, yo, bori, shorty's a naughty one, 
All she wants is a forty and a blunt, 
As naughty as a front, just to get the party crunk, 
So rump, shake and reggaeton, and some puerto rican rum, 
A thong and a pair of pumps to freak it when she's drunk, 
And it's done- I got it all recorded by the tons, 
Even caught it in her buns for the right amount of funds, 
She stunts just for the fun of it, her story's just to front- 
For the chumps, I'm the one who taught her how to hump, 
How to pump, how to bump 'n grind, no frontin from behind, 
How to become a dime, she had to be one of a kind, 
Now she's something fine, sweeter than Dunkin Hines, 
Try to pump your mind up to sign on the dotted line, 
And I ain't having it, she's only for the bagging it, 
And stabbing it, the broad seen more draws than a cabinet, 
To put a cap in it, she tapped the whole hood- 
Like any ho would, I tell ya, she no good 

(Chorus) 
Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui)) x5 

(verse two) 
Yo god, you part of my fam, you my man, 
Understand nigga, handle this, 
The word in los angeles is she banging in sandwiches, 
I'm in and she ran the triz, she's taking a gang of dicks, 
Far from them amateurs, I start with a scandalous nature, 
Ain't nothing you can do about it, cause you already knew about it 
Before you even started, and you're still tryin to change her, 
I'll turn in your lawyer, goddess don't be modest, 
Whatever she wanted she got it, but she still went on and played ya, 
And now you want to pout about it, thought that she was bout it bout it, 
Gave her your heart, but she just wanted your paper, 
I told you you could do without it, you was just a fool who doubt it, 
But you went at it, don't worry about it, 

dile voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui, 
Jamas podria aguantar el que si ella se va( tenga que morir)x2 

(Chorus) 
Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui))x5 

(verse three) 
I'm pretty sure I seen her face before, 
In a different place before, 
And it's not deja vu, 
Could have sworn that we blazed before, 
Back in the days on tour, 
Shorty I know you, 
Now I knew I seen her face before, 
She was that crazy broad, 
Who went and blazed the whole crew, 
I don't have to trace her face no more, 
I rest my case I'm sure, girl you know it's true
