I see nothing in your eyes
And the more I see the less I like
Is it over yet
In my head

I know nothing of your kind
And I won't reveal your evil mind
Is it over yet
I can't wait

So sacrifice yourself
And let me have whats left
I know that I can find
The fire in your eyes

I'm going all the way
Get away
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be

You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I'll be the death of you
This will be all over soon
Pour salt into the open wound

Is it over yet
Let me in

So sacrifice yourself
And let me have whats left
I know that I can find
The fire in your eyes

I'm going all the way
Get away
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be

You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I'll be the death of you

I'm waiting
I'm hating
Realize
Start hiding

You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be

You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I'll be the death of you
