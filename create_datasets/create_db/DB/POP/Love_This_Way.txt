I want to run into someones arms
Lie on a bed of roses
I want to feel just like Juliet
I want to fall in love
I've got a feeling

Everybody wants someone to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way
I know I do 
What about you?

I want to be somebody's baby
I want to cry and still feel beautiful
Maybe I really just want to be myself
Am I the only one
I've got a feeling

Everybody wants someone to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way
I know I do
What about you?

See I do 
I do doesn't everybody want to give their heart away
I do 
Doesn't everybody want to be in love this way
Cause I do

Everybody wants someone to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way

I want to feel like an angel
I want to fly on a beam of moonlight
I want to see heaven from the inside
I want to feel just like Juliet
I want to feel just like Juliet
Juliet Juliet

Everybody wants someone to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way
