We'll take this nowhere town
And turn it into something

And set the wheels in motion

Going out in a flash of light
You know it goes with the territory
When you run the night

And nothing's standing in your way
Take it all the way from zero

And turn it inside out yeah inside out

While others only follow

And bet against tomorrow
Storm the barricade
And cross that line of fire
