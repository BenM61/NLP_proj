Is there something going on?
Well
I maybe right but I could be wrong.
It's a mystery - I got circumstantial evidence.
Well
I can't be sure 'cause it all depends on you and me.
(What will be will be.)

Tell me what you're gonna do
You know you hold the vital clue to my destiny.
Well
I'm your judge and jury
And I sentence you to life with me for eternity.
(You've been found guilty).

It's a love trial and I ain't gonna set you free.
It's a love trial (you can't win)
it's a love trial.
And I ain't gonna hear your plea 'cause it's a love trial.
(You can't win).

I'm gonna lock you up and make you mine forever
'Cause you stole my heart and that's a major felony.

Got to have you
can't you see 
'Cause we've got love in the first degree.
Gonna run you in
I've got witnesses
Who'll testify that it's only you who can satisfy;
You just can't win (that would be a sin).

Tell me what you're gonna do
. . .

It's a love trial and I ain't gonna set you free. . . .
I'm gonna lock you up and make you mine forever .

Gonna get your heart
you can't get free
'Cause you got love in the first degree.
And I sentence you to eternity 'cause you've been found feel free.
There ain't no way you're gonna get loose
So don't you try there ain't no use.
You're caught in a track and you can't get back.
So you better be cool and take a rule.

I'm gonna lock you up and make you mine forever . . .
It's a love trial and I ain't gonna set you free. . . .
It's a love trial and I ain't gonna set you free. . . .
