Of the wonderful things that you get out of life there are four.
And they may not be many but nobody needs any more.
Of the many facts making the list of life,
Truth takes the lead.
And to relax knowing the gist of life,
It's truth you need.

Then the second is honor and happiness makes number three.
When you put them together you know what the last one must be.
Baby so truth, honor and happiness
And one thing more,
Meaning only wonderful, wonderful love that'll make four.

Baby so truth, honor and happiness
And one thing more,
Meaning love and that's the real score and more than enough when times are tough and poor.
They may not comprise a lot
Still (you) only got those four.
And there ain't no more.
