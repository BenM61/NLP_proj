W: I know just how bad I've hurt you 
T: Oh yeah 
W: Let me make it up some way 
What can I do just to prove I love you 
Should I beg on my knees? Baby, please come home 

[Chorus] 
T: Come home baby 
W: Baby, just come on home 
T: Come home baby 
W: Need your love so bad 
T: Come home baby 
W: Need you by my side 
T: Come home baby 

W: I'll be good to you, I promise 
I'll do anything you say 
I want your kiss; I can't go on like this 
Keep me bad if you must, baby just come home 

[Chorus] 

W: What can I do just to prove I love you 
Should I beg on my knees? Baby, please come home 

[Chorus]
