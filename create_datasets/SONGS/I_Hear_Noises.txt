I am disappointed 
Every morning that I wake up
I am disappointed by the feeling 
Of waking up next to you

You call me up, let me know that 
That my sick guilt is so unwelcome
It's so unwelcome yeah 
I hear noises in the darkness

I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
My health is failing me

So I flip on the television 
And watch sad movies 
And look for sad sick people like me
Call me up, and let me know that 

That my sick guilt is so unwelcome 
I'm so unwelcome 
I'm so unwelcome
I hear noises in the darkness

I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
We could go 

(We could go)
We could go through the front door
(Through the front door)
We could go 

(We could go)
We go in through the front door
(Through the front door)
We could go

(We could go)
We go in through the front door
(Through the front door)
We could go

(We could go)
I come in through the front door
Through the front door
And the pills they will not 

Will not 
Will not 
Will not let me go
And I will not 

Will not 
Will not let you drink yourself alone
Call me up and let me know that 
That my sick guilt is so unwelcome 

You're so unwelcome 
You're so unwelcome
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness in your voice

I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you

I hear sadness inside you
