Is it a sin to love again?
I cannot win, this pain's not fair

And yes, so I've to cross the highest mountain
And yes, I painted you a pretty sky
Now you say it's over

Forgot to tell you I am sorry
Never had the time to lie
And now it's like a sad old story
Why do lovers always cry?

I never had the time to worry
I never had the time to try
And now you say it's over

Is it a sin to love again?
You broke me in
This won't repair

And yes, I fell for you so madly, deeply
And yes, I want to hold you by my side
And now you say it's over

Forgot to tell you I am sorry
I never had the time to lie
And now it's like a sad old story
Why do lovers always cry?

I never had the time to worry
I never had the time to try
Now you say it's over
And now you say it's over

And yes, I need to tell you why I'm angry
And yes, I need to look you in the eye
Because you said it's over

Forgot to tell you I am sorry
Never had the time to lie
And now it's like a sad old story
Why do lovers always cry?

I never had the time to worry
I never had the time to try
Now you say it's over

Now you say it's over
Now you say it's over
Is it a sin to love again?
