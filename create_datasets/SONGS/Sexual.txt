So there you are 
And here am I
A crowded room 
Your eyes meet mine
You are alone
I take my chance
Some music plays
We begin to dance

Don't wanna lie to you, don't wanna die for you
Sometimes it's cruel to be kind
No true romance here and no wedding bells, dear
That's not what I have in mind

Sexual
It's only sexual
It's nothing else at all
Just animal pleasure

No talk of love
No tears, goodbye
I've had enough
So please don't try
This pain inside 
Won't go away
Until I learn 
How to love again

No hearts and flowers, no talking for hours
I just want you here for tonight
No Mills and Boone and no romantic tunes
It's so easy so why don't you try?

Sexual
It's only sexual
It's nothing else at all
Just animal pleasure

Sexual
It's only sexual
It's nothing else at all
Just animal pleasure

Don't wanna lie to you, don't wanna die for you (sexual, it's only sexual)
Sometimes it's cruel to be kind (it's nothing else at all, just animal pleasure)

No true romance here and no wedding bells, dear (sexual, it's only sexual)
That's not what I have in mind (it's only natural, just animal pleasure)

No hearts and flowers, no talking for hours (sexual, it's only sexual)
I just want you here for tonight (it's nothing else at all, just animal pleasure)
