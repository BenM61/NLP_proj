It's been a happy day
Try not to spoil it, now
Please don't get hung up that way.

Oh, he's not the boy for you
And I think you know it, too
Kiss him and don't start to cry.

'Cause you're having a pipe dream, an ordinary pipe dream
(Now you see him flashing right before your eyes)
You're having a sweet dream, a lifelong sweet dream.
(I'm the one who loves you, can't you see?)

Pi-i-ipe dream
Pi-i-ipe dream
Come back to reality.

Now, in your mind there's always me
That's the way it's gonna be
Kiss and tell him good bye.

I say you won't have to dream tonight
Tomorrow may be clear and bright
I think the pipe's going out.

'Cause you're having a pipe dream, an ordinary pipe dream 
(Now you see him flashing right before your eyes)
You're having a sweet dream, a lifelong sweet dream
(I'm the one who loves you, can't you see it's me?)

Pi-i-ipe dream
Pi-i-ipe dream
Come back to reality.

(Hey!) Come back to reality.
