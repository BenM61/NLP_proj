It's such a small town girl, news travels faster than a sigh, 
Everybody wants to know about the next man's secret, so everytime we meet upon the street, we've got to keep it... 

Like sister and brother we'll wave to each other, we don't want all the world to know, we are really lovers 
So we'll talk about the weather 'til we're alone together 
And all the world will fade and die, and baby there is only you and I 

You and me baby, you and me baby. 

Sometimes it's hard to hide pent up emotions we both feel, 
I want to tell the world I love you, but I dare not say it... 
Until I let you go there's only one way we can play it... 

Like sister and brother, we'll wave to each other, we don't want all the world to know, we are really lovers 
So we'll talk about the weather 'til we're alone together, 
And all the world will fade and die, and baby there is only you and I. 

Like sister and brother We'll wave to each other, we don't want all the world to know, (2x) 

We are really lovers so we'll talk about the weather 'til we're alone together and all the world will fade and die, and baby there is only you and I. 

Like sister and brother We'll wave to each other, we don't want all the world to know...(fade)
