Girl, is there something in the night 
That draws us together 
Are these moments worth the fight? 
Why must we keep it to ourselves 
The secret we hold inside 
Let me take you in my arms 
With the strength of a love that's denied 
And we've always believed in our hearts 
That the chances we've missed 
Still exist in the world after dark 
Backstreet love affair, running through the heart of the night 
Backstreet love affair 
Girl, there's a tension I can taste 
That speaks for the danger 
Let the warnings go to waste 
Oh, eyes that reflect a secret fire 
That covers the fear inside 
In a flash we're lost from sight 
To explore the romance that we hide 
And the thrill of the chase plays a part 
In the chances we take 
We escape to the world after dark 
Backstreet love affair, running through the heart of the night 
Backstreet love affair, meet me in the city tonight 
Backstreet love affair, running through the heart of the night 
Backstreet love affair 
Oh, backstreet love affair, running through the heart of the night 
Backstreet love affair, meet me in the city tonight 
Backstreet love affair, running through the heart of the night 
Backstreet love affair 
Backstreet love affair, meet me in the city tonight 
Backstreet love affair, backstreet love affair
