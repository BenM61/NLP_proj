I'm the man today
Can't nobody tell me nothing
Got a hold on life
Taking each day by day
Being strong
Know just where I'm going to
As I get higher and higher
Dreams grow
Visions flow by
This is as good as it gets
As I take another hit sugar
I can't stopI won't stop
Cause I'm too cool
And what they say is true
Ooh, I'm full of smoke
Watching my life go down
Down
Watching my life go down
Watching my life go down
Watching my life go down
Another day
Time just passes by me slowly
But I'm all right
You'll see
Faces in places catchin' different cases
Surroundings is glorified
Same situation nothing ever changes
Just being a bonafide hustler
Hustler baby
From day to night
Business is as good as it gets
As I take another hit
SugarI won't stop
I can't stop
