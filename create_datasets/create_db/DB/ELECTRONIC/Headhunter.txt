Today he has no means
He's alone and anonymous
But written in his cells
He's got the marks of a genius
I'm looking for this man
To sell him to other men
To sell him to other men
To make us rich and famous

One you lock the target,
Two you bait the line,
Three you slowly spread the net
And four you catch the man!

I'm looking for this man
To sell him to other men
To sell him to other men
At ten times his price at least
I'm looking for a man
Who knows the rules of the game
Who's able to forget them
To realize my aim

One you lock the target
Two you bait the line
Three you slowly spread the net
And four you catch the man

Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net then catch the man

One you lock the target
(Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, then catch the man)
Two you bait the line
(Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, then catch the man)
Three you slowly spread the net
(Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, then catch the man)
And four you catch the man
(Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net, then catch the man)
