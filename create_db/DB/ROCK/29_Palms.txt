A fool in love 
A crazy situation
Her velvet glove 
Knocks me down and down and down and down
Her kiss of fire 
A loaded invitation
Inside her smile
She takes me down and down and down and down

Her moves look good 
A touch of desperation
From where I stood 
She turned my head around and around and around

It comes kinda hard 
When I hear your voice on the radio (hear your voice on the radio)
Taking me back down the road leads back to you

Oh-oh 29 Palms 
I feel the heat of your desert heart (feel the heat of your desert heart)
Taking me back down the road leads back to you

Oh, I'm burning in love
A strange infatuation
Why cold cold touch, mmm 
What must I do, do, do, do
The heat and the dust 
Increase my desolation
In God we trust 
Always for you, and you, and you, and you

It comes kinda hard 
When I hear your voice on the radio (hear your voice on the radio)
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you

Oh-oh-oh 29 Palms 
I feel the heat of your desert heart (feel the heat of your desert heart)
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you

Baby, now it comes kinda hard
When I hear your voice on the radio
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you
Oh, don't ya hear me baby, now

29 Palms
I feel the heat of your desert heart (feel the heat of your desert heart)
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you, you, you
Yeah-yeah-yeah 
I'm coming home, oh oh

Gonna get there, gonna get there, don't ya know, babe
It comes kinds hard 
I said when I hear your voice on the radio
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
29 Palms
