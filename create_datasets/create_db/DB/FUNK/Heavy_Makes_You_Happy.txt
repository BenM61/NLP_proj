Ahh, whoa--great gosh a mighty...

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Say it, y'all
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Well, well
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)

I've been trying to find what's heavy that's been messing up my mind
I think I found the answer, 'cause it was right there all the time

Heavy makes you happy, I just got to say
Put on your heavy, if I can't feel this way

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Come on, come on
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Do it, do it, do it, do it
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)

By talking to my people, you know that it occurred to me
It's more than just a feeling--it's a philosophy
Heavy makes you happy, drying up your drink
Oh, spread a little heavy and it makes somebody sing

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Come on, y'all
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Right on, right on, right on
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
A little bit softer, now
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Oh, do it easy, now
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Lay it on down
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)
