Wait
Watched you throw out your bouquet
Now I think about you everyday
I'm alone now in my bed

And there's a lake
And at the bottom you'll find all our friends
They don't swim cause they're all dead
We never are what we intend, or invent
'Cause I make little lies and then I pull them apart
Think something dark's living down in my heart

And if I wanted to die before I got old
I should've started some years ago digging that hole
Well I carry this box to the proper place
And when I lower it down
I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me (I hope that you would do this for me)
Well I'd serve you drugs on a silver platter
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me (I hope that you would do this for me)

A deer that a hunter shot in the heart
Some dogs that got hit by cars
All came to spill their guts

And we spoke
About the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
And which songs we had loved the most
And then we all turned to dirt
And dust
Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold
Some die looking for a hand to hold

Well I carry this box to its proper place
And when I lower it down
I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me (I hope that you would do this for me)
Well I'd serve you drugs on a silver platter
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me (I hope that you would do this for me)

I'm slowly bringing you down from the Heavenly gates
Now I'm drowning in the flood I made
Well explain myself to me on the other side
I'll watch from Heaven when I die

Well I'll carry this box to the proper place
And when I lower it down
I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me (I hope that you would do this for me)
I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me (I hope that you would do this for me)
