To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me

No, I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know, I'll never let you down, no way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

Try to tell you that it's alright
Ooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying
You are my religion

To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me

No, I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know, I'll never let you down, no way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

Try to tell you that it's alright
Ooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying
You are my religion

To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me
