Mind... blow...ing
Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions
Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions

So I talk to myself, I give plenty time
To all these decisions lying in my mind
Holding hands or put my arms around her waist
Neither one of the these two will I try in haste
Taking my time to work the problem out
Yet trying to convince her that there is no need for doubt

Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions
Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions

So I tell myself again to thing deep within
And remember when we first met we were only friends
Throw a kiss or try to taste her tender lips
Will these be the factors that will make our lives a trip
But just in case things don't settle well with her
I'll say that I'm sorry and keep hoping for the best

Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions
Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions

Must decide how to go. Is she mine I want to know
(Well if you think long you think wrong. So don't think too long)

-sing over chorus-
Must decide how to go. Is she mine I want to know
Must decide how to go. Is she mine I want to know

Marriage or shacking, which way do we go
One of us must let the other know
By taking our time we will work our problems out
'Til death do we part or as friends we'll begin...

Mind blowing (...again) decisions causes head on collisions
Mind blowing decisions causes head on collisions
