Time will change you
Nothing lasts forever more
Tomorrow's all we're living for
And lights will blind you
Illusions keep you wanting more
Just look past revolving doors
To find what's real

Dear life, am I doing this right?
Can you see me tonight
Can you help me dear life?
And I know that I can't understand
What you hold in your hands for me
Dear life

Love will change you
No matter if you stay with them
You'll never be the same again
You've shown me magic
Highs I've never felt before
Memories that I thank you for
From deep in my soul

Dear life, am I doing this right?
Can you see me tonight
Can you help me dear life?
And I know that I can't understand
What you hold in your hands for me
Dear life

I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor
Dear life

Sometimes it hurts you
Maybe it's a lesson learned
To bring my feet back to this Earth
To find what's real

Dear life, am I doing this right?
Can you see me tonight
Can you help me dear life?
And I know that I can't understand
What you hold in your hands for me
Dear life

I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor
Dear life
Dear life
