Check the meaning don't stop the teasing now
Watch the ceiling crushing down to the floor
If you want it get it coming after dark
Guess we make it faster than you ever thought

Climb this mountain to cut off the top
Damage, damage
First I swallow then I throw up
Damage, damage
Come and try me falling apart
Damage, damage
Climb this mountain to cut off the top
Damage, damage

Stripped to the bone
Ready to go
You can never tell, getting hell, from being well, so let me spell
It's me against the world
It's me against the world

Climb this mountain to cut off the top
Damage, damage
First I swallow then I throw up
Damage, damage
Come and try me falling apart
Damage, damage
Climb this mountain to cut off the top
Damage, damage

I see at least you live by the rule
(Stop the fuss now pray for love)
Now that you're stuck to the groove
(Raise your head now say goodbye)
At least you live by the rule
(A sudden rush covers up my doubts)
You never know how the drugs work out

Come down watch the whole thing explode
Come down watch the whole thing explode

Climb this mountain to cut off the top
Damage, damage
First I swallow then I throw up
Damage, damage
Come and try me falling apart
Damage, damage
Climb this mountain to cut off the top
Damage, damage

Kreuzberg, Kreuzberg!
