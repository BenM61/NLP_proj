He don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart

Fare thee well, I know you're leavin'
For the new love that you've found
The handsome guy that you've been dating
Whoa, I've got a feelin' he's gonna put you down

Because he don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart

He uses all the great quotations
He says the things I wish I could say
Whoa, but he's had so many rehearsals
Girl, to him you're just another play

But wait
And when the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Oh, oh, I'll be there to take you home 'cause

He don't love you and he never will, like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you
