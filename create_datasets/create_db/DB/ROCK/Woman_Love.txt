Woman love, hey hey hey, woman love, hey hey 
Woman love, hey hey hey, woman love, hey hey 

Well I went to my good doctor not so long ago 
A-walkin' in a circle and moanin' low 
He looked at me and said, good lord above, son, 
You need a vaccination of a-woman love. 

Well I'm lookin' for a woman with a one track mind 
A huggin' and a kissin' and a smoochin' all the time 
I'd build her a castle to the moon up above 
I sure am a needin' me some woman love. (let's rock)

We'll I'm lookin' for a lovin' gal that needs a lot of care 
Not worried about her figure or the color of her hair 
The doctor really scared me when he said, good lord above, 
You sure am a-needin' you some woman love. 

Well I'm tired of walkin' circles, tired of moanin' low 
I want my baby with me everywhere I go 
I want my lovin' baby to call him turtle dove 
I sure am a-needin' me some woman love (let's rock again) 

Well I'm tired of walkin' circles, tired of moanin' low 
I want my baby with me everywhere I go 
I want my lovin' baby to call him turtle dove 
I sure am a-needin' me some woman love. 

Woman love, hey hey hey, woman love, hey hey 
Woman love, hey hey hey, woman love, hey hey 
Woman love, hey hey hey, woman love, hey hey
