Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Well I'm begging of you 
Please don't take my man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin
And eyes of emerald green

And your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like a summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

And I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

Well I could easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Well you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene

And I had to have this talk with you
'Casuse my happiness, it depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man!

Jolene Jolene Jolene Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
