Princess cards she sends me with her regards
Oh, bar-room eyes shine vacancy
To see her you gotta look hard
Wounded deep in battle
I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted
To her cheshire smile I'll stand on file
She's all I ever wanted

You let your blue walls get in the way of these facts, honey
Get your carpet baggers off my back
Girl, give me time to cover my tracks, you said
"Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks"
But they're not what I came for
Oh, I came for so much more (I came for you)
And I know you know that too (I came for you)
And I know you know that's true (I came for you)

I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you
I came for you

Crawl into my ambulance
Your pulse is gettin' weak
Reveal yourself all to me now
While you've got the strength to speak

Don't call for your surgeon
Even he says it's late
It's not your lungs this time
But your heart holds your fate
Don't give me my money back
Don't want it anymore

It's not that nursery mouth I came back for
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor
And who am I to ask you to fight my wars? (I came for you)
And you should know that's true (I came for you)
You should know that too (I came for you)

I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you
I came for you

Don't call for your surgeon
Even he says it's late
It's not your lungs this time
But your heart holds your fate
Don't give me my money back
Don't want it anymore

It's not that nursery mouth I came back for
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor
Who am I to ask you to fight my wars? (I came for you)
You should know that's true (I came for you)
You should know that too (I came for you)

I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you
I came for you
