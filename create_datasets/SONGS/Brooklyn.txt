I wake up with worry
Nothing fills me up
He follows me daily
He knows how to love
No true end inside me
I won't ever say it enough
You're a Brooklyn baby
You know how to love

I know what can rule me
Sink me with the sand
Oh, I can be the warden
And I will never crave it
I won't ever say it enough
You're a Brooklyn baby
You know how to love

You are someone else
There's something I can't define
You are not mine
You are someone
You are someone else
Worrying in my head
That's what she said
You are someone else

You, you are not my

You are like the honey
I am not allowed
Oh, I won't go without
Show me in a movie
You can tell me what you're about
Oh, I'm in Brooklyn baby
I'm a long way out

You are someone else
There's something I can't define
You are not mine
You are someone
You are someone else
Worrying in my head
That's what she said
You are someone else

You, you are not my
You are someone else

Swear I go
Does he know
That we're different, I
You, you are not my
And I still say
Each new day
I got this one

You, you are not my, you are not my
You, you are not my

You are someone else
There's something I can't define
You are not mine
You are someone
You are someone else
Worrying in my head
That's what she said
You are someone else

You, you, you are not my
You are someone else
You, you, you are not my
You are someone else
