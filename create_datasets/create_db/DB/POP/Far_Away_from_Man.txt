I'm sold to the the world
And I'm happy and I swirl on a cloud
My feet has never touched the ground
We are around ,you all the time
But you just swallow your Prozac
And listen to your deep division
I can't listen, I just swallow my fingers a
And try to throw up

Just throw that shit out of your window
You're a man but you're into a black widow

And it's far away from man, from man, from man
If you could be yourself I'll be damned
But you will always be my friend
Just want to give you a hand
From man, from man
If you could be yourself I'll be damned
But you will always be my friend
Just want to give you a hand

I'm so different
But I'm shifting
Like the borderline with time I just drift
From the shore
And the heat in the night is not like before
It's cold
And don't you try to chain me no more

I think you have to take you're life more easy
Or else you'll die

And it's far away from man, from man, from man
If you could be yourself I'll be damned
But you will always be my friend
Just want to give you a hand
From man, from man
If you could be yourself I'll be damned
But you will always be my friend
Just want to give you a hand

You're so sad, so sad
So lonely close to mad, so sad
Just listen to the bands
That takes colours instead of blood on their chests
That takes money before a funeral rest
That don't mourn their whole lifes
That smiles, when you should smile

And it's far away from man, from man, from man
If you could be yourself I'll be damned
But you will always be my friend
Just want to give you a hand
From man, from man
If you could be yourself I'll be damned
But you will always be my friend
Just want to give you a hand

And it's far away from man
