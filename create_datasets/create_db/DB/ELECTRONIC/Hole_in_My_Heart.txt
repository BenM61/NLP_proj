You've made a hole in my heart,
You've made a hole in my heart,
You've made a hole in my heart,
You've made a hole in my heart

And they can say what they want but it doesn't mean a thing,
Even if they went inside me and changed everything,
This hole is nothing that a doctor can cure,
It's not a disease no, that's for sure

I was looking for a way to get close to you,
But I got inside, I got inside,
Nothing in the world could pull be back again,
Now I'm inside, now I'm inside

You, you turn me upside down,
Whenever you're around,
You turn me upside down

You, you turn me upside down,
Whenever you're around,
You turn me upside down

You've made a hole in my heart,
You've made a hole in my heart,
You've made a hole in my heart,
You've made a hole in my heart

And the gap that you have made goes deep inside of me,
It's all used to invade girl, you've got my galaxy,
What this is you do to me it's not been done before,
I don't want to stop no, that's for sure

I was looking for a way to get close to you,
But I got inside, I got inside,
Nothing in the world could pull be back again,
Now I'm inside, now I'm inside

You, you turn me upside down,
Whenever you're around,
You turn me upside down

You, you turn me upside down,
Whenever you're around,
You turn me upside down

All I want to do is to do something with you,
All I want to do is to do something with you,
(All I want to do is to do something with you),
All I want to do is to do something with you,
(All I want to do is to do something with you),
All I want to do is to do something with you,
(All I want to do is to do something with you),
All I want to do is to do something with you,
(All I want to do is to do something with you),
All I want to do is to do something with you,

You, you turn me upside down,
Whenever you're around,
You turn me upside down

You, you turn me upside down,
Whenever you're around,
You turn me upside down
