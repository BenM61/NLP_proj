Broken teath, a shattered jaw
Ten to one, behold my God
Wicked sons of heaven's loss
Raise your own inverted cross
King's of earth, iron fist
Serve the sacred you dismissed
Stand before your final day
Choke on every line you pray

Raise your glass to death
Not one second left

Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell.
Storm the Gates of Hell.

Coward's heart, a serpent's tongue
Stand to face what you've outrun
Fear of death, fear of pain
Bound to all you took in vain
No more lies, no regrets
Sever ties and hollow debts
Open eyes, live to learn
Or watch your blessed temple burn

Raise you glass to death
Not one second left

Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me. Storm the Gates of Hell.
Storm the Gates of Hell.

Hell Hath No Fury At All.
