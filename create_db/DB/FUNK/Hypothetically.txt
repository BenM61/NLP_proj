What if I broke our monogamous agreement
What if I told you I lied but didn't mean it
What if my one mistake
Had the potential to break
Up our happy home
Would you want to know
What if I confessed it and though she didn't mean nothing since it happened
You're thinking about leaving
What if I suppressed it
And made a vow to never mess with another
Is it cool for me to smother the facts
Is it cool for me to cover my tracks
If you'd never know
Or would me not being honest hurt you more

Hypothetically of course
Are there some things better left unsaid
Or would you want to know instead
Hypothetically of course
Are there some wars not worth fighting
Some tears not worth crying
Hypothetically of course
What if this happened to you
What would you want me to do

Well what if I told you that I had a confession
What if I said 4 years ago when we were arguing
He came to comfort me and I wound up pregnant
And I just can't say for sure
If the baby's yours
What if I confessed it and it turns out not to be your baby after you get tested
And it destroys what we've been blessed with
What if I suppress it 'cause technically you're the baby's daddy anyway
Is it wrong for me to want you to stay
Would you rather have me tear you away
From the only family you know
Or is this just too big a secret to keep it on the low

Hypothetically of course
Are there some things better left unsaid
Or would you want to know instead
Hypothetically of course
Are there some wars not worth fighting
Some tears not worth crying
Hypothetically of course
What if this happened to you
What would you want me to do

Would you want to know
Would you want to know
Tell me what you'd do
Would you walk away or would you stay
Would you want to know
Would you want to leave the past behind us
Or are you afraid that one day it might find us
Would it even matter
Could it even matter
Should it even matter
