Me and my friends in a hundred dollar volva
Busting down the street and we're cruising Alvarado
Getting fucked up on the 101
Shooting our guns and having fun

I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you
I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you

Forty beers later and a line of speed
8-ball of blow and a half a bag of weed
Heading down the tracks to Mexico
Fucked on beer and staying gold

I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you 
I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you 

It's hot as hell in the ship like that Vietnam shit
Beer is always better with a bag around it
Dan's in the back puking on my seat
But me was drinking cheap beer, so it's okay by me
Supposed to be in Santa Monica at 8AM
F*CK THE CLOCKS, drink red again 
Twenty three years I've been drinking cheap beer 
Sixty-one more but from a liquor store 

I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you
I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you

I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you 
I drink cheap beer, so what, f*ck you
