What did I do? What did I say?
How about you, running away?
Tell Me

(What) in the name of love
Are we doing?
In the name of love
(What) in the name of love
Are we losing?
What are we doing?

Take the risk and pay the price
And leave it to fate
It's better to have loved and lost
Well, that's what they say

Don't you tell me
What I can do, what I can say
I'm not the one, running away
Tell Me

(What) in the name of love
Are we doing?
In the name of love
(What) in the name of love
Are we losing?
What are we doing?

You don't know what you could lose
Until you have lost
I won't be the only one
Left counting the cost

So won't you tell me
What I can do, what I can say
How can you leave when I want you to stay?
Tell me

(What) in the name of love
Are we doing?
In the name of love
(What) in the name of love
Are we losing?
What are we doing?

In the name of love
In the name of love
What are we doing
