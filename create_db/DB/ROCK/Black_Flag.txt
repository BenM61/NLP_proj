A year in the hole had taken its toll When I
took a good look at me And what a surprise
the scope of my eyes could only see black
And I remember someone who was taking
them two by two and lately I'd become the
one who'd have laughed at you too! There
was a Black Flag on my morning There was
a Black Flag on my day There was a Black
Flag on everything around and I was
walking backwards again I walked in the
day, my usual way, looking through a 2 X 4
It colored my view, I couldn't see you Or
maybe I just wouldn't And I remember the
time when the sunlight fell on my head And
lately I'd become a member of the walking
dead There was a Black Flag on my
morning There was a Black Flag on my day
There was a Black Flag on everything
arouond and I was walking backwards again
And I know that I was wrong. It was up to
me if I wanted to see And I remember the
day when I saw the mask on my face And I
knew that it was time to put the thing in its
place I'd put the Black Flag on my morning
I'd put the Black Flag on my day I'd put
the Black Flag on everything around And I
was walking backwards again And I know
that I was wrong
