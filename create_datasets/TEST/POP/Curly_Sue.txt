Your strength is so hard to find,
I feel so much stronger now,
The feeling??s alright. -Your words make me whole again,
Those eyes cannot ever lie,
You're so divine
I'm not ever alone, you're not ever alone

I'm head over heels, goddess of mine,
Your curls touching my face and now I can fly
You brought my life back,
The glory you found,I'm in deep debt, without-you I wouldn't survive
I'm not ever alone

Your smile is heavenly,
I-don??t deserve all the love, that you're giving to me
Your touch makes it hard to breathe,
The shiver's around me now, you're so fine

I'm head over heels goddess of mine,
Your curls touching my-face, and now I can fly
You brought my life back,
The glory you found, I'm in deep debt, without-you I wouldn't survive

The heart is pumping for my life, the mind is happy and I, I will love you till the day I die

I'm head over heels goddess of mine,
Your curls touching my face, and now I can fly
You brought my life back,
The glory you found, I'm in deep debt, without you I wouldn't survive

I'm head over heels goddess of mine,
Your curls touching my face and now I can fly
You brought my life back,
The glory you found, I'm in deep debt, without you I wouldn't survive
