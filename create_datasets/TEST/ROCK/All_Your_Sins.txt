The time has come you must repent
For all your sins you have spent
The rule to beckon now is here
The spark that loads your soul with fear yeah

Your life in chaos no control
The hand beneath it voids your goals
The kindling fire is now prepared
To meet the one who have dared

Oh yeah
You can never win
Pay for all your sins
You can never win
Pay for all your sins like this

You're gunna burn now!

Your can never win
Pay for all your sins

Your can never win
Pay for all your sins
