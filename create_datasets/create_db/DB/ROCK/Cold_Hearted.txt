It's not the same when I look in her eyes,
The magic's not there.
And when I look I realise
What we could have shared.

I'm always gonna love you,
If loving means forever,
I'm always gonna want you,
I don't think I could ever
Just forget the love we had.

It's not the same when she's here in my arms,
Or the smile on her face.
And even though with all of her charms,
She can't take your place.

I'm always gonna love you,
If loving means forever,
I'm always gonna want you,
I don't think I could ever
Just forget the love we had.

It's not the same when I look in her eyes,
The magic's not there.
And when I look I realize
What we could have shared.

I'm always gonna love you,
If loving means forever,
I'm always gonna want you,
If loving means forever.
I'm always gonna love you,
If loving means forever,
I'm always gonna want you,
If loving is forever.
