Some things will stay the same
The shape of a power point won't change
And I won't back away and run
If you make me feel strange
She's the hand at the end of the arm
And she's got a lot to say
She thinks the world is falling apart
But that's okay
She just wants to be happy
A place for everything
And everything in its place
I get better, wait and see
She amazes me
It's kinda hard to see in here
But there's nothing to see
So who cares?
Drank coffee all night and now I can't sleep
I think I opened a secret file
I let her look for a little while
And now I'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive
She just wants to be happy
A place for everything
And everything in its place
I had better wait and see
She amazes me
I couldn't understand the instructions
And the clock sounds like it's ticking slow
And this book is in another language
A language I don't know
I used to tie double knots
But now I couldn't be fucked
Things are getting stupider all the time
She just wants to be happy
A place for everything
And everything in its place
I had better wait and see
She amazes me, you're confusing me
You're confusing me
