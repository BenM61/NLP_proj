I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them there eyes
You've had a certain little cute way of flirtin' 
With them there eyes
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm fallin' love strung in a big big way for you

My heart is jumpin'
You started something with them there eyes
You better look out little brown eyes if you're right
This spark will make bubble
They gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
Hah, I'm ready, them there eyes
