I'm just like an old rooster, out way out here on a hill
I'm just like an old rooster, out way out here on a hill
People I'm done scratchin', ooh Lord Big Bill is just tryin' to live

I'm just like Joe's turkey, I can't do nothing but bauble(?)
I'm so poor baby, I have to lean up against the fence to garble(?)
Yeah now baby, gal, I believe I change town
Yeah I'm down so low baby, ooh Lord girl
I declare I'm lookin' up at down

The men in the mine baby
They all lookin' down at me
Gal I'm down so low baby
I'm low as I can be
Yeah now baby
Girl I'm down as I can be
Gal I'm down so low baby
Ooh Lord everybody's lookin' down on poor me

Everything I get a hold of baby
It goes away like snow in June
If I get a chance now baby again
I'm goin' up to the moon
Yeah now baby
Yeah I believe I change town
Yeah poor me down so low baby
Big Bill is lookin' up at down
