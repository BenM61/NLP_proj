One cold and sad affair
Take my heart and leave it there
I'm gonna feel this way forever
Never thought that I'd be free
Now you've made this change in me
Carrie, Carrie

Now only time will tell
It's a dream I know so well
You always tried so hard to please me
Only thing I know for sure
I couldn't love you any more
Carrie, Carrie

Waited so long no one to share
Could you belong to someone
Show you care, I'll be there

Oh, Carrie, is it more than a dream this time? (more than a dream)
Carrie, can I tell everyone you're mine? (tell everyone you're mine)
I will never be the same
Now you've made me live again
Carrie, is it more than a dream this time?
Oh, Carrie, is it more than a dream this time?

My heart is open wide
You know how I feel inside
You say my sad old days are over
Never need to hide away
Getting stronger every day
Carrie, Carrie

Waited so long no one to share (Why did you keep me waiting?)
Could you belong to someone?
Show you care, I'll be there

Oh, Carrie, is it more than a dream this time? (more than a dream)
Carrie, can I tell everyone you're mine? (tell everyone you're mine)
I will never be the same
Now you've made me live again
Carrie is it more than a dream

Oh, Carrie, is it more than a dream this time? (more than a dream)
Oh, Carrie, can I tell everyone you're mine? (tell everyone you're mine)
Oh, Carrie, is it more than a dream this time? (more than a dream)
Oh Carrie, can I tell everyone you're mine?
