I don't know why I'm feeling lost
It's only love
I give you everything I've got
It's not enough

Shutting my eyes I find
Opening up my mind
What is this sound I'm hearing

Voices in my head
Telling me beware
Voices in my head
Everywhere

Whenever we're together
It breaks my heart
I've got a fantasy, of which
You are a part

Shutting my eyes I find
Opening up my mind
What is this sound I'm hearing

Voices in my head
Telling me beware
Voices in my head
Everywhere
