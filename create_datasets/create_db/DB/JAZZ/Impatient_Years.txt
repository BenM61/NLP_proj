We're going through the impatient years
The years when the day seems twice as long
Restless and sighing and laughing and crying
And dreaming a dream people say is wrong

But we'll journey through the impatient years
To each other's arms where we belong, clinging together
I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year
But we'll journey through the impatient years

To each other's arms where we belong, clinging together
I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year.
