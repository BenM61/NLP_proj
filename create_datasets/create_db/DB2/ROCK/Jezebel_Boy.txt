Jezebel boy!
You know all the guys
In the sheriff's patrol
They leave you alone
When they round up the whores
Up on hollywood boulebard

Sometimes that nasty d.a.
Thinks he needs his name
In the paper again --
That's usually when
The short-pants girls
Have to take a ride
With a friendly policeman

But the jezebel boy
On the corner by the technicolor processing plant
Stands by the light;
Waitin' through the night
Waitin' for that distinguished-looking
Wilshire district gentleman
With snow-white hair,
To drive up in his lincoln,
And whisk away the jezebel boy

There he goes now!
Old ralph will make him put that wretched
Sausage in his mouth again

Another day,
Another sausage --
Jezebel boy
