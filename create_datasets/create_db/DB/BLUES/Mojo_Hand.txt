I'm goin' to Louisiana
And get me a mojo hand
I'm goin' to Louisiana
And get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna fix my woman so
She can't have no other man

Cold ground was my bed last night
Rocks was my pillow too
Cold ground was my bed last night
Rocks was my pillow too
I woke up this morning, I'm wondering
What in the world am I gonna do?

I lay down thinking
Buy me a mojo hand
I lay down thinking
Buy me a mojo hand
I did wanna fix my woman so she can't have no other man

But don't let your woman
Fix you like mine fixed me
Don't let your woman, boy, fix you like mine fixed me
She make a fool about her, oh, about as a fool can be

Now, can't a woman act funny
Ha-ha-ha, when she got another man?
Can't a woman act funny
When she got another man?
You know, she won't look straight at you
Then she's always raisin' sand, sand

Well, I'm going tomorrow
But I won't be gone long
I'm going tomorro
But I won't be gone very long
I'm gonna get me a mojo hand, I'm gonna bring it back home

That's what I'm gonna do
