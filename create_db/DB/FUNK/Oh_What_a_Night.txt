Oh, what a night, 
Late December back in sixty-three 
What a very special time for me,
As I remember, what a night
 
Oh, what a night, you know I didn't even know her name,
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night
Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon
 
Oh what a night hypnotizin' mesmerizing me, 
She was ev'rything I dreamed she'd be 
Sweet surrender, what a night
I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder,
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under
 
Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light,
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night
 
I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder,
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!
Oh what a night!
