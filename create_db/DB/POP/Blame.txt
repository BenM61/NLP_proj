You go sleep with the fishes
There’s no room for you here
There’s no room for you here
Wrap your teeth around the pavement
'Cause your body’s a message
Send my regards to hell

Fall upon your knees saying
"This is my body and soul here"
Fall and begging, pleading
"You’ve got the power and control"
Don’t pin it all on me
Don’t pin it all on me

You’ve been granted three wishes
Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son
I can hear your pulse racing from here
Sitting next to this gun beats your heart in your mouth

Fall upon your knees saying
"This is my body and soul here"
Fall and begging, pleading
"You’ve got the power and control"
Don’t pin it all on me
Don’t pin it all on me

Don't blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Oh blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Oh blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Oh blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)

Fall upon your knees saying
"This is my body and soul here"
Fall and begging, pleading
"You’ve got the power and control here"
This is my body, this is my soul
Fall upon your knees saying
"This is my body and soul"

Don’t pin it all on me
Don’t pin it all on me
