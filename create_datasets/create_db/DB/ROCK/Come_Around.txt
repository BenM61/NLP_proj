I'm all tied up
And I'm trying my best to get down
Come on girl
Come around, come around

I'll wait up all night just to see you move
And for the past few days
I've been doing my best to move on
Baby baby shake it up and come along
Lets take a ride and forget this town tonight

Late night
Bring back the heat some more
What's right
I don't know what I'm waiting for
It takes all that I have
Just to move along
It takes all that I have
It takes all that I have

Last call
That's what I said tonight
Passed out
Lose control in the fading light
So many nights spent with you in the beginning
It takes a while getting used to having nothing

I would give all I have
Just to be what you need
Until the end
I'd give myself to be and to hold you close again

I'm all tied up
And I'm trying my best to get down
Come on girl
Come around, come around
I'll wait up all night just to see you move
(see you move)
And for the past few days
I've been doing my best to move on
Baby baby shake it up and come along
Lets take a ride and forget this town tonight

Exposed and you're my weakness
I'll take this day by day
Exposed and you're my weakness
There's nothing left for me
Exposed and you're my weakness
I'll take this day by day
Exposed and you're my weakness
For loss of words to say

I'm all tied up
And I'm trying my best to get down
Come on girl
Come around, come around
I'll wait up all night just to see you move
(see you move)
And for the past few days
I've been doing my best to move on
Baby baby shake it up and come along
Lets take a ride and forget this town tonight

What goes around comes around in the end
It takes you down and you're never gonna stop it
