I hear he's out there... somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Rosweld to Timbuktu I thought I found him once at a jiffy lube
But it turned into a dead end so I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery like the deep blue sea
You can take it you can leave it but I still believe
So I won't give up and I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

I met a mystic down in Memphis we stood at the foot of the pyramid
He had me looking east - He had me looking west
Then he showed me a map and said "I wish you the best"
There was Elvis not the real one
When he told me good bye he called me hun
Just another shot in the dark like Eldorado or Noah's ark
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery like the deep blue sea
You can take it you can leave it but I still believe
So I won't give up and I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

I said a girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

trying to find Atlantis
hey, I'm still trying to find... Atlantis
