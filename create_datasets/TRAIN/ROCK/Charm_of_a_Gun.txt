(VERSE 1)
Last night a lady came knocking on my door
Knock knock open up, ain?t seen her before
"What?s your name?", she said to me, "You look the playful kind..."
"I am the angel you require, come to waste your time!"

(VERSE 2)
So I took some time to cool out, chase away the fear
A man comes up to offer me some heavy smoking gear
I said: "No, thanks a lot, I don?t shoot that stuff."
He looked mad, a gun came out, "no!" ain?t good enough

(BRIDGE 1)
Stop and look around, or maybe you won?t get much older
People with ambition, there is danger round the corner

Some people live on the streets by night
And... calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets, alright!
And calm with the charm of a gun

(VERSE 3)
In this world we?re living in, a very narrow line
Separates sanity, we cross it all the time
If, by chance, the lunatic should get the final vote
This can be your serenade, I will row the boat

(BRIDGE 2)
If you?re passing through, you better keep your engine running
Keep from asking questions, if you want to keep on living

Some people live on the streets by night
And... calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets, alright!
And calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets by night
And... calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets, alright!
And calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets by night
And... calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets, alright!
And calm with the charm of a gun

(GUITAR SOLO)

Some people live on the streets by night
And... calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets, alright!
And calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets by night
And... calm with the charm of a gun
Some people live on the streets, alright!
And calm with the charm of a gun
