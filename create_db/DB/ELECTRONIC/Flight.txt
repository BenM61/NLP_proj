Throw your hands up high
Somebody jump and touch the sky
Let's go

Now everybody in the crowd
I need you all to jump

Jump, jump
Let's go
Jump
Let's go
Jump
Let's go, let's go

Throw your hands up high
I said hands up high
Somebody jump and touch the sky
Let's go

Now everybody in the crowd
I need you all to jump

Jump, jump
Let's go
Jump
Let's go, let's go
Let's go,
Jump
Let's go, let's go
Jump

Can you hit that?
