I woke up, but was far from home
Living a life that was not my own
Oh, oh
Places familiar but they're not the same
I have some strangers who will know my name
Oh, oh

I wait for the penny drop, hey
I'm never going to give you all my love
Black rainbows never stop, hey
I'm never going to give you all my love

Whispers the lies
The closer your eyes
The burnt part, the tides
Black rainbows for miles

Turn up the volume all the way it goes
There's only silence on the radio
Oh, oh
Woke up the songs that I used to know
I had it all but I, I let it go
Oh, oh

I wait for the penny drop, hey
I'm never going to give you all my love
Black rainbows never stop, hey
I'm never going to give you all my love

Whispers the lies
The closer your eyes
The burnt part, the tides
Black rainbows for miles

If you're part of being new love
Don't give up the blue skies
Leave the static for a new love
That's what you told me so many times

I wait for the penny drop, hey
I'm never gonna give you up my love
Dark rainbows never stop, hey
I'm never gonna give you up my love
Give it up my love

Whispers the lies
The closer your eyes
The burnt part, the tides
Black rainbows for miles

Give you up my love
Give you up my love
Give you up my love
Give you up my love
Give you up my love
Give you up my love
Give you up my love
Give you up my love
Give you up my love
