A little bird told me that you love me
And I believe that you do
This little bird told me I was fallin'
Fallin' for no one but you
There's no use denying
Might as well confess
Of all the boys I know, dear
I'm sure I love you best

The little bird told me we'd be happy
And I believe that it's true
A little bird told me we'd be married
And I believe that it's true

This little bird told me when we marry
We'll have a pretty cottage
Not too far
All fenced in like a movie stars
We'll have a great dane pup
We'll call him Ace
Lying there by the fireplace
A goldfish pond and a wishing well
Everything is gonna turn out swell

A little bird told me we'd be happy
And now I know that it's true
Come June it's bound to be true
