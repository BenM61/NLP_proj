We've come a long way from nowhere
The road was often paved with tears and pain
Whenever I got lost you were always there
Through it all you never once complained

There were times I know you thought
The sun would never find us
Sometimes I felt that same way too
Now it looks as if all the hard times are behind us
One by one our dreams are coming true

Love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light

Whoa, oh, it only needs two people
With a dream and endless faith
And given time and a little patience
Love finds its own way

I know you must have pushed aside your feelings
When down inside you thought you'd fall apart
And if it hadn't been for your believin' (believin', believin')
We might still be stumblin' in the dark (we might still be stumblin' in the dark)

Now we're standing on the threshold of a new beginning
The doors of life are opened wide
For once in our lives we're finally winnin'
All because love is on our side

Ooh, love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light

Because love, love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love, love, love finds its own way
