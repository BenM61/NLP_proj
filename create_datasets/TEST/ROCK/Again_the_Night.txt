Hold on to these words, 
This night won't last forever, 
That's a promise. 
This light won't die. 

This light won't die. 
Between the shadows of the leaves, 
It dances. 
As the wind goes by. 

So when sleep just won't come, 
And you've got no occupation, 
But nibbling at the fruit 
Of the melancholy tree, 
Just hold on to these words, 
Hold on to me.
