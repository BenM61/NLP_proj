I'm gonna hold on (hold on)
Hold on (hold on)to your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold on (hold on)
Hold on (hold on) to your unchanging love
I need ya baby
Baby, I need you right now
Darling there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important
Than paintin' the town
Morning, noon and night
'Cause night life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim

But your love and tender arms
I can always come home to them
And I'm gonna hold on(hold on)
Hold on(hold on) to your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold on(hold on)
Hold on to your unchanging love
I need ya baby
Baby I need you right now
I used to have more friends that I can count
But now all of my so called friends are gone
Since I lost everything in my bank account
Darling I'm tired of running 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
'Cause if I don't have a dime
I know your love is mine

And I'm gonna hold on (hold on)
Hold on (hold on)to your unchanging love
Hey, so I'll hold on,(hold on) hold on to (hold on)
Your unchanging love
I need ya baby
Baby, I need you right now
Darling, everybody needs somebody too
I need you, I know now
Nobody really loves me
Honey, honey, honey
The way you do

One more thing
I've changed girls in my life
As often as I changed my suit
Only to learn the only true happiness
Is being, honey, being loved by you

That's why I'm gonna hold on (hold on)
Hold on (hold on)to your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold (hold on) on baby to your unchanging love
