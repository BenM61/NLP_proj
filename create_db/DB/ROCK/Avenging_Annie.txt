They ran through hills and forest
As two under a spell
He was a city boy Floyd the outlaw
And she thought she knew him well. 

Long after that great summer
When she first came into her fame
And the avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to her name
The avenger she became. 

Well they call her avenging Annie
The avenger of womanhood
She spends her whole life telling lies
These on a mess  and over good
She'll take all these spoilt young  hippies
Running around playing games
They're surrounding your bed, she'll blow your head
She'll put you through a change. 

What you've done to others
She'll do unto you. 

Then she met her sensitive outlaw
He was the best thing she ever did seen
She was to be his wife for the rest of her life,
But she was so blind she could never had seen.
No! 

So she joined up with her outlaw
And headed for California. 

He treated her worse than she'd ever imagined
He didn't say he didn't want her around
He kept it up so long, she couldn't be strong
He run her right into the ground. 

After five long years,
He picked her up and slapped her down. 

Then she told her friends about him
They all were on her side
But she could see through the haze he looked so pale
She put her head right down and she cried. 

For her poor lover
She cried like a mother for her poor lover. 

And now she lives on a mountain top
And she's almost thirty-five
And she's found her peace and found her release
Happy  just to be alive. 

And she might go back to her Floyd
If she thinks it's the thing to do
He gave up murder and theft after she left
And you know she still loves him to
Just like a worn out shoe
Just like a worn out shoe
Just like a worn out shoe
Just like a worn out shoe
Just like a worn out shoe
Just like a worn out shoe
Just like a worn out shoe 

Well they call her avenging Annie
The avenger of womanhood
She spends her whole life telling lies
Leads them on a mess and over good.
