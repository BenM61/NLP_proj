Yo
I want my ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side,
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side,
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Wait bitch I'ma blow my kisses
Get pissed and throw my dishes
Why'all niggas know just who this is (Woo woo!)
And the head so vicious
With me this shit gone cost
You short than that's your loss
You know this ass is soft
Make a nigga go to breaking off
Tell me that you love me baby
And get high and f*ck me crazy
Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch with no type of flaws
My girls be shopping hard
These hoes be buying cars
In the club buying bars
Nipples hard is a sign of bras
All my niggas who getting cheese
Throwback and the crispy G's
Moet, Cris on freeze
Laugh at a tab 'cause this on me
Me and Luda in a cut supreme
Doing things just to touch the cream
So many names want to f*ck the Queen
I live a life like its just a dream

I want my ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side,
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Give me the beat then I'ma make it bump
Tell me what you want to hear damn yes it can
Trouble with your man I'ma pop my trunk
You ain't seen no chicks like mine
You ain't seen no flips like mine
Gonna make you (Ugh!) next to the seat buckles in my 659
Tell me that you like it raw
Tell me that my dick is wah!
I might make you famous and buy you watches my Maurice Merquaw
Tell me if it's new or old
Tell me if its hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold
Say Ludacris six million sold
See I ain't got no time for games
And I ain't got no time for lames
How you loving my Southern slang
Oh, eh, watta watta bing bang!
So anytime you need me call
Winter summer spring or fall
It doesn't matter come one come all
Either get dropped or drop them drawers

I want my ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side,
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Diamond, Princess
Just mind your business
These rumors are senseless
Your whispers are endless
We living Ghetto fab
We spending hella cash
This girl is hella bad
Your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores
You saw me grace the Source
You watched me work the Vibe
Bitches I works for mine
One time for these divas
Two times for these Visa's
Third time I come I'm breezing
The ice just keeps on freezing
Hold up I'ma keep it going
Back to back I'ma keep on blowing
Platinum plaques keeping it up
Wet Saks keeping it gut
Look girl you don't know my angle
A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggas will slow your roll
Pussy power we in control

I want my ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side,
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright
