(Body heat)
When your body get down from aggravation
(Body heat)
And you need some love from fascination

What's that?

And you don't do it 'cause you know you're through

What's that?
(Body heat)
What's that?
(Body heat)

When you can't get your body, please
And you need some love for your tension easin'

What's that?
(Body heat)
What's that?
(Body heat)

When I was a little boy about the age of one
My mother told me that you're a loving son of a gun
When I was a little boy about the age of two
Get myself, then I had to do

When I was a little boy about the age of three
Don't want nobody bothering me
When I was a little boy about the age of four
Back up, had to take it myself, gonna give me some more

When I was a little boy about the age of ten
(Incomprehensible) catch myself, won't to do it again
I was a little boy about the age of eleven
Growing up, I can turn up the heat, take on that fresh air

Can I go to church, y'all?
Can I go to church, y'all?
Can I beat upon, y'all?
Can I get the horn, y'all?

Gimme my loving, gimme my loving
I want to give it up
I want to give it up
I want to give it up
I want to give it up
