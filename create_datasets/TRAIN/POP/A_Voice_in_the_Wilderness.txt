My heart was so heavy with longing for you
My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue
Alone in my sorrow, I heard a voice cry
A voice in the wilderness, a voice from the sky

Have faith in your darling, the voice seemed to say
Be true to her memory, she'll come back some day
And though there was no-one, nobody to see
A voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me

We had a quarrel, I was unkind
Why did you leave me, love made me blind
My darling forgive me, I yearn for your touch
Have pity, come back now, I need you so much
Believe me and you'll hear it, that voice from above
The voice in the wilderness, the voice of true love

Believe me and you'll hear it, that voice from above
A voice in the wilderness, the voice of true love.
