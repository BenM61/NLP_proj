There goes the girl I dreamed all through school about, 
There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about 
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present 
My future just passed. 

Don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me 
My future just passed. 

Stars in the blue, tho' you're at a distance 
You can at least do this, 
Sometimes a boy encounters resistance 
Help me to win this miss. 

Here are my arms, may she find illusion there. 
Look in my heart, there is no confusion there 
Now that I'm loving, I'm living at last, 
My future just passed
