Found a piece of candy on the floor and I couldn't resist but taste it
Momma wanted to smack me and that's when I made up my mind and I ate it
And I have to admit it tasted better than the ones in the kitchen cupboard

Every night I'd look out the bedroom window and wonder what it's like to run away
Daddy told me he would hit me if I did it so I made up my mind and I ran away
And I have to admit it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be

What doesn't kill you makes you sick
And if you're sick you learned a lesson
And with every lesson you get wiser (wiser) wiser (wiser)
So I figure that it pays to cross the line
And eat a little dirt sometimes

I found a book about mystical things but momma said it's against our religion
So late at night I'd read it anyways and that was the last time I asked for permission
And I have to admit that I don't regret telling her lies 'cause it opened my eyes

What doesn't kill you makes you sick
And if you're sick you learned a lesson
With every lesson you get wiser (wiser) wiser (wiser)
So I figure that it pays to cross the line
And eat a little dirt

I won't let my years go to waste,
living in a cage this prodigal child will always stray
I got over the stomach ache
Wiped the mud off my face 'cause this world belongs to the brave

What doesn't kill you makes you sick
And if you're sick you learned a lesson
With every lesson you get wiser, wiser
So I figure that it pays to cross the line
And eat a little dirt sometimes ('cause this world belongs to the brave)
And eat a little dirt sometimes ('cause this world belongs to the brave)
And eat a little dirt sometimes
