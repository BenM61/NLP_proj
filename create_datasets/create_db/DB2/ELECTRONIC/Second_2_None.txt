You broke my heart by stayin'
Under the Earth forsaken
They broke my heart by meanin'
All of the words they said this evenin'
Outside the world is reachin'
None of me is engagin'
It broke my heart to see you
So tall and ready in the early mornin'

And what do they think they've done?
You'll never be second to them, you're second to none
And how can they think you've gone?
You'll never be second to them, you're second to none

You said this world was fallin'
Feet on the ground, then jumpin'
It used to live all through you
This sense of hope, remorse of belonging
Rockin' my head right to you
Hard workers are still lied to
My point sent back for your sake
I know there are more wishes to make
 
And what do they think they've done?
You'll never be second to them, you're second to none
And how can they think you've gone?
You'll never be second to them, you're second to none

You'll never be second to them, you're second to none
Second to them, you're
You'll never be second to them, you're second to none
You'll never be second to them, you're second to none
