Night lift up the shades let in the brilliant light of morning
But steady me now for I am weak and starving for mercy
Sleep has left me alone to carry the weight of unraveling where we went wrong 
It's all I can do to hang on, to keep me from falling into old familiar shoes

How stupid could I be
A simpleton could see 
That you're no good for me 
But you're the only one I see

Love has made me a fool set me on fire and watched as I floundered
Unable to speak except to cry out and wait for your answer 
But you come around in your time speaking of fabulous places create
An oasis that dries up as soon as you're gone
You leave me here burning in this desert without you

How stupid could I be
A simpleton could see 
That you're no good for me 
But you're the only one I see

Everything changes everything falls apart
I can't stand to feel myself losing control
In the depth of my senses I know

How stupid could I be
A simpleton could see 
That you're no good for me 
But you're the only one I see
