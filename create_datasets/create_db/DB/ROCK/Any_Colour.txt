I dream, dream of a lonely girl
Who sleeps, lost in her lonely world
Any sunset I'd give to you
Any colour that you like, all for you

She wakes wrapped in her naked room
The air filled with a sweet perfume
Any rainbow I'll save for you
Any colour that you like, all for you

I've waited, I've waited so long for you
To show my true colours come shining through

I dream, dream of a distant girl
Who sleeps, lost in a lonely world
In a diamond, I'll shine for you
Any colour that you like, all for you
