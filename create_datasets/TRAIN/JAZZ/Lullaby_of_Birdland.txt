Lullaby of birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry on my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love

So bi ba ya boo ba doo bi du da bu bi di ba du be da
So bi ba ya boo ba doo bi du da bu bi di ba du be da
Sha ba ba ba be dee ba ba ba da ba ba da da da dee ya
Sha ba ba ba be dee ba ba ba da ba ba da da da dee ya

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry on my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love

Sha ba ba ba be dee ba ba ba da ba ba da da da dee ya
