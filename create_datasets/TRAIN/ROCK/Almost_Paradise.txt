I thought that dreams belonged to other men
'cause each time i got close
They'd fall apart again

I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could i have known
That all my life i only needed you?

Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that i can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

It seems like perfect love's so hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must have read my mind

And all these dreams i saved for a rainy day
They're finally coming true
I'll share them all with you
'cause now we hold the future in our hands

Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that i can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

And in your arms salvation's not so far away
It's getting closer
Closer every day

It's almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that i can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that i can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

Paradise
Paradise
