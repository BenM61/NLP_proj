You're riding in my car
I turn on the radio
I'm pulling you closer
But you keep tellin' me no
You say you don't like it
But I know you're a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh...

Fire
Late at night
You're taking me home
You say you want to stay
But I want you to go
Say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh...

Fire
You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool
Well my kisses might burn
But my heart stays cool

Well Romeo and Juliet
Sampson and Delilah
Baby you can bet
They were burnin' with desire
If I say split
Then I know that I'd be lying
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh...

Fire
When we kiss
I'm on fire
Your tenderness
Gives me desire
I can't resist
Your tender lips
When we kiss
Ooh...

Fire
When we kiss
I'm on fire
Your tenderness
Gives me desire
I can't resist
Your tender lips
When we kiss
Ooh...

Fire
