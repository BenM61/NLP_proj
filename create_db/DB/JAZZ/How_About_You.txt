Tommy Dorsey 
I like New York in June, how about you? 
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you? 
I love a fireside when a storm is due, 
I like potato chips, moonlight 
And motor trips, how about you? 
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill 
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill, 
Holding hands in a movie show 
When all the lights are low may not be new 
But I like it, how about you
