I tried to run away but I was frozen in place 
My body was mad of sawdust and my heart just split 
My old friend rigor mortis started to breathe in my face 
The air started to drain out of my spirit 
Help me, can you help me? 
A century of my tears wouldn't even fill a thimble 
The war of the class clown is never won 
But nothing makes me laugh anymore 
And nothing makes me craw 
And nothing makes me feel like I belong 
Help me, can you help me? 
I can't believe all the stupid things I'm saying now 
Either I've shaken the world off my back 
or else I've gone senile 
I thought your love was just a great big lie 
Now love you is the only thing that's gonna get me by
Help me, can you help me? 
All I have to offer you is archaeology and Christmas 
And we'll turn our backs on what the world has in store 
And twist the light so that it shines down on us 
And wait together for the touch of something more 
Help me, can you help me?
