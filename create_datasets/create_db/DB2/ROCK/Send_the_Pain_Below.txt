I liked,
Having hurt,
So send the pain below,
Where I need it.

You used to beg me,
To take,
Care of things,
And smile at the thoughts,
Of me failing.

But long before,
Having hurt,
I'll send the pain below,
I'll send the pain below.

Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating (I'll send the pain below)
Much like suffocating (I'll send the pain below).

You used run me away,
All while laughing,
Then cry about that fact,
Til my returns.

But long before,
Having hurt,
I'll send the pain below,
I'll send the pain below.

Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating (I'll send the pain below)
Much like suffocating (I'll send the pain below)
Much like suffocating

I can't feel my chest (chest, chest),
Anymore,
Drop down,
'Cause I'm in
I can't feel my chest (chest, chest)
Drop down!

I liked,
Having hurt,
So send the pain below,
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating) (I liked),
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating) (Having hurt)
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating)
So send the pain below (Much like suffocating)
So send the pain below
