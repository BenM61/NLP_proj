name's joe...i used...i used to fix shoes... 
  
fly across the ocean 
butterfly potion 
gougin at the eyeballs 
blow a hole in bedroom wall 
  
flyin at the ocean 
butterfly potion 
gougin at the eyeballs 
blow a hole in bedroom wall 
  
hairs as red as nicotine 
round my jar of vaseline 
fly across the ocean 
butterfly potion 

away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll... 
  
weepin at the wall 
where i crawl 
nobody knows 
'bout the blowjob in the hole 

and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll... 

careful what you did 
phone the wife and kid 
fill up on a mile 
thru the turnstile,man 

flyin at the ocean 
butterfly potion 
gougin at the eyeballs 
blow a hole in bedroom wall 

hairs as red as nicotine 
round my jar of vaseline 
fly across the ocean 
butterfly potion 
  
away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away,away,away we roll 
  
away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll and away we roll...
