You're the key to my life

Rain on the window covers the trace
Of all the tears that I've had to waste
And now I'm missing you so
And I won't let you go away
Stain on the desktop where coffee cups lay
And memories of you forever will stay
And the scent of your perfume
And the smile on your face will remain

And I never gave up hope when things got me down
But I just bit on my lip and my face began to frown
'cause that was just my pride and I've nothing else to hide
And now the way is clear and all I want to say is

[Chorus:]
All of my life the doors have been closed now
And all of my dreams have been locked up inside
But you came along and captured my heart, girl
You're the key to my life
Yeah

Year after year, was blaming myself (blaming myself)
For what I'd done, just thought of myself
I know that you'll understand (you'll understand)
This was all my own fault, don't go away

And I never gave up hope when things got me down
But I just bit on my lip
And my face began to frown
'cause that was just my pride and I've nothing left to hide
And now the way is clear and all I want to say is

[Chorus]

Girl you know that I feel for you
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Stop the thunder and the pouring rain
You're the one that's going to stop the pain
Girl you know that I feel for you
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Stop the thunder and the pouring rain
Listen to me can't you hear what I say

[Chorus]
