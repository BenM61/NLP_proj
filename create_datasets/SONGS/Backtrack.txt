I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it
You backtrack and change your act
At a hundred likes a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it

Am I confused, am I a crazy person
You say it's old news
She doesn't mean nothing
But don't you understand that I am heartbroken
No matter what you do
You just can't make it untrue

You're breathing lies
I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door
I could fall through the floor

But I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it
You backtrack and change your act
At a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it

Too much to lose and it's still raining
I know it's not a game
So I'll stop playing
But oh my heart's on fire
And it keeps burning
And I don't mean to cry
It's just the smoke gets in my eyes

You're breathing lies
I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door
I could fall through the floor

But I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it
You backtrack and change your act
At a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it

Let the battle drum start
I wanna turn back the clock
I wanna find the missing pieces
Of the whole love I lost
You say it like you mean it
And I wand to believe it
Because I can't stop this feeling

But I can't go along with it
You can say just what you like
But you still did it
You backtrack and change your act
At a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am I won't go along with it
