There's something that I wanna say 
I feel a little out of place 
But I need you to make that change 
You promised, to keep me out of the rain 
I love the cars and everything 
The diamond rings but I loved you much more, baby 

You said, that you were gonna stop when you 
Had enough, you'd do what you had to do 
Now you, like the profession you've made it for yourself 
You said, you cared about me and you 
Now all, you wanna do is hustle you 
Gotta choose, whatcha gonna do and am I worth it to you baby 

Never thought I'd be afraid to trust (to trust) 
Somebody that I love so much 
If I can get him out of the streets 
Then he could come back to me 
Now I see that there ain't no "us" 
Baby to me that's a definite plus 
If I can't get you out of the streets 
Then you don't need to be with me 

Do you love me like you say 
Maybe you could get away 
From the life of doin' the wrong things 
You promised 
Don't make me read about it babe 
Think of me before I'm gone 
Cause when I'm gone, it will be to late (oh yeah babe) 

You said, that you were gonna stop when you 
Had enough, you'd do what you had to do 
Now you, like the profession you've made it for yourself (made it for yourself) 
You said, you cared about me and you 
Now all, you wanna do is hustle you (you you) 
Gotta choose, whatcha gonna do when I'm not worth it to you baby 

Never thought I'd be afraid to trust 
Somebody that I love so much 
If I can get him out of the streets 
Then he could come back to me 
Now I see that there ain't no "us" 
Baby to me that's a definite plus 
If I can't get you out of the streets 
Then you don't need to be with me 

Never thought I'd be afraid to trust (Never, never, never) 
Somebody that I love so much 
If I can get him out of the streets 
Then he could come back to me (come back, to me) 
Now I see that there ain't no "us" (there ain't no us baby) 
Baby to me that's a definite plus 
If I can't get you out of the streets (If I Can Get You Outta the streets) 
Then you don't need to be with me (Then you don't need to be with me) 

Oh, oh, mmm yeah yeah........yeah

Never thought I'd be afraid to trust (Never thought I) 
Somebody that I love so much (Somebody I love, somebody I love) 
If I can get him out of the streets 
Then he could come back to me 
Now I see that there ain't no "us" (baby, baby, baby, yeah) 
Baby to me that's a definite plus 
If I can't get you out of the streets (oh oh, if I can get you outta the 
streets) 
Charge it to the game, baby 

Visit the streets or me (Visit the streets) 
The job has taken over pain (The job's taken over) 
I know I've gotta leave (I know I know) 
Cause you weren't there for me (You weren't there for me he he he)
