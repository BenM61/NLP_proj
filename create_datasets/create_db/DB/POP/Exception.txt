Pride is for the privileged, pride is for a few 
Who can't afford a conscience clean and morals too 
You can't undo what can't be undone 
I can't rewind and so I run

Exception, yeah, you are my exception
Exception, yeah, you are my exception
Exception

You came to me with confidence, I saw the devil smile
You said hey here's your second chance, redemption for a life
A heart-shaped magic lucky charm
My gift to you will keep me warm

Exception, yeah, you are my exception
If I could be your angel flying through a desert storm
A soothing calm oasis
You would always be my one exception

I had an inner vision, attacking from behind
A backstabbing illusion, no smoke without a fire
You told the truth, I lived a lie
There's nothing I won't sacrifice

Exception, yeah, you are my exception
Exception, yeah,
If I could be your angel flying through a desert storm
A soothing calm oasis
You would always be my one exception
