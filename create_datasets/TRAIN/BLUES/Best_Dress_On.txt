Hey hey 
Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on

Hey hey 
Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on

Hey hey 
Look at you now
Look at you now 
With your best dress on  

It doesn't seem so very long ago
That your mind was weak
And dragged your spirits low

You had some worries 
Like the size of earth 
And the weight on your shoulders
Of the universe

I said hey hey 
Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on 

You painted yourself in a corner space
Trying to lose that stigma
And the badge of shame

But everybody has a cross to bear
You were a slave to your desire
To find a better way

I said hey hey 
Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on  

I can see you dancing in the pale moonlight
And you're moving round just like a spinning top
Got your hair highlights 
And got your painted nails
Got your glad rags on 
And got your humor back

Yeah the purple people they can learn from you
To control a mind and make it follow through
From the darkest recess found a shining light
Built your world back up 
And set your life to right 
 
I said hey hey 
Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on 

Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on 

On a blind date
Under shooting stars
Met an angel
Chosen by your fate
And that's how destiny is shaped 
When you lend a helping hand

I said 
Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on 

It doesn't seem so very long ago
That your mind was weak
And dragged your spirits low

I said hey hey
Look at you now
Look at you now
With your best dress on
