Yes your heart will lead the way
And the truth will come with time
Those of riches pave the road
That we can hardly find
Let the devil be the lonely one
And let changing colors of the leaves be your guide
And lead us to peace

We have got to breakthrough
All the lava that has fallen
We have got to breakthrough oh yeah

What will be left of our manger

Who will speak in our defense
If we lose our holy waters
Will the grass still grow
Let the devil me the lonely one
And let the direction of the breeze be our guide
And lead us to peace

We have got to breakthrough
All the lava that has fallen
We have got to breakthrough oh yeah

We have got to breakthrough (breakthrough)
Oh yeah we've got to breakthrough (breakthrough)
Let's join hands and breakthrough (breakthrough)
(Breakthrough)
