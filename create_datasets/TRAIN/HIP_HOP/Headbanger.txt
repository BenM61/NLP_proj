Parrish Smith gettin wreck 
(Hit Squad) The head banger 
Verse One: Parrish Smith 
Ka rank the boombox as my sound knock from blocks 
as I chill and bust grills you take snapshots 
of the maniac dressed in black carry round a strap 
Kid you play me too close (slow down and catch a cap, POW!!) 
Cause I don't play games, an outlaw like Jesse James 
To hell with the bitches and the so-called fame (uh-huh) 
Strictly biz to hard (kid yeah) as I climb charts 
Bustin ass daily as I compose like Mozart 
Just stand, say you're mad damn, why him? 
Z-oh-one Tonka, five-sixty Benz 
I'm sick and mad deep no shorts and no sleep 
I'm bugged like a tapped phone, hard like concrete 
So get a GRIP and don't SLIP or catch a CLIP 
from the infrared aimed at your head as I blast my TARGET 
The Bozack, I rip up flows that 
make an MC stop and chill and say HE'S ALL THAT 
Hardcore no R&B singer 
Roll with the Hit Squad... down with the head banger

Verse Two: Erick Sermon 
SURPRISE, you wonder where I've been, I've been workin 
But sounds makin danger, and black birds chirpin 
A real Damian, Omen possessed by the devil 
You dig the rhythm, and I'll play the RUNNIN REBEL 
Changed my style, so I can freak the funk 
Yo pass the Philly, HIT SQUAD spark the blunt 
I got the power, to ramshack a stadium 
WUBBA WUBBA, even Judy Brown the Palladium 
Yo, I'm from the Boondocks so I knows the flavor (yeah, yeah) 
Sometimes I curse but now, I show behavior 
EPMD, YO, is in this to win this 
A brand new LP SO MIND YOUR BUSINESS 
No jokin, I'm gettin paid fully 
You want to buy the cassette, stop by Sam Goody 
YO WHERE'S MY HOODIE? I want to be hard and cause some ruckus 
Talk with the be	-boy slang and blast some suckers 
Walk like an Egyptian, rough crackin my steel 
Plus I'm goin to court, make my own appeal 
As taught as a kid or told, NEVER TALK TO A STRANGER 
Cause I could be a head banger

and pissed cause I can make him my TARGET 
Braggin em taggin em draggin em mad hollow-point rhymes in my mic 
Choose Smith or assault over Magnum (huh) 
So back up off me, here's a clip 
For uzis and guns, and then you faggots gonna OFF ME 
I'm sure you know the deal that my nine can box 
I knock punks out quick like Evander Holyfield 
More rhymes than music's, my solution 
Subscribers of my style here's a contribution 
Let's say you want a shovel layer parkin MC's like cars 
and drivin MC's away 
Tanks gon be full, to rappers want to tempt me 
I break the steering shift and leave em EMPTY 
Cause they can't go, so I'ma call a hoe tow truck 
To come tow truck your weak SIDE SHOW 
Back on the scene is the incredible one man team 
When I get mad I turn GREEN 
The Fugitive's gone peace, I'm outta here later 
And here's a finger, to all you non movin spectators
