Oh hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight
Oh hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight

I get the shivers up and down my spine
The only time I'm happy's when I know she's mine

So hold, hold me tight
Treat me right
Won't you be my woman tonight
So treat me right
Won't you be my woman tonight

First I see you
And then you let me go
The only time I touch you's when you don't want to know
So hold me, hold me tight, all right
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight
Hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight
I get the shivers up and down my spine
The only time I'm happy's when I know she's mine
So hold me, hold me tight
Hold me tight, woman tonight
