what can i do, to make you stay my love
you fit me like a glove
i love when you are by my side
my love is like an endless slide
i feel like the world is flying in my heart
i feel like we could almost be a piece of art

what can i do, i am in hell
maybe i should cast a spell
can you whisper my name 
and say i'm your only flame
i need a warm embrace, warm embrace, warm embrace
i need an act of grace, act of grace, act of grace

j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, from you to your soul I take it all 
j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, from you to your soul I take it all 

where are you, my guru
i m tired of calling you
i wish i could be more than a friend
i wish i could be close to you until the end
your fingerprints are tatooed on my skin (ou pour rimer avec met : oh please dont tell me you regret ou oh please don't give me cold sweat)
sometimes you hear that some people love each other but you've never met ...

j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, from you to your soul I take it all
j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, from you to your soul I take it all

oh i feel so high
when you're next to me my heart is flying in the sky
oh dont send me a curse
and i'm sure we could cross the universe
i know maybe there's a sea a between us
but it s not the moment to make a fuss
oh j-o-l-a-n tAke the time to understand

j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, from you to your soul I take it all 
j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, j-o-l-a-n five letters that love each other, from you to your soul I take it all
