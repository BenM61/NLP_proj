The clock on the wall has just told you
Your hour has come
And you know those that God loves
Die young

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment
There is never forever
Only the moment

You're thinking too much about
Who will think badly of you
You throw away chances
Let love pass you by

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment
There is never forever
Only the moment

Don't be afraid of the dark of the night
Just reach for your feelings
Let your mood tell you
You're making the right moves

The days fade away
And before you can say
I wish I'd made all the right moves
It's too late

With guilt on your shoulder
With fear in your heart
You're bedeviled by angels
Belittled by fools

But remember
There is never forever
Only the moment
There is never forever
Only the moment

With guilt on your shoulder
With fear in your heart
You're bedeviled by angels
Belittled by fools

There is never forever
Only the moment
There is never forever
Only the moment
