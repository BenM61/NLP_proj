So giving all the love you have
Never be afraid to show your heart
So giving all the love you have
There is a special reason
A special reason

In the big dream
We are heroes
We are dreamers
Of the big dream

Someone told me
There are brothers
Live forever
In the big sky

Just hear your voice
Sing all the songs of the earth
Nothing can come between us
You're a brother of mine

Sing out your sisters
All the dreams of the world
Nothing can come between us
We are the travellers of time

See the desert
We have walked the path
Of all the known religions

In the big dream
We are brothers, we are sisters
Of the big dream

Just hear your voice
Sing all the songs of the earth
Nothing can come between us
You're a brother of mine

Sing out your sisters
All the dreams of the world
Nothing can come between us

Took me by surprise
It opened up my eyes
I can't believe we're ready to
Run another
Run another
Run another

Fourth Dimension Dream
All the way it seems
I can't believe we're running to
See the world for what it really is
In the full moon

Took me by surprise
It opened up my eyes
I can't believe we're ready to
Run another
Run another
Run another

Fourth dimension dream
Always the way it seems

Just hear the voice
In all the songs of the earth
Nothing can come between us
You're a brother of mine

We hold our hands together
Be the sunshine
Nothing can come between us
You're a sister of time

Just hear the voice
Sing all the songs of the earth
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come between us

So give it all the love you have
Never be afraid to show your heart
So giving all the love you have
There is a special reason to come true

So giving all the love you have
Never be afraid to show your heart
So giving all the love you have
There is a special reason
There is a special reason this time

Long lost brother of mine
Seeing my life for the first time
Long lost brother of mine
Living my life in the dig dream

Long lost brother of mine
Walking away from illusion
Long lost brother of mine
Seeing my life for the first time

Long lost brother of mine
Seeing me fly like an eagle
Long lost brother of mine
Watching me walk in the full moon
Long lost brother of mine
Seeing my life for the first time
Long lost brother of mine
Walking this dream everlasting

So it's there
Putting one into one special reason
So it's there
Putting one into one
One another. Sure can. Sure can

This is a further dimension
Coming at us for the very first time
It's the second attention
Realising it all of the time

Re-defining this long lost passion
For the living we're in
This will be the first of many
I be telling you

Long lost brother of mine
Walking the dream evolution
Long lost brother of mine
Singing the sisters of freedom
Long lost brother of mine
Seeing the fathers of wisdom
Long lost brother of mine
Seeing my life for the first time

So it's there, but to want it to one special reason
Yes it's there, but to want it to want one another
So it's there, but to want it to one special reason
Yes it's there, you can see what you want to see

Long lost brother of mine
