High, high flames and boiling water
Still nobody knew
Stare at the ceiling, make way for something
Still nobody moves
Oh my goodness, oh my god I fear
Oh my goodness, oh my god I fear
I fear I'm cracking up

One million feelings is this for real I ask
Nobody knows
Somebody's daughter made me walk on water
Don't let me sink
I think I'm stupid, luxury problems still
I think I'm stupid, luxury problems still
It's more than I can take

Crying in the basement, what can I say
But I am so very sorry
Who would've thought that it would ever dry
Leaving nothing
Oh my goodness, oh my dear is this
Oh my goodness, oh my dear is this
The end?
Is this the end?
Is this the end?
Is this the end?
