Take good care of you and me
Protect us from the things that hurt love
Jealousies that take you under
Lies that undermine

Please be fair to you and me
Don't betray the love I give to you 
When you're away don't make me wonder
If I'm on your mind

Take good care of you and me
Real love is hard to find

Look in my eyes
I'll fall in love with you
Over and over
For the rest of our lives
Hear what I say now
I want our love to be
The one that's the strongest
And the one that survives
Cause there's no one else
That makes me feel so glad I'm alive

What a sorry note to end on 
If we should fall apart
Take good care of you and me
I've given you my heart

Look in my eyes
I'll fall in love with you
Over and over
For the rest of our lives
Hear what I say now
I want our love to be
The one that's the strongest
And the one that survives
Cause there's no one else
That makes feel so glad I'm alive

Look in my eyes
I'll fall in love with you
Over and over
For the rest of our lives
Hear what I say now
I want our love to be
The one that's the strongest
And the one that survives
Cause there's no one else
That makes me so glad I'm alive
