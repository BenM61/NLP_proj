I don't love you for what it's worth
So if you're leaving can you hurt
Cherry blossom, this is goodbye
Come here lately and you fly

When they say what it's worth
The world tells you first
Then you know where to hurt
The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so have you heard

Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
Lover let me please, be the one
Know the prayers to make
Flowers made to fade
And when this world to wait
It'll wait for us

The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so have you heard

Yes I loved you as a matter of fact
You first are wrapped up, and that's that

Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
You once made me smile
When you strayed

The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so have you heard
The world's on fire
The world's on fire, have you heard

Lover have you breathed
To make for your relief (To make for your belief)
So I'm no longer here by your side
What's to hide

The world's on fire
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Monday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Tuesday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Wednesday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Thursday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Friday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Saturday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Sunday)
