I just can't stop the feeling
Don't seem to go away
So if I hurt your feelings
Don't blame it all on me

I just can't stop the feeling
(Nothing else to say)
And now they're here to stay
So if I hurt your feelings
(Don't take it the wrong way)
It's just because I'm

Oh la la la la, la la la la la
Oh la la la la, la la la frisky
Oh la la la la, la la la la la
Oh la la la la, la la la frisky

I think I found a winner
With no ring around her finger
Her dress from all saints
But I think I've found a sinner

I think her pals are with her
Who's your girlfriend downin' liquor
If I tell her I'm a boxer
Would she let me down her knickers

I wanna pick her up
Pin her down
She gon' be waking up my neighbors
If I bring her round

Where I'm from if you're famous
You don't go to tinsel town
Pose for a picture smile
The fashionista's out

They say her best days
It cool to take her picture
Girl you better keep your distance
I just wanna have eh eh

I'm on a mission
I don't even wanna kiss her
Honey I won't even miss ya
When I'm done with ya eh eh

I just can't stop the feeling
(Nothing else to say)
Don't seem to go away
So if I hurt your feelings
(Don't take it the wrong way)
It's just because I'm

Oh la la la la, la la la la la
Oh la la la la, la la la frisky
Oh la la la la, la la la la la
Oh la la la la, la la la frisky

Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit?
Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit?

Yeah, I'm suspicious
She looks delicious
She likes to talk a lot
That's why I call her Trisha

Her nails are manicured
Her hair has been conditioned
Don't worry 'bout her race
She ain't it in no competition

She should be on television
Or on the radio singing
I would be the first to watch
And I would be the first to listen

I would put her in positions
Like the mission
From my staircase to her kitchen
Leave her twitchin', twitchin', twitchin', twitchin'
