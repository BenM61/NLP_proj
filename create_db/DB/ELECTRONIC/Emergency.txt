This girl is so hot!
How hot?
It's an emergency that I get her up outta the club
Let's go girl straight to the crib (To the crib)
A lot of freaky nasty things gonna go down

OK 911
I'm looking for a chick I am gonna find me some
The time has come she get a gold medal
I see you in your high heel shoes, stilettos
Tell me where you go mommy, keep a bad chick that's right for some
And I smoke tree so please don't rile me
What I mean when I say I think of you highly
'Cause your body so good, writing out cheques gotta thank my hood
And I won't fail my mission
Seen a video, she a real life vixen
I'm in the fast lane, see my tail lights glisten
Batman man, you can bail like Christian
Yeah I bring the life, but you gotta be willing
Say that new Diplo so appealing

So take a sip of this
I know it's real good
Just move your body now, if it feels good
Turn the bass up, I know they like that
There go shorty now, I'll be right back

Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency
Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency

We get it in and also go dance
I been in and out of her pants
Shorty wanna roll with me with no man
Back to the program, here we gon spend it out, shorty bend it out
Chillin' with Aoki we in the house
Emergency no they heard of me
And shorty on fire in the third degree
She like me, yes we like trees, I rained on her
And she known to keep a clean white-tee
Said I got to keep it brisk like Ice-T,
Coco you can get it if she like me
And we like he, they said we need I.D.
But do you really when you headed to the V.I.P.
More money, more problems yup B.I.G.
You gotta get it how you live before you D.I.E and that's that

So take a sip of this
I know it's real good
Just move your body now, if it feels good
Turn the bass up, I know they like that
There go shorty now, I'll be right back

Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency
Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency

Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency
Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency

Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency
