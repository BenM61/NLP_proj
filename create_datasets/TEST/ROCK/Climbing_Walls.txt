Ooh, oo
Run and break the chain I hope to get away some day.
To feel just what I want and to feel the hold you have on me.
Climbing up a wall I'm waiting for the weather to sway,
I'm feeling like a fool in a cage there's nothing left to say.

Oo, oo
Looking at the past I try to push your words away.
I'm rising up above to my sunset where the sky is grey
Taken for a ride now I'm reaching out to take control
I'm searching for the truth when I know that it wont lead the way.

Oh, I keep trying to run away,
From what you're saying.
Oh, I keep trying to run away,
I stay standing.

Oo, oo
Following a ghost in the distance of a brighter day
Its swimming in my mind now its building like a tidal wave.
Breaking down the walls that have kept me climbing up so high.
I feel the rays upon me and now the shadows run and hide.

Oh, I keep trying to run away,
From what you're saying.
Oh, I keep trying to run away,
But I stay standing.
Oh, I keep trying to run away,
From what you're saying.
Oh, I keep trying to run away,
But I stay standing.

Oh, I keep trying to run away,
From what you're saying.
Oh, I keep trying to run away
