Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired 
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired. 
Before the day I met you,
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my piece of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didnt know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it. 
Now im no longer doubtful of what im living for
And if I make you happy I dont need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
Ohh baby what ya done to me (whatcha done to me)
Made me feel so good inside (good inside)
And I just wanna be (wanna be)
Close to you you make me feel so alive

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel 
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
