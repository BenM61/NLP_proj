I gave you my heart on a platter
It was stupid
I gave you my life like it mattered
But you took it
I know that people tell me that it's gonna take time
But time feels like forever when you ain't by my side

I was young and foolish for breaking the spell
And now it just feels like I'm guilting myself
I found every reason to spin this around
Oh why, why, why, why

I missed you so much more than I ever loved you
I'm better at needing you now than when I had you
Oh I, I know I complained
But now you're all that I crave
Maybe I just loved you more than I knew

The truth is so hard to remember when it's fading
And all I can think about is what worked, it's amazing
It's funny how back then we always focused on the fact
And now it seems like you're the best thing I ever had

I was young and foolish for breaking the spell
And now it just feels like I'm guilting myself
I found every reason to spin this around
Oh why, why, why, why

I missed you so much more than I ever loved you
I'm better at needing you now than when I had you
Oh I, I know I complained
But now you're all that I crave
Maybe I just loved you more than I knew

I know in my heart we're not meant to be
If things were that good you'd be here with me
Or maybe I ruined a perfect thing
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah

I missed you so much more than I ever loved you
I'm better at needing you now than when I had you
Oh I, I know I complained
But now you're all that I crave
Maybe I just loved you more than I knew
