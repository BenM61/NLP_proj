Until you came, it felt like my world 
Was fallin' apart at the seams 
All of my childhood dreams were empty and meaningless 
Until we kissed it seemed like the rain 

Was turnin' my hopes into sand 
Ah, I was a yesterday man until I found you 
It was as plain as the nose on my face 
That I was heading nowhere 

Then into my life came an angel of grace 
Sunlight in her hair 
Now love is the strangest emotion 
'Cause just when 

I want you to stay 
Seems like you're changing, don't turn me away 
don't turn me away 

Until you came, it felt like my world 
Was fallin' apart at the seams 
All of my childhood dreams were empty and meaningless 
Until we kissed it seemed like the rain 
 
Oooh... 
I'm like a man in a mantle of black 
Who just saw the light. 
Who cast off the shadow when you gave him back 

The meaning to life 
Now love is the strangest emotion 
'Cause just when I want you to stay 
Seems like you're changing, don't turn me away 
I want you to stay 

Until you came, it felt like my world 
Was fallin' apart at the seams 
All of my childhood dreams were empty and meaningless 
Until we kissed it seemed like the rain
