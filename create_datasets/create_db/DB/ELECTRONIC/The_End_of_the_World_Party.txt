Bring me the dawn of the dead

Welcome to the end of the world party
Your first move might be your last
This is the night we all leave it behind
Goodbye for the last time

You can tell this is an un average rage
Not where I thought I'd be
Eighteen living the dream

Welcome to the end of the world party
Your first move might be your last
This is the night we all leave it behind
Goodbye for the last time

We feel so small watching the ball drop,
You wanna dance it's your last chance baby
We feel so small watching the ball drop,
You wanna dance it's your last chance baby

Welcome to the end of the world party
Your first move might be your last
This is the night we all leave it behind
Goodbye for the last time

Will you be invited, your front row seats at the end of the world
The end is near, we start to spin taking our last round
Bring me the dawn if the dead
