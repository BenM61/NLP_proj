Out amongst the walking wounded, every face on every bus 
Is you and me and him and her and nothing can replace the us I knew 
Nothing can replace the us I knew 

And no, I'm never gonna let you go 
And no, I'm never gonna let you go
And now I know I had a choice though you never made it clear to me 
I thought you never felt it deeply 
Now I'm never gonna let you go 
Now I'm never gonna let you go
Cause I could have loved you forever 
I could have loved you forever

What do you want from me? Are you trying to punish me? 
Punish me for loving you, punish me for giving to you 
Punish me for nothing I do, punish me for nothing 
You punish me for nothing, for nothing

Now I'm never gonna let you go
Cause I could have loved you forever 
Oh I could have loved you forever 

What do you want from me? Are you trying to punish me? 
Punish me for loving you, punish me for giving to you 
Punish me for nothing I do, punish me for nothing

Is you and me and him and her and nothing can replace the us I knew 
Nothing can replace the us I knew 
Out amongst the walking wounded, every face on every train 
Is you and me and him and her, some days I think I could go insane 
Some days I think I could go insane
