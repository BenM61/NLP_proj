So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
It's over
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
When it's over
And we can't take it home
The fire that was burning
When all around was turning
And we were cruising for the ride

Got to give a little of the love inside
Not to take it all
And watch me fall
I got me loving you
I had you loving me

And we both played along
Love is easy on the young
Life was together
As the world fades away
Into yesterday
I'm losing you forever

I'm just an empty shell
With nothing for tomorrow
I'm here to face the sorrow
The dream we sailed was far & wide

Got to give a little of the love inside
Not to take apart
This breaking heart
I got me loving you
I had you loving me

So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
It's over
And my heart lives alone 
I can make believe you need me 
When it's over

And we can't take it home 
The fire that is burning
When all around is turning
The dream we sailed was far & wide

Got to give a little of the love inside
The love inside
The love inside
