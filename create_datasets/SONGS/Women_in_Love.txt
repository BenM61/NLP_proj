A boy, a girl, two souls that grow
Two different directions
away they go
How so? Well, to feel a flow,
for love to show we must know
To say what we mean,
mean what we say
It's just like it seems
So take time to pray for her
She will see love as a blur
That's when the pain will occur
Word!

She will fall so far and
won't know who you are
Her strange heart
won't see the danger
The passion for love,
no way to save her
So treasure her heavenly pleasure
beyond all measure
Just reassure her that
You love her
That you love her

It's such a mystery sharing
your passionate pleasures
You wrestle with your soul,
your dreams won't last forever
It hurts to love it so, who knows 
when the heart is a stranger's
Then pray for one who sees, your
way through the untold dangers

It's a world, it's alive,
it's a look in your eyes
It's a touch, it's a kiss,
it's a reason to fly

Women in love
(Searchin' the night, lookin' for
light, prayin' for one who sees)
Women in love
(Hopin' to find some peace of mind
not just a fantasy)
Women in love
(A hopeless dream of love supreme
not what it seems to be)
Fall so far

Your fallen angel's come
time torn from the heavenly fire
You'll have to bite your tongue,
it's intensity's desire
You can say what you mean,
feel you know who you are
Looking into the eyes
like a child in the dark


Fall so hard
It's a world, it's alive,
it's a look in your eyes
It's a touch, it's a kiss, 
it's a reason to fly
You can say what you mean
feel you know who you are
Looking into the eyes
like a child in the dark

Women in love
(Searchin' the night, lookin' for
light, prayin' for one who sees)
Women in love
(Hopin' to find some peace of mind
not just a fantasy)
Women in love
(Into the night, lover's delight,
shakin' in ecstasy)
Women in love
(Searchin' the night, lookin' for 
light, prayin' for one who sees)
Women in love
(A hopeless dream of love supreme
not what it seems to be)
Fall so far
