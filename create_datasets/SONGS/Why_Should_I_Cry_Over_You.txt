I don't know why I should - cry over you
Sigh over you - even be blue
I should have known - that you'd leave me alone
And break - my heart in two

Although you have left me - alone to pine
And all of my love was - a (big fat) waste of time
Someday your heart will be - broken like mine
So why should I cry over you

(You broke my heart - you took it apart)
(So pack up your baggage and beat it)
(Why should I cry over you)
