Cut it out - your self-inflicted pain
Is getting too routine
The crowds are catching on
To the self inflicted song

Well, here we go again
The art of acting weak
Fall in love to fail
To boost your CD sales

(And that CD sells - yeah, what a hit)
You've got to repeat it
You gotta' sink to swim
If at first you don't succeed

You gotta recreate your misery
'Cause we all know art is hard
Young artists have got to starve
Try, and fail, and try again

The comforts of repetition
Keep churning out those hits
'Til it's all the same old shit

Oh, a second verse!
Well, color me fatigued
I'm hiding in hte leaves
In the CD jacket sleeves

Tired of entertaining
Some double-dipped meaning
A soft serve analogy
This drunken angry slur

In thirty-one flavors
You gotta' sink to swim
Immerse yourself in rejection
Regurgitate some sorry tale

About a boy who sells his love affairs
You gotta' fake the pain
You better make it sting
You're goin' break a long

When you get on stage
And they scream your name
"Oh, Cursive is so cool!"

You gotta sink to swim
Impersonate greater persons
'Cause we all know art is hard
When we don't know who we are
