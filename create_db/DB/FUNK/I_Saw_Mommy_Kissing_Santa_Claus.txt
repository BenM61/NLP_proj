Wow, mommy's kissing Santa Claus
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

He saw mommy kissing, kissin', kissin' Santa Claus
I did, I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

I did, I did, I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
You gotta believe me, you just gotta believe me
Come on, fellas, believe me, you just gotta believe me
