Cheers!
Uh
Oh, baby boy needs
Red baby, sunshine, sunshine, yeah

Usually it's cold in the England
So I think I'll fly somewhere different
Usually I work on the weekend
But I'm free, so I'm goin' out
African boy, where are you at though?
Need someone so bad I can take 'em
One night ting is not what I came for, no no
I wanna hit the town

Now I'm movin' through the race line, waistline
Pull me on you
Now, clearly you don't waste time, want mine
Not shy, are you?

Move confidence
Need a brother who move confident
Need a fella who do what he want
Got me feelin' all ooh
Dun-da-da-da
Seen a fella who knows what I want
Need a brother who move confident
Who's got me feelin' all ooh

Honestly, I know that we just met
But I think there's somethin' I'm likin'
The way that you look in my eyes
Like no way I can tell you no, I say, "Yes"
I don't know how quickly we'll take this
But whatever happens, I'm in this, I'm in this
Begin this, ay you can't see it's 'cause your window's tinted

Now I'm movin' through the race line, waistline
Pull me on you
Now, clearly you don't waste time, want mine
Not shy, are you?

Move confidence
Need a brother who move confident
Need a fella who do what he want
Got me feelin' all ooh
Dun-da-da-da
Seen a fella who knows what I want
Need a brother who move confident

Oh, you need a brother like me, babe
Spend money, I don't feel it
Fly around the world with a G, babe
Or slick talk got your in your feelings
The way I feel I can't deny
Got me workin' overtime
I lose it when you bust a rhyme
We foreplay then press rewind

I got you movin' to the waist line, waist line
Turn me on, babe
We be goin' to the late night, late night
Put me on you

Move confidence
Need a brother who move confident
Need a fella who do what he want
Got me feelin' all ooh
Dun-da-da-da
Seen a fella who knows what I want
Need a brother who move confident
Who's got me feelin' all ooh
