Rejoice I could, rejoice I could
Could take a choice, the choice I took
To take the choices out of your hands
And put'em in my hands
And it's all good, yeah it's all good
I got the bag, got the books
Skip the town, goodbye
With no bad feelings
No heartbroke, I hit the road

And so I moved to England
And started seeing, started seeing what we're doing
Still doing everything we want to

And maybe one day we'll go to rehab
Or back to Argentina, it's not that far away
Any day now

Let's hope that someday I play my concertina
To an arena full of people
Or dream my life away
Dreaming of the day

I wanna find my girl, love will be amazing
Champion sound, champion sound

Yeah

And maybe one day we'll go to rehab
Or back to Argentina, it's not that far away
Any day now

Let's hope that someday I play my concertina
To an arena full of people
Or dream my life away
Dreaming of the day I would

I found my love to be her
When I see her Imma say yeah
I'm on my hope she say yeah
I wanna try to say her this some day

I wanna find my girl, love will be amazing
Champion sound

When you find that love inside of me
Deep within the heart of me
Deep within my, deep within my
Deep within the heart of me

I wanna find my girl, love will be amazing
Champion sound, champion sound
