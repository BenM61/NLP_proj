Oh the band marched on in formation
The brass was phasing tunes I couldn't place
Windows open and raining in a room yellow, blue, gold and gray

The drunks were ricocheting 
The old buildings downtown empty so long ago
Windows broken and dreaming 
So happy to leave what was a home

With the sky blue sky, this ride in time wouldn't seem so bad to me now
Oh, I didn't die; I should be satisfied I survived
It's good enough for now

With the sky blue sky, this ride in time wouldn't seem so bad to me now
Oh, if I didn't die, I should be satisfied I survived
It's good enough for now
