Well I'm a sucker for some pretty eyes
But they're going home with some other boy tonight
Hell, I guess I'll be fine
'cause there's one girl whose all mine
She's seen it before, she'll see it again
Because those other girls going home with him
And I'll go back to her and she don't mind

she's my best girl
She's got six strings
She knows all about these
Heartbreaking things
And though her eyes might not shine
She's always by my side
Hell, she's all mine
For all night
She's my best girl by far
She's all mine
For all night
And she'll never break my heart

well she don't care if I come home late
Or if I don't come home for seven long nights
She knows that I'm hers and she knows to wait
She knows those other girls just won't last
She knows I'll always come on back
To her
She's all that I've got

she's my best girl
She's got six strings
She knows all about these
Heartbreaking things
And though her eyes might not shine
She's always by my side
She's all mine
For all night
She's my best girl by far
She's all mine
For all night
The only girl a boy can trust
Is his guitar
