I want to be there
When the morning breaks
Light in the dark
I want to be there
When your daughter paints
Her fingers

Write back (Write back)
Write back (Write back)
Come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back)

Given the chance, I'd take it
You walk my way, I'll be yours
Let your fingers tap
To the rhythm of my heart
We haven't met but I'll be right back

Write back (Write back)
Write back (Write back)
Come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back)

Cool wind cut through my heart
Wax the key to my part
Give into the green light flicker
You run the bath
And I'll warm the pasta, girl

Write back (Write back)
Write back (Write back)
Come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back)

Are you gonna be there
When the love is gone?
