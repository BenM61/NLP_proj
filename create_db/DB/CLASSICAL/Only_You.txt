Only you,
can make this world seem right
Only you,
can make the darkness bright
only you, and you alone
can thrill me like ya do
and fill my heart with love
for only you

Only you,
can make this change in me
for its true!
you are my destiny
when you hold my hand, i understand
the magic that you do
your my dream come true,
my one and only you...
