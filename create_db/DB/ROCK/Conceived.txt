Want to keep your dream alive
Can I keep it with mine
But I'm no good for you I suppose
When you get a cold bath
You still hold me close at night

Never liked you any less
And the world's not such
A friendly place, is it?
Can go very cold very quickly
And for a very long time
If the sun by some twist of fate
Stops giving out its shine

Some of the time the future
Comes right round to haunt me
Some of the time the future
Comes round just to see
That all is as it could be
Like it's there to remind me
We've got to wait and see

Didn't ask to be conceived
In a loveless embrace
Still we learn to be a warm sun
Around a very cold galaxy
It's just like you said it could be
Oh it's like you said it would be

Some of the time the future
Comes right round to haunt me
Some of the time the future 
Comes round just to see
That all is as it should be
Like it's there to remind me
We've got to wait and see
Got to let it be
Wait and see
Do do doop...
