I'm back again
Mama know that papa grow on jelly beans
Takes good care but pulls his hair when he gets mean
Papa know that mama goes for fancy dress
If papa give her nothing but the very best
If papa give her nothing but the very best
Honest papas love their mamas better

Mama know where papa goes so he revived
Starts to croon is since his tune to ginny rock
Papa know that mama shows her love is strong
By waiting up for him until a early dawn
By waiting up for him until a early dawn
Honest papas love their mamas better

They laughin' laughin' loud together
And make their little world seems better
And after laughin' fun is fun
They kiss goodnight till the morning come
Honest papas love their mamas better

Papa know that mama goes for fancy dress
And papa give her nothing but the very best
And papa give her nothing but the very best
Honest papas love their mamas better
Honest papas love their mamas better
