I found a place
A place to plant my seed
I found a place
A place to plant my seed
I know a place

A place to plant my seed
A place to plant my seed

Two souls alone in embrace
An angel awaits to be named

I found a place
Oh, oh my delight!
I found a place
Planting under a fertile moonlight
I know a place

A place to plant my seed
A place to plant my seed

Two souls alone in embrace
An angel awaits to be named

And they turn into three
Garden
Rich in
Fertility

I found a place
Oh, my delight!
I found a place
Planting under a fertile moonlight
I know a place

A place to plant my seed
A place to plant my seed
