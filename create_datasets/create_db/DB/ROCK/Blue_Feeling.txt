Sit here and wonder what am I so blue
Is it because I'm still in love with you ?
Blue blue feeling got me down today
Blue blue feeling, my baby's gone away

Now that she's gone, I don't know what I'll do
I guess I'll have to find, find somebody new
Blue blue feeling got me down today
Blue blue feeling, my baby's gone away

Baby please don't leave me, oh don't leave me
Now that she's gone, I'm feeling kind of blue
I guess I'll have to find, find somebody new
Blue blue feeling got me down today
Blue blue feeling, my baby's gone away

Well baby please don't leave me
Baby please don't go
Awh!Honey child don't leave me now,
Baby please, baby please
