Influences now are things that are all around me
Changing shape as they move around in an open mind
Coloured in by the images I find
I'm just watching for shapes that grow
I'm just watching for shapes that grow
(watching for shapes that grow)

Like electric sparks they danced by an open mirror
Closing doors never looking round but it's not goodbye
They'll be there till I'm taken out I know
I'm just watching for shapes that grow
I'm just watching for shapes that grow
(watching for shapes that grow)

In my mind there's a space that's full of painted pictures
Things I did that I went through, but can't recall
Now and then there's a flash of the unknown
I'm just watching for shapes that grow
I'm just watching for shapes that grow
(watching for shapes that grow)

(watching for shapes that grow)
(watching for shapes that grow)
