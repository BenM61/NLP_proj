I'm talking about the death of rock'n'roll 

1 2 3 4!

I came to raise the energy
They came to kill the energy
Some spread lies and some go wild
But I don't care 'cause you can't stop me

I'm here to stay!
And I'm here to stay!
And I'm here to stay!
You better watch out 'cause I came to terminate!

Kiss of death!
Come on!
Kiss of death!
I'm gonna tear your world down!

Don't even try to corrupt me
Don't even try to seduce me
Kiss of death!
You gotta do much better than that!

Hey!

When I feel it you feel it
When I do it you do it
I wanna know where the truth has gone
Next to me is where you belong

And I'm here to stay!
And I'm here to stay!
And I'm here to stay!
No one around is gonna take my place!

Kiss of death!
Come on!
Kiss of death!
I'm gonna tear your world down!

Don't even try to corrupt me
Don't even try to seduce me
Kiss of death!
You gotta do much better than that!

Media is telling you to adjust
Friends look at you like you must
When they start turning shit into gold
It's time!
Come on!
Death, the only romance to have
Faith is gone, only ignorance is left
When they start turning shit into gold
It's time!

Too many things that contradict
All rats leave when the ship starts to sink
But when there's nothing to leave to?
It's time!
It's time to make up your mind
If you wanna belong to the dying kind

Kiss of death!
Come on!
Kiss of death!
I'm gonna tear your house down!

Don't even try to corrupt me
Don't even try to seduce me
Kiss of death!
You gotta do much better than that!

Come on!
And I'm here to stay!
And I'm here to stay!
And I'm here to stay!
You better watch out 'cause I came to terminate!

Kiss of death!
Kiss of death!
Kiss of death!
Kiss of death!
