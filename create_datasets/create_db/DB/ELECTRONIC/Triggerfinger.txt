You're letting go
But I need to know what should I do
The more I pull you in, the more that you get loose
We're playing games, but I can never win with you
Every spark has an ending like a burning fuse

I'm on the edge
The more that I try to confess, the more our feelings collide
And all your dreams will fade until nothing is left
If you keep looking behind

You drain my heart, then you fill it up
You keep cutting me short, and you always put a pressure
On my triggerfinger
You keep pulling my chain in a hurricane
I try breaking away, but is sinking to the pressure
and I sense you're an ember

We're on a road, heading nowhere as we're steering blind
We're on our own, with each other racing side by side
Nowhere to go, but I am heading to the end of time
We'll never know where we're going
Never know if it's right

I'm on the edge
The more that I try to confess, the more our feelings collide
And all your dreams will fade until nothing is left
If you keep looking behind

You drain my heart, then you fill it up
You keep cutting me short, and you always put a pressure
On my triggerfinger
You keep pulling my chain in a hurricane
I try breaking away, but is sinking to the pressure
and I sense you're an ember

You keep pulling my chain in a hurricane
I try breaking away, but is sinking to the pressure
and I sense you're an ember

Everything's long, long gone
Everything that we know
Everything was easy
Everything hot went cold

Everything's long, long gone
Everything that we know
Everything was easy
Everything hot went cold
