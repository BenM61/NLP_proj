Ayo this Cassidy
And niggaz is not fuckin wit me man
Yea I'm talkin reckless but you gotta respect it
Its in my DNA man, I was born to be a gangsta
Kiss talk to 'em man

(Jadakiss)
Yo, you know me K-I-S-S
Kiss of Death LP soon come for ya, bless bless
Metallic green paint on the apala the S.S
And I figured the more niggaz dead the less stress

You love how I'm hurtin the track
You want to polly but I'm sort of hard to reach like the dirt on ya back
Hand to hand like I'm workin the sack
And I work out on my arms, so I have no problem workin the mack (uh)

Neva been a toe steppa, side switcher
A fence jumper, I was ten wit ten pumpers
Hustled wit the best of dem
Did watever it took to make a quarter I charged niggaz to watch wrestlin

I'm a heavy threat, D-Block, Double are, Full surface why'all niggaz ain't ready yet
YEA, NEW YORK IS MINE, PHILLY IS CASS
HOLLA BACK

(Cassidy)
You know me, see-A-S-S, fresh dressed
Just coped some new 4-5's and a fresh vest
I get scout, 'cause a bitch mouth is the best sex
But less talk, you ain't got no heart in ya left breast

Go head, get ya beef on
I let my wolves get they eat on
And leave you wit nothin but ya sneaks on
But it don't matter 'cause ya feets gonn

Now that's restin in peices so go meet Jesus
You lil boys better ease up
'Cause them dudes you think hot, will see Cass and then freeze up
You want to scrap? role ya sleeves up

But, I'd rather squeeze 'cause I ain't trynna f*ck my trees up
Or wrinkle my dickie, I crack the dutch sprinkle the sticky
I know you pissed, I got kiss and them wit me, dig me?
'Cause you dudes is haters
And if you bet that I was gonn flop, you gonn LOSE YA PAPER

(cassidy: yea) I need to talk to ya
(cassidy: okay) can I talk to ya?

Ayo, get it through ya head it's no stoppin me
Nigga the "are" is Double, the Surface is Full, the Block is D
All it take is a trey 8 and a mask
Nigga its Jada and Cas I vision ya face, watin to blast
If money was food why'all niggaz be fastin
And we stuffin our face, we eatin wit passion
In the hood like we runnin numbers
Cass ask these mothafuckas why they runnin from us

(Cassidy)
They runnin from us 'cause they petrified
I lift guns for the exercise
And I spray like insectosides
You bullz better recognize
When the weapon rise
You can catch slugs in ya chest through ya vest and die
You on some sucka shit
So I'll leave a scar on ya face
Longer than the knife that I cut you wit
I done paid my dews
So I'll blow ya brains out
And then feed it to ya seed like baby food

(cassidy: yea) I need to talk to ya
(cassidy: okay) can I talk to ya?
(cassidy: come on come on come on) ay, lemme holla at cha
(cassidy: come on come on come on) yo, stop runnin from me
