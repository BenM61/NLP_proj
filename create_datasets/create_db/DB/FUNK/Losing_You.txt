Tell me the truth boy, am I losing you for good?
We used to kiss all night, but now there's just no use
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth boy, am I losing you for good

I know you're waiting for the rest that you can't get from me
Just treat me good and baby I'll give you the rest of me
I'm not the one, that you should be making your enemy
I'm not the one, that you should be making your enemy

There's nothing more I know you're taking it away from me
I gave you everything and now there's nothing left of me
