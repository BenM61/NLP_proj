Well it's cold and it's windy
And the snowflakes are heavy like a dead man body
Whatever the weather I got you under my skin
But now it's time for me to climb the top of the hill again
And spit all your feathers
Birdie lady, spit all your body

I can't believe I can't stand to believe
You know I can even think
Oh I can't believe I can't stand to believe
You know I can't even think
About the idea of losing you again

Well it's cold and windy
And the snowflakes are heavy like a dead man body
I can't even think about the idea of losing you again

Whatever the weather I got you under my skin
