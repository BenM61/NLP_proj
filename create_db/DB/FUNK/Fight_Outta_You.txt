They'll look you in the eyes and stone you,
Then turn and disown you.
Don't you let em take the fight outta you.

They'll walk all over your name
Till they find someone else to blame.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

Secrets hide their lies
Inside hidden alibis.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

They put the world on a hook,
It's worse every time I look.
Don't let em take the fight outta you.

I would rather take your punch
Than not give you a shot.
I'd rather find out who you are
Than who you're not.
Should've known better than to mistake business for love.
Should've known better than to mistake a fist for love.

It will be in your 'on' until you're not
Needed any longer.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

Don't believe the headlines,
Check for yourself sometimes.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

The lies you live become you,
The love you lose, it numbs you.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

You say that you've arrived,
That's just a high class bribe.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

I would rather take your punch
Than not give you a shot.
I'd rather find out who you are,
Than who you're not.
Should've known better than to mistake business for love.
Should've known better than to mistake a fist for love.

There's always someone younger,
Someone with more hunger.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

They'll say you're one and only
They'll straight up leave you lonely.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

Like a transplant patient
Waiting for a donor.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.

Like a half empty balloon
After a party in the corner.
Don't let it take the fight outta you.
