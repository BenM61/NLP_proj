You said it's over now 
It's just not right 
You said there's a better place for you to be 
It's not with me 
Then you turned and walked away 
I can't believe what I see 
And I can't go to sleep at night when I think of how it used to be 

She can't give you what I've got 
And she can't stop your pain 
And she can't love you the way I do 
God I want you back again 
Maybe she could try with money 
Or she could buy you clothes 
But baby when it's dark and you're home at night 
Does she ever hold you close 

She takes you out in style 
She treats you right 
She gives you all the things I never could, she's so good 
But don't you think of me 
Baby late at night 
And I just can't take it boy, together we could be so right 

She can't give you what I've got 
And she can't stop your pain 
And she can't love you the way I do 
God I want you back again 
Maybe she could try with money 
Or she could buy you clothes 
But baby when it's dark and you're home at night 
Does she ever hold you close 

Take me back 
(Ooh you're gonna need me) 
(Ooh you're gonna need me) 
Take me back 
(Ooh you're gonna need me) 
All those things we did before 
Whatever happened to them 
And all those things I've been living for 
Gotta start 'em all over again 

You said it couldn't last 
That we were meant to part 
A guy like you and a girl like me didn't stand a chance - not from the 
start 
But then you looked at me 
I had to ask you why 
As I see and try to find out why you left me for those hungry eyes 

She can't give you what I've got 
And she can't stop your pain 
And she can't love you the way I do 
God I want you back again 
Maybe she could try with money 
Or she could buy you clothes 
But baby when it's dark and you're home at night 
Does she ever hold you close 

Take me back 
(Ooh you're gonna take me) 
Take me back 
(Ooh you're gonna take me) 
Take me back 
(Ooh you're gonna take me) 
Take me back
