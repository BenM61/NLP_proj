You never had a chance, didja babe?
So good lookin', so insecure.
And now you say you can't remember,
When the lines you drew began to blur.
Yeah, when all of this is over,
Should I lose you in the smoke?
I want you to know you were the one.
And may my love travel with you everywhere
Baby, may my love travel with you always.

Maggie's still tryin' to rope the tornado.
Joe's in the backyard, trying to keep things simple.
And the lonely DJ's diggin' a ditch,
Tryin' to keep the flames from the temple.
Oh, and if perhaps I lose you
In the smoke down the road,
I want you to know you were the one.
And may my love travel with you everywhere
Yeah, may my love travel with you always.

How bout a cheer for all those bad girls?
And all those boys that play that rock and roll?
They love it like you love Jesus,
It does the same thing to their souls.
And when all of this is over,
Should I lose you in the smoke
I want you to know you were the one.
And may my love travel with you everywhere,
Yeah, may my love travel with you always.
Baby, may my love travel with you everywhere,
Yeah, may my love travel with you always.
