Push your foot to the floor
Don't need no more
You've been peeking all around
While they're messing about

Better get your name, come on in
Gimme that thing and feed your war

War Machine

Make a stand, show your hand
Call in the high command
Don't think, just obey
I'm like a bird of prey

So better get your name, come on in
Gimme that thing and feed your war

War Machine

Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck, know the score
They take you by surprise
And here's mud in your eye

This will be the day they shouldn't forget
Call of the wild, hungry for more
And feed your

War Machine

Let's go.

I've seen your war

War Machine
