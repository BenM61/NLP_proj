"It's scary to watch someone you love go into the center of himself and confront his fears...
Fear of failure, fear of death, fear of going insane
You have to fail a little, die a little, go insane a little to come out the other side."

Break my heart slowly
Dora Maar said to me
She came to me in a dream
Reaching out full up with fear

She said:
"Hold on, hold on, hold on to your gun"

It was cold, the night was black
You could feel her freezing hands
Exiting a life of chance
Painted dead a million times

She said:
"Hold on, hold on, hold on to your gun"

She said:
"If your life has changed
If it makes no sense
You can carry on if you still belong
If your life has changed
If it makes no sense
You can carry on
If you still belong

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Break my heart slowly
Break my heart slowly
So come one now etc
Break my heart slowly
