I'm a Custom Kar Commando
Ain't she, she, she can, she can
I'm a Puerto Rican rocket baby
Fast as fast you can
Anyway you can

Come on, come on, come on you can, can
Come on, come on, come on you can, can
Firebomb boogie dance on, dance on
Sex bomb boogie dance on, dance on
Baby, dance on

I'm a Rio riot rampage
Ain't she, she, she can, she can
Made in Hong Kong jukebox junkie
Jack the knife the astrokan
Anyway you can

Come on, come on, come on you can, can
Sex bomb boogie dance on, dance on
Neutron boogie dance on, dance on
Baby, dance on

Princess Perfect white Mercedes
Ain't she, she, she can, she can
Tilt back shiny pink and fishtail baby
Fast as fast you can
Anyway you can

Deluxe she looks I wanna bam, bam
Deluxe she looks, she looks she can, can
King Kong boogie dance on, dance on
Sex bomb boogie dance on, dance on

I'm just gift wrapped to be unwrapped fuel injected
And I'm on firearm boogie dance on, dance on
Sex bomb boogie dance on, dance on
King Kong boogie dance on, dance on
Firearm boogie dance on, dance on
Ooh baby, dance on
