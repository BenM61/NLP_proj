I felt this coming for a month or two
You don't look at me like you used to do
So when you leave it's going to be too soon
Give me a minute, while we're still in it

Lie with me, hold me like you need it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower, baby, one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on, lie with me

Go put your favorite MoTown record on
Do what we need to feel it all night long
Make me believe you ain't already gone
Let's make our last time, our best time

Lie with me, hold me like you need it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower, baby, one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on, lie with me

Baby lie with me

Love me like you mean it, like you really
You owe me that much now
Don't leave me here with nothing
Give me something, baby what's the rush now?

Lie with me, hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower, baby, one last time

Lie with me, hold me like you mean it
Kiss me like you're loving only me tonight
Make me feel like it ain't over
Go a little slower, baby, one last time
It ain't the truth's gonna set me free
Come on, come on, lie with me

Lie with me, lie with me
