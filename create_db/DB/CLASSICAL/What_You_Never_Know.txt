What you never know won't hurt you
What you never know won't lie
What you never know won't desert you
What you never know won't say goodbye

What you never know won't hurt you
What you never know won't lie
What you never know won't desert you
What you never know won't make you cry

I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
*My heart's torn in two*
I'm falling for you

What you never know won't hurt you
What you never know won't lie
What you never know won't desert you
What you never know - unless you try

I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
