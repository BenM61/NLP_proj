Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat,
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head.

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

I'm tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
I'm tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Last time tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
Last time tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you
