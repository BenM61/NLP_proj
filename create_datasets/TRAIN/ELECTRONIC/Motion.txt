He won't come down never
He won't come down
He won't come down never
He won't come down

He won't come down
He won't come down

When your it heart beats heavy for a drum.
No you won't come down easy let me run.
When you long to reach heaven where the night is young
All the stars above you are in

Motion now, motion now
Your feeling so alive
Motion now, motion now tonight
Motion now, motion now
Your feeling so alive
Motion now, motion now tonight
Oh

In the neon blue city
In the twilight fields
See the ballroom dance floor
Only there has heat
Anyone can feel it

Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, motion now tonight
Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, motion now tonight

Oh

Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, motion now tonight
Motion now, motion now
You feel so alive
Motion now, motion now tonight
Oh
