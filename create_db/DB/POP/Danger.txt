Your arms reach out for me
And something deep inside me
Seems to say (danger)

My friends all tell me
You will break my heart
But I can't stay away (danger)

For when we kiss
I know that this is where
I always want to be

Yet when you look at me
There's something in your eyes
That seems to warn me

And I see danger, danger
Danger, danger in your eyes
There's danger, danger
Danger, danger
My heart cries, I know
I know that I should stay away

But when you smile at me
The danger disappears
And when you're close to me
I have no doubts or fears

Oh, darling, should I stay
Or should I run away

I guess that I could leave
And find someone whose love
I'd never doubt (danger)

But that could never be
For you're the one
I just can't live without (danger)

But still the danger's there
And should you break my heart
I'll take the blame

Although there's danger
And my heart's in danger
When I play the game

And I see danger, danger
Danger, danger in your eyes
There's danger, danger
Danger, danger
My heart cries, I know
I know that I should stay away

But when you smile at me
The danger disappears
And when you're close to me
I have no doubts or fears

Oh, darling, should I stay
Or should I run away
