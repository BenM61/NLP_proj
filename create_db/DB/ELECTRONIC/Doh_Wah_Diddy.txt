There she was just a - walking down the street
Singin' doh wah diddy diddy dam diddy doh
Snapping her fingers and shuffling to the beat
Singin' doh wah diddy diddy dam diddy doh

Check out the groove
And the beat is gonna move you
Shake it shake it shake it
Until you get crazy
But just don't fake it
So you want me to shake it, yo I'll shake it
Pass me the mic
And I sure won't fake it
Me and my man  TC
We get down
To the beat
It's the doh wah diddy sound
Let this beat just spin you around
Get up and stand up and move
To this sound
Let this rhythm control
Your feet it's the factory of fun

Unique styles is what we're bringing you
'Cause we blow up y'all
And I came to do
A brand new style for
The dance floor
'Cause I got more you
