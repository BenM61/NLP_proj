I'm better, so much better now
I see the lights touch the light
We're together now

I'm better, so much better now
Look to the skies
Give me life
We're together now

We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again

And now it feels so amazing
Can't see you coming
And we'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

I'm never, I'm never down
Lying here, staring up
And you're looking down
I'm never, I'm never down
Live forever, forever
With you around

We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun,
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun

When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again

And now it feels so amazing
Can't see you coming
And we'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh (Chasing the sun)
Oh oh oh oh (Chasing the sun)
Oh oh oh (You'll find us chasing the sun)
Oh oh oh oh

You'll find us chasing the sun

When the daylight's fading (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
We're gonna play in the dark (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Till it's golden again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

And now it feels so amazing (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Can't see you coming (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And we'll never grow old again (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
You'll find us chasing the sun
