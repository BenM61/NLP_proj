I hear you comin', just surroundin' me
I'll try to fight it, just you wait and see
'Cause when you come around you take me up in the space
Oh, I get excited and I start to go insane

Insane, take my feet up off the ground
Insane, every time you come around
Help me, help me, why don't you help me out?
Insane

Uh, I saw three women just the other day
I snuck up real close to hear what they had to say
Ah, they said that Rudolph Valentino's the best lover in town
And when I need him the most, he ain't around

Ah, hey fellas, yes, I need some more support
'Cause when she do me like she do, I wind up in a rut
Ah, and that rut you see makes livin' hard for me
If this goes on much longer I'll lose my identity

Insane, take my feet up off the ground
Insane, every time you come around
Insane, yeah, yeah
Insane

Now, if you would think the sound of my voice
I want you to go like this
1, 2, 3, uh

Insane
Insane
Uh

Insane
Insane
Insane

Insane
Insane
Uh

Insane
Insane
Insane

Insane
Insane
