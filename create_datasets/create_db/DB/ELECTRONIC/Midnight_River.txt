Home is an hour away
And I don't even know my name
And time bent like an hourglass
We want to forget about ourselves
Just 'til the night is through
But the way back is sliding out of view

And if you wait for the river to roll
Just let it roll, just let it roll
And if it feels like you're losing control
Let go, just let go
And let the midnight river roll
And let the midnight river roll

Distraction is just a breath away
It carries my weight back home
But I got, I'll run this on my own

And if you wait for the river to roll
Just let it roll, just let it roll
And if it feels like you're losing control
Let go, just let go
And let the midnight river roll
And let the midnight river roll

And if you wait for the river to roll
Just let it roll, just let it roll
And if you feel like you're losing control
Let go, just let go
And let the midnight river roll
And let the midnight river roll
And let the midnight river roll
