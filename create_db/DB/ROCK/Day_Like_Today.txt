Welcome back
Says the voice on the radio
But I never left
I was always right here

In your hand all the colours
You thought were kings
At the turn of a card
Can just disappear

I wish I could comfort you
If love is our defence
It's alright I can comfort you
If you let me I could love you to death

Need to see
Need to say
Need to be
Something beautiful

I can't get today
Out of my mind
Need to say need to call
To love someone beautiful
A day like today
Has stained my eyes

All I ever say
And all I ever do
Is just a message to you
And all I ever play
Are the cards you gave me
It's just my version of the truth

All I ever say
And all I ever do
Is just a message to you
And all I ever play
Are the cards you gave me
It's just my version of the truth

I wish I could comfort you
If love is our defence
It's alright I can comfort you
If you let me I could love you to death
If you let me I could love you to death
