The light at dawn is mystery
She holds out her hand
Velvet green
Alive at night you know it's right
It creeps down your spine
You couldn't sleep now she's all you see

It creeps down your spine. velvet green.

A kiss at dawn is mystery
You think it's showing
Bittersweet

Candy candy. give it to me.
I want it bittersweet
Candy candy. give it to me

The kiss at dawn is mystery
She holds out her hand
Likes what she sees
To break a heart to mend your ways
It only takes seven days
You know everything. everything's upside-down.

Candy candy. give it to me.
I want it slow and sweet.
Candy candy. give it to me.

It melts your mouth slow and sweet.
