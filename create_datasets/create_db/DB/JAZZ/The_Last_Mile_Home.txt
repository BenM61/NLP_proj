(The longest mile, the sweetest mile,
The last mile home)

The longest mile is the last mile home
When you've been away
The dearest dreams are the dreams of home
When you've been away
You travel far over land and sea
Then one day it's as clear as can be
The sweetest mile you'll ever roam
Is the last mile home.

(You can travel round the globe
And see a lot of things
From Mandalay to old Pompeii
To Paris in the spring.)

But you'll only learn one thing
Yes, just one thing.
You travel far over land and sea
Then one day it's as clear as can be
The sweetest mile you'll ever roam
Is the last mile home.
