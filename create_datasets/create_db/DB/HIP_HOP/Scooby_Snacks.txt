Me and Fast got the gats, we're out to rob a bank 
We got Steve outside, carrying a full pack 
Now everything's cool and everthing's smooth 
I walked up to the teller, I gave her the letter 
She gave me the loot with puckered up lips 
And a wink that I found cute, and I said, 
'Baby, baby, baby' 
(Is this some Kharmic-Chi love thing happening here baby or what) 
By that time Fast tapped me with the nine
He said it's time to blow, ya know, so out the door we go 
Back to the ride with Steve inside and alive, off we drive 
See, I hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far, 
Riding around in a stolen police car
So we dropped it off and piled in a Caddy 
Steve was driving 
Because I had to talk to my man about something 

Running around robbing banks 
All wacked off of Scooby Snacks! 

Running around robbing banks

I don't give a f*ck about the hell's gate, 
Ain't punkin' the crowd and I'm still standing up staight 
So, we pull these jobs to make a little money, 
No one gets hurt if they don't act funny 
On the way to the yacht, we almost got caught, 
Fast shooting mailboxes, knowi where the cop is
Yeah, they're at the Dunkin Donuts, adjacent from The Froman's 
Whose mailbox Fast had just Exploded 
They gave chase, but our man 
Steve's an ace, we lost those brothers with haste 
We cast off and along we went 
Off Bermuda to an island resort we rent 

Running around robbing banks 
All wacked off of Scooby Snacks!

Running around robbing banks 
All wacked off of Scooby Snacks!

Running around robbing banks 
All wacked off of Scooby Snacks!
