A we-a-e-a-ell
The little things you say and do
Make me want to be with you-a-hoo
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin' and
I know it's got me reelin'
When you say, I love you, rave on

The way you dance and hold me tight
The way you kiss and say goodni-hi-hight
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin' and-a
I know it's got me reelin'
When you say, I love you, rave on

A-well rave on, it's a crazy feelin' and
I know, it's got me reelin'
I'm so glad, that you're revealin'
Your love for me
Rave on, rave on and tell me
Tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only
Rave on to me

A-well rave on, it's a crazy feelin' and
I know, it's got me reelin'
I'm so glad, that you're revealin'
Your love for me
Rave on, rave on and tell me
Tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only
Rave on to me
