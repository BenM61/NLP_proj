If I ask you politely
What it is your going to be
When you grow up you tall me
A woman
Came to see me yesterday,
In the merry month of September
I took a trip to see
All the things I was going to be
A famous movie star
With a two hundred foot car

That will only carry two people
Came to see me yesterday
In the merry month of July 
I'll fly anywhere you want me to
Just tell me when and

You won't mind if I don't find
What I am looking for
What I am looking for
Is a bicycle made for one
Hundred people to sit on
Plus a carriage made for two people
Came to see me yesterday,

In the merry month of July
I'll fly anywhere you want me to
Just tell me when and

You won't mind if I don't find
What I am looking for
What I am looking for
Is a bicycle made for one
Hundred people to sit on
Plus a carriage made for two people
Came to see me yesterday,

In the merry month of marching
Side by side and back to back
I think it's fair to say that's that.
