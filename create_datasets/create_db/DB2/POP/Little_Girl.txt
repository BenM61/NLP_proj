Hey Erica and Tina can 
Sing a song about little girls for me, please

She was just 13 and I just don't think
That she ever seen her own beauty
And she didn't think she'd be anything
And that little girl, she used to me be

Little girl, little girl
Wonder are you listening 
Little girl, little girl
Struggling with your confidence
Little girl, little girl
God made you so beautiful
Little girl, little girl
I just thought that you should know

Sometimes you feel like you don't fit in
'cause you don't look like
All your other friends
Got your own thing going on 
Girl you are so unique you are just
That way that
God intended for you to be

Little girl, little girl
Wonder are you listening 
Little girl, little girl
Struggling with your confidence
Little girl, little girl
God made you so beautiful
Little girl, little girl
I just thought that you should know

Tell you what you should do
When you get up
In the morning look yourself in the 
Mirror and say
I love me
Even with all of your flaws and all of your downfalls 
Just be your best 'cause to him you 
Already are

Little girl, little girl
Wonder are you listening 
Little girl, little girl
Struggling with your confidence
Little girl, little girl
God made you so beautiful
Little girl, little girl
I just thought that you should know
