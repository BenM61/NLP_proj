S-W- with the V , yeah, you know,
Characters.

Oh, life is short.
What?
Never thought I'd find love, 'til the day I found you, sugar.
Never had no one to hold me like this, (like this, like this.)
What?
Oh, no, no, Oh.
Characters.
What?
Oh, oh.
Like this what, like this what, oh. 
 
This time, last year, I was feeling so alone.
I never thought that you would come along.
You changed my whole world.
Now all I have is memories.
My lonely days are gone.
You changed the right from wrong.

[Chorus] 
And I never,
Never thought I'd find love,
'Til the day I found you, sugar, (I never had no one.)
Never had no one to hold me like this, (like this, like this.)
No, no, no

[Chorus]
 
Never imagined just what it would be like,
To have this feeling that I feel,
Without you in my life.
It's like a day of sunshine after days of cloudy skies,
And when you held me in your arms,
You opened up my eyes.
And I tell the world that I'm in love, (yeah, yeah.)
And it feels so good to know,
You're the one that I adore.
Every day, (everyday and night), you love me right.
I don't want to trade it for nothing in this world.

[Chorus x 2]
 
Imagine this, me Caes.
E-3's, chesties, palm trees.
I know you like the way it sounds, so take your pic hon,
And watch this tongue go dead between your lips, uh.
While my niggaz be stazzin' out, I blowin' mad spazzles out.
Your leather, my house.
What's even better, my cheddar, your couch.
It's now or never, my tongue, in your mouth.
I makes it happen, dumber than a Hummer with my man Trife jigga.
Only boney girls with nice figures, ridin' dat digga.
Whole figure, platinum with gold diggers.
So what's it gonna be girl, tell me who you roll with?
Who you want to be with, who you creep with?
I giving you the green light, so if you the right ho,
Ask Joe, square the double, be a playa no more.

I never, 
Never thought I'd find love,
'Til the day I found you, sugar. (I never felt this way.)
Never had no one to hold me like this, (like this, like this.)
No, no, no.

I never, 
Never thought I'd find love,
'Til the day I found you, sugar. (I never felt this way.)
Never had no one to hold me like this, (like this, like this.)
No, no, no.
