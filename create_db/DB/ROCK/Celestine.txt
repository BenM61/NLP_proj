This may come as a surprise
But I've got x-ray eyes
And I can see the skull
Beneath the skin
Though you do not realize
I can read what's in your mind
And I know you're not so
Attached to him

Celestine, don't lie to me
Celestine, don't lie, don't lie

You may not understand
I don't need to lay on hands
I already know exactly
How you feel
You don't have to say a word
It's your heatbeat I have heard
Getting louder now across
The space between

I know what you're thinking
So you don't have to say
Stranger things can happen
They happen every day
I've got special information
I don't need to be told
But I need insight into your soul
