Girl
I'm feeling down tonight.
What you gotta do
Is - put a little love on me
Put a little love on me.
You can set my soul alight.
Girl it's up to you to
Put a little love on me
...
Put a little love on me
...
Girl
You picked me up before.
Let me lean on you
You - put a litle love on me
Put a little love on me.
I can't take it anymore
You can pull me through.
So - put a little love on me.
Put a little love on me...
