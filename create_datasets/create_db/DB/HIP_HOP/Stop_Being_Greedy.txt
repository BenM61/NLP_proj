Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop being greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
F*ck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's having dreams
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but, never
Will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holding, on 'til, what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhunting motherfuckas, stay on the floor
4-4, that's what I get sick wit (Grr)
Fall off, now all this is liquid (Grr)

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop being greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
F*ck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop being greedy

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with the gift
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start running
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm coming
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Begging me to stop but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowing red eyes, everything else is black

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop being greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
F*ck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop being greedy

When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thanking me for their help
Hoping that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's going down you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day that's when your luck stops
One drops, and another and another
Gun pops, going through you, hit your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fucking with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when its your time to go, you go

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop being greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
F*ck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
