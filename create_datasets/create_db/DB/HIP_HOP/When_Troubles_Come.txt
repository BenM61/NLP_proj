Do you live your life a pleasure
Trust in things you can see
Seeking after peace and freedom
But never finding the key
Well my son hear my instructions
Wisdom crieth in the streets
How long will you despise wisdom
And love simplicity
'Cause when your fears cometh
Like a dark and anguish flood
And your mortal strength has failed you
And there's no one to lift you up
To lift you up

For the day is coming
Time is approaching
Don't you be left here all alone
'Cause you're gonna need somebody
A special someone to call your own

When troubles come

See I thought my life was hopeless
And my problems out of reach
I heard He gave to all men
Yet still bound by unbelief
So until my eyes were opened
I just lived a life of fear
Just wondering what would happen
With troubles being so near
With troubles being so near

For the day is coming
Time is approaching
Don't you be left here all alone
'Cause you're gonna need somebody
A special someone to call your own

But today I know Somebody
A Special Somebody
Yes One whom I can depend upon
That will be there when I'm needing
There when friends forsake me
I'm not all alone
When troubles come
Ooh Jesus, when troubles come
