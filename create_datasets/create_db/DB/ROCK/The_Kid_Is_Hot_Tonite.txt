We just heard of a brand new wave
And we hope its here to stay
Well have to wait and see
If its half of what they say

We heard he opened up a brand new door
Well you know that's what I'm lookin' for
Well have to wait and see if it makes you shout for more

How do you like him so far?
How do you like his show?
How do you like the way he rocks and the way he rolls?

How do you like his image?
How do you like his style?
How do you like the way he looks and the way he smiles?

The Kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But where will he be tomorrow?

The kid, is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But where will he be tomorrow

And we just heard of a brand new fad
And they say its gonna drive you mad
Well have to wait and see if its the best you ever had
And we just heard of a brand new wave
He heard its headin' for an early grave
Well have to wait and see if there's anything we can save

How do you like him so far?
How do you like his show?
How do you like the way he rocks and the way he rolls?

How do you like his image?
How do you like his style?
How do you like the way he looks and the way he smiles?

The kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But tell me where will he be tomorrow
The kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But where will he be tomorrow

The kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But where will he be tomorrow?
The kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But where will he be, but where will he be
The kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But where will he be tomorrow?
The kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
