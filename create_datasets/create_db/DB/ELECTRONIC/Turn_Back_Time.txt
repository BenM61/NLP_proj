Give me time to reason, 
Give me time to think it through 
Passing through the season, 
Where I cheated you 

I will always have a cross to wear, 
But the bolt reminds me I was there 
So give me strength, 
To face this test tonight 

If only I could turn back time, 
If only I had said what I still hide 
If only I could turn back time, 
I would stay for the night, for the night 

Claim your right to science, 
Claim your right to see the truth 
Though my pangs of conscience, 
Will drill a hole in you 

I've seen it coming like a thief in the night, 
I've seen it coming from the flesh of your light 
So give me strength, 
To face this test tonight 

If only I could turn back time, 
If only I had said what I still hide 
If only I could turn back time, 
I would stay. 

The bolt reminds me I was there 
The bolt reminds me I was there
