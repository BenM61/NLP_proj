Christmas is the time we have picked to give
Each other gifts, oh yeah, yeah
Most people never seem to think about the things
We really need oh, ho, oh who?

So I'm offering this wrapped present
Wrapped up in a package that you can get from someone
This package that they'll bring to you is my gift to you

We must not predict without giving up yourself you know
It's just not a gift, oh no
So how can you expect a gift from someone else unless you give
That's just the sign of a selfish man

So I'm offering my heart and soul
And every single part I have to give of myself
My love is what I bring to you is my gift to you
Oh, yeah, my gift, my gift, my gift to you

So I'm offering this wrapped present
Wrapped up in a package that you can get from someone, oh yeah
This package that they'll bring to you is my gift to you

Said, "It's my gift, yeah"
Gonna say it again, "My gift to you, yeah"
Do you hear what I'm talking about, baby?
My gift, my gift, my gift to you

Oh yeah, yeah, my gift to you
Said, "It's my gift"
Said, "It's my gift, my gift to you"
