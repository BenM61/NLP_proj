Get away, let's leave today, let's get away! 

So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure
People around you are giving you pressure
Try to resist, all the bad things all around you
If you taste them, they will haunt you
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!

What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away

Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seemed boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can. I know we can, I know we can, I know we can ah

Get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
Let's leave today, let's get away
Let's get away!
Let's leave today, let's get away

Get away, leave today
Get away, yeah yeah yeah
Get away, leave today
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
