I heard a lonely shepherd play
It was a haunting melody
I heard the music clearly saying
That he was happy as could be
He played and he played
The world was forgotten
Like castles in air
My every care began to fade
If he would only play forever
This little shepherd serenade

He played and he played
The world was forgotten
Like castles in air
My every care began to fade
If he would only play forever
This little shepherd serenade
This little shepherd serenade
