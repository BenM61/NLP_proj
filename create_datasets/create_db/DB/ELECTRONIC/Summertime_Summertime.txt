Take me 
Take me to the water 
Summertime, Summertime 
Maybe, we can fall in love 
In Summertime, Summertime 

I listen to the rain outside 
Please come and take me for a ride 
I really want you 
To come and take me far away 
I want to say 

Take me 
Take me to the water 
Summertime, Summertime 
Maybe, we can fall in love 
In Summertime, Summertime 
 
I'm here lying on the sand 
You look down to me and take my hand 
I can't believe it's true 
But you got me after thee 
Until you say 

Take me 
Take me to the water 
Summertime, Summertime 
Maybe, we can fall in love 
In Summertime, Summertime 

Take me 
Take me to the water 
Summertime, Summertime 
Maybe, we can fall in love 
In Summertime, Summertime 

Take me 
Take me to the water 
Summertime, Summertime 
Maybe, we can fall in love 
In Summertime, Summertime
