Stayin' up all night
This could be a party
I've got some friends outside
Lookin' for a good time
You better head my way
This is where it's starting
No rules, no laws, no gifts tonight
You've gotta stay

Hey girl, hold me tight
Ooo, the night ain't over
Hey girl, hit that light
Ooh, the night ain't over

I'm stayin' up all night
This could a showdown
I've got this thing inside
Tellin' me, don't run and hide
And there's so many roads
Only you can go down
Don't close your eyes
There just might be another way

Hey girl, hold me tight
Ooh, the night ain't over
Hey girl, hit that light
Ooh, the night ain't over

Ooh, I might be losin' my soul
Life's only fun when it's dangerous
And I don't wanna be told
I won't play safe and start growin' old
It's five in the mornin'
I can feel the beads of sweat
Runnin' down the back of my neck
It's so good to be with you again, woh
Someday, wait and see
This will be just a memory
And I'll look back with no regrets
Good times like this, I can't forget

Hey girl, hold me tight
Ooo the night ain't over
Hey girl, hit that light
Ooo, the night ain't over

Hey girl, hold me tight
Ooo the night ain't over
Hey girl, hit that light
Ooh, the night ain't over

Hey girl, ooo the night ain't over
Hey girl, ooo the night ain't over
Hey girl, ooo the night ain't over
