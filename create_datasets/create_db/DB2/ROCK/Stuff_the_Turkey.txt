Stuff the turkey
That's bootiful!
Boo-boo-bootiful!

Have you ever wondered
Why Santa's cheeks are ruby red?
He's not jolly
He's off his head.
Pull a cracker
Pull up a chair
Have some of this
It will remove your hair.

Stuff the turkey
It's no time to fast
Enjoy this Christmas
It might be your last.

Let's make this Christmas
One to remember
Let's stay drunk
From January till December.
I'll stuff your stockings
With passion fruit
Loosen your tie
Get outta that suit.

Stuff the turkey
It's no time to fast
Enjoy this Christmas
It might be your last.

(heavy bit)
It only comes
But once a year
Stop drinking coffee
And have a beer.
Pull a cracker
Pull up a chair
No time to be sober
Just one long bender!

Stuff the turkey
Stuff the turkey
It's no time to fast
Enjoy this Christmas
It might be your last.

Stuff the turkey
Stuff the turkey
Stuff the turkey
Stuff the turkey
Stuff the turkey
Stuff the turkey
