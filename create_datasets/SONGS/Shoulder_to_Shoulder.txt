'Cause I feel safe when you're near me
And I can hold you completely
Although you constantly hurt me

And we fight
And we cry
And we tell the same lies about love
And we cling to each other shoulder to shoulder against the world

So I'm gonna drag you down
Whilst you drag me down
And I'm gonna shout at you
Whilst you shout at me until we realize that real love is free, free

And I get a kick when you worry
That you are just no good for me
And I feel weak watching you plead

And we fight
And we cry
And we tell the same lies about love
And we cling to each other shoulder to shoulder against this world

So I'm gonna drag you down
Whilst you drag me down
And I'm gonna shout at you
Whilst you shout at me until we realize that real love is free, free

Don't be my downfall
Don't be my downfall
Don't be my downfall
Don't be my downfall

Let's leave it alone
We can work it out
Find our way
Forget the past
'Cause I love you and you love me
So let's crawl free

So I'm not gonna pull you down
While you pull me down
And I'm not gonna shout at you
Whilst you shout at me because I've realized that real love is free
Free
