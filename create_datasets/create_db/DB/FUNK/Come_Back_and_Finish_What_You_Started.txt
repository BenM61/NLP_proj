come back and finish what you started
and don't leave me hanging on 
come bavk and finish what you started
and leave me hanging on

you planted seeds of love in my heart
with all the tender words you said at the start
but love is something you shouldn't begin 
if you're not gonna see it through to the end

a taste of honey is a dangerous thing
after it's gone, the momeories kling
just like the promise i heard you repeat
that you left undone and incomplete

baby come back
don't leave me
baby come back, come back
don't you know i love you
baby come back
uhm

a taste of honey is a dangerous thing
after it's gone, the memories cling
just like the promist i heard you repeat
that you left undone and incomplete

dont you know i need you to stop me
come right back and let your love at me
