Woo, here we go

The answer is no, in spite I can't let it go
The answers don't ever make no sense
When the questions are up to you
If you want you can fly, you can float
You can walk, you can do what you want
But if the smallest seed of feeling is left in you
You will see you were wrong

With your crimes you convicted me
As you swore so convincingly
You played the game of Gods
You played the game of Gods
Oh in this game, the game
You blow off

I lay myself on the floor
Give it up, threw my hands through the door
How could I give you what you can't accept?
How can I make you more present?
All I can do is come through and be more than you are
Whip out the phone but I'm sure you'll ignore your response

As you lied so convincingly
And you swore so religiously
You played the game of Gods
You played the games of Gods
You played the game of Gods
Oh in this game, the game
You blow off

I wanna get close
Wanna rock, wanna lie, wanna roll
Baby I'll give you all your happiness
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it
How can I do unto you when you use everyone?
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it
Without the truth there's no room, there's no room anymore
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it

As you fight so judiciously
And you swore so convincingly
You played the game of Gods
Gods
Gods
