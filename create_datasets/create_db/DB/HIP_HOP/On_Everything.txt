Pick up your gun
Jump in the whip
Let's ride on this like oh oh oh
Let's ride on this like oh oh oh
Let's ride on this like oh oh oh
Let's ride on this like oh oh oh

(Chorus)
I put that on everything
I will be reppin' the south to the day that I die
I put that on everything
From the midwest I'm ready to ride because I'm from the Chi
I'm from the M I'm from the Double the S, y'all know the rest
Talk about that and I'll dig in yo chest
Ready to die for these streets so hit you with with this heat
You don't want to see T and DB and I put that on everything
You don't want to see T and DB and I put that on everything
