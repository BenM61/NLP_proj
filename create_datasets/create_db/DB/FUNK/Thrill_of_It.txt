Hey, let me grab my guitar and get in the car
Got to pick up my cousins, pick up my cousin on the bass
Got my cousin on the drums, got to pick up Cris
Come on, let's ride, we ride

Some people are looking for the fountain of peace
And others are looking for some kind of truth
Some people like to sit in darkness
And others like to light up the brightest room

We got to get out to believe
Tomorrow will never guarantee

It might hurt just a little bit
One more try and they'll figure it out
I'm on this ride for the thrill of it
Living the dream, that's what life's all about

I'm working it out

Some people say I live of the turnpipes
And others say 'cause what you're feeling like
Some people like to pose like their hardcore
And others stand around like they're really bored

We got to get out just to see
Tomorrow is all we'll ever need

It might hurt just a little bit
One more try and they'll figure it out
I'm on this ride for the thrill of it
Living the dream, that's what life's all about

Oh, it feels so deep
Come on, come on somebody help me out

It might hurt just a little bit
One more try and they'll figure it out
I'm on this ride for the thrill of it
Living the dream, that's what life's all about

It might hurt just a little bit
One more try and they'll figure it out
I'm on this ride for the thrill of it
Living the dream, that's what life's all about

I'm working it out
I'm working it out
I'm working it out
