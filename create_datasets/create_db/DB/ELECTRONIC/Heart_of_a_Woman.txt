[Verse 1]
Look all around
You see the same thing
In every book, every magazine
All of them saying we're worlds apart
Well, maybe we're different but we share the same heart

[Hook 1]
Ask any woman and she'll tell you what's true
What we need ain't nothing new

[Chorus]
The heart of a woman
Is just like a man's
She wants someone who needs her
Someone who understands
The heart of a woman needs like his
Somebody who loves her just like she is
It's as simple as this

[Verse 1]
Look all around
It's all the same
So many people so tired of the game
So disappointed with love that's gone wrong
If only we realized the truth all along

[Hook 2]
Ask anybody and they'll tell you what's true
What they need is the same thing as you

[Chorus]

[Hook 3]
It's been the same thing through all of history
But the heart of a woman is no mystery

[Chorus]
