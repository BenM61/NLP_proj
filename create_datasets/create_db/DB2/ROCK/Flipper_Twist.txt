And I say 
Oh oh oh you never know which way to go 

And I say 
Oh oh oh the Flipper twist is in my soul 

Now all the time we spent runnin around 
City to city, any club, any town 
We got a taste of the audience zeal 
What makes them hop and bop and feel 
They want to dance and have a good time 
We gotta keep the tempo upbeat all the time 
But we are trying to do something new 
Playing discord in theory and that chord too 
Abundant vibrations so pure and true 
Move about betraying me and you 

The nations taste changes from day to day 
First its humor becoming ultra violence decay 
Its just a game of the rat eats the dog 
Lead the pack or be forever lost 
So many kings to rule just one hill 
To me its crap, I say just be real 
I have to stand out from the rest 
Vocational noise puts myself to the test 

The music squeaks, squawks and drones on 
A magic feeling where nothing can go wrong 
I lift my head proud, the feeling is bliss 
My body starts a motion and I start to twist 
Scream and shout but never resist 
even though there's no control 
Until falling down makes its cycle whole 

And I say 
Oh oh oh the Flipper twist is in my soul 

And I say 
Oh oh oh you never know which way to go
