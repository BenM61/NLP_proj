Oh baby
I got up the nerve to try again
Some broken hearts, give time will mend
Will you be gentle if I surrender all to you, to you

Please understand that I got to be sure
The lessons I've learned I can't ignore
Will you be gentle if I surrender all to you, to you

Take good care of me
'Cause my heart's a tender thing, oh yeah
Take good care of me
'Cause this heart has known much pain

And could never have the loving again
So take good care of me, of me

Don't get me wrong 'cause I really care
A shadow of doubt has always been there
Please reassure me
Hold me against my fears away, my fears away
Something tells me it's right this time
It took a little while but I made up my mind
Please reassure me
That we'll be together come what may, come what may

Take good care of me
'Cause my heart's a tender thing, oh yeah
Take good care of me
'Cause this heart has known much pain

I know forever's never been promised to anyone
So don't forget me forever
I'll take what I can get
'Cause baby you're the best thing
That ever happened to me yet, oh oh oh

Woah baby
So if it can't be forever
I'll take what I can get
'Cause baby you're the best thing
That ever happened to me yet, oh oh oh
