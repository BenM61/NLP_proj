Heard a shot rang through the woods
Couldn't tell from what direction
Spun around and tried to see
If there were two if there were three

The mist came down the ground was wet
I talked with you inside my head
The way i have forgotten back
Quickly prepare it's an attack

Listen for the sound
Feel a shaking underground
To have the weapons and the time
The will to push off from the side

I use my eyes, and use my head
I use all of the things you said
A person needs to know before
A hunting, hunting we will go

Oh, my beloved alleyway
To go it takes a lot of patience
Figure out the constellations
Work on the coordination

Listen for the sound
Feel a shaking underground
To have the weapons and the time
The will to push off from the side

Listen for the sound
Listen for the sound
