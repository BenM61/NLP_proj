All the signs are there, I did not exist
Underneath the stars and comets
Far beneath the sun, eyes can see
And I think they want to believe

And I, I was breathing all the oxygen that's left
I surrender, put my hands up in the air
I waited for you there

But you left an everlasting breath
I saw the cold air
It wrapped me up at last
With all the love in your hands, ah

I believe in love because of you
Everything is put aside now
Watch me in a daze, seconds new
But I fall apart without you

I, I was breathing all the oxygen that's left
I surrender, put my hands up in the air
I waited for you there

But you left an everlasting breath
I saw the cold air
It wrapped me up at last
With all the love in your hands, ah
