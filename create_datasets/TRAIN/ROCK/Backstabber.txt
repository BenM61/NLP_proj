The record goes from blue to gold, so thank you for all your help
I know you want to jump around but try to contain yourself
You always struck me as the type to take it lightly
But now you're gonna have to shut your mouth when you fight me

Ohh, backstabber, backstabber

you're all alone, you're all over the popular magazines
Will never care, what do you care? you're down with the Japanese
But she got no right to sit there saying, "I abuse it"
When you only sleep with girls who say they like your music

Ohh, backstabber, backstabber, backstabber, backstabber
Backstabber, backstabber, backstabber, backstabber
Backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver, God, I feel for you, fool
You shit lover, off brusher, jaded bitter, joy crusher
Failure has made you so cruel, you

Rotten to the core, rotten to the core
Rotten like a crack whore, backing out the backdoor
Show us what you're good for then stick to the noise board
Come on join the bloodsport, show us some support
Still working in the drugstore, is it because you're a fucking?

Backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver, God, I feel for you, fool
You shit lover, off brusher, jaded bitter, joy crusher
Failure has made you so cruel

So, don't tell me what to write and don't tell me that I'm wrong
And don't tell me not to reference my songs within my songs, oh oh

You, backstabber, you backstabber
Backstabber, hope grabber, greedy fucking fit haver, backstabber, oh, oh
