Yes, it's the return of the young hustle
A nigga came for the money, not the tongue tussle
Me - I'd rather do my lip lashin' when the chips cash in
Then you might see me on the strip flashin'
Like Vegas lights, and they say I shine Vegas bright
Draw a crowd like a Vegas fight
So shit, gettin' hit, and my leg is light
I mean it could a been a 2Pac Vegas night
Or maybe a Notorious L.A. evening
"Baby, you okay?" I mean, well, I'm breathin'
Hell, I'm even bossin' and I laugh
The money ain't right, then I toss you to the left
Yes, to the left, to the left
Everything is hustle to the death for the F
A-B, baby, they be lazy
Gucci straight jacket 'cause I may be crazy
Loony for the loot, psycho for the paper
This a new year, but I recycle for the paper
If green talks, then I'm the Geico with the paper
So have my check right, no typos with the paper, please

They say the rap game remind 'em of the crack game
That's why they money go quicker than a crack high
My money stacked high; how high? Shaq high
Yao high; that's why yours is Bow Wow high
You lookin' at your new hustle like your last hustle
Was looked at as Russell in my past hustle
Shorty work it; she be on her ass hustle
She make it clap; she know how to work them ass muscles
Fast rush you, then back to the money
They say I'm frontin', can't turn my back to the money
And, truthfully, you're cool, but I'm attracted to money
So why don't cha turn your back to the money, and let it shake?
I'm lovin' how you move that smooth; you let it snake
But players don't chase at it, baby, we let it make
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate
I'm nine-fifteen, that means I'm hella straight
Swizz stacks, Just Blaze bucks
I'm back for my money; it's just they luck
