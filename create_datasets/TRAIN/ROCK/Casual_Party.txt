Talking television at the casual party
Here's some brand new friends to get you started off
So start it off

Since Ben got that he's a sociopath
He's only playing games don't be distracted, oh
It's all or nothing, all or nothing
So you really got something to lose

It's coming around as it did before
It's gettin' your attention but where's the door? Woah
I can't locate it, where's it located?
I got plenty to live for

Blind faith, it don't sit right
You got rage wound so tight
I wanna leave
Best get out of the way
Blind faith don't sit right
You're full of rage wound so tight
I'm gonna leave
Best get out of the way

Awful conversation at the casual party
The job, the babble on, the recreational hobbies, oh
No it never stops

Kids and the dog, a freshly-mowed lawn
Retirement plans for a mountain home, oh
Been arrested, lived in Texas
My God I'm gonna leave it with you

Blind faith don't sit right
You got rage wound so tight
I better leave
Best get out of the way
Blind faith don't sit right
You're full of rage wound so tight
I'm gonna leave
Best get out of the way

Talking conversation at the casual party
Awful television don't get you started, oh
No it never stops
Children and dogs and manicured lawns
All your future plans, vacation homes
I wanna go
Home

It's so stupid
Everything's about you man
Hey!
Hey what's up? (that's Steve)
