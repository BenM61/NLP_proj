Blue collar Jane lives in fifty four
Always got a teacup when she knocks upon my door
She just wants some milk and sugar, but all I want is her
Blue collar Jane, my girl, you're causing quite a stir

All we could be, b-l-u-e
C-o-l-l-a-r, oh, J-a-n-e, oh baby, please
If you could see, then you'd agree
That I love blue collar Jane and she loves me

Blue collar Jane, always in your town
Never wears her hair up 'cause she's always dressing down
You got a four wheel drive, you know that's how she gets around
Blue collar Jane, my girl, you knock me to the ground

All we could be, b-l-u-e
C-o-l-l-a-r, oh, J-a-n-e, oh baby, please
If you could see, then you'd agree
That I love blue collar Jane and she loves me

Watch out!
