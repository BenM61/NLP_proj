Blackout music

Bend, Eastside, could you stretch then bend?
Westside, could you stretch then bend?
Southside, could you stretch then bend?
Midwest, could you stretch then bend?

N why see, could you stretch then bend?
M I A, could you stretch then bend?
A T L, won't you stretch then bend?
St. Louis, won't you stretch then bend?

I guess you hear that I'm a live wire, say what?
Lose nigga and a five rider
Run with the city's biggest drug dealers, Dipset
For you sissy, rap f*ck, niggaz, f*ck 'em
Yeah, we pistol packin', bust niggaz, Bang, bang

Never worry 'bout the spotlight
This star nigga, keep the glock tight, that's right
That's for the jackers at the spotlight, watch 'em
To live and die in the streets of New York
We gettin' by, pumpin' diesel and snort

I'm gettin' high in the seats of my Porsche
Federales, love to see me in court
And tell the Lord, I hope you keep me in thought, pray for me)
But I'm a G, who gives a f*ck what you think
And f*ck the D's, roll my weed and fill my cup full of drink

You got some beef then we gotta do it
You got some ki's, show you how to move it
And four birds'll get a extra pigeon, what else
And that's a bird with an extra clip in
We on the curb where my niggaz dealin'
That's how my niggaz livin'

Bend, Eastside, could you stretch then bend?
Westside, could you stretch then bend?
Southside, could you stretch then bend?
Midwest, could you stretch then bend?

N why see, could you stretch then bend?
M I A, could you stretch then bend?
A T L, won't you stretch then bend?
St. Louis, won't you stretch then bend?

So now we ballin' in the major leagues
Yellow bottles and some hazy weed, Cristal
Got some models with that Maybeline, so pretty
Fancy rides, pushin' major speeds, Westside
Westside, when we race the beams, Eastside

Break laws 'til the day I leave, no doubt
Hardcore and a brazy G, Eastside
Yo, pull the bar when we makin' cheese, Harlem
"Harlem World", so "Double Up"

And all my girls still love a thug
A heartthrob and a wild rebel
I park cars through the foul ghetto, so what?
A rolling stone but I hold my own, then what?
These golden stones, have you niggaz on press

I hold the chrome so you niggaz don't step, watch it
You better party, do your bend and your stretch
And it's a promise, I ain't sendin' no threats, I promise you
Shit, Dipset, the new mob, niggaz
No need to ask 'cause you know we on our job, nigga

Bend, Eastside, could you stretch then bend?
Westside, could you stretch then bend?
Southside, could you stretch then bend?
Midwest, could you stretch then bend?

N why see, could you stretch then bend?
M I A, could you stretch then bend?
A T L, won't you stretch then bend?
St. Louis, won't you stretch then bend?

To all my bitches wearin' thick incense, hey, girl
You know it tickles when you kiss my neck, stop that
Them icicles on my wrist and neck, blingin'
Your wife wit you, well, don't disrespect, sup, nigga
Could be an issue, keep yo' bitch in check, f*ck that bitch

My thug aura make a bitch lose
It ain't a party 'til the Dips do it, bird game
Smokin' reefer, screamin', ?Eastside?, Purple
Loaded heaters, that's how we ride, we ride

All the time was my reply, I'm from the G side, G side
Checkin' for hotties, that's sexy in (Incomprehensible)
Seven jeans and Giuseppes and Noti's, we ask at the party
You tryin' to slide let me know some
Hop in the ride we can blow some, that purple

Baby, no lie I give you no stuntin', no frontin'
Duckin' pictures from the paparazzi, watch the cameras
Tuck your fifth up in my Maseratti, we loaded
Shit, I park the whip in front of the project lobby
I keep it gully and the car all foggy, muth'fuckers, just

Bend, Eastside, could you stretch then bend?
Westside, could you stretch then bend?
Southside, could you stretch then bend?
Midwest, could you stretch then bend?

N why see, could you stretch then bend?
M I A, could you stretch then bend?
A T L, won't you stretch then bend?
St. Louis, won't you stretch then bend?
