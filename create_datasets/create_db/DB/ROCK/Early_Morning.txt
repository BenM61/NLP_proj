Early morning,
It's cold and the sun is white
For I was born in
The darkness before the light

Of a new day
A new way of living
Of giving delight
And if you pay
Then you may be slipping
Back into the night

Then all knowing
With words and with pen I write
Of the growing
Of things that are in my sight

Early evening
It's cold and the moon is bright
And I believe in
The darkness before the light
Of a new day
