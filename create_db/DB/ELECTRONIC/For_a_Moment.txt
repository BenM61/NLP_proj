Lately I've been thinking about the ups & downs
We've been through together and how we almost lost our ground
We held on long enough to see all the good out weigh the bad
And I'm thankful, so grateful for everything we have
But for a moment I thought I lost everything
For a moment I forgot about our memories
Then I woke up and I realized how much you mean to me
For a moment I thought I lost you and me

My first love, my first kiss I shared both of them with you
From the first time we locked eyes I knew you and I would be the truth
But since then you've lied to me and I've lied to you
But we made up and I'm thankful so grateful
For everything we have
So beautiful that's what we are
I'm your sky and your my star
All the trials that we've been through
Only made us who we are today

But for a moment I thought I lost everything
For a moment I thought forgot about our memories
Then I woke up and I realized how much you mean to me
For a moment I thought I lost you and me

Your connected to everything and everybody that matters to me
Your the center all my charm without I wouldn't be
I thought I lost my best friend
My perfect world came to an end
But it was just a dream that felt like reality

But for a moment I thought I lost everything
I thought I lost my baby
I forgot about our memories
Then I opened my eyes
Then I woke up and I realized how much you mean to me
For a moment I thought I lost you and me
I thought I lost you and me
