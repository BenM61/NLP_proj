Yo, I'm tired of chumps tryin' to waste my time
I ain't got no time to play
Gotta make moves

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay
(I gotta make moves)

Never no time to play
(No time to play)
Gotta keep workin' every day
Never no time to play
(I gotta make moves)
Gotta make moves

Nope, I can't stop
Nope, I can't stop to talk
I gotta go, I gotta go, yo
Basically I'm a brother they depend on, lean on
So now I gotta be gone, I gotta keep strong

Always stayin' busy, kid 'cause I can never fall off
Laziness ain't gettin' to me
There's too much opportunity
And I'm not waitin' for no one
'Cause slow ones, they don't get nuttin' done, son

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
(No time to play)
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay
(I gotta make moves)

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
(No time to play)
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves
(I gotta make moves)

Your time is runnin' short, sport
Make a move or get caught
Nothing lasts forever, nothing lasts forever, baby
Maybe, you shouldn't act so crazy
Instead of tryin' to be the man
You could really be the man

If you had a plan, understand?
But I'm not the one to be waitin' for ya
Back in the day, I used to do stuff for ya
Now I'm warnin' ya
That you really ain't no pimp, you wimp

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
(No time to play)
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay
(I gotta make moves)

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
Never no time to play
(I gotta make moves)
Gotta make moves

I gotta make moves, each and every day
I need the cash, I need the cash money
With my rhyme display, I may take all the paper wild
I guess I have the know-how

When you see me in the house you better go
"What's up G? What's up Gang?"
Then give me a pound because I've been down
Dedicated and I've waited for my turn
'Cause respect is somethin' you earn

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
Never no time to play
(Uh, I gotta make moves)
Gotta make moves with no delay

Never no time to play
(No time to play)
Gotta keep workin' every day
Never no time to play
(I gotta make moves)
Gotta make moves

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin' every day
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves

Never no time to play
Gotta make moves
Never no time to play
No time to play, ahh
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves

Ain't got no time
I ain't got no time
Ain't got no time
I ain't got no time

(No time to play)
I ain't got no time
(No time to play)
No time to play
(No time to play)
Ain't got no time
(No time to play)
(No, no time to play)

(No time to play)
I ain't got no time
(No time to play)
I ain't got no time
(No time to play)
No time to play
(No time to play)

Ain't got no time
I ain't got no time
I ain't got no time
Never have the time

Never no time to play
No time to play
No time to play
No time to play

No time to play
My man Ronny Jordan gets busy on guitar
DC Lee and Big Shug in the house
Big shouts to the crew
"Whassup?" To the Cutthroats, slicker than most
I ain't got no time, yo, so I'm gone, I'm gone
