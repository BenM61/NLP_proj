I found me a girl (candy girl)
She sets my heart a-whirl (candy girl)
With huggin' (huggin') and kissin' (kissin') and lov-in'
(She's mine) mi-ine (mine) mine
Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oh (candy girl)

We get along so well (candy girl)
I know just why I fell (candy girl)
She's thrillin' (thrillin') oh, chillin' (chillin'),
Yeah she's so divine
(She's mine) mine (mine) mine
Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oh (candy girl)

When we're out together
Everyone knows the way we feel
We both seem to glow with the glow of a love
And it's plain to see
Our love is real

I'm happy as can be (candy girl)
She vows eternally (candy girl)
To hold me (hold me) and love me (love me)
Until the end of time
(She's mine) mine (mine) mine
Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oh
