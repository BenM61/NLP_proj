I wont need to think of nice things to say,
I dont want to want this way anymore,
Shh now and hear comes silence,
from this comes strength I promise,
This is it soon i won't care
No need for pain, nothing physical, no violence,
Just intense thought some space some silence,
just something pure and precious worth having, soon i won't care
take this ridiculous mood all away,
then give me something new i could say,
no more time to look like this,
I'll never ask again I promise.
