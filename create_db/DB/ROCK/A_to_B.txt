A to B
A to B	
Oh, to move your

It is a shame
It is a pity
When you can't raise the energy to get from A to B	 

A to B	 
A to B (I ask a question; you wouldn't comment)
A to B (forget the question, think nothing of it)
A to B, oh, to move your body

I ask a question; you make a comment
Impossible to make a comment
I ask a question; you make a comment
Can you say that again 'cause I didn't catch your comment?

And you say you're gonna reform
And you see you gotta move
Well, it's no excuse, it's no excuse
Because there's no excuse to use
Why do you say you're gonna reform
And you see you gotta move?
Well, it's no excuse, it's no excuse
Because there's no excuse for you to us

A to B (I ask a question; you wouldn't comment)
A to B (forget the question, think nothing of it; forget all my questions)
A to B (I ask a question; you wouldn't comment; forget all my questions)
A to B, oh, to move your body

It is a shame; it's a real pity
When you have to be lazy, when you have to start early
When you can't raise the energy to get from A to B
