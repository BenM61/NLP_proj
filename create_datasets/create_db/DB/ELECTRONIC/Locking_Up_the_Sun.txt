They're locking up the sun, the light of reason gone,
N' hope has been successfully undone
The question's burning on, where is it coming from,
No-one seems to know the monster born

It's a bad trip on a sinking ship, when no-one seems responsible
Scapegoat to rock the boat, yeah, we need someone expendable
Volunteers to face the fears, can we be sensible
And find a way to break the fall, find out the cure for all

Is there a hero somewhere, someone who appears and saves the day
Someone who holds out a hand and turns back time
Is there a hero somewhere, someone who will never walk away
Who doesn't turn a blind eye to a crime

They're locking up the sun, they have their chosen one,
You know this time they'll make him play along
They're taking to the arms, the fathers and their sons,
There's nowhere left to run and hide

It's a bad trip on a sinking ship, when no-one seems responsible
Scapegoat to rock the boat, yeah, we need someone expendable
Volunteers to face the fears, can we be sensible
And find a way to break the fall, find out the cure for all

Is there a hero somewhere, someone who appears and saves the day
Someone who holds out a hand and turns back time
Is there a hero somewhere, someone who will never walk away
Who doesn't turn a blind eye to a crime

And in the emptiness, there's a solution,
Just look within yourself for absolution
