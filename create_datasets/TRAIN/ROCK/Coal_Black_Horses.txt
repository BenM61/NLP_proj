Just as sure as that suns gonna shine
When he comes at his table I will dine

Just as sure as that dog's gonna whine
In my heart no longer will I pine

Just as sure as by evil you are torn
The sky will open up an an angel blow his horn
An down come Jesus lookin' so fine
Just as sure as that girl she is mine...
An I say

Hey hey hey it's always forever
Hey hey hey it's never or now

I dug a hole an hollowed it out
Yes an I fell in
Oh Lord I'm caught in the cord...
The cord of my own sin

Shoot 'em up cowboy - yeah I got away,
But I been dragin' this chain the whole way...
An I say

Hey hey hey it's always forever
Hey hey hey it's never or now

Oh yea boys I know an I am certain
In your heart of heart ye all are hurtin'
Oh no no no not that name not to me
It's much too hard to get down on my knees
But just as sure as by evil you are torn
The sky will open up an an angel blow his horn
An down come Jesus lookin' so fine
Just as sure as that girl she is mine...
I say...
