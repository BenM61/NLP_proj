Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone no

You can't hide from the flipside
Your foolish pride
Can't sustain the strain
Trouble bubbles inside
You can try but you cannot resist
If we insist
Persistent, every instant, 
Every moment in time
We are on your mind

Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone no

We have ways to make you understand
We demand you let us in
Under your skin
You tuned in to the frequency
We can't let you be
We live happily
Beneath
On the underneath
On the inside
The flipside

Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone no

In your search for contentment
Tormented, unrelenting
Turbulent intent
And all the money spent
You will listen precisely to each word
As it reoccurs
We insinuate, irritate, we can't dissipate
Deflate your ego
Give up self control

Can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone no
We can't leave you alone
Can't leave you alone no

When will it end?
Delerium is back again
We will suspend
Numbskulls are back around again
Trouble bubbles inside
You cannot hide from the flipside
We are in your mind
Every instant, every moment in time

We're alive and we will survive
As a part of you
Listen if we want you to
Can't you see?
Just a part of you are we
Surround sound you can't turn it down
A little frequency dependency
You are we, all on your own
We can't leave you alone no

We can't leave you alone
We can't leave you alone no
We can't leave you alone
We just can't leave you alone
(Give up self control)
