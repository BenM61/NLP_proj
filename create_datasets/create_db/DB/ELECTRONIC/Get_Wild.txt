It's time for you to get wild
To live it up
To be free
It's time for you to feel alive
To ignore them
Be carefree
It's time for you to get wild
To live it up
To be free
It's time for you to feel alive
To ignore them
Be carefree

Make your life like a one big party
Live hard, life is temporary
Watcha' doin' right now?
Why you sittin' down?
Get up and mess around now
I don't really care about a lover
All they wanna do is wait forever
That's not how I live my life
I wanna be in love but I'd rather get wild

I wanna see you get wild
Now get wilder

You don't have to be so so fancy
All you need to be is so so crazy
Bring your friends downtown
And just live right now
We're gonna be forever y-oung
I don't really care about a lover
All they wanna do is wait forever
That's not how I live my life
I wanna be in love but I'd rather get wild

I wanna see you get wild
Get wild right now
This is your time
This is your moment
It's about you not them
It shouldn't matter
How you wanna live your life
As long as you're happy

Get wild right now
This is your time
This is your moment
It's about you not them
It shouldn't matter
How you wanna live your life
As long as you're happy
And free, yeah
It's time for you to get wild
To live it up
To be free
It's time for you to feel alive
To ignore them
Be carefree
It's time for you to get wild
To live it up
To be free
It's time for you to feel alive
To ignore them
Be carefree
