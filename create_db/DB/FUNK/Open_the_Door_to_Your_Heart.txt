Walk right on in
Stretch out your arms
Let the lovelight shine
On my soul, baby, and
Let love come running in

You know that I needed you
I've needed you a long, long time
My pride is too much for me, baby

And I'm about to lose my mind

(CHORUS)
Walk right on in
Let your love come running in
Open the door to your heart, baby
Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your heart
And let love come running in
Let your love come running in

Let it flow like the river
Let it shine like the light
Take all my mind and soul, baby
Why don't you give it sight

I'm trying to
Keep from loving you
And I've been loving you
A little too long

Darling, darling
You've been so sweet to me
That's what keeps my
Love so strong

(CHORUS)

I need you to stand by me
Let your love come running in
Let it flow like the river..
