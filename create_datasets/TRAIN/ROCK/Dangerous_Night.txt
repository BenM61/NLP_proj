We burn and we played, we try to forget
But the memories left are still haunting
The walls that we built from bottles and pills
We swallow until we're not talking

I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire

What a dangerous night to fall in love
Don't know why we still hide what we've become (oh, oh)

Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in love

Started a stranger, a love endangered
The edge of a night
The face of an angel, the heart of a ghost
Was it a dream?

I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire

What a dangerous night to fall in love
Don't know why we still hide what we've become (oh, oh)

Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in love (oh, oh)

Oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

I, I am a man on fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
You, a violent desire

A dangerous night to fall in love
A dangerous night to fall in love

Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in love (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in love (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in love (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
