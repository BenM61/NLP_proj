Excuse me, I know we just met
But may I have this dance?

Sitting here with a drink in my hand
Your presence I can't ignore
I must admit I like watching you dance
But it seems like I've seen this before
Girl, you look like my first wife
Though I've never been married before
So I kiss your hand and tell you "Thank you"
You turn and ask me what for

For our first kiss, oh, next week
For when we make love, in six weeks
For the ring you wore probably three months from now
For when you said "I do" next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance

(Shawn, help me sing it)

Hi, my name is Shawn
Tell me your name
Although I know the last one
It's funny that we're shaking hands
(Wait a minute, I know this hand)
It's the same hand (I'll hold in front of a minister)
Same hand (when you're havin' my son and his sister)
I don't mean to sound so bold and forward
But I thank you in advance

For our first kiss, oh, next week
For when we make love, in six weeks
For the ring you wore probably three months from now
For when you said "I do" next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance

It's like I came back in time to tell you thank you
You were as beautiful then as you are now
Look in the mirror, there is a picture
Of you and the man you love

For our first kiss, oh, next week
For when we make love, in six weeks
For the ring you wore probably three months from now
For when you said "I do" next March
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance

For our first kiss, oh, next week
For when we make love, in six weeks
For the ring you wore probably three months from now
For when you said "I do" next March(?)
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes, I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance

I, I, I, I, I
I thank you in advance, ooh
Oh oh oh
