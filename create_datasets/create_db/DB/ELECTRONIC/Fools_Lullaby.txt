Baby, when I lost you
My heart stood still
Oh baby, when I kissed you
Gave me such a thrill

Oh I'm far away from home
Oh baby, when I touched you
Felt a shiver on my skin
Baby, oh I love you

This love's not a sin
Oh I'm far away from home
I'm so alone
Far away from home

[Chorus]
Oh it's a fool's lullaby
Oh I never meant to make you cry
We can make a better life
Don't make my blue eyes lie

Oh it's a fool's lullaby
I gave you all
The best years of my life
Baby, take another chance
And give it one more try

Oh baby, if you call me
I'll he there
Whatever happens, baby
We just won't care

Oh I'm far away from home
Oh baby, take my heart
Let's heal the pain
Take me in your arms

Make love again
Oh I'm far away from home
I'm so alone
Far away from home

[Chorus]

Oh it's a fool's lullaby
I gave you all
The best years of my life
Baby, take another chance
And give it one more try

[Chorus]
