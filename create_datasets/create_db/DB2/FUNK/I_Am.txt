I thought the moment I was leaving
Barely breathing
I fall to pieces, couldn't face this
Why would I be leaving?
I was believing
It's you and me against the world

Not saying I was afraid of you
Won't put the blame on you
But I won't change for you
Just when you thought you dropped me
I gotta drop the news, I'm still existing
I'm still here

I am, with or without you
I am, breathing without you
I am, somebody without you
I am, I am
I am, free without you
I am, stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again, but I am, I am

First steps that I was making
On this new planet
Never done it, found all I wanted
The world was so forgiving
Open-hearted, warm and loving, amazing

I never once regretted it
And I'll break my bread
I'm revealed again
All of the mistakes that I made
Finally led the way
To a better place

I am, with or without you
I am, breathing without you
I am, somebody without you
I am, I am
I am, free without you
I am, stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

First my remedy, now my poison, oh
Won't get down to love until I'm afraid to live
Ooh yeah

I am, with or without you
I am, stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

I am me, oh
Oh, oh
