Here we are 
At the end 
Say goodbye to all your friends 
Here we go watching the sun go round 
Sitting on a rooftop making time stop 
I never want to come back down never want to come down 

Its the end of the summer 
Its the end of it all 
Those days are gone its over now were moving on 
Its the end of the summer 
But we'll see it all again 
So hold on till this moment till then 
Its the end of the summer 

Here we stand 
In the middle of an empty street 
Tell me where you want to go 
I'll tell you that's where I want to be 
Say goodbye to the warm breeze 
We could be almost anywhere 
Ill miss you till the next time 
I hope I see you there 
I hope I see you back here. 

Its the end of the summer 
Its the end of it all 
Those days are gone its over now were moving on 
Its the end of the summer 
But we'll see it all again 
So hold on till this moment till then 
Its the end of the summer end of the summer 

Rides almost over 
Its getting colder 
Take one last look 
Before it passes by before it passes you by 

[Repeat x2]
Its the end of the summer 
Its the end of it all 
Those days are gone its over now were moving on 
Its the end of the summer 
But we'll see it all again 
So hold on till this moment till then 
Its the end of the summer 

End of the summer
