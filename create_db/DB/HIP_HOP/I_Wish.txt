'Cause I know I've been wasting time tryna catch your eye, uh
Yeah I know that I been so blind thinking that I'm your type

And now I'm at home, I'm all alone
'Bout to pick up the telephone
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah

I wish I was tall, I wish I was fast
Wish I could shop with a bag full of cash
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that (Come, come kiss me boy)
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash
Wish I woke up with a butt and a rack
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that (Come, come kiss me boy)

And now I'm at home I'm all alone,
'Bout to pick up the telephone
Got to call my genie so he knows (So he knows) yeah

Wish I could shop with a bag full of cash
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that (Come, come kiss me boy)

Wish I woke up with a butt and a rack
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that (Come, come kiss me boy)

Clearly carried away but what I'm saying you construed that
