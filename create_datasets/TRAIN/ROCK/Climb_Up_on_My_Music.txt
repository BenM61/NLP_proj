Have you ever had a fever,
From a bitter-sweet refrain,
Have you ever kissed the sunshine,
Walked between the rain.

Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.

Well, there was a girl named Christmas,
Did I tell ya she drank gold,
She wasn't very hard to capture,
But she was rather hard to hold.

Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.

Have you ever been in darkness,
And your mind could find no peace,
When you woke up after midnight,
Found your swans have turned to geese.

Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.
