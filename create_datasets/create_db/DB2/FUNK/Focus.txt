Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me? Babe

Hands in the soap
Have the faucet's running and I keep looking at you
Stuck on your phone and you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clue

But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on

Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

Lazy and broke?
No, he get this money, so I guess I can't complain
But I feel alone even when we're alone
And that don't cost a thing

But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately I've been a little fed up
Wish you would just focus on

Me
Can you focus on me? Oh, yeah
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me

Baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes, ooh
