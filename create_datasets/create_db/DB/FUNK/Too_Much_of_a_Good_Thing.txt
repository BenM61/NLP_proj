(Wo wo wo wo, wo wo wo wo, wo wo wo wo) 

All my life I'm gonna love you just as much as I can 
And no one's made me ever think so much as anyone, man 

Too much of a good thing can never hurt anybody, baby 
And you've got a real good thing with me 
So move a little closer, come closer to me, & you'll see 
Too much of a good thing never, can never hurt anybody, baby 
And you've got a real good thing with me 

Oh baby, oh baby 

I was savin' all my love until the day I met you 
And I'm gonna give it all to you until I get you 

Too much of a good thing can never hurt anybody, baby 
And you've got a real good thing with me 
So move a little closer, come closer to me, & you'll see 
Too much of a good thing never, can never hurt anybody, baby 
And you've got a real good thing with me 

Too much of a good thing can never hurt anybody, baby 
And you've got a real good thing with me 
So move a little closer, come closer to me, & you'll see 
Too much of a good thing never, can never hurt anybody, baby 
And you've got a real good thing with me
