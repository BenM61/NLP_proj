Once more I'll say goodbye to you
Things happen but we don't really know why
If it's supposed to be like this
Why do most of us ignore the chance to miss?
Oh, yeah

Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feelin' this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
All these things I hate revolve around

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
Just back off before I snap

Once more you tell those lies to me
Why can't you just be straight up with honesty?
(Honesty)
When you say those things in my ear
Why do you always tell me what you wanna hear?
(Wanna hear)
Oh yeah
(Yeah)

Wear your heart on your sleeve, make things hard to believe
I'm not feelin' this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
All these things I hate revolve around

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
Just back off before I snap

And you'll see
(Yeah)
Me
(Me)
All these things I hate revolve around

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
Just back off before I snap

Torn apart of the seams of my dreams, turn to tears
I'm not feelin' this situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like me
(It's the best place to be when you're)

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
All these things I hate revolve around

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
Just back off before I snap

And you'll see
(Yeah)
Me
(Me)
All these things I hate revolve around

Me
(Me)
Yeah
(Yeah)
Just back off before I snap
