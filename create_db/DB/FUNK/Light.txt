Light, Beautiful light
Light, Savior from darkness
Light, Precious power
Light, Look to the light

Come learn the way, hear what we say
Come learn the way, hear what we say

(Chorus)
Look into the Crystals see what you can see,
If you desire.
Lost in reflectios see what you can be
Hearts filled with fire.

(Chorus)
