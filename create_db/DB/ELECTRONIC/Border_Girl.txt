When you're on top of the world
Or it's got you down
When you're flying through the air 
Or you're crashing to the ground
When you're searching for the light
And it's nowhere to be found
Just phone me baby

And I know we'll be the same 
The air won't tie you down
I won't ever be the broken wings
That keep you off the ground
But when you start to see
I will be the sound
Just let me baby

I only want to be the one you love
I only want to be the one you want
Come and get me baby
Let me loose inside your soul
I only want to be your every need
I want to be the girl in all your dreams
I'll do anything to be
The one you love

Baby you can tell me everything
The secrets of your heart
If you could look inside of me 
You'd see how beautiful you are
I want to show you everything
Each and every part of me is yours
Just take it baby

I only want to be the one you love
I only want to be the one you want
Come and get me baby
Let me loose inside your soul
I only want to be your every need
I want to be the girl in all your dreams
I'll do anything to be
The one you love

Let me be the lover
You want to uncover
Let me be the one you love

Hey baby
