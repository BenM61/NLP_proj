An angel in lace,
A fabulous face,
That's no exggeration,
That's my Marilyn.

No gal, I believe,
Beginning with Eve,
Could weave a fascination
like my Marilyn.

She made me a poet,
Thinking up romantic themes,
Though she may not know it,
she's all mine in my dreams!

I've planned everything,
The church and the ring,
The one who doesn't know it yet
Is Marilyn.

She hasn't said "Yes"
I have to confess:
I haven't kissed, or even met
My Marilyn.

But if luck is with me
She'll be my bride forevermore;
I'll be marryin', carryin' Marilyn through my door!!!
