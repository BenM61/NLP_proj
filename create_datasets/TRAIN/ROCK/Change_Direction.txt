I see it clearer now
Only shadows are left behind
Looking for redemption
For something they call a crime

Some say they can see it
Some they still are blind

Change my direction
Find a new place to hide
The light stole my reflection

Saw my path so clearly
And I knew it from the start
It's easy to live with what you're told
When you see it circling the top
