It's been a long haul
L.a. to la
We've always done it our way
That's just how we are
Rolling off that mountain
Headed out for glory
I guess you heard the story
Man, we felt so strong
I never thought we'd laugh this long.

We are all drifters
Singers and sisters
Brothers and lovers and mothers and confidantes
We were born alone
We're alone when we're gone
So while we're here
We might as well just sing along.

Keeping up the good fight
And we'll be alright
We always have each other
And that's all we need
And if you want to find us
We left a map behind us
Meeting in the circle
Swirling sky and stars
You never have to look too far.

'cause we are all drifters
Singers and sisters
Brothers and lovers and mothers and confidantes
We were born alone
We're alone when we're gone
So while we're here
We might as well just sing along.

You don't understand, no
You don't understand.

And if we're all wrong
We'll have to sing our own songs
To one another
Until we grow old
And that's the way we started
And even if we're parted
There'll always be a road sign
To lead us home
We never have to be alone.

'cause we are all drifters
Singers and sisters
Brothers and lovers and mothers and confidantes
We were born alone
We're alone when we're gone
So while we're here
We might as well just...

We are all drifters (we're all drifters)
Singers and sisters (singers and sisters)
Brothers and lovers and mothers and confidantes
We were born alone
We're alone when we're gone
So while we're here
We might as well just sing along.

And while you're here
You might as well just sing along.
