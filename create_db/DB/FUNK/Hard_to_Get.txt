Girl, you're cute, you're sweet
You're such a sexy treat
You are the girl that turns me on
And when you're hot, you're hot
I love the stuff you've got
You are the kinky girl I write about in every song

(Do do dah do do da do do dah)
(Do do bop bop, baby)
(Do do dah do)
Don't be so hard to get

(Do do dah do do da do do dah)
(Do do bop bop, baby)
(Do do dah do)
'Cause I will get you yet, ho

Don't be so hard to get, baby, baby
Don't be so hard to get, baby, baby

Girl, you're loose, you're tight
You're black and even white
You have a rainbow sex appeal
And when we dance, romance
You give me such a chance
To get the kind of love
That no man ever has to steal

(Um pa pa um pa pa)
Don't be so hard to get
(Um pa pa um pa pa)
(Um pa pa um pa pa)
'Cause I will get you yet

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
(Um pa pa um pa pa) ho

You keep on runnin', baby
Why you runnin', baby?
Stop your runnin', yeah
You keep on runnin', baby
Why you runnin', baby?
Don't be so hard to get
Girl, don't be hard to get
Girl, don't be hard to get
Hey, hey, hey

(Um pa pa um pa pa)
Don't be so hard
(Um pa pa um pa pa)
Don't be so hard to get to
(Um pa pa um pa pa)
Don't be so hard
(Um pa pa um pa pa)
Listen to this, girl

Girl, you're cute, you're sweet
You're such a sexy treat
You are the girl that turns me on
And when you're hot, you're hot
I love the stuff you've got
I sing about you every time I sing a kinky song

(Do do dah do do da do do dah)

Don't be so hard to get (I will get you in the end)
Keep your lovin' freaky (Keep your lovin' soft and wet)

Keep your lovin' kinky (I'll give you love you won't forget)
