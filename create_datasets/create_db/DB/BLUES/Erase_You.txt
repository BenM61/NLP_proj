Tonight will be preceded by
A few drinks to calm me down
To settle my gut, to work up a smile
Because your bones are shakin'
Baby, agitate my nerves
I'm feeling reckless
And I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll do this till I'm somebody else
Well, tonight I'll be a classic work
Like Edgar Allan Poe
And I'll die on these streets of Baltimore
As a beggar, john, or buyer
Look, I'm just trying to score
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history
Is with me, shouting, "have another"
Now I'm taking all the liberties
I was too scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now bend over and touch the floor
Plan A has got a boyfriend
But she melts to my touch
Plan B has got a crush
As much as she's got a lust
Plan C well, God forgive me
Well, she, she just lives to f*ck
I'll just act like I'm not in control
Well I'm feeling reckless
And I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll take this, drink think, do this, smoke this
f*ck you while we're somebody else
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history
Is with me, shouting, "have another"
Now I'm taking all the liberties
I was too scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now bend over and touch the floor
Shut up and dance
Ms. sings in her sleep
Ms. moves to my beat
What kind of secrets are we keeping tonight?
Because he's not here and he's not waiting up
How about another spin around the floor?
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family history
Is with me, shouting, "have another"
Be sure I'm slutting it up
'Cause I know love's not enough
And I'll be outside the bar
Hopes for the back of her car
She's got wandering eyes
And much more curious lips
And I'm still betting every dime
She answers as her skirt slides over her hips
