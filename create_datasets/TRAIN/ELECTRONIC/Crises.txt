Crises, crises - you can't get away!
Crises, crises - you can't get away!
Crises, crises - I need you on my side 'cause there's a crisis.
And you can't get away!
Crises, crises - you can't get away!
Crises, crises - you can't get away!
Crises, crises - I need you on my side 'cause there's a crisis.
And you can't get away!
Crises, crises - you can't get away!
Crises, crises - you can't get away!
Crises, crises - I need you on my side 'cause there's a crisis.
And you can't get away!
Take a walk until the next dawn.
In the winter, rain and storms.

The watcher and the tower,
Waiting hour by hour.
There's a breech in the security,
A disturbance in tranquility.
The watcher and the tower,
Waiting hour by hour.
The watcher and the tower,
Waiting hour by hour.

The watcher and the tower,
Waiting hour by hour.
The watcher and the tower,
Waiting hour by hour.
