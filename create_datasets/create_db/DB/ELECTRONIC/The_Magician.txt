Back with the living, no you're back on your feet
Back in the house that just, just made you complete
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Back now for Easter and you're back here with glee
Oh I, son of mother, oh I
I'm the magician for tonight

Back with the living, no you're back in your tie
Back for the luncheons and you're back here to dine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Back now for Easter, you're back and you're fine
Oh I, son of mother, oh I
I'm the magician for tonight

Back with the living, no you're back on your feet
Back in the house that just, just made you complete
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Back now for Easter and you're back here with glee
Oh I, son of mother, oh I
I'm the magician for tonight
