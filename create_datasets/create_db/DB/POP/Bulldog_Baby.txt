Stood up at a border street
A souped up strut on swollen feet
My loss remembered incomplete
What memory knows I can't repeat
Offered army soul salvation
Sandwich choice of God and nation

Haloed voices, chiselled faces
Fill my head with empty spaces
Out of the breakdown of the whole
Back to the choices on repeat
Out of a life put on hold
Once again a bulldog baby
Classified as cheap and lazy
Inner pity meat mutation

Pay the price for approbation
Welcome to the new dictators
Power, drugs and imitators
Out of the breakdown of the whole
Back to the choices on repeat
Out of a life put on hold

Mother's dressed in alligator
All good children love to hate her
Out of the breakdown of the whole
Back to the choices on repeat
Out of a life put on hold
Into the fallout of belief
