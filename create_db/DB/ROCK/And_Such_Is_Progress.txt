we are living in a world of unconsciousness and in this world we are devoid of all sensibility, a gross self interest of undefined proportions, education eliminates itself diluting the path which leads beyond the curriculum of uniformity and the actuality of thinking, expanding, defying and redefining. a nd propose that we depart from the duties that we have been conditioned to serve, a civil disobedience of sorts in order to reroute the political authorities which control the execution of law and order that service the few. I defy what capitalism has become and I defy what it has done to me. and living in this world the solutions that are so desperately needed are provided yet ignored. an intellectual insurgence awaits as we educate each other and learn from those who have gone beyond the perimeters of mindlessness. ... and such is progress.
