What I've been trying to do is tell you I'm still scared
What I've been trying to hide is just how much how care
There's reasons for breaking our ties, I'm telling you lies, I confess
What I've been trying to say is oh, I'm such a mess

I'll be your favorite worst mistake
I'll be a memory, I'll be a ghost
You'll be a night to fill the space 
You'll be a moment and then I'll go

When it's 4 a.m. in the morning
I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4 AM and I call ya
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her

How can I hold you so close
When I'm thinking of somebody else?
How can I treat you so right
When I know that you're only the help?
The reason you're here is to deal with my fear
I hate being alone
How can I do this to you
Yet you still always answer the phone?

When it's 4 a.m. in the morning
I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4 a.m. and I call ya
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her
You should know, I don't want, your love
Never have, never will

So I'll be your favorite worst mistake
