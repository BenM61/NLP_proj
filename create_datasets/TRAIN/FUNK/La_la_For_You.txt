You make me feel
So good, loving me
And you turn around and
Shamed my name

All I can say is la-la-la you, baby

Good feeling
(Listen yeah)

It's for you sure that I'm a man
Take the bread out of my hand
Now you wanna know how strong I am
All I can say
La la la la you, babe

What's the use of giving out
Giving out, giving in, giving in, let 'em sin
Now you trying to be, you wanna be my friend

Yeah

I love you, anyway
No matter what my friends say
Ooh baby, come with me
Oh yeah

I la la la la la you
It's for sure that I'm a man
Take the bread out of my hand
Now you wanna know
(Wanna know)
How strong I am

I'm gonna keep on
(Keep on)
Loving you
(Loving you)
No matter what my friends say and do
Trying to sleep, trying my find my way through

I get down on my knees
I beg you, baby, baby
Just lend a helping hand to me
La la la la la la you
Yeah

Ooh baby
Aww, aww, babe
Wanna know, I got to know
Yeah baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, yeah
