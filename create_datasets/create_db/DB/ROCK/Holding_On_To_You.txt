I'll be there where the music goes
I'll be there singing
Working out my life where the feelings right
Well the years keep rolling on
But my heart is strong
I'm holding on

I won't be letting go
I just started to hold on harder to you
I won't be letting go
I just wanted you to know
I won't be letting go
I just wanted to hold on harder to you
All our songs come around again
And our world's ever turning
Somehow everyday there's another way
When my soul's in place
Every song will trace your smiling face

I won't be letting go
I just started to hold on harder to you
I won't be letting go
I just wanted you to know
I won't be letting go
I just wanted to hold on harder to you

All the music that I haven't made
Keeps my soul alive
Gotta make it
For only the song survives

I won't be letting go
I just started to hold on harder to you
I won't be letting go
I just wanted you to know
I won't be letting go
I just wanted to hold on harder to you

I'm holding on to you
