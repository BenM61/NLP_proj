I guess I flew too high
Icarus falling from the sky
But in the dense rainforest heat
Somehow I landed on my feet
With the will to survive

And in the heart of darkness
Without a chance of rescue
I never quit, I just refused
I thought of you
Somehow I know I'd find you
Following my heart's compass
And your love
Your love was leading me back to you
Now the ordeal is over
Now I can feel your heartbeat
And your love
Your love is leading me back to you

Daylight began to show
A jungle painted by Rousseau
I walked around in circles lost
Above the spidermonkeys laughed
At my failure below

And in the heart of darkness
Without a chance of rescue
I never quit, I just refused
I thought of you
Somehow I know I'd find you
Following my heart's compass
And your love
Your love was leading me back to you
Now the ordeal is over
Now I can feel your heartbeat
And your love
Your love is leading me back to you

Your love is leading me back to you
