Welcome to this world that we live in
Normal people going for a spin
And we don't realize
That it changes all our lives

Every day somebody's asking questions
Someone wants to know if I know
All the answers, or am I just guessing?
Guess we'll never really know

Sunday section gave us a mention
Grandma's freaking out over the attention
Now my friends abound
They're coming back around

Long distance on the other end
Says I need them for a friend
No matter what I choose
I'm the one they want to use

Flip your wig
Flip your wig
Flip your wig
Flip your wig
Flip your wig
Flip your wig
Flip your wig
Flip your wig

Do I really know
And do I really care
Do we really know
And do we really care
And do I really know
And do I really care
Do we really know
And do we really care
