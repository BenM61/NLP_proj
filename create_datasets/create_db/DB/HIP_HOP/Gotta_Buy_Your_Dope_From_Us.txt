[Little Bruce: ]

I got Now and Later, bubble gum and sour candies 

With a trunk load of cookies like Amos and Andy 

Got the bud from Hershey and Mr. M&M 

And me and Willy Wonka is old school friends 

It's the American dream 

On the triple beam 

Little Bruce got the bomb ass cookies and cream 

And I'm servin' more kids than Chuck E. Cheese 

And a german chocolate cake'll cost you 16 G's 

[be-Legit: 

It's the big time billa 

Sucka side killa 

Real about the fetti 

No Ben baby?? 

Got a truck load baby for the hillside ride 

Bombbay all the way from the Bay we slide 

Through your hood 

Gettin' off our goods 

Fiendin' for a knot 

We put it in the box 

We got a brand new batch 

And we put in the smash 

Better get it 'cause we sellin' out fast 

[Chorus: ]

You gotta buy dope from us 

You gotta buy dope from us 

You gotta buy dope from us 

If you want to ball please 

If you want to stack cheese 

You gotta buy dope from us

I got variety packs 

Hits so fat 

And that's platinum status 

I'ma let you have it 

It's on for a little bit or nathin' at all 

I'm going wholesale 

I needs mail from all 

[see-Bo: ]

Suitcase full of G's 

400SC 

It's the candy man with all the cream 

I put the candy on the triple beam 

The ziplock baggies 

Distributin' to the nation to have your whole crew cavied 

Now fools want to blast me because I'm ballin' 

'cause got more cream than 31 flavors at Baskin Robbins 

Slangin' thangs for 16 9 for half 

Got ya flyin' to the Westside to double up your cash 

Little Bruce: 

I'm playin' chase with the FEDS 

And got the DA's pissed 

They raided my spot 

Shot both my Pits' 

While I was in Atlanta smokin Swisher Sweets loungin' 

Countin' hundred thousand in the Lexus clowin' 

[Chorus ]

You gotta buy dope from us 

You gotta buy dope from us 

You gotta buy dope from us 

If you want to ball please 

If you want to stack cheese 

You gotta buy dope from us 

Answering Machine: 

What's happening? 

You reached Sik Wid It slash Jive. 

Leave your name and number at tone. 

I'll get writ back at you. 

Playa, we at the All-Star game in San Antonio. 

You and Bruce meet us here and don't to forget to bring it. 

[Little Bruce: ]

I hit the All-Star game with a thang my back pack 

And on no train we rollin' nice ass Cadillacs 

The north star system on 100 spoke Daytons 

I smokes big with Reider and Gary Payton 

Behind the back door where ballers be livin' 

Transactions on nation-wide television 

[see-Bo: ]

I'm down to make cheese 

Slangin' straight cream 

In the land of milk and honey 

On a mission about the money 

Breakin' down in quarters 

Saran wrappin' acorss the border 

In my 500 Ben behind the '96 Explorer 

be	-Legit: 

I pull the keys out my pocket 

And I started to G 

Bo-Loc back seat strapped down with heat 

Track after track 

Unit after unit 

Runnin' straight through it 

It ain't nothin' to it 

It's kind of like me sprung out on doves 

And when you buy dope you better but it from us 

[Chorus: ]

You gotta buy dope from us 

You gotta buy dope from us 

You gotta buy dope from us 

If you want to ball please 

If you want to stack cheese 

You gotta buy dope from us
