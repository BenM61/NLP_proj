I got a kindhearted woman, do anything in this world for me
I got a kindhearted woman, do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women, man, they will not let me be

I love my baby, my baby don't love me
I love my baby, my baby don't love me
But I really love that woman, can't stand to leave her be

Ain't but the one thing, makes Mister Johnson drink
I's worried about how you treat me, baby, I begin to think
Oh, babe, my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart, when you call Mister So-and-So's name

She's a kindhearted woman, she studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman, she studies evil all the time
You well's to kill me, as to have it on your mind
