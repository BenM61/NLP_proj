Here she comes
You better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true

It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false coloured eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down
What a clown

Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're written in her book
You're number 37, take a look
She's going to smile to make you frown
What a clown

Little boy she's from the streets
Before you start you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
Yes it's true

Cause everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please
(She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

She will try to bring you down
The hardest girl around

Cause everybody knows
The things she does to please
She's just a little tease
And everybody knows
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
