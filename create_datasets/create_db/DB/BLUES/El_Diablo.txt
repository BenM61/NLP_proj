Did you ever hear the story
That happened not long ago
'Bout the man with a tan:
El diablo de Mexico?
And this man played his hand
And he lived by the luck of the draw;
Now and then and again,
Found him steppin' outside of the law
Hey, hey!

And his fortune he had made
let him live high on the hog
Til the day of the raid
When they hunted him like a dog.
He was out on the run,
Knowing he could get by,
'Cause the men killed in sin
were not there to testify.
Hey, hey!

He was caught, he was bound
In La Casa de Calaboose.
He was tried; he was found
And readied for the noose.
But the break he would make,
It didn't turn out so well.
And the hombre called "Diablo"
Bid his last farewell.
