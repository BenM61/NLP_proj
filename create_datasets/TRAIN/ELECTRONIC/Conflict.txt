Conflict, confusion, distrust...
Conflict confusion distrust

You taught me right
You taught me wrong
You taught me to always be strong
You paved the way
You showed me fear
I know now, what wasn't real
I saw one thing and heard another
I was too young to understand
I never knew what to believe
I feel so deceived

Confusion in my head
Don't understand all that you said
And now I see the light 
It's times like these I realize
But how can I read these
Mixed messages that you did bring
And forgive all the pain you cause 
All of the suffering

You taught me right
You taught me wrong
You taught me to always be strong
You paved the way
You showed me fear
I know now, what wasn't real
I saw one thing and heard another
I was too young to understand
I never knew what to believe
I feel so deceived

Keep my perspective straight...
Keep me away from hate...
Keep my eyes uncovered...

You taught me right
You taught me wrong
You taught me to always be strong
You paved the way
You showed me fear
I know now, what wasn't real
I saw one thing and heard another
I was too young to understand
I never knew what to believe
I feel so deceived

Conflict, confusion, distrust...
Conflict confusion distrust

I feel so deceived!
