Ayo mo bee
Drop it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's do it like this, uh

If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb

If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more

If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man, yeah

She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall

'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you won't ask

If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I was your woman

Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you
Yeah, yeah

Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind

You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman

Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you

If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
I were your woman
