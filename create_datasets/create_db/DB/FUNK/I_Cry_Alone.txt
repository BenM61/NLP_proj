I cry alone
When no one else can hear me
When friends come by to cheer me
I smile and say I feel okay

But I cry alone
Each lonely night without you
But when they talk about you
I make believe I never grieve

And here in my room
When no one else can find me
I lock the door behind me
And I cry

Please come home, come back to me
Oh, how I long to kiss you
If friends say I don't miss you
They just don't know
How I cry alone

If friends say I don't miss you
They just don't know
How I cry alone
