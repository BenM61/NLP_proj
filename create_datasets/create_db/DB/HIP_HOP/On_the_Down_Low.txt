Maxine was 5'9'' 
Had a man, and she didn't mind 
Walked up to me nice and slow 
What she wanted 
I did not know 
Gave me her pager number 
And said call her "anytime" 
Then she whispered in my ear 

[Chorus]
She said 
My body wants you so 
For what I miss at home 
Nobody has to know 
Keep it 
On the down and low 
She said 
My body wants you so 
For what I miss at home 
Nobody has to know 
Keep it 
On the down and low 

She says that he 
Doesn't take her anywhere 
Used to say sweet things 
Acts like he doesn't even care 
He thinks that she's content 
'cause he buys her cars 
And he pays her rent 
But she's not ready to leave 
She turned and said to me 

[Chorus]

I wouldn't treat you that way 
If you were my lady 
I wouldn't share you 
You'd be mine and mine alone, oh yeah 
If he continues wastin' your time 
Girl, he's crazy 
I'll take her 
(Got to get down and low) 

Maxine looked into my eyes 
Wanted me to be the other guy 
'cause tonight she's needin' someone to hold 
Lonely nights can be, oh, so cold 
Deprived of all the things 
She misses, wants, wishes, and needs 
Got hotter than a hundred an' three 
She turned and said to me 

[Chorus: Repeats]
