I'm not upset when you're around
I think I lose myself the second that I see I'm found
And not a day goes by or an hour without
Times I can't remember what I'm thinking about
Cause my head's caught up 
And tangled in those dreams

I go uptown on a quiet day
Just to gather my thoughts when I don't know what to say

And we go outside when the morning's dark
And we fall in the grass of an open park
And the sun will break
When our hands hit the tree

And I'm on time
Though I didn't try
And the seconds move slow
But the moments all too right

And not a day goes by
Or and hour without,
Times I can't remember what I'm thinking about
Cause my head's caught up
And tangled in those dreams

Daydream the days away
