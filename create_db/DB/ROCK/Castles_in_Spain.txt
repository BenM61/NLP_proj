This is the easy time
The first and last river crossed
A happy time

Can you hear the voices 
Calling - calling - calling
Go on - go on - go on keep moving
Its so easy to see why

He who will rise will fall again
I see your eyes
Castles In Spain

Push your way across
And did I feel uneasy here
You settled in

Can you hear...
You're here and you know why

He who will...
Can you hear...
What can I do

You settled in
A happy time
What can I do
