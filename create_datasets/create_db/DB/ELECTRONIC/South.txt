This was the one and only
So pure, so pure
You named the stars and told me 
They're all yours, they're all yours

And all at once I saw the sign
The very extreme of lies
And my pain
Smothering
My pain 
Cover it

I can't feel your pain but
I can taste the rain I've laid

I lost my sense of wonder
There's no cure, there's no cure
I'm losing my head
Smothering
My pain 
Cover it

I can't feel no pain
But i can taste the way
It touched my heart bleed

And all at once I saw the sign
The very extreme of lies
It taught me how to cry

Without my strength
I'll handle this
Over and over and I'll
Handle this
Over and over and I
Found way to blame you
Found how to blame you
I can recognize

I've lost so much
I gave so much
I've loved so much

And that's why
You took so much
And you gave so much
It's all yours
