Groove me groove me groove me hey 
Move me move me baby 
Groove me groove me groove me hey 
Move me move me baby 

Time is up 
It's time to get up 
No fakin' to be seen 
No dumbness to be heard 
We got to all move in the same direction 
If you can't move then you need a correction 
Just move you body out on the dance floor 
If you can't dance 
Get off my dance floor 
Rap is out 
It's what I talk about 
It started it all so what you're talking about 

Roll roll roll 
You loose control 
Fun factory groove you know I got soul 
To get you all up on the dance floor 
So all you scream move, move, more, more 
So what you're gonna say 
So what you're gonna do 
Try to stop Rod D. 
You know you can't do 
So let me flow just how I like 
I give you all just what you like
