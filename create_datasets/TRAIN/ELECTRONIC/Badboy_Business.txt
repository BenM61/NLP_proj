Yeah yeah yeah 

Say there ain't no love, don't need it
Why you showing off your weakness?
You don't need to front, don't need to front
Don't need front, it's not even a real one
Say there ain't no love, don't need it
Why you showing off your weakness?
You don't need to front, don't need to front
Don't need front, it's not even a real one

Everywhere we go, everywhere we go baby
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know baby
Soon as we alone, soon as we alone baby
That's when I like you the most
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go baby
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know baby
Soon as we alone, soon as we alone baby
It's when I like you the most
