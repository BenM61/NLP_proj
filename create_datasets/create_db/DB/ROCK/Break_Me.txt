Hole in our waist we take a breath again
To work it out
It's all in my head, a friend again
Always, please let me out

I've been there before, I've seen it once more
Would I see you are going, see you are
Would you break me? Would you break me now?
You won't break us, you won't break us now

Sole state of mind, the state of mine
Always, I won't let you down
It's all in our days to find a way
And say I'll have you 'round

I've been there before, I've seen it once more
Would I see you are going, see you are
Would you break me? Would you break me now?
You won't break us, you won't break us now

Would you break me? Would you break me now?
You won't break us, you won't break us now

Please break all to the underground
Please break all to the underground
Please break all to the underground
Please break all to the underground
