What more can I say?
From the bottom of my heart I need you
You're part of my day

My inspiration is you alone
To call my own
I love you, I love you

From the bottom of my heart I want you
It's you I adore
Ev'ry moment we're apart I miss you
And, darling, what's more
 
I'd be on my way to heaven
If you'd say "I love you from the bottom of my heart"

From the bottom of my heart I want you
It's you I adore
Ev'ry moment we're apart how I miss you
And, darling, what's more
 
I'd be on my way to heaven
If you'd say "I love you from the bottom of my heart"
