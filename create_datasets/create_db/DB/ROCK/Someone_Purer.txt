I was gripped with a bit of fear
Worried the one thing that I loved
Back when I was just a kid
Might now never be enough
That the body I was in
Might belong to someone else
Someone kinder
Someone surer
Someone innocent
Young and beautiful
Someone purer

I was scratching at my skin
Hopin changes would begin
But what laid beneath was blood
Well of course
What the hell was I thinking of
Won't you take me down to the creek
Wash away our sins of sleep
I feel so tired
As though I might
Not wake at all on the other side
That's no way to go

Oh my dear one
Bathe me in your glow
Cut out my lonely heart
And bury it in the snow
Nothing really means nothing
Is the saddest thing I know
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll

And in the morning there'll be hope
And in the morning there'll be light
And if I sleep and dream up a system
A solution
To fend off perils of the night
Come on in, I'll be born again
Born again as someone else
Someone kinder
Someone surer
Someone beautiful
Someone purer

And when I am you'll know
And when I am you'll know

??????
The devil knows my name
Will salvation come
And wash away my pain?
For I was once a kid
With a pure and innocent soul
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll
A pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul

Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll
And a pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul
