Here I was rollin' in the car 
I drove down past the park 
Spotted a couple 
Who wasn't in trouble 
And they were doin' no harm 
She leans down and kisses him on his lips 
To give her love back he rubs her hips 
Oh, I could feel it 
I felt their passion 
Running through my warming veins 

So bad I wished that that was me 
Make love like they do on TV 
I see, all I seem to see 
Is you and me 

Here I was rollin' in the car 
I drove down past the park 
Spotted a couple 
Who wasn't in trouble 
And they were doin' no harm 
She leans down and kisses him on his lips 
To give her love back he rubs her hips 
Oh, I could feel it 
I felt their passion 
Running through my warming veins
 
How I wished that could be 
Baby you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 
If I had one wish it would be 
Baby, you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 

Now I'm not sayin' something's wrong with this relationship 
But I know one thing, boy 
It could be better 
We have bedroom secrets 
Sealed with a kiss 
But nothing else compares to this 
I'm talkin' about that real love 
That true love 
Can you feel me? 

Someday it will be you and me 
Makin' love like they do on TV 
I see, all I seem to see 
Is you and me 

Now I'm not sayin' something's wrong with this relationship 
But I know one thing, boy 
It could be better 
We have bedroom secrets 
Sealed with a kiss 
But nothing else compares to this 
I'm talkin' about that real love 
That true love 
Can you feel me?

How I wished that could be 
Baby you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 
If I had one wish it would be 
Baby, you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 

With one exception 
I'mma grant your wish 
You see I'm diggin' your package 
That's why I sealed it with a kiss 

Homie's ain't understanding it 
They think I'm saving you girl 
Never take me for granted 
'Cause I'm craving you girl 

See my mental state is streetlight 
I'm like a fantasy 
Spontaneous of mind 
I turn your wish into reality 

I greet you in the land of lovemaking 
A true man, true to you, you 
Or even thinking about shaking a spot 
We keep it steamy hot 
Keep it full-blown baby 
Get it, get it, don't stop 
Just you and me baby 
Touching up stuff 
Young dear keep it going 
And make it like a 

What, ain't it evident that the mood 
Goin' to be hanging on us 
Getting' love twisted with love 
See, I smoked that drama 
Go on and tell it 
And I could show you 
But yes I can tell it 

How I wished that could be 
Baby you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 
If I had one wish it would be 
Baby, you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 

How I wished that could be 
Baby you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 
If I had one wish it would be 
Baby, you and me 
To become reality 
In the perfect love fantasy 

My one wish would be 
For you to make sweet love to me 
Like the first time 
Baby all the time
