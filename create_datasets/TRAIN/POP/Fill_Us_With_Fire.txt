I'm talking 'bout the soul inside
Every thought and word and deed
We're running and we don't look back
Some people never see the light

Every particle of time
It will be a healing one
We only dream in black and white
Blind to that beautiful one

We're choking on the air we breathe
And I believe that God's a waste of time
It will fill us with fire
There'll be no sense of pity
We will fly into heaven, (heaven)

Can you the feel love inside?
Something to aspire to
Spirit of the lost and found
We'll find it again and again

I wanna know the way you feel
We all want to touch the sun
Send it to the end of time
Back to the beginning

All across the universe
We can feel the love
Around this crazy world
Fill us with fire
There'll be no sense of pity
We will fly into heaven

We're choking on the air we breathe
And I believe it's all a waste of time
It will fill us with fire
There'll be no sense of pity
We will fly into heaven (heaven, heaven)

Everybody is hurting
Everybody wants freedom
We will fly into heaven
(We will fly into heaven, 
Fly into heaven, fly into heaven)
