I'm the feathered serpent of the Aztecs
I've weathered the invasion of the insects
I invented the Jayne Mansfield Nuclear project
The Pope genuflects to gain my respect
Oh these are the confessions of a psycho cat
These are the confessions of a psycho cat
I know why and when and where it's at!
Yes, these are the confessions of a psycho cat

I cross the himalayas with Hannibal
I had some himalayan with cannibals
Its completely un-understandable
I can't believe this stuff comes over my mandible!
These are the confessions of a psycho cat
These are the confessions of a psycho cat
I'm Jayne Mansfield Memorial Power Plant
Yes, these are the confessions of a psycho cat

Get a load of this:
Our Lady of Spain on guitar
Pinky Tripmayer on bass
Rock Block on skins
Yeah
Um they are very good

I've been through the psychedelic keyhole
I speak to all the flowers and the beetles
I've seen the church and dwelled in the steeple
Say I'm keen to bring the power to the people
Yes, these are the confessions of a psycho cat
These are the confessions of a psycho cat
Should have kept under my surrealist hat
These are the confessions of a psycho cat
Yes, these are the confessions of a psycho cat

Yes psycho! Th-that's what they tell me. 
But it was me that put an end to the wigstore riots. 
And it didn't work when the Marine Corps tried it. 
I can make a joke and sideswipe it. 
So put that in your smoke and pipe it!
