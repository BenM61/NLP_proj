I wish that I was staying longer
But I been called into the light
Something 'bout you makes me stronger
But all the lows, they feel like highs
I'm sorry that I never told you
But I will never lose the faith
Through the stars, over the oceans
I'll meet you there someday

So lay me down, in the water
Let me drown, don't let my feet touch the ground
Kiss me now, until it's over
We're running out of time

When I'm with you, I can hear them singing
My tears will fall when my eyes close
With you, I am always winning
And that feeling never goes

So lay me down, in the water
Let me drown, don't let my feet touch the ground
Kiss me now, until it's over
We're running out of time

I wish we could rewrite our story, love is extraordinary
Try to say the words but make no sound
If God is real, then reassure me
Take my hand and hold me closely
Show me that you'll always be around
If my heart is never found
But love is all we needed
But time let us down
I can feel you getting lighter
Your eyes are shining brighter
You're finally coming home
Don't have to wait no longer
I know I made you stronger
I know you're not alone

So lay me down, in the water
Let me drown, don't let my feet touch the ground
When we're found
But love was all we needed
But time let us down
When we're found
But love was all we needed
But time let us down
