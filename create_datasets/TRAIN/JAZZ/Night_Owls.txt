See all the Night Owls when they gather 'neath the neon lights
They've been sleeping all day long, now they come alive
See all the Night Owls when they gather, dressed up to the nines
They're out to party and they'll keep it going 'til the morning light

Sundown girls are posing coolly, looking so divine
Trying to excite and mystify
Sharing juicy secrets 'bout some man to hypnotize
Merry-making sisters, flashing smiles that hold the sharpness of a knife

See all the Night Owls when they gather 'neath the neon lights
They've been sleeping all day long, now they come alive
See all the Night Owls when they gather, dressed up to the nines
They're out to party and they'll keep it going 'til the morning light

Heavy Boys are watching from the corner of their eyes
Talking of some hero's latest crime
Then they leave the circle one by one, once in a while
If you want to keep it going, 'ain't it time that we all had another line

See all the Night Owls when they gather 'neath the neon lights
They've been sleeping all day long, now they come alive
See all the Night Owls when they gather, dressed up to the nines
They're out to party and they'll keep it going 'til the morning light

Blue-eyed boy is taking Cinderella for a ride
Promising a glimpse of paradise 
Says the spider to the fly

'Til the morning light
