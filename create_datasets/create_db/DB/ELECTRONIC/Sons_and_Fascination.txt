Summer rains are here
Savaged beauty life
Falling here from grace
Sister feeling call
Cruising land to land
No faith no creed no soul
Half a world away
Beauty sleeps in time
Sound and fury play

Ma son warm land semi-monde
Ma son warm land semi-monde

Cry because you're young
Governments and gifts
Hearts are in our mouths
Thank you for the voice
Thank you for the eyes
Thank you for the good times
Golden guns and cars
Styles and motorcades
In screaming beauty days

Ma son warm land semi-monde
Ma son warm land semi-monde

Only winds that twist
When white money calls
Falling here from grace
White-eye movement trust
Parades are leaving town
When boys of Venice call
In all stations trust
In all stations soul
Sons and fascination

Ma son warm land semi-monde
Ma son warm land semi-monde
