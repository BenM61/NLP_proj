Wasn't forever the word you used?
Always together, we can't lose
Pictured the minister, bells and lace
And all of the relatives in one place

And then right in the middle of the party
You wanna change your mind
Well, it's time for me to face up to reality
Plan be, that's what time it is

I should have known better, girl so fine
They tell me it happens all the time
And nothing but trouble tip to toe
With tons of attention everywhere you go

Well, I got the kind of girl
That makes a little dog break a big chain
If you know what I mean
Well, there's only one option that's left for me
Plan be, let me get my head together

I guess it was too good to be true
All that devotion and attitude
But you found somebody you had missed
And that was the one thing that you can't resist

So you tell me that you love me
Then you kick me out in the street
So cold
Well, it's time for me to face up to reality
Plan be, that's what time it is, yeah
Plan be, you got to have a plan

Plan be
Plan be
Plan be
Plan be
