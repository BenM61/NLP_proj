Alhamdulillah Allah Jehovah
Yahweh Dios Ma'at Jah
Rastafari fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop

It's bigger than religion
Hip-hop
It's bigger than my nigga
Hip-hop
It's bigger than the government
This one is fa' Dilla, hip-hop

We ain't dead said the children don't believe it
We just made ourselves invisible
Underwater, stove-top, blue flame scientists 
Come out with your scales up
Get baptized in the ocean of the hungry

My niggas turn in to gods
Walls come tumblin'

Alhamdulillah Allah Jehovah
Yahweh Dios Ma'at Jah
Rastafari fyah dance, sex, music, hip-hop

It's bigger than religion
Hip-hop
It's bigger than my nigga
Hip-hop
It's bigger than the government
This one is the healer, hip-hop

Told you we ain't dead yet
We been livin' through your internet
You don't have to believe everything you think
We've been programmed wake up, we miss you
They call you indigo, we call you Africa
Go get baptized in the ocean of the people
Say reboot, refresh, restart
Fresh page, new day, o.g.'s, new key
