Saw you again for the first time
In a long time it brought out
All these feelings that I never
Knew I had inside seeing you
With another girl it didn't sit
With me too well and I'm mad
At myself cause I love you and
With or without you I'm going through hell

I don't think that I could shake ya
So baby can we make up I know
That this is kinda crazy but
Baby I want to make up
I don't think that I could shake ya
So baby can we make up I know
That this kinda crazy but
Baby I want to make up

I never knew I could love you
How I love you
I thought that
I was through with you so glad
That I could be single now I'm
Caught thinking about the past and wish
That we could just go back
And I'm mad at myself cause I love you and
I really want you to come back

I don't think that I could shake ya
So baby can we make up I
Know that this is kinda crazy but
Baby I want to make up
I don't think that I could shake ya
So baby can we make up I know
That this is kinda crazy but
Baby I want to make up

I don't know if I'm crazy but all
The pain and the heartache you gave me
That only made me want to get back with
You oooo you held her hand the way
Ya held mine you felt her uhhhh
The way ya felt mine
And all the fighting
That we went through, see
I was already used to it

I don't think that I could shake ya
So baby can we make up I
Know that this kinda crazy but
Baby I want to make up
I don't that that I could shake ya
So baby can we make up I know
That this is kinda cray but
Baby I want to make up
