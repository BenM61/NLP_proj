Sing your magic spell 
Into my ears
Place a blissful sigh 
Into my tears

Cradle my forgiveness 
Judging that I'm half a man
If it were not for your sweetness 
I would not know who I am

Take your magic broom
And sweep my heart
Rescue Cupid's arrow 
From broken hearts

Reaching for completeness
Digging deep into the sand
If it were not for your sweetness 
I would not know who I am

I find a shelter in your wings
I find my self-remembering 
That I'm in a dream 

Blow your moonlit trumpet
And sound my tone
Sing to me your silence 
And call me home

I'm not full of answers 
Though I pretend that I am
If it were not for your sweetness 
I would not know who I am
