Another walk about, after dark
It's my point of view
If someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you always coming and you'd never have a clue

And now I'm left behind, all the time
I will wait forever, always looking straight
Thinking, counting, all the hours you wait

See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night

And now another clue, I would ask
If you could help me out
It's hard to understand
Cause when you're really by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand

And now it's gonna be, tough on me
But I will wait forever
I need someone now to look into my eyes and tell me
Girl you know you gotta watch your health

To look into my eyes and tell me
La la la la la
To look into my eyes and tell me
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
I see you on a dark night
