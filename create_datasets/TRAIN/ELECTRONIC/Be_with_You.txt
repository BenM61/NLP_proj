Yeah
I can feel it
Well I heard you're coming home
I've been waiting
For your call to come
I remember
And it feels like yesterday
Haven't seen you for years
And now you're home and I feel it

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be (I'll be with you)
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be

If you're leaving
Then I know it's not for long
So I listen
To all your desires
In the moonlight
We can dance into the night
Let the world disappear
Oh, smell it here
And I'll be with you

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be (I'll be with you)
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be (I'll be with you)
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be (I'll be with you)
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I will be
