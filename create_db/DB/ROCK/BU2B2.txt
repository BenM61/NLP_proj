I was brought up to believe 
Belief has failed me now 
The bright glow of optimism 
Abandoned me somehow 

Oh, belief has failed me now 
Life goes from bad to worse 
No philosophy consoles me 
In a clockwork universe 

Oh, life goes from bad to worse 
I still choose to live 
Find a measure of love and laughter 
And another measure to give 

Oh, I still choose to live and give
Even while I grieve 
Though the balance tilts against me 
I was brought up to believe
