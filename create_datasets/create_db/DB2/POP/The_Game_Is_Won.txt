Am I talking too fast?
I got a lot to learn
I'll keep my eyes wide open
And I will wait my turn
I would jump right in
But now I'm not so sure
If I put two and two together
Would I still get four?

And I know where I belong
But I'm still breaking through
Sometimes I get it wrong
But I'm keeping it true

If everything is how it should be, then everything will come
When it gets here I'll be ready
If it's just determination, 
Everything will come
And the game's already won

They say you have one chance
But that I don't believe
Although my expectations 
Can get the better of me
I shouldn't be afraid 
Of what I can't control
'Cause whatever's round the corner
I will take it all

And I know where I belong
But I'm still breaking through
Sometimes I get it wrong
But I'm keeping it true

If everything is how it should be, then everything will come
When it gets here I'll be ready
If it's just determination, 
Everything will come
And the game's already won

Believing in myself can't be wrong
I'm waiting for my time in the sun

If everything is how it should be, then everything will come
When it gets here I'll be ready
If it's just determination, 
Everything will come
And the game's already won.
