First the tide rushes i-in
Plants a kiss on the-e shore-ore-ore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more-ore

So I rush to your-our si-ide
Like the on-comi-ing tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can te-ell, I-I can feel
You are love, you are rea-ea-ea-eally mi-i-ine

In the rai-ai-ain
In the dark
In the su-un
Like the tide at its e-ebb
I'm at peace in the we-eb
Of your arms...
