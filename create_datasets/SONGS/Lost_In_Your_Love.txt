I couldn't name the last three songs 
Of what that last exit sign said
I guess I'm hypnotized by those little white lines
And tonight it's playing back in my head
And there's no way to concentrate on anything but you
And I don't know just where I'm going
But all I want to do 

Is get lost in your love
All mixed up
So completely turned around
You've got me in so deep
That I can't find my way out
But I know I've found the place where I belong
When we touch
I get lost in your love

I thought I had all the lines on the map picked out
To show me where to go
And I made up my mind I was sure this time
To play it safe and take it slow, whoa
But now I'm flying up so high
So fast I can't let go
The first time I stepped on this ride
I guess I should've known

Is get lost in your love
All mixed up
So completely turned around
You've got me in so deep
That I can't find my way out
But I know I've found the place where I belong
When we touch
I get lost in your love

I'm so lost in your love
I get lost in your love
In your love
