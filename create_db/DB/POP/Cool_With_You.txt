Late last night 
I was goin' through some old things 
When I saw a picture of you, my best friend 
It reminded me of day when you were mine 
You had a way that always lefe me here with a smile 
I want those sweet days back again 
'Cause baby 

It's a sunny day 
But you're not around 
That doggone rain might as well be pouring down 
It's such a shame 
'Cause my heart's on the ground 
Just want to be cool with you again 

Sometimes I sit by the fire and reminisce 
About the time that we spent in front of it 
And that old flame will never be the same 
Until you come back here and rekindle it 
I just want to share my heart with you again 
'Cause babe 

It's a sunny day 
But you're not around 
That doggone rain might as well be pouring down 
It's such a shame 
'Cause my heart's on the ground 
Just want to be cool with you again 

I fall asleep at night 
And often see you here 
In my dreams (in my dreams)
Holding me (holding me), yeah baby
But then I wake up and I realize that you're 
Not here with me 
It hurts so much 
I gotta have you back, babe 

It's a sunny day 
But you're not around (you're not around)
That doggone rain might as well be pouring down 
It's such a shame 
'Cause my heart's on the ground 
Just want to be cool with you again 

It's a sunny day 
But you're not around 
That doggone rain might as well be pouring down 
It's such a shame 
'Cause my heart's on the ground 
Just want to be cool with you again
