Padlock
Padlock, uh huh

I'm lockin' up
Lockin' up, yeah (I'm lockin' up)
I'm lockin' up
Lockin' up (I don't want you no more)

Lockin' up
Lockin' up now
Lockin' up (I'm lockin' up) 
Lockin' up

I've done enough complainin' to my girlfriends
My Romeo, you'll never ever change
You're all my love, but tonight releases
'Cause my heart has no room in it for pain

Don't you think, tomorrow we will make up
Can't believe this ain't a bluff
You blew it, you blew it, you blew it

So I'm padlockin' my heart
You and I are finished 
Padlockin' my heart
Love has been evicted

Padlockin' my heart
You ain't nothin' here
No more
I'm lockin' up

I'm lockin' up
Lockin' up, yeah (I'm lockin' up the door)
I'm lockin' up
Lockin' up (I don't want you no more)

Lockin' up
Lockin' up now
Lockin' up 
I'm lockin' up

I packed your things and left them in the hallway
And my telephone number has been changed
Pondering and use the chance to celebrate
Of being alone so get the stupid ring

I'm happy free and ready for some new love
Not for me I never was
You blew it, you blew it, you blew it

So I'm padlockin' my heart
You and I are finished 
Padlockin' my heart
Love has been evicted

Padlockin' my heart
You ain't nothin' here
No more
I'm lockin' up the door

I'm lockin' up
Lockin' up, yeah (I'm lockin' up the door)
I'm lockin' up
Lockin' up (I don't want you no more)

Lockin' up
Lockin' up now
Lockin' up (lockin' up)
Lockin' up

Go on hit the road jack and I'll help you up (lockin' up, lockin' up now)
If you leave right away it would make my day (lockin' up, lockin' up)
(Padlock) don't wanna see you 
(Padlock) 'cause I don't need you
(Padlock)
(Padlock)

I don't love you know more (padlock)
(Padlock)
(Padlock)
(My heart)

I don't love you know more (padlock)
(Padlock)
(Padlock)
