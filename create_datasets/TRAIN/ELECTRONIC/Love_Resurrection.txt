What can I do to make light of this dull dull day?
What switch can I pull to illuminate the way?

Show me one direction
I will not question again
For a warm injection
Is all I need to calm the pain

We all need a love (resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love (resurrection, just a little divine intervention)

What seed must I sow to replenish this barren land
Teach me to harvest, I want you to grow in my hand
Let's be optimistic, let's say that we won't toil in vain
If we pull together we'll never fall apart again

We all need a love (resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love (resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We need love

Resurrection
(We need a love)
Just a little divine (intervention)

Show me one direction
I will not question again, no, no
For a warm injection
Is all I need to calm the pain

We all need a love (resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We all need a love (resurrection, just a little divine intervention)
We need love

Resurrection
We need love
(We need a love resurrection)
(Just a little divine intervention)
Resurrection
(We need a love resurrection)
(Just a little divine intervention)
(We need a love resurrection)
(Just a little divine intervention) resurrection
