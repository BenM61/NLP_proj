So if we all come together, we know what to do 
We all come together, just to sing we love you 
And if we all come together, we know what to do 
We all come together just for you 

Racing all around the seven seas 
Chasing all the girls and making robberies 
'Causing panic everywhere they go 
Party-hardy on Titanic 

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing 
Drinking, drinking, 'till the ship is sinking 
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex-appealing 
Come, let us sing the sailor-song 

So if we all come together, we know what to do 
We all come together, just to sing we love you 
And if we all come together, we know what to do 
We all come together just for you 

Sailorman, you really turn me on 
Now the guys are gone, come let us get it on 
Girls like me are pretty hard to find 
So if you go, I'll kick your Heine 

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing 
Drinking, drinking, 'till the ship is sinking 
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex-appealing 
Come, let us sing the sailor-song 

So if we all come together, we know what to do 
We all come together, just to sing we love you 
And if we all come together, we know what to do 
We all come together just for you 

Now, let's fight! 
Ha, that's not a knife, this is a knife! 

I'm king of the world! 
Wow, this was great! 
Yeah, baby, you can sail my ship!
