I saw this old man with this young girl the other night
I walked over to him and pulled him off on the side
And I said, pops, what are you trying to prove?
I said, I've seen you out here every night this week
With a different young girl wrapped around your arm
I said, you can't keep this pace up, uh
Because these young girls
Huh, oh
They'll certainly get you down

He said, son, sit down here
Lemme tell ya something
He said, all my life I've worked hard, huh
And I've saved up me a little money
He said, but just about the time I got me a nest egg saved
I became a widow man
He says, and I'm 72 going on 73 years old
And don't have too many more years to live
Hah, he said, I know that I should be ashamed of myself
Ha, but he said
Young girls is my weakness
Oh yes, they are, huh
He said, so would you please
Leave this old gray-haired man alone
Mind your business
Heh heh
Let me and this young girl
Have us a little bit of fun, huh

That's when I looked at him and I said
I said, all right, pops, you got her
But listen, ha ha ha ha, here's all you're doing
Oh yes, oh yes, oh, you just
Buying buyin' a book
That's what I said to him
I said, listen to this, here's all you're doing
(Buying a book for some young man)
That's what you're doing, heh
To read
But don't do it
(Don't do it)
Don't do it
(Don't do it)
Oh, don't do it!
(Don't do it!)
Send that young girl on home
Mmm mmm mmm

Then there was this middle-aged woman whose name I dare not call
Simply because you out there listening
Just might know who this woman is
But I can tell you this much
The woman lives right here in your town
I know you didn't know that, did you, huh
I saw this woman with this young man
In the broaden day time the other day
I say, miss lady, you oughta be ashamed of yourself
Ridin' around with this young man all hugged up like this here, heh huh

She said, son, oh son, you're dippin' in my business
But if you want to know why I fool with this young man
I'll tell you
She said, I was married to a man 40 years older than I was
Says, for a long time I was true and faithful to that one man
Says, and last year he died and willed me a whole lotta money
And I know that that young man sittin' in my car
Just wants me for my money, uh huh
She said, but if that's what it takes to keep the young, fine thing
Oh ho, he can get every single dime
Because it ain't nothin' an old man can do for me
But show me which way a young man went, hah hah

Oh Lord, oh, oh
Here's what I said, huh
I said, you're just
Buying
That's all you're doin'
(Buying a book)
That's what I told her, huh
Listen, miss lady, here's all you're doin', uh
(Buying a book for some young girl)
You oughta quit it, huh
To read
(Don't do it)
I said, that's your car, drive him home
Give him all your money!
I'm sorry I dipped in your business
I won't do it no more
No
