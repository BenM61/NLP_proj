My love waits for you
There's nothing I can do
So I'm holding back
Afraid when I can't save it all
This love I know

I'm saving it, you've got to keep
I'm saving it, your love to me
A sentimental love tonight to me
Every time it is when you love somebody

No tears, no signs
Only makes it so much harder to go on
Just take good care
And remember when you're feeling all alone

You'll be with me in my heart
And always on my mind
The only thing that keeps us apart is time

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together
I'm saving my love for you

When we're, our two
And I felt that I've known you for so long
One thing, I knew
It was lovin' that would last on and on

Even with the best of plans
The world gets in the way
Don't be downhearted
I'll soon be back to stay

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together

And I would be a fool to throw away my chances
The best shot that I ever had

And all that we could have
One of those romances
That's warmer with the good times
And grows stronger with the bad

Ooh Lord, I'm saving it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together
Oh, I'm saving it

Ooh baby, I'm saving it
Yes, that's all I wanna do, just save it
All I wanna do, sweet thing, is save it

Saving it, ooh baby, boy, I'm saving it
Only thing I want to do is save it
Sweet, sweet baby, I'm saving it
Saving my love
