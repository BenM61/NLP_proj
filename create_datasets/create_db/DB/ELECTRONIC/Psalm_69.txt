Congregation, 
Please be seated and open your prayer guides to the book
Of revelations, psalm 69

Drinking the blood of Jesus
Drinking it right from his veins
Learning to swim in the ocean
Learning to prowl in his name

The body of Christ looked unto me
A preacher with god-given hands
He wants you to suck on the holy ghost
And swallow the sins of man

Psalm 69

The invisible piss of the holy ghost
Comes down like acid rain
They're making a bonnet of terminal guilt
The scavengers go on parade

The fathers who write that eternity
Is used to fight the sword
Have filled you up with the devil's cock
And he'll come in the name of the lord

The way to succeed and the way to suck eggs
