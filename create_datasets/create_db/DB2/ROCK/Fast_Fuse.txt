Oh baby, I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to love, just a city to abuse
Oh baby, I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to love, just a city to abuse

Oh, come get me, with your files don't arrest me
I'm Lucifer's child, wild, acids done
Black sunglasses shade the morning sun

So come get me, all you fuckers can't touch me
Well, I'm the hooligan choir, sire, so sit don't scatter
It don't matter get me one, two, three

Gold lighting in the skyline
Gold lighting in the sky

Oh baby, I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to love, just a city to abuse
Oh baby, I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to love, just a city to abuse

The vultures circle round
They wait above the ground

How dare you? Now it's time to address you
I'm the reason you came, shame, stroke my mane
See my fist chopping up your reign

It's getting hotter, now I'm spitting out lava
I'm the Spaniard in the works, jerks, genuine stock
Hear that bomb going tick, tick, tock

Gold lighting in the skyline
Gold lighting in the sky
Gold lighting in the skyline
Gold lighting in the sky

Oh baby, I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to love, just a city to abuse
In the middle of the night when they come for you
Who you going to be? What you gonna do?

Heaven may come and heaven may call but I won't be there
Heaven may come and heaven may call but I won't be there
Heaven may come and heaven may call but I won't be there
Heaven may come and heaven may call but I won't be there
