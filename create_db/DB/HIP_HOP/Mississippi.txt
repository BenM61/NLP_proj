Intro- David Banner

Know What I'm Talkin Bout
Mississippi mothafucka,
Newton County
What I live and die for (Scott County)
Ball for da kids (Simpson County)
Know what I'm talkin 'bout
Niggas out here flashin' and ballin' and shit (Lincoln County)
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm supposed to be so hard
Fuckin' rebel flags still flyin' (what's dis shit)
F*ck 'em
Some hoes

Chorus2x

We From A Place
Where Dem Boys Still Pimpin' Them Hoes
We From A Place
Cadillacs Still Ridin' On Vogues
We From A Place
Where My Soul Still Don't Feel Free
Where A Flag Means More Than Me(IN MISSISSIPPI)

Verse 1 David Banner

Still ridin' Cadillacs
Still bump in the back
Mothafuckas talk shit but we still in the hood
Mississippi in this thang
Pinky rang in my hand
Peanut butta top (lovin wood)
Crackas only come to buy crack
And cracka cops only come to bust niggas who sell that
We from a place where they scream
PIMP A HOE PIMP A HOE
We from a place where they still
CHOP DEM BOES CHOP DEM BOES
We from a place where yo Grandmama still showin' you love
And we still eatin' chicken in the club bitch

CHORUS 2X

VERSE 2- DAVID BANNER

We from a place
Where Medger Evers live and Medger Evers died
We from a place
What we chokin' on sticky green to get high
We from a place
Where ya used to come in the summatime
Now y'all don't mention us in ya rhyme we kin folk
Ya we broke
Some talk with a drawl but bitch we ball
Runnin through with two techs screamin F*CK ALL y'all
We From A Place
Where da rebel flag still ain't burnin
New schools but the black kids still ain't learnin BOUT SHIT
But hit da streets and learn to pimp on a bitch
FIVE-O aw shit throw yo crack in the ditch
And y'all nigga run y'all nigga run

They got pumps
And them crooked cops love to dump
