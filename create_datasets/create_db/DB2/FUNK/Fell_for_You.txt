Like a star, slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky, tumbling through space
When you touch my hand,
I swear I feel like I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Seems like I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)

Like a wheel whirling, round and round,
Rolling down a hill (rolling-down-a-hill)
Spinning on the ground
Your kisses make my dizzy
In the head and I'm falling,
(falling, falling, falling)
Falling
(falling, falling, falling)

Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you

I was a bird soaring, through the air
Flying fancy free, without a care
Until you clipped my wings
Now look at me
Oh, I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Yeah, falling
(falling, falling, falling)

Oh here I go, down and down I go
I can't help myself
Girl you thrill me so
Yeah you blew my mind
And I know, that I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Yes, I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)

Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you

Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
(seems like, seems like)
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl,
I think that I have fell for you
