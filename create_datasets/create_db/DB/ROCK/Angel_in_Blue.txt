We met in a bar
Out on Chesapeake Bay 
With her white patent boots
And her blouse red lame

A table top dancer
She would smile on cue
Oh those lips of an angel 
Angel in blue

She'd been dancin for ages
Through cities of bars
She was kickin' the habit 
Of scoring in cars

She'd been drained of her spirit
All caged up in this zoo
A wild cat angel
Angel in blue

And as she stared out into nowhere
I thought yes I thought she might break down and cry 
Oh when I whispered I thought I could love her

She just said, "Baby don't even bother to try"
And I watched as she spoke
Her words chilled my bones
All her friends did her favors

That were really just loans
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
Oh the palest of angels
Angel in blue

And the bees they had stung her
The birds they had flown
There were guys she could number
But none had she known

And she never had dreams 
So they never came true
Oh my fade away angel

Angel in blue
Angel in blue
Angel in blue
Angel in blue
