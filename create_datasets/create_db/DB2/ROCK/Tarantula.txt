I don't want to fight
Every single night
Everything I want is in your eyes
You and me go back
To places I don't know to care
The spoils of all I got were left for scraps
Don't let me say this
But you're no worse than me
It's crazy

We are as real if real ever was
Just because we are the real, they feel we have enough
We are the real 'cause someone gave us up

I wanna be there when you're happy
I wanna love you when you're sad
Can't stand the morning rain?
Get out, I'll take your place then
Can't stand the blazing sun?
Then close your eyes, you'll see
The angel dust

I don't wanna be anything believed
A million watts of sound can't compare
Come along, you'll see the world
The pulse ripples, the crowd unfurls
The current starts to flow, and then you're on

Oh, it's the white hot soul they want
To sing for

We are the real if real ever was
Just because we are the ruin of every living soul
We are surreal 'cause someone gave us up

Don't break the oath
I wanna love you when you're happy
Don't break this oath
I wanna be there when you're sad
Freeze-frame the pouring rain

We are the real, as real as any ghost
So easy now
We are the real in every living soul
Oh don't they know?

Can't stand the blazing sun?
Can't stand the morning rain?
Ah, get out, I'll take your place again
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone, at all

If it's a white hot soul they want
Then a black heart they'll get
