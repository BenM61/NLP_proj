I've got mountains of problems.
They all catch me off guard and
Start when I'm not looking.
They make noise when I'm sleeping.

I've got mountains of mistakes.
They all come back to haunt me.
Every fork in the road I didn't take
Has never once cut me a break.

So I'm leaving you for the man in the business suit.
My priorities and views are beginning askew.

Got a new code of ethics
Used to think was pathetic.
Now I'm reaping benefits
Out of all my new conquests.

Got a new way of speaking
Think it's rather ingenious.
(I'm in a mountain of three syllables or less
You really want to sound modest.)

So I'm leaving you for the man in the business suit.
He'll make all my dreams come true
Since I've got nothing to lose.
I've got nothing to lose.

Oh, I don't understand you weren't invited but you came.
And I can't comprehend how she still don't know my name.
It's still the same,
Nothing has changed.

I'm leaving you for the man in the business suit.
My priorities and views are beginning askew.
I'm leaving you for the man in the business suit.
He'll make all my dreams come true
Since I've got nothing to lose.
I've got nothing to lose
