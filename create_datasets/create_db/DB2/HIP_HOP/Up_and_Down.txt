Up and down, round and round it goes
Sometimes we just lose control
Up and down, round and round it goes
That's the way love goes
Girl, sometimes it drives me crazy
To know that love does not explain
Why it has me so confused
But I can't help but play its game
'Cause love has so many meanings
And girl you're everyone to me
That's why I'm so excited
Because you knock me off my feet, so girl

Up and down, round and round it goes
Sometimes we just lose control
Up and down, round and round it goes
That's the way love goes
Girl, sometimes it drives me crazy
To know that love does not explain
Why it has me so confused
But I can't help but play its game
'Cause love has so many meanings
And girl you're everyone to me
That's why I'm so excited
Because you knock me off my feet, so girl

Time will only give the answers
To the questions that I have
I want to know
Enough to get a chance to live it
With a girl who wants to be with me
The way I feel, I can't control
It is you I need girl, this I know
Your love is taking me up and down
That's why I'm going round and round

Up and down, round and round it goes
Sometimes we just lose control
Up and down, round and round it goes
That's the way love goes
Girl, sometimes it drives me crazy
To know that love does not explain
Why it has me so confused
But I can't help but play its game
'Cause love has so many meanings
And girl you're everyone to me
That's why I'm so excited
Because you knock me off my feet, so girl
