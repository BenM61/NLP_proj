Prove it, prove it, prove it, prove it to me

Prove
That it won't bother me
To become your used to be
Prove
That I can just ignore
All the love we shared before

Prove it to my starving heart (prove it to my starving heart)
Prove it now before we part (prove it now before we part)

Prove it, baby
Prove it, baby

Prove,
The loneliness I'll find
Will be only in my mind
Prove
That all these tears that fall
Aren't really tears at all

Prove that I don't want to die (prove that I don't want to die)
Now that you say, it's goodbye (now that you say, it's goodbye)

Prove it, baby
Prove it, baby

Before you walk out that door
Prove, I won't love you no more
Prove that I'll forget your kiss
In your arms, I'll never miss
Never miss
Now let me see you
Prove it
Just let me see you
Prove it

Prove, that I don't want to die
Now, that you say, it's goodbye

Prove it, baby
Prove it, baby

Let me see you
Prove it
Just let me see you
Prove it

Prove, that I don't want to die (prove that I don't want to die)
Now, that you say, it's goodbye, baby (now that you say, it's goodbye)

Prove it
Baby
Let me see you
Prove it

Prove it, prove it, prove it, prove it to me
