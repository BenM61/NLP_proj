All my lifetime I've done wrong 
Never thinking I belonged 
And my problems stay with me 
'Cause my thoughts lie with she 

She was my girlfriend though I was mean 
Always there in my hour of need 
I took for granted her gentleness 
And have to live without her sweet caress 

And as I light me a cigarette 
My heart is falling in my breast 
And as I lie me down to rest
There's a mountain of regret

I turn my back on her true love
All my friends and the lord above
And my drinking dragged me down
To the bars in Cabbage town

And as I light me a cigarette
My heart is falling in my breast
And as I lie me down to rest
There's a mountain of regret
 
And as I sit here feeling low
Wondering why she had to go
I know I see through my disgrace
The perfect beauty of her face

And as I light me a cigarette
My heart is falling in my breast
And as I lie me down to rest 
There's a mountain of regret
