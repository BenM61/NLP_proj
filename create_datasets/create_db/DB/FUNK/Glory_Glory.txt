I saw a child
He was carrying a light
I asked where it came from
He blew it right out
His eyes looked into me
His voice was a song
He said tell me tell me do you
Know where it's gone

Glory, glory
My eyes have seen the mountain
My soul can sing the song
Glory, glory
Singing Hallelujah
The truth is marching on

Every morn' the sun lights us all
The trees ask for nothing
They just let their fruit fall
Fire's the same no matter
What the source
The flame of life burns on
It's never, never lost
