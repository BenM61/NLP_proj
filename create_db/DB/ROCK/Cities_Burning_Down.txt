Trying to rise the water
It was a love that filled the sea
Dreamt it kept on rising
A haunted love was she

Dreamt of raging fires
Swept around the bend
Dreamt I had a nightmare

The cities burning down again
The cities burning down again

And the storm it kept on coming
All the while I saw the sun
Then the earth made a sound
And I heard it tempt me

The cities burning down again
The cities burning down again

So help me out please
So help me out please

Oh, I

Trying to rise the water
It was a love that filled the sea
Dreamt I had a nightmare

The cities falling down on me
The cities falling down on me
The cities burning down again
The cities burning down again
