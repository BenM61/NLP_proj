Now I wanna do it up (So big)
Party it up (So big)
Spend it up (So big)
So the whole world know my love for you (So big)
My heart is (So big)
My love is (So big)
For you,for you

Now was a girl like u, nothing u cant do
But give the whole world to her 24-7
When she looking so sweet that kind of body
You don't mind spending all of your time, time, time
And its not that you were asking me for nothing
I just wanna show you how deep my love is
