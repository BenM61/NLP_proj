All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey
I've been for a walk on a winters day
I'd be save and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreaming on such a winters day

Stepped into a church I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees and I began to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold he knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming on such a winters day

All the leaves a brown and the sky is grey
I've been for a walk on a winters day
If I didn't tell her I could leave today
California dreaming on such a winters day
On such a winters day, on such a winters day
