When day is done and shadows fall
I dream of you
When day is done, I think of all the joys we knew

That yearning, returning to hold you in my arms
Won't go love, I know love
Without you night has lost it's charms

When day is done and grass is wet
With twilight's dew
My lonely heart is sinking with the sun

Although I miss your tender kiss
The whole day through
I miss you most of all when day is done

Although I miss your tender kiss
The whole day through
I miss you most of all when day is done
