Sleep, my love
Dream on in heart and true
In pieces
In colors
In a cloud of awkward blue
Hold my hand
Feel the things you tell your man
Move through you
So easy
This knife that cuts me through

And you bring me your charms
In the cool of your soft little hands
In the heat of your legs and arms
You bring me your charms

In my eyes
In the circle of my eyes
With my baby
My lover
That is warm and heart and true

When you bring me your charms
In the cover of all evening sheets
In the twist of all things and arms
You bring me your charms

In my eyes
In the circle of my eyes
With my baby
My lover
That is warm and heart and true

When you bring me your charms
In the cover of all evening sheets
In the twist of all things and arms
You bring me your charms

Oh, you bring me your charms
You bring me your charms
Oh, you bring me your charms
Oh, you bring me your charms
You bring me your charms
You bring me your charms
Bring me your charms
Bring me your charms
Bring me your charms
Bring me your charms
