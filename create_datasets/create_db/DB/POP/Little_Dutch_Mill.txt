Far across the sea in Holland
In the land of wooden shoes
There's a story nearly everyone knows

You may never be in Holland
So I know you will excuse
If here and now I tell you how it goes

There's a little Dutch mill
On a little Dutch hill
Where the little Dutch stars shine bright

Now a little Dutch boy
And his little Dutch Girl
Fell in love by the mill one night

Up above, the Dutch moon made the scene complete
They both had so much moon, that it was a real Dutch treat

So the little Dutch boy and the little Dutch girl
Bought the little Dutch mill on the little Dutch hill
And they've added a touch of a little Dutch family

Up above, the Dutch moon made the scene complete
They both had so much moon, that it really was a real Dutch treat

So the little Dutch boy and the little Dutch girl
Bought the little Dutch mill on the little Dutch hill
And added a touch of a little Dutch family
