Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

When the music calls, it's like your ten feet tall
A song can take you far away from day to day

Let's drink to it, hold to it
(Burn hard today, today get smart)
Let's refine and free fine and moonshine
(Smart as a fox)

Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

I know the world has changed
But some things are the same
Like COD's and SOB's and ABC's

Let's drink to it, hold to it
(Burn hard today, today get smart)
Let's refine and free fine and moonshine
(Smart as a fox)

Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

Burn hard, slap your bass
Burn hard, slap your bass

Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard
Work out, work out
Brahms gonna do the charm
Slap your bass, burn hard, burn hard

Burn hard today, today get smart
Smart as a fox, a fox you say

Burn hard, slap your bass
