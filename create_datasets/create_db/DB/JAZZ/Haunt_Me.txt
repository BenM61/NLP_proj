Haunt me 
In my dreams 
If you please 
Your breath is with me now and always 
It's like a breeze 

So should you ever doubt me 
If it's help that you need 
Never dare to doubt me 

And if you want to sleep 
I'll be quiet 
Like an angel 
As quiet as your soul could be 
If you only knew 
You had a friend like me

So should you ever doubt me 
If it's help that you need 
Never dare to doubt me
