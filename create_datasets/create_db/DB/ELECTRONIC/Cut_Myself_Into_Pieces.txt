15 minutes to show
And 15 more days to go
I feel like a cake and every night I cut
A piece out for you

So don't tell me that you're hungry
I know you are, but I am too
I won't tell you what I want
But I'll tell you what I won't do

Oh no, I won't cut myself into pieces
For no one
Oh no, I won't do it for you
Won't cut myself into pieces

So look here, here I stand
With that cake in my hand
And hungry hearts are the only thing
That a man like me can't stand

Don't tell me that you're hungry
I know you are, but I am too
I won't tell you what I want
But I'll tell you what I won't do

Oh no, I won't cut myself into pieces
For no one
Oh no I won't do it for you

Oh no, I won't cut myself into pieces
For no one
Oh no, I won't do it for you
Cut myself into pieces
Cut myself into pieces

No, I won't do that
Cut myself into pieces
