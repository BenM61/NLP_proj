There's not a hope
While you're in this kind of mood
Too much to drink
But not enough to lose
You tore me apart
Now I've got to suffer
I wish I'd been around when you started this

Give me a chance
I'd show you what I could do
You're in a trance
And I'm not so fond of you
You may be a friend
But you're not my relation
But you're the only person I ever knew

And it's too late to wash my hands
We're caught in a trap
Set for a man

There is a wind
That blows in the northern skies
Holding me back
No matter how hard I try
If I had the sense
I'd leave here tomorrow
I wouldn't even bother to say goodbye

But it's too late to wash my hands
We're caught in a trap
Set for a man

Would you lie to me
If you thought I was wrong
You deserted me
When it all went wrong
Would you lie to me
Would you lie to me

Would you lie to me
If you thought I was wrong
You deserted me
When it all went wrong

But it's too late to wash my hands
We're caught in a trap
Set for a man
