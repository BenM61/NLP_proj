I want to thank your folks
For making you as sweet as you are,
How else can I express how I feel,
Assess and reveal all my love?
I want to thank your folks
For making you the dream that you are,
And tell them what a swell job they've done
Of raising the one I love.

Do you recall the birthday party they gave you
When we were just a couple of kids?
Well suppose they haven't thought of inviting me too,
See what I'd have missed?

And here's my thanks to you
For making all my love dreams come true.
But darling, to be perfectly frank,
I really must thank your folks.

And here's my thanks to you
