Stuck in a laundromat
Clutchin' a photograph of you
God knows who's ready
God don't know you

The blame won't change autumn days
When the sky is fallin'
Hey, hey, don't waste one more day
Love the sky fallin'

Life in the aftermath
Walking on broken glass, my friends
Try walking steady and straight ahead

'Cause the blame won't change autumn days
When the sky is fallin'
Hey, hey, don't waste one more day
Love the sky fallin'

If you want it, if you like
If you want it, if you tried
If you want it love you better run for your life
If you want it because I try
If you want it because you lie
If you want it love you better run

'Cause the blame won't change autumn days
When the sky is fallin'
Hey, hey, don't waste one more day
Love the sky fallin'
