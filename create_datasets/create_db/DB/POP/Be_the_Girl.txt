you look at me
curious what i'm made of
sugar or steel
and what kind of man i love
what i believe
what i know and what i crave
all my pet peeves
where i've shed and when i stain
do you know

'cause i'm not here to be around
and be that girl that you forget about
'cause all i want is just to be a song
that you can feel longer than just right now
so come on baby let me be the girl
that you can count on to rock your world
and then you'll see there's so much than curves
and then you'll see that you and me belong

do you know my vice
and how to get under my skin
just what i like
and where i want you to begin
do you know my middle name
and where i'm sensitive the most
that each night i pray
and do you think i fit that mold
do you know

'cause i'm not here to be around
and be that girl that you forget about
'cause all i want is just to be a song
that you can feel longer than just right now
so come on baby let me be the girl
that you can count on to rock your world
and then you'll see there's so much than curves
and then you'll see that you and me belong

you and me belong
you and me belong

'cause i'm not here to be around
and be that girl that you forget about
'cause all i want is just to be a song
that you can feel longer than just right now
so come on baby let me be the girl
that you can count on to rock your world
and then you'll see there's so much than curves
and then you'll see that you and me belong
you and me belong
you and me belong
