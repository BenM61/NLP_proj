Sweet one, fairer than the flowers,
Never will I meet one sweeter than you.
Would you turn away or could you
Really every care, 
If I'd ever dare to say, 
"I Love you."

If the nightingales could sing like you,
They'd sing much sweeter than they do,
For you brought a new kind of love to me.

If the Sandman brought me dreams of you,
I'd want to sleep my whole life through,
For you brought a new kind of love to me.

I know that you're the queen, and I'm the slave,
And yet you will understand
That underneath it all 
You're a maid, and I am only a man.

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you;
For you brought a new kind of love to me.
