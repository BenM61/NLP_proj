I'm
Just sittin' here wonderin'

The world's gone to hell
And we blame someone else
For the trouble we're in
In a big easy chair
At the T.V we stare
While the world caves in

And it ain't no wonder, that we don't get a break
It's so easy to find someone else's mistakes

Give me a shovel
I'm gonna dig all night
Give me a hammer
I'm gonna chisel for light
Love is the thing
Makes the world go round
Come here, darlin'
I wanna take you down

I'm
just sittin' here wonderin'

There's too many hearts
Too many miles apart
And they can't give up
And no one can win
There's just too many bends
On the river of love

And it ain't no wonder, that we don't get a break
It's so easy to find someone else's mistakes

Give me a shovel
I'm gonna dig all night
Give me a hammer
I'm gonna chisel for light
Love is the thing
Makes the world go round
Come here darlin'
I wanna take you down

Well, if you ever get down
In a hole in the ground
You gotta dig

If you're walkin' the streets
Hungry and beat
You gotta dig

On your own
Away from home
You gotta dig, you better dig

Breakin' your back
Ballin' the jack
You Gotta dig

Give me a shovel
I'm gonna dig all night
Give me a hammer
I'm gonna chisel for light
Love is the thing
Makes the world go round
Come here darlin'
I wanna take you down
