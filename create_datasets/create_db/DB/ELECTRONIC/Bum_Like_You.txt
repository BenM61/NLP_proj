You're always up to no good
Your fingers in my cookie jar
You can have my checkbook, visa and my master card too
Ain't no price to high for what you do

You could be my dog
I would push your bail-bonds when cash was tight
We could fall in love
I could be the apple of your eye
Let's do it right now

My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you
My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you

Your car's a dump and you're broke
But that's all right
I never liked them fancy guys
You don't even look good
God it ain't right
But your story's acting out of sight

you could fall apart
I would push your bail-bonds when cash was tight
We could fall in love
I could be the apple of your eye
Let's just do it right now

My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you
My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on you

My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you
My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you

You're always up to no good
You catch on like a bonfire
Every single worn out line is shiny and new
I never met a sweeter liar

You could be my king
I'd would knit you mittens and make you pie
We could fall in love
I could be the apple of your eye
Let's just do it right now

My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you
My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you

My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you
My new favorite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you
Is wasting my time on a bum like you

Is wasting my time on a bum like you
