Staring at the ceiling 
I've been California dreaming
Oh, I just can't get you off my mind
Can hold back the feeling, yeah 
I got a small addiction 
to the way you look into my eyes

So California 
So California 

You're so California, -fornia, -fornia
You're so California, -fornia, -fornia
You're so California, -fornia, -fornia

So California

You're so California, -fornia, -fornia
You're so California, -fornia, -fornia
You're so California, -fornia, -fornia

So California

Staring at the ceiling
