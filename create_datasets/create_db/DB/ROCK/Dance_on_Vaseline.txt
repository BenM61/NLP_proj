I'm taking back the knowledge
I'm taking back the gentleness
I'm taking back the ritual
I'm giving in to sweetness

Oh preacher man
Shoot me with your poison arrow
But I dance on Vaseline
I'm trippin' out
Workin' on a revolution
Gon' let the music in

I'm taking back the children
I'm taking back the ceremony
I'm taking back my offerings
I'm taking back what you mean to me

You're dangerous!
Shoot me with your poison arrow
But I dance on Vaseline
I'm slippin' out
Workin' on a revolution
Go'n let the music in

And war is all around us
The Gods are dead and buried underground
Your hollow Gods are burried underground
I was a silly putty
Your big ideas are useless to me now

My baby saw the future
She doesn't want to live there any more
It's lousy science fiction
Gets on your skin and seeps into your bones

You're dangerous!
Shoot me with your poison arrow
But I dance on Vaseline
I'm slippin' out
Workin' on a revolution
Go'n let the music in

Started in Oklahoma
You always think it happens somewhere else
This madness is attractive
Until the day it happens to yourself

& Power might seem sexy
But check her in the cool grey light of dawn
A legislative body
And all at once your lust for her is gone

& I'm trippin out
Workin on a revolution
Gon' let the day begin

We'll turn it out
Monkey time for evolution
Gon' let the music in
