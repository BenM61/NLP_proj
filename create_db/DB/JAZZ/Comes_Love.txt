Come a rain storm put your rubbers on your feet,
Comes a snow storm you can get a little heat;
Comes love nothing can be done.
Comes a fire then you know just what to do,
Blow a tire You can buy another shoe,
Comes love nothing can be done.
Don't try hidin' 'cause there isn't any use,
You'll start slidin' when your heart turns on the juice.
Comes a headache you can lose it in a day,
Comes a toothache see the dentist right away;
Comes love nothing can be done!

Comes a heat wave you can hurry to the shore,
Comes a summons you can hide behind the door;
Comes love Nothing can be done.
Comes the measles you can quarantine the room,
Comes a mousie you can chase it with a broom;
Comes love nothing can be done.
That's all brother, If you've ever been in love,
That's all brother, you know what I'm speaking of!
Comes a nightmare you can always stay awake,
Comes depression you may get another break;
Comes love nothing can be done!
