Give blood
But you may find that blood is enough
Give blood
And there are some who'll say it's not enough
Give blood
But don't expect too ever see reward
Give blood
You can give it all but still asked for more

Give blood
But it could cost more than your dignity
Give blood
Parade your pallor in iniquity
Give blood
They will cry and say they're in our debt
Give blood
But then they'll sigh and they will soon forget

(man in background)
where heading for the day of blessings I'm telling ya,
Its all building up to something,
Something that's opening beginning with fire

So give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers

Give blood
But you may find that blood is not enough
Give blood
And there are some who'll say it's not enough
Give blood
But don't expect too ever see reward
Give blood
You can give it all but still asked for more

So give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers

Give your love and keep blood between brothers
Give your love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
Give love and keep blood between brothers
