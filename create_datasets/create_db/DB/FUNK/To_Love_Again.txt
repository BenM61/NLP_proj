When you smiled as if you knew me
There was nothing else that I could do
Without a word I tried to follow you
And it was good for me to know
That I could try to love again

And the feeling running through me
I remember from another time
I could even leave this world behind
And it was good for me to know
That I could try to love again

Wouldn't it be fine just to believe
Wouldn't it be wonderful
If life were like a song
And all the magic and the peace
That lovers feel could last forever
If only this time it were real
But memory in silence only fades away

So I woke up to reality
And all the life that no one wants to see
And how could I afford the fantasy
But if was good for me to know
That I could try to love again, to love again

Wouldn't it be fine if all the magic and the peace
That lovers feel could last forever
If only this time it were real
But memory in silence only fades away
To love again

When you smiled as if you knew me
There was nothing else that I could do
Without a word I tried to follow you
And it was good for me to know
That I could try to love again
