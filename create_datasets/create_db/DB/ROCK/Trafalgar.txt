I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope 
I need someone to know me and to show me 
The square peg fits the hole 
Why haven't I been told? 
I need someone to know me and to show me 
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar, please don't let me down 

Ten hundred people roam through the place I call me home 
I need someone to know me and to show me 
Sitting cross-legged on my own and yet I'm not alone 
Don't need no one to show me 
No one owns me 
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar 
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar, please don't let me down 

Trafalgar
Trafalgar
