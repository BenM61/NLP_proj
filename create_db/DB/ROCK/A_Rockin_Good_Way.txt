[Bonnie:]
 If you're gonna give me good kisses like that
 Honey don't you know I'm gonna give 'em right back
 Cause that's a kissin' good way
 That's a kissin' good way
 That's a kissin' good way to mess around and fall in love
Shaky: If you're gonna start out hugging me tight
Bonnie: Right
Shaky: Don't mess around come and hug me right
 Cause that's a huggin' good way
 That's a huggin' good way
 That's a huggin' good way to mess around and fall in love
Bonnie: You know you called me on the phone
Shaky: Yeah I got your number
Bonnie: And just because I was alone
 Ah, you came around a-wooing
Shaky: Why not?
Bonnie: You better ask somebody if you don't
know what you're doing
Shaky: Now that you've kissed me and you
 rocked my soul
 Don't come around knockin' rock and roll
 Cause that's a rocking good way
 That's a rockin' good way
 That's a rocking good way to mess
around and fall in love
Bonnie: Tell me Baby
Shaky: Well, now you called me on the phone
Bonnie: Yeah baby
Shaky: And just because I was alone
 You came around a-wooing
 You better ask somebody if you don't
 know what you're doing
Bonnie: Now that you've kissed me and you
rocked my soul
Shaky: I love you so
Bonnie:Don't come around knockin' rock and roll
 Cause that's a rockin' good way
 That's a rockin' good way
 That's a rockin' good way
 to mess around and fall in love
Bonnie: It's a rockin' good way
Shaky: It's a rockin' good way
Both: It's a rockin' good way
to mess around and fall in love
