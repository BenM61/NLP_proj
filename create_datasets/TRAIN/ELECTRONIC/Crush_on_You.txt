How did you know 'cause I never told
You found out,
Ive got a crush on you
No more charades,
My hearts been displayed,
You found out,
Ive got a crush on you

You must have heard it
From my best friend
Shes always talkin' when she should be listenin'
Cant keep a secret
To save her life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside
I never knew, a rumor could spread so fast
(cause now the) Word is out!
All over town
That I'm longing for you

How did you know If i never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades,
My hearts been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face
One little emotion so easily read
That you would know my love before a word was said 
Was it my eyes that let you know you had control
Because the way you move
It was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender!

How did you know If i never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades,
My hearts been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Ooh

How did you know If i never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades,
My hearts been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you
