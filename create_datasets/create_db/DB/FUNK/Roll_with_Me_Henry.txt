Hey, baby, what do I have to do
To make you love me too

You've got to roll with me, Henry
(Alright, baby)
Roll with me, Henry
(Don't mean maybe)

Roll with me, Henry
(Any ole time)
Roll with me, Henry
(Don't change my mind)

Roll with me, Henry
(Alright)
You better roll it
While the rollin' is on
Roll on, roll on, roll on

While the cats are ballin'
You better stop your stallin'
It's intermission in a minute
So you better get with it

Roll with me, Henry
You better roll it
While the rollin' is on
Roll on, roll on, roll on

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, wee
Henry, you ain't movin' me
You better feel that boogie beat
And get the lead out of your feet

Roll with me, Henry
Roll with me, Henry
Roll with me, Henry
Roll with me, Henry

Roll with me, Henry
You better roll it
While the rollin' is on
Roll on, roll on, roll on, roll on

Roll with me, Henry
(Alright, baby)

Well, I ain't teasin'
(Talk to me, baby)
You better stop your freezin'
(Alright, mama)

If you want romancin'
(Okay, sugar)
You better learn some dancin'
(Mmm hmm, mmm hmm)

Roll with me, Henry
(Alright mama)
You better roll it
While the rollin' is on
Roll on, roll on, roll on

Roll with me, Henry
(Alright, baby)
Roll with me, Henry
(Don't mean maybe)

Roll with me, Henry
(Any ole time)
Roll with me, Henry
(Don't change my mind)

Roll with me, Henry
(Alright)
You better roll it
While the rollin' is on

Roll with me, Henry
(Alright, baby)
Roll with me, Henry
(Alright, baby)
