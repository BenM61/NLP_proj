"An open microphone can be dangerous"

(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)
I can be that threat that make you change your life
(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)

(Verse 1: WC)
It's about f***in' time
N****z ta came up with some real s***
And start bustin'on you b**** n****z and kill some s***
High shells and c***tails, rags on faces
A terrorist f***in' it up in chucks with fat laces
In my cutoffs I stand with triggery canon
Nah b****, I ain't from the Taliban I'm from the n****ban
Westside, roll 'em motherf***ers up
Call me Dub McVeigh about to blow this motherf***er up

(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)
I can be that threat that make you change your life
(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)

(Verse 2: Mack 10)
We got you n****z scared like a snitch and a gangsta cook out
And when the meter read red all cowards get took out
Back with more firepower than before
To us a nuclear bombin' is just a drug war
And I got no gangstarism and stardom
And got n****z shakin' that ain't even from Harlem
Spit rapid fire down in the whole place
And it's hard to breathe with duck tape on your face

(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)
I can be that threat that make you change your life
(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)

(Verse 3: Ice Cube)
I'm from that WSCG car
Beat you up in ER from my PR
N****, superstar, smokin' on a cigar
Little homies know who the OG's are
Been the s*** since '86 and even right now
And gotta brag to this b****es 'bout my lifestyle
No mistake the westsider for Al-Quieda
This ain't super-fly n**** I'm a spider

(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)
I can be that threat that make you change your life
(Duck n****, west-coast)
I can make a promise now to take your life
(West-side, bustin' that janky...)
