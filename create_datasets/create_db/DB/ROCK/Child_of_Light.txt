You came out from nowhere like the first star at night
And the world went on like it never saw you come
Your mother felt something and your father wasn't there
But she raised you best she could for a poor man's son

Shame, she never realized the light in your eyes
You're a child of light
You were born into a world that lives in darkness
You're a child of light
And you wear the thorn, anymore than man

As you grow old and wiser, you keep more to yourself
And when you are aware, your body glows
Keep a look to here, as you're walking through the night
They're hoping you might be the Holy Ghost

Do they ever understand the light in your eyes?
You're a child of light
You were born into a world that lives in darkness
You're a child of light
And you wear the thorn, anymore than man

Will they ever understand the light in your eyes?
You're a child of light
Being born into a world that lives in darkness
You're a child of light
And you wear the thorn, anymore than man
A child of light, child of light

Can't you see, child of light
That the world needs you tonight?
