I'm a bit unstable, she said 
With a Cheshire grin 
So many cracks in my sidewalk, boy 
Don't you fall in. 

Feels like the things that I've wanted 
The most in this life 
I can't have 
So you see I've been damning the world 
Before it damns me 

She said I'm naked and shameless 
And I'm peeling back the layers 
Like an onion girl 

Don't try to save me 
Just stay away 
'Cause I might make you cry 
Like an onion girl 
Like an onion girl 

Second grade playground 
I still haven't the nerve 
Fear is under my skin 
Like St. Anthony's fire 
And I can't stand the burn
Yeah 

So let's break a little bread, have a little laugh
I haven't laughed for a while 
'Cause it's a long road back, yes
From the womb tonight 

I'm naked, shameless 
And peeling back the layers 
Like an onion girl 

Don't try to save me 
Just stay away 
'Cause I might make you cry, yes
Like an onion girl 
Like an onion girl 

She said I'm naked, shameless 
And I'm peeling back the layers 
Like an onion girl 

Don't try to save me 
Just stay away 
'Cause I might make you cry 
Like an onion girl 

She said I'm naked and shameless 
And peeling back the layers
Like, like an onion girl 

Don't try to save me 
Just stay away 
'Cause I might make you cry 
Like an onion girl 
Like an onion girl, yeah
Like an onion girl
