My mama told me, when I was just a child 
She always knew that I'll be a superstar 
You got just what it takes to go that extra mile 
Just keep believing and baby you'll go far

I got to working I was
So damn determined to make
My way to stardom
I get on the case
Packed up and left home hit the
Road all on my own with no
No one to lean on
I was on the way

Aim High
Till you reach beyond the sky
You gotta try
Don't let this moment pass you by
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit

My eyes were open to opportunity
I held my hands up never let 'em get past me
I took my chances to be all I could be
Cope with my sadness, anything to live my dreams

I kept on climbing so that
I kept on shining now it's
It's perfect timing to take on the world
No time for wasting to reach
My destination I'll be
Fantasy chasing still I'm number one

Aim High
Till you reach beyond the sky
You gotta try
Don't let this moment pass you by
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit

Don't hesitate
It'll be okay
You've got it made
Don't give up
Gotta feel it in your bones
To know where you belong
It's been part of you all belong

Aim High
Till you reach beyond the sky
You gotta try
Don't let this moment pass you by
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
The sky ain't the limit
Spread your wings and fly
The sky ain't the limit
