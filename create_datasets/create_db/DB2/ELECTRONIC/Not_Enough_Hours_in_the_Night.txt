I've got so much I want to say
I've got so much I wanna do
There never seems to be enough
Time to be with you

So (Incomprehensible) moments in your arms
And when the moment's here and gone
I'm just missing you
It's not fair when the morning comes
And the night must end, oh, I can't wait to
Hold you again 'cause there's just

Not enough hours in the night to hold you
Not enough hours in you arms
To show you the love I feel inside
There's just not enough time to love you
Not enough, not enough

I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna look into your eyes
I want to spend the rest of time
Making love to you

Oh baby, I loved you so much
No time is ever (Incomprehensible) enough to be close to you
It's not right when the moon light fade
And the kisses end, oh, I can't
Wait to kiss you again, yeah

Not enough hours in the night to hold you
Not enough hours in your arms
To show you the love I feel inside
There's just not enough time

Not enough minutes in the day
Not enough to tell you that I love you
Not enough time to do the things
Things I wanna do, yeah
Not enough hours in the night to love

If I can stop the clock
Every kiss would last forever
If I can spend forever here by your side
Still wouldn't be enough time for you and I, no

Not enough hours in the night to hold you
Not enough hours in you arms
I wanna show you, baby, the way I feel inside
There's just not enough time

Not enough minutes in the day
Not enough time to do the things
Things I do, yeah
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough kisses in the moon light
Not enough hours in the night

Not enough, not enough
Feel with me, baby
Not enough, not enough
(Incomprehensible)
Oh, I'll be runnin' through the time
Hey, you know you're mine
You're mine, you're mine, you're mine, baby
