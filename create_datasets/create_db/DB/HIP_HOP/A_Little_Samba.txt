This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)
This is just a little samba

Yo man, I'm living grandiose, puffin on an Ambassador
Paid in full, kill the bull, like a matador
Flash the cash, make my album cover shinier
My head's spinning like a discus, and if this is (Just a little samba)
Then I'm straight, with the seven-course meal on my plate
I put my leftovers in the doggie bag
I got moves like Mr. Miyagi had
With the "wax off, wax on," I'll play you like Zaxxon
Girls love my songs, sunbathing on the back lawn
"Ju-look-mahvellous"
C'mon young lady, get in the car with us, superstar deluxe (hey!)
I'm always animated cause my game's so tight, that I keep it laminated
Well, if that's true, why you living with ya mama?
Shh! It's just a little samba

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)
This is just a little samba

Yo, I make all the mon-ay
No you don't
I get all the girls
No you don't!
I put it down on fools!
No you don't (huh?)
No you don't (man)
No you don't!

You might spot me in Versace suits
When I'm at award shows paparazzi shoot
I own a fly home, four-car garage
With rides for me and my entourage
Hold up, I got a email
It's a female
Girls pressing on me like Lee Nail
I make the hits that you hear on the jukebox (so?)
Chicks come hotter than Arizona rooftops

I got this one, she's a Playmate
When I met her she was looking at my gold Dizzy nameplate
But I had to vacate, I said "I'm gonna miss our date cause my plane's late" (Plane?)
Yeah, I own a plane and I also bought a yacht
So I scuba in Bermuda when the weather gets hot
And I travel a lot
The why you livin' with ya mama?
Man, it's just a little samba!

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)
This is just a little samba

I make all the money
No you don't
I get all the girls
No you don't!
I got my own sitcom!
No you don't (huh?)
No you don't (what?)
No you don't!
I star in the movies
No you don't
I run my own label
No you don't
Man, I only date models
No you don't (huh?)
No you don't (hey?)
No you don't!

Man, I got more property than Monopoly
No you don't

Man, I drive a flying car!
No, no you don't
Man, I got two pet sharks,
Your mom lets you have sharks in the house?
Man, ge, wha?
C'mon man, the song's over man, you don't have to front anymore
