A new bad girl, who get on my block
I gave her my keys, said don't bother to knock
I said c'mon, ya got what I need
I said come on, don't make my heart bleed

(I'm beggin')
Whoa bad girl, whatcha tryin' to do
What is the matter with you
Bad girl what are you tryin' to do

Cause I'm early in the mornin', not too late at night
And you're tryin' to tell me everything's alright
Then you're gonna ask am I gonna take it slow
I said don't you worry there's no place to go
(My bad girl)

I'm walkin' to the corner, to go in th cafe
That's when I seen her, a'walkin' my way
She's all dolled up, in her waitress' skirt
I said c'mon, don't make my heart hurt

(I'm beggin')

And you can keep the change
All you gotta do is get down in my range
If you're gonna ask me am I gonna take it slow
