How could they leave you standing
Holding on to the air
Never a hope of landing
Didn't they know you cared
You're finding out
It's never quite like it seems
You're finding out
It's never quite like it dreams
Didn't you get connected
When things were still upside down
Feeling somewhat neglected
Turning the tide around
It keeps coming up you again
You're never to hard to find
It keeps coming up you again
They're taking up all your time
It keeps coming up you
Coming up you again
However you want to take it
With streamers of violet
If only you could forsake it
It stifles your etiquette
