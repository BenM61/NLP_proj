The pressure
It is so great
It's hard to put your foot on the break
'Cause nobody wants to get left behind
You have no choice but to get trapped in the grind

Slow down kid
I know it's hard for you
You always want to rush things
But it takes time so never mind
Those get-rich-quick schemes
They wouldn't be dreams
If they were easy to achieve

Life is crooked
You know that by now
A nice straight line has yet to be found
You don't have to move
Like the people around you do
What are you trying to prove?

Slow down kid
I know it's hard for you
You always want to rush things
But it takes time so never mind
Those get-rich-quick schemes
They wouldn't be dreams
If they were easy to achieve

You always want to rush things
(Slow down)
You always want to rush things

Slow down kid
I know that's hard for you
But that's something you've gotta do
