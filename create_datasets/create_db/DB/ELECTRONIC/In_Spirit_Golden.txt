Fall into flames and you won't do it again,
You've learned a lesson that you've never been taught so.
Crawl into blame that you will never reclaim
It is a blessing that you'll never get caught, oh

But underneath we are golden,
Hold them, we made them.
Our hearts beat control them
Too fast,
too fast for me tonight.

I've seen souls in spirit golden
And I've seen souls in spirit gold
Now I've cleaned myself from that unsettling light
It was too bright for me and the love in my life
But if you capture me I'll be within your sight
It was too bright for me,
It was too bright tonight
It was too bright tonight

Before the insults and post the praise
You are the subject of a sugarcoat crosshair.
During the shell shock of a crystal maze
You are important at your opening funfair.

However underneath we are golden
So hold them we saved them
Our heartbeats control them
They're too fast,
Too fast for me tonight.

I've seen souls in spirit golden
And I've seen souls in spirit gold
Now I've cleaned myself from that unsettling light
It was too bright for me and the love in my life
But if you capture me I'll be within your sight
It was too bright for me,
It was too bright tonight
It was too bright tonight

Here by a circus on this moonlit night,
With the lukewarm light is not too frightening.
Here by a settle at the starboard side
If you only vouch for me
On this golden night,
on this golden night,
Oh my burning eyes

I see souls in spirit golden
I see souls in spirit gold
Now that I've cleaned myself from that unsettling light
It was too bright for me and the love in my life
But if you capture me
I'll be within your sight
It was too bright for me
It was too bright tonight
