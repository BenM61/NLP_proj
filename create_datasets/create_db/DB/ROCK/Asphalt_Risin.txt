I've got a full board
On a frame in the yard
I've got a half grown
And I ain't going far
With a hurst shift
Gettin' me into four
And a hand full
I'll be needin' more
Of a super sea
A super sea
A super sea is what I need
A super sea
A super sea
A super sea is what I need
Straight off the line
I'm better every time
I pulled a left lane
I supercharged it fine
I took a fourth try
To a star at right
I pushed a button for
A ride into the sky
With a super sea
A super sea
A super sea is what I need
A super sea
A super sea
A super sea is what I need
I've got a full board
On a frame in the yard
I've got a half grown
And I ain't going far
With a hurst shift
Gettin' me into four
And a hand full
I'll be needin' more
