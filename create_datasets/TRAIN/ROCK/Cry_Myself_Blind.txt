I've seen their faces, at different places
They mingle with the crowds or hide away

Two slimy creatures, suspicious features
In camouflage they're waiting to attack
They start their mission in sound and vision
And drag their victims to the hill of fear

Don't tell me I'm insane
I've seen this human slaughter
And there will come the day
We'll have to leave our vale

Hear our cry
Is there someone who can help us
Why tell me why
Do they bring us to a place called
Tunderdome - Tunderdome

In disaffection we watch the action
We take for granted what we're living for
But unexpected and not accepted
Their power is increasing more and more

Don't tell me I'm insane
I've seen this human slaughter
And there will come the day
We'll have to leave our vale

Hear our cry
Is there someone who can help us
Why tell me why
Do they bring us to a place called

Tunderdome - Tunderdome
Tunderdome - Tunderdome

I smell the rotten bodies
No one's left, everything's so muddy
Give me hope to survive my future
Is this place diseased by creatures

Hear our cry
Is there someone who can help us
Why tell me why
Do they bring us to a place called
