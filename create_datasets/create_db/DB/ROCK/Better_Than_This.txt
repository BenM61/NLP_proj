Help me, could something so right?
Be so tainted a brief intermission
Between feeling and reason
I promise beneath the shrink wrap
And the price tag there's something
Worth your while at least there used to be

Believe in me
Believe in love
Believe in anything
That's better than this

I want You but I just can't ask You
'Cause I don't even know You now
(Want to know You)
Caught in this tailspin and I'm blinded by my sin
And I still don't know You now
(Want to know You)

I'm writing a book but it's got no pages
'Cause You were all I had to say
And I guess, I have walked away from You
I'm too slow, there's God on the phone
Well, leave a message and I'll get back to You soon

Don't believe in me
Please believe in love
Believe in God
It's better than this

I want You and I want to love You
'Cause I don't even know You now
(Want to know You)
I need this and I'm praying for it
But I still don't know You now
(Want to know You)

I want You, I need this
(Want to know You)
And I am praying for it
I still, I don't know You
(Want to know You)

Now
(Want to know You)
Now
(Want to know You)

I wanna bleed, I wanna see
I wanna know You
I wanna know You
I wanna know You
I wanna
