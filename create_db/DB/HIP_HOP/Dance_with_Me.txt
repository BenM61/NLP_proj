Too much is on your mind
Gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time
Just let it flow
Say you need a break
There's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you
Baby, what's this you tell me
Things ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

Dance the night away
Party 'til the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
Dance
Dance with me
Dj if you please

Nobody's on the wall
That's what I like
Come closer to me now and hold me tight
Tell me just how you're feeling right now
Are you really havin' a good time
Baby, what's this you tell me
Thing's ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

Dance the night away
Party 'til the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
Dance
Dance with me
Dj if you please

Just let yourself go (Go)
Dance on the floor (On the floor)
Your body is stopping you (Stopping you)
Do what you wanna do
Let the music take control
If you feel it in your soul
Come on and move your body to the groove

Up in the club (The club)
Out on the floor(The floor)
Move to the beat
(Come and move your body come and move your body)
Dancin' with me
Dj, DJ, play my music
Dance the night away

Just let yourself go (Self go)
Dance on the floor (On the floor)
Your body is stopping you (Stopping you)
Do what you wanna do
Let the music take control
If you feel it in your soul (In you soul)
Come on and move your body to the groove

Dance the night away
Party 'til the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
Dance
Dance with me
Dj if you please
Dance the night away
Party 'til the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
Dance
Dance with me
Dj if you please
