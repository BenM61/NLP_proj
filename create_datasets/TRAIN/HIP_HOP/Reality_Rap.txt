One hand wash the other, I never shit on my niggas
I roll with them niggas that be pulling them triggers
I rep the dead and the living
We the best that did it, expenses we spend it
Big faces explosive guns we smash out dunns
IM three coming through make way what you wanna do
Choose the fifth or get popped with the fifth
Either way you got no ends, I represent QB
The biggest hood in the world, there's too many of us
It's too easy to get touched
Catch you at a show take your 'dro take your ice
Catch you on the island while you rocking on the mic
Sending kites from down south
Cut that nigga from head to his mouth
He violated in the streets
Fronted like he wanted beef
Now it's a wrap, duke rather hang it up
We the mob we ain't no gang 
But we bang niggas up

Besides rap I blaze niggas up
My ox shit, my mutton chops
Ice pick their guts never gon' na stop
All your mans is gonna watch
Free performance on the block
Meantime invest in rocks buy and sell stocks
Uno, dos is papi to connect
With my eyes on your neck
Your jewels extra large like stretch I'll show you my strength
Fiends get their check on the first
Be gone by the second the third they 
Come on stolen shit begging for seconds
I ain't gon' lay for a second
Ain't gon' wait for a second
If it's any beef can get it
Uno, dos don't forget it
I'm chum to menace exclusive
Honorable mention f*ck with Knitty, G O and Twin
Y'all some dead niggas

Hustle and rob
We Infamous mob nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous mob nigga
IM three's the squad
Infamous mob and we won't stop
'Till your head goes pop

We them original mob men
Get lead lodged in
We them marksmen you hate
Them thug niggas you love
Find me in my neighborhood pub I'm yacked up bent
Crushing haze and hash until I'm content
I'm a hood nigga for life, it ain't no changing
I'm so damn dangerous, you want I'll make you famous
Take cover when I aim this pistol I'm bucking to hit you
My forty first team all pro official
Nigga I'll kiss you then kill you
No CO D's just me then beat that body cause you ain't nobody
Been on these cold ass streets living off juice and naughty sleep
You'll be six feet under this concrete

You and that metal cut them corners you ghetto's left deserted
My origins the projects rebels, steps and murders
My name is the logic connect and vets and burners
If I bang them thanks on this cannon, bet you earned it
Pop up in your zip code aim while I'm loading
Shit and I can let this clip go in the name of this Omen
Leave him holding with my clip grow
Raised on his blowing
Like times in this life of crime, ways never knowing
Contact and touch your body
Trust me I'll be up in that black van no plates rusty shotty
'Cause cliques want no drama
With cliques that hold armor
Blitz approach drama from strips to Osama

Hustle and rob
We Infamous mob nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous mob nigga
IM three's the squad
Infamous mob and we won't stop
'Till your head goes pop

It's a potent mixture
Crime fame over infamous beats
Don't get it twisted dunn I spit for the streets
All the base heads and dope fiends
Little one's that was sold dreams
Gangs with no cribs, dunns with long bids
I spit facts of life, and clap at mics
Turn boosts to crime scenes, who's tougher than my team
None and Kaos ain't scared of no gun
I look it eye to eye the dot is ready to die
If you ain't back up, cause the mob will have you wrapped up
Moms crib clapped up dare a nigga to act up
I done hit the streets with bricks, and get back chips
Now I breathe hits on tracks to shut down cliques
It's deeper than sipping on liqs, and puffing on spliffs
You might end up sipping on this chrome four fifth
Niggas sleep in the hood, get clipped in the hood
And Papi come spitting it good
Don't end up rest in wood

We got four pound chest naked running through the block
When it's on who really gives a f*ck about the cops
When a nigga owe you knots he bound to get drop
Moms crying cause her little son got shot
How come? He owe me a little cake
And the next nigga that pump for me won't do the same thing
We think long range to get those big ass chains
Big ass cars, gripping those movie stars
Who we are IM three reppin' to the death
And you'll never catch a nigga like me wearing a vest
Only toting a tech ready to wet the whole set
Ready to wet the whole set
Cutting your neck, beating you in 
Your head 'till your dead

Hustle and rob
We Infamous mob nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous mob nigga
IM three's the squad
Infamous mob and we won't stop
'Till your head goes pop

Hustle and rob
We Infamous mob nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous mob nigga
IM three's the squad
Infamous mob and we won't stop
'Till your head goes pop
