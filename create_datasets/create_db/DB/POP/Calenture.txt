Don't need no Atlas, where I'm going ain't up to me
I'm just a passenger riding with an old memory
I can stay in my pajamas, lay here on the couch alone
I won't need my keys, ain't gonna be
Leavin' the comforts of my own home

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm going on a guilt trip
Draggin' all the baggage she left behind
Going on a guilt trip
My heart's at the wheel and it's driving me out of my mind
We're making record time
I'm going on a guilt trip

I never know when I'm leaving or when I'll be coming back
I might go any time, a guilty conscience is always packed
Just because you're looking at me
Don't assume that I'm all there
In the blink of an eye, I'll go back in time and
I can leave from anywhere

[Chorus]

I'm going, yeah, on a guilt trip
