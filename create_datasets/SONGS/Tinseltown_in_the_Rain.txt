Why did we ever come so far ?
I knew I'd seen it all before
Tall building reach up in vain
Tinseltown is in the rain

I know now love was so exciting
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women
Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm

One day this love will all blow over
Time for leaving the parade
Is there a place in this city
A place to always feel this way

And hey, there's a red car in the fountain
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women
Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm

Do I love you ? Yes I love you
Will we always be happy go lucky ?
Do I love you ? Yes I love you
But it's easy come, and it's easy go

All this talking is only bravado yeah
Oh, Tinseltown
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women

Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women
Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm

Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Do I love you ? Yes I love you
Will we always be happy go lucky ?
Do I love you ? Yes I love you
But it's easy come, and it's easy go

All this talking, talking is only bravado
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
