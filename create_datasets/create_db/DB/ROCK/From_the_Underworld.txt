Out of the land of shadows and 
Darkness, we were returning 
Towards the morning light 
Almost in reach of places I knew 

Escaping the ghosts of Yesterday 
You were behind me following 
Closely 
"Don't turn around now" 

I heard you whisper in my ear 
"If you should turn now, 
All that you won 
Will vanish just like a passing dream. 

Just on the very verge of the 
Morning, daylight was dawning, 
Freedom was but a step away 
Now with the deep dark river 

Behind us, 
What could go wrong if I stayed 
Strong in mind. 
What was the sudden lapse into 

Madness, what was the urge that 
Turned my head around to look at you? 
What was the stubborn will 
To destroy the love and the joy 

I nearly held? 
Three times the thunder roared 
In my ears 
In all of my years I'll see that lost 

Look in your eyes. 
As, with a sigh like smoke in the wind 
You slipped from my grasp into 
The waiting shadows 

So much I longed to say, 
But my touch found only the 
Empty air and a black nights 
Coldness. 

Into another world you entered 
And never again I can reclaim you.
