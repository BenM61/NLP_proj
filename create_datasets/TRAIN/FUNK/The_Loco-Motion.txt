Everybody's doin' a brand-new dance, now 
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion) 
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now 
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion) 
My little baby sister can do it with me,  
It's easier than learning your A, be, see's, 
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me. 
You gotta swing your hips, now. Come on, baby. 
Jump up. Jump back. Well, now, I think you've got the knack. 

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now. 
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion) 
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now. 
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion) 
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control: 
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul. 
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me. 

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion. 
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion) 
Do it holding hands if you get the notion. 
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion) 
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do. 
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue, 
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me
