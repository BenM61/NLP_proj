Those kissing words that come out of your mouth 
Sweet promises to break my heart 
You talk of love and I begin to trust 
I don't know why I'm scared 

Those kissing words they climb inside my head 
They cloud my mind like purest poison 
When I'm with you it feels so dangerous 
I don't know why I'm scared 

It's driving me crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 

I know your thoughts I've read your diaries 
My fingers burn as I turn the page 
You spoke of love my tears have turned to dust 
I don't know why I care 

I'm asking you to give me more than this 
I need to feel beyond the pain 
The rain returns to rearrange the rust 
I don't know why I care 

It's driving me crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 

It's cold and it's crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 

Cold sun in a wet rocky sky 
A broken beach where the waves come to die 
I walk alone with fear in my heart 
Still I deny we're falling apart 

Cyclops shines through the legendary night 
The living tale of a time we thought we might 
The open grave of the shallowness of blame 
Still I try to hold on to the flame 

A cold sun like the steel in your eyes 
The day you said goodbye was the day you saw me die 
A cold sun no heat for my heart 
Still I deny we're falling apart 

It's driving me crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 
It's cold and it's crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me
