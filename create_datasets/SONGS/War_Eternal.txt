Friend or foe there's no way to know
In the battlefield of life its kill or be killed.
So many times its a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck to down on your knees.

Its a hellish inferno
This is war eternal.

They try to change you, crush and break you.

Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are.

It's time like these when lines are drawn
Which side of the fence you are standing on?
There will come a day not so far away
When the hunter becomes the prey (and you will pay).

Its a hellish inferno
This is war eternal.

They try to change you, crush and break you.

Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are.

This is fucking war!

They try to change you, crush and break you.

Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are.
