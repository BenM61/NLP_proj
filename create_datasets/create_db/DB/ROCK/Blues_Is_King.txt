Blues is king 
A beautiful thing 
You just don't know whenever you're done by the one you love 
And the joke's on you 
If you don't know it's true 
If you lose your dreams 
You'll know what I'm thinking of 
Yeah, blues is king 
So let it ring

Surrender do, to the sound so real and true 
And relax your mind, go on, you'll be fine 
Surrender do, 'cause you'll never displace it 
So face it, blues is king 
As the sun descends, rain begins 
Everything in view 
Is a dull shade of blue 

And the traffic sounds, the lights uptown 
Make a sad and uninviting scene to walk into 
But the blue of the night 
Everything in daylight 
Don't even begin, to be as blue as the mood I'm in 
People out alone, on their way home 
I'm wandering on, remembering only 
That I'm lonely 
And blues is king 
Blues is king, 
A beautiful thing 

You just don't know whenever you're (torn) by the one you love 
And the joke's on you 
If you don't know it's true 
If you lose your dreams 
You'll know what I'm thinking of 
Yeah, blues is king, 
So let it ring 

Surrender do, to the sound so real and true 
Just relax your mind, 
Go on, you'll be fine 
Surrender do, 'cause you'll never displace it 
So face it, blues is king
