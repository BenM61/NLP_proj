Turn your ugly face
Are you so surprised to see me
Yeah I was your little 
Childhood playground toy 

And if I remember 
Yeah if I do remember rightly
I said the tables would be 
Turned around, boy 

Who's getting scared now 
Tell me, tell me how does it feel
It feels so good 
From where I'm standing 

The only times of my life
The sun was meant to shine for me
You made it pour down, 
Pour down with tears of rain 

Dug my pride with a knife
Enraged by your obsession with me 
Time was mental torture 
And screams of justified pain 

So ya gonna chase me now, boy
Yeah ya gonna corner me now, boy
You think ya gonna threaten me now, boy
Well somehow I don't think so 

Yeah, ya gonna stamp me down now, boy
Yeah, ya gonna crush me down now, boy
You think ya gonna threaten me now, boy
Well somehow I don't think so 

Who's getting scared now 
Tell me, tell me how does it feel
It feels so good 
From where I'm standing 

Yeah you're getting scared now, piggy,
Go ahead and squeal
It sounds so nice 
From where I'm standing 

Who's getting scared now 
Tell me, tell me how does it feel
It feels so good 
From where I'm standing 

You're getting scared now
Baby, go ahead and scream
It sounds so nice from where I'm standing
From where I'm standing

Who's getting scared?
Who's getting scared now?
Who's getting scared?
Who's getting scared now?
Who's getting scared?
Who's getting scared now?
