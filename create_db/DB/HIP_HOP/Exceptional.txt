There are days when I'm so mystified
That you have chosen me, yes
That every night before I close my eyes
I thank god that I'm me
To know that you love me
To know that you care
To know that you give up yourself and yet still ask of nothing
From me

Your love is exceptional
Born of a heart of gold
It fills me up to my soul
Then my cup, it overflows
You're my sunshine all day, all night
For always, for all time, baby
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional, so exceptional

Every night when I lie next to you
I lay in disbelief
That I'm worthy of deserving you
That I get to live this dream, babe
To know that you want me
Is to know that I'm here
To know that I live in your heart is to know that I'm blessed
And it's clear

Your love is exceptional
Born of a heart of gold, yes it is
It fills me up to my soul
Then my cup, it overflows
You're my sunshine all day, all night
For always, for all time, baby
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional, so exceptional

You're my sunshine all day, all night
Always, for all times
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional, so exceptional

Your love is exceptional
Born of a heart of gold
It fills me up to my soul
Then my cup, it overflows
You're my sunshine all day, all night
For always, for all time, baby
You're my whole life, star shine so bright
Your love's unconditional, so exceptional
