I've been here all the time
As far as I know doing right
I've always waited for the moment
That you would come through my door
But this brought loneliness so far
I lay my hand onto my heart
Is this the life I want to live
Is this the dream I had of you

But this brought loneliness so far
I lay my hand onto my heart
Is this the life I want to live
Is this the dream I had of you
The dream I had of you

The dream I had of you

Now I'm standing here alone
Waiting on my own
For something that will fill the emptiness
Inside the moment that you mind
But this is loneliness I know
I lay my hand onto my soul
Is this what life has got to give
Is this the dream I had of you

The dream I had of you

But this is loneliness I know
I lay my hand onto my soul
Is this what life has got to give
Is this the dream
The dream I had of you
