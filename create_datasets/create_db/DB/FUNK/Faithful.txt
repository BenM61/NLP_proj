I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more

I'm faithful to my baby
To cheat on you would be crazy
I can't cheat on you
I can't do it no more

I've been a cheater
Ever since I was 12 years old
Baby-baby, yeah, baby
But when I first laid eyes on you
I knew it was over for the other cuties
Oh, lady

I could see big girls from Amsterdam
But I'll never take the chance
Cause I really love your, your style
There could be fine naked girls in the room
But I'm coming home to you
Cause you know I love you

Girl, I love your big eyes
I'm faithful to my baby
You're my one special prize
To cheat on you would be crazy
I won't cheat on you
I can't do it no more

To get respect
I know I have to show respect
That's why I'm by your side going nowhere
Now that I'm with you
Every girl wants a piece of my mind and soul
Can't have it

You know you really opened my eyes
Even my father was surprised
How faithful I am to you
I tell them all to get away
Cause I love you more each day
And my life is yours

Girl, you are my whole life
(Saadiq, what's up, Playboy)
You know what's up (What's up with that)
I can't be like you no more (What's wrong with me, man)
You got 'em all, you got this one, you got that one
You got 4 or 5 of 'em (You know I love them rigs)
They ain't seeing me (Huh)
I gotta let all that go
Cause you just can't have 'em all, you know what I'm saying?
(I heard ya, I hear ya)
Cause I really love my baby-baby, woo-wee, baby

I'm faithful to my baby
I won't cheat on you
And to cheat on you would be crazy, baby
To cheat on you would be crazy
Nobody could ever change my mind
Lady, lady, I'll be crazy

I'm faithful to my baby
I won't cheat on you
And I'm coming home every night, baby-baby
To cheat on you would be crazy
They could me crazy
Cause I love you, lady, I love you, lady, woo, baby

I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more

I can't do it no more, no
Oh, no
I can't do it no, no more

I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before (Like I did before)
I can't do it no more

No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, baby

I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more
