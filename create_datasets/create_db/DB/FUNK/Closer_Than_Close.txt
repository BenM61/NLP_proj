She'll read your mind 
She's smart as a whip 
She'll suck you dry 
But look at how much I drip 

At the point of ecstasy 
I write a symphony 
Of poetry in motion 
And leavin' me there to die 

I tell myself 
Let no one take her place 
To confide in someone 
And look at how much I paid 

I want you next to me 
Call it telepathy 
We drifted into vision 
And look at how much we see 

Ah... 
Ah... 
I just want to get closer than close to you 
To the moment you discover 

What the best of my love can do 
And lovers fall for lover's friends 
We make each other cry 
Living in each others lives 

And tryin' to make the fantasy come true 
But I just want to get closer than close to you, baby 
I just want to get closer than close, to you 
Your soul is naked 

It tells you what you want 
I read your letter 
And look at how close I've come 
There's more for us to see 

In this philosophy 
We both end up in heaven 
And look at how close we'd be 
Ah... 
Ah... 

I just want to get closer than close to you 
I know that one way or the other 
Any test of my faith will do 
I give my heart for you to break 

I give my final breath 
When nothing last forever see 
What we can turn eternity into 
And I just want to get closer than close to you, baby 

I just want to get closer than close, to you
