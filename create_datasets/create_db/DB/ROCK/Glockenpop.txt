Singing is easy if you can remember the tune
It can be something to do on a bright afternoon
Singing in sunshine, sweet melody
I'm singing for you and I hope that you're singing for me

Just try to remember
Words go together
Songs last forever
Nothing can
For you

You can be happy when everyone's singing your song
And think of the cash you can make when they all sing along
It doesn't matter if all of your songs sound the same
Cause people are happy to hear them over and over and over again

Just try to remember
Words go together
Songs last forever
Nothing can be together
For you

Singing a song
Walking along
I'm singing for you
I hope that you sing for me too
