Listen to the beat

Trampin' feet
With traffic meet
And fill the street
With boomin' and zoomin' and rhythm
With the merrily beat of my heart

Birds that sing
and bells that ring
their voices bring
the rollicky' frollicky' tempo
of the dancing beat of my heart

It all began
The day you smiled at me
In such a charming way

Need I further say:
Because of you
The world is filled with music

Rumblin' trains and roarin' planes
Their noise contains
The clickety clackety drummin'
From the hummin' beat of my heart

(?) hours
(?) powers
thundershowers that pitter and patter
are sounding to the poundin' beat of my heart

And since you're mine
My love song needs another line
With word 'divine'

That your name will rhyme with
While I sing in time with
Every thumpin' bumpin' beat of my heart

The beat of my heart

The beat of my heart

It all began
The day you smiled at me
In such a charming way

Need I further say:
Because of you
The world is filled with music

Rumblin' trains and roarin' planes
Their noise contains
The clickety clackety drummin'
From the hummin' beat of my heart

(?) hours
(?) powers
thundershowers that pitter and patter
are sounding to the poundin' beat of my heart

And since you're mine
My love song needs another line
With word 'divine'

That your name will rhyme with
While I sing in time with
Every thumpin' bumpin' beat of my heart

Listen to the beat
