Welcome to the Throne Room
Welcome to the place where it all got started
Bow down in His presence and worship Him

Welcome to the Throne Room
Beyond the veil only those who know and love Him
Come boldly before His throne

And cry holy, holy, holy, holy
Cry out holy, holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
Which was, and is, and is to come

Welcome to the Throne Room
Welcome to the place where He shows His face
Oh, worship in spirit and in truth

Welcome to the Throne Room
Welcome to the place where it all got started
Bow down (bow down)

And cry holy, holy, holy, holy
Cry out holy, holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
Which was, and is, and is to come

Welcome to the Throne Room
