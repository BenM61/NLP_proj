(Maxi Jazz)
My love is generations old,
I was there when trees died as the world went cold
Still there when my people were bought and sold
What's going on? What's going on?

(Dido)
Your love is on a grand scale
Mine is in the detail
Your love is to change the world
We just want to have to hold

Two hearts, both forgiving
Two ways to see the same thing
One house there's room for all
We just want to have to hold (2x)

(Maxi Jazz & Dido)
No roots, no tree, no family, no me

(Maxi Jazz)
Our first f*ck was more planning than luck
I had a deep understanding of what makes you (hot)
I did my homework till my dome hurt, I was a stone flirt
Hustling for some prone work, and I don't stop
I knew that you were good for me,
You 'n I fit together so beautifully
But only for three years were we in harmony

I've ended up part you, part me,
Love that we agree, not be ugly
And now that we're free to create our own destiny
You will always be a friend to me
My love persists over land and sea, through centuries
I'll fill you up like rice and peas,

Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.
Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.
Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.
Like the breeze, Cool ya skin, fill your hair,
Even when I'm not there.
