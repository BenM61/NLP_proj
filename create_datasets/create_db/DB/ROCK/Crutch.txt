I don't want to be the crutch
One step away from down
I don't want to be the crutch
One step away from...

Man I feel like hell so come on over
Be a love machine and I could be your friend
Ain't no shame feel strong for one another
Make a real true color come end to end then
God damn, change of pace
I think there's still a piece of my heart on your face
It's a shame to let it waste
How does it taste? How does it taste?

Break it down in pieces, make it simple
'Cause you know damn well that I'm a simple man
All these things go changing like the weather
And they stay that way until the weather man says
One down, gone to waste
I think there's still a piece of that smile on your face
And I would like to see it erased
There ain't no two ways about it

I don't want to be the crutch
One step away from down
I don't want to be the crutch
One step away from down, down, down

Bring it on then gone, use a lover
Like a cigarette the way that lovers do
One sweet song that starts a little slow and
Then goes on and on and makes you want to
Move around the room in circles
Everybody wants to be you
Try to find my place up on the map
Of all men you've been through
Dig a little deeper and you'll realize
All I'm building up you're tearing down

I don't want to be the crutch
One step away from down
I don't want to be the crutch
One step away from down, down, down, down, down

All you needed was a crutch
One step away from down
I could never be your crutch
I could break you down

I don't want to be the crutch
I don't want to be the crutch
I don't want to be the crutch
One step away from...
