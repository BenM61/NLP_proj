I caught you cryin'
Tryin' to hide your tears away
And all the while
I never knew you felt this way
I've loved you from the start
How could we let this come apart?

We've got to put
The sun back in our hearts

Through the alleyways
The avenues and dreary days
Your schoolyard eyes
Hypnotizing every time
When we kiss in the dark
Emotion tearing us apart

We've got to put
The sun back in our hearts

Down the cinder path
And through the hedge
Climbing up to the window ledge
Throwing lockets to make a scene
I can't explain, you know what I mean

I caught you cryin'
Tryin' to hide your tears away
But your crippled smile
Will always give the game away
Are we fallin' apart?
Are we just walkin' in the park?

We've got to put
The sun back in our hearts
