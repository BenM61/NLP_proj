Thought that you were just another Romeo
The shoe you pass by in the store window
But soon as I got home I wish I bought you instead
I got it bad, I'll take the black, take the navy and red
No other man has ever, ever had quite this effect
I sleep alone cause there's no room in my bed
For any other lover, with no gun to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage
And I don't wanna stop it

'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

I came before this digital ocean
Where folks only move in digital motion
But you're so classic I want you more than my Adidas
All the bees are getting at you cause your honey is sweeter
I need you, with no gun to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage and I don't want to stop it

'Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

Can't let this go, what can I say?
I just don't know, my love ain't no trip for the weekend,
Here to stay for all of the seasons!
You're the weakness that I can't control!

Baby you all I need to get by
You fly, so you're all I need to get high
You got it? So put ya number in this camera phone
And we can live like the camera's on
No strip, though these boys claiming they ball
Got no grip, though
My flow switchmode, it's so schizo
So I'm the one that your girl blow a kiss for
You've got to love me, Cole World, no snuggy
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You're hoping I'm the one
But I already knew though
It ain't no secret that I get around, true
But girl, you make me want to settle down, with you
Get a crib with a view, lay up in the bed make a kid, maybe 2
All my ex-girlfriends gon' have to get a clue
'Cause the rumors that you heard about is true!

I said I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

I said I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I I I I I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel, that you feel like I do
