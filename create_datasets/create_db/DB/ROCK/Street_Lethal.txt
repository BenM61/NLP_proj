Movin' down the back streets
Pass the speed of light
Sparks burn inside me
Gas and air adjusted right
Layin' down some rubber
Needle's in the red

I'm blowin' away
On the edge

Never ceasing, never ending
My machine's what I live for
Don't ever try to pass me
Cause I'll even up the score
Cool, and lean and righteous
Slipping through the air

I play for keeps
But won't play fair

And I'm street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me ride

Movin' down the pavement
Don't get in my hair
Exploding in your faces
Like a match to liquid air
Bolting down the back straights
Spilling round the curves

I'll give you all
Your just desserts

One explosion then another
Feeling it excel
Put the road behind me
Keep my feet out of hell
Pulling up into the heavens
Blowing past a shooting star

First I'm near
Then I'm far

And I'm street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me ride

On this four wheel heart attack
Customized to cut no slack

And I'm street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me ride

Street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me
Ride
