I've been searching for a long time
To find someone to be mine
I never thought, you'd come along
Now that you're here, all my worries are gone
Oh oh

Sweet you
Sweet you
All of my dreams have all come true

You're just the one I've been looking for
You're just the one I've been looking for

I didn't know how long it would take
But good things come to those who wait
I can't ask for anything more
You're everything I've been looking for

Sweet you
Sweet you
Nobody, nobody, nobody will ever do

You're just the one I've been looking for
You're just the one I've been looking for

Nights were dark, the days gotten longer
My mind was weak but my heart stayed strong
Then you came along and rescued me
Please don't you ever, set me free

I don't know
Oh oh oh oh

Sweet you
Sweet you
All of my dreams have all come true, yeah

You're just the one I've been looking for, baby
You're just the one I've been looking for

I've been looking (you're the one)
I searched all day Monday (you're the one)
And I couldn't find you (you're the one)
I searched all day Tuesday (you're the one)
And I couldn't find you (you're the one)
Early Wednesday morning (you're the one)
You know I found you (you're the one)
And when I found you (you're the one)
I threw my arms around you (you're the one)
I said baby I'm glad (you're the one)
