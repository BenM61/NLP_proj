Standing in your shadow always
Standing in the hallways
Standing in your shadow always
Don't even know my name

Your secret, when it will be mine?
Standing in the hallways of time
Do you even know my name?
You don't even know my name

Ah oh I'm telling you ah
A short stab of heartbreak
Won't get you through

I just want your tears to drown up my sorrow
I don't wanna start again tomorrow
I just want your tears to drown up my sorrow
I don't wanna start again tomorrow

Ah oh I'm telling you ah
A short stab of heartbreak
Won't get you through

Who'd dare leave you?
A short stab of heartbreak
Won't get you through

Standing in your shadow always
Standing in your shadow always

Your secret, when it will be mine?
Standing in the hallways of time
Do you even know my name?
You don't even know my name

Ah oh I'm telling you ah
A short stab of heartbreak
Won't get you through

Ah oh I'm telling you ah
A short stab of heartbreak
Won't get you through

Ah oh I'm telling you ah
A short stab of heartbreak
Won't get you through

A short stab of heartbreak
Won't get you through
