Oh I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul
Well I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love.

My heart is bursting Lord
To tell of all you've done
Of how you changed my life
And wiped away the past
I want to shout it out
From every roof top sing
For now I know that God
Is for me not against me

Everybody's singing now 'cause we're so happy
Everybody's dancing now 'cause we're so happy
If only we could see your face
And see you smiling over us
And unseen angels celebrate
For joy is in this place!
