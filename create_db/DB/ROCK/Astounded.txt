Hey, hey Hey, hey

You don't care 
How I feel 
You care about yourself 
I understand the way you feel 
Your pity is your wealth 

Lost in time 
She don't mind the change in the ways 
Now you're mine 
We don't mind the change in the ways 

[Chorus:] 
Hey hey hey I just found my way 
All you stupid fuckers 
Walk around astounded and drowning 

Hey hey hey I just found my way 
Some things can be lost 
But now I found a new way through it again 

I'll never wish you harm in life 
I pray you find your way I have found 
I'll live my life 
Discovering my fate 

Lost in time 
She don't mind the change in the ways 
Now you're mine 
We don't mind the change in the ways 

[Chorus x3] 
Hey hey hey I just found my way 
All you stupid fuckers 
Walk around astounded and drowning 

A new way Through it 
A new way through it again
