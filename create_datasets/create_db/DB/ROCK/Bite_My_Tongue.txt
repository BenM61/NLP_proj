I hate to break it to you but
You're just a lonely star
I try to bring you down but
A level isn't good enough
You always do as you believe so
I'm gonna fall asleep
And take a seat
And watch you fall apart
'Cause in the end
What are you without me?
I slow this down 'cause I know that you can't keep up
Oh baby I, maybe I was alone from the start
I might be proud, but at least I'm proud of something
You've taken pride in becoming nothing

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me

I'm married to the music
For better or for worse
You say that I'm privileged but
Your gift is my curse
I can't recall the last time
Someone asked me how I was
Well deject I was a fucking wreck
But my help can only shoot us
I sit in the dirt

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me

Just forget what you've learned
Just forget what you've heard
The truth just confirmed
I can't bare the sight of you anymore.
You've become what I hate
Sold yourself for a bit of fame
Now that the wolves have closed the door
You wanna drag me down some more
F*ck you
F*ck you

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you with me
I can't hate the ones who made me
