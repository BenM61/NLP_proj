So much going on out there
Leaves us hanging in the air
And it's all that we can do
To face each day and see it through

Life's a dance
Put on your dancing shoes, take a chance

You can't shut your eyes to pain
Faces crying in the rain
You can't keep it all inside
You need some way to let it ride

Life's a dance
Put on your dancing shoes, take a chance

When you're all over
When you know you've done all that you can do
Put on your dancing shoes
It'll see you through

Voices shouting in the street
Life lived to a ragged beat
Someone's world is tumbling down
Who's the saint and who's the clown?

Life's a dance
Put on your dancing shoes, take a chance

When you're all over
When you know you've done all that you can do
Put on your dancing shoes
It'll see you through

When time is flying
When you know there's no end to these modern blues
Put on your dancing shoes
It'll see you through

Life's a dance
Put on your dancing shoes, take a chance

When you're all over
When you know you've done all that you can do
Put on your dancing shoes
It'll see you through

When time is flying
When you know there's no end to these modern blues
Put on your dancing shoes
It'll see you through

Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing
