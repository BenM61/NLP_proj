I'm a song,I'm a song
I can't be read, I can't be read
I can't be drawn
In the radio
I shine it off

Cause it's on Friday, it's on Friday 
I wanna leave
I wanna fly
You know I feel like my place
It's right around you

We got hungry eyes
We got hungry eyes
We won't stop to find the one right guy
We won't crash out, no
We won't leave the focus after all

We got hungry eyes
We got hungry eyes
We won't stop to find the one right guy
We won't crash out, no
We won't leave the focus after all

And I'm a bird, I'm a bird up in the trees
Because the telephone lies
We will fall of it
And it's time, it's time I screw the clock

But if it's not a good lie
I 'll smell, won't I?

We got hungry eyes
We got hungry eyes
We won't stop to find the one right guy
We won't crash out, no
We won't leave the focus after all

We got hungry eyes
We got hungry eyes
We won't stop to find the one right guy
We won't crash out, no
We won't leave the focus after all

And love keeps us 
Won't let go
Won't stop for the other hand
And all the dreams are aside
We will go and slowly fade it 

We got hungry eyes
We got hungry eyes
We won't stop to find the one right guy
We won't crash out, no
We won't leave the focus after all

We got hungry eyes
We got hungry eyes
We won't stop to find the one right guy
We won't crash out, no
We won't leave the focus after all
