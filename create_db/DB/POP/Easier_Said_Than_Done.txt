Hold it there
Try to imagine
Songs of heaven in motion
Singing songs of devotion
Say it's all possible
But it's easier said than done
Twice as close
Bringers of wisdom
Simply trying to touch
Put a spell on you
Say it's all possible
But it's easier said than done
Think for a reason
It's easy to please
Thoughts of a love world
Where innocence leads you
To a magical high
When someone you remember
Helps by telling you why, why
Why there is worship
Deep, deep within
Not so easily seen
Or amazingly witnessed
A spell on you
It's already said and done
Hold it there
You can imagine
All of heaven in motion
Special songs of devotion
Say it's all possible
But easier said than done
Think of a season
So easy to reach
Thoughts of a good world
Where innocence leads you
To a magical high
When someone you remember
Helps by telling you why, why
Why there is worship
Deep, deep within
Nor so specially seen
Or amazingly witnessed
A spell on you
It's already said and done
See it clear
Sounds of emotion
Spreading all or' the world
Bringing peace for a moment
Sa it's all possible
It's already said and done
Already said and done
Already said and done
Already said and done
Already said and done
