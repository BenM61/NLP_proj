She was the queen
She got all her drugs for free
She walked up to her daddy's door
He said, "You don't live here anymore"
She wanted love, wanted love
Oh, but she just couldn't get enough

And my man, he wanders 'round
He lets all those young women down
And they say, 'Baby, oh, can't you stay?"
And he says, "Darling, already on my way"
They wanted love, wanted love
Oh, but they just couldn't get enough

Well, all these people and all these things
What's the point in a wedding ring?
We might not be here when next year comes
You better watch your back and carry a gun

Baby girl, where did you go?
I threw you out where the cold wind blows
Are you in Vidalia with your no-good mom?
Just couldn't watch you stick it in your arm
I wanted love, wanted love
Oh, but I just couldn't give enough

From the boogie-down to Bowling Green
I rode the night train to infinity
I tempted fate and I acted smart
I grew some callous on my heart
I wanted love, wanted love
Oh, but I just couldn't give enough, enough

Well, all these places, and all these towns
What's the point in settling down?
We might not be here when next year comes
You better live it like you're on the run
