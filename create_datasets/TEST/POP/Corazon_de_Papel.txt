Passing under barren skies
Waiting for our worlds to collide
And there you are
All alone feeling bad

Interstate movin' again
Barrel through thick and thin
Side by side
To survive like creosote

Born under a widespread changes
The search for higher reason
Learning the ropes okay
But fate just runs you around

From Memphis to New Orleans
In and out of railroad dreams
You're out there
In scenes passing by

Everyone faces what they deserve
Carousel to claim or curse
Sticking around
At least for the ride
