No more invisible speechless, deaf and blind child
With neglected pleasures being addicted to denial
Floating through time, gravitating towards a warm arm
With an appetite for the emptiness that promises no harm

No more uncontrollable eruptions of emotional depression
A primal S.O.S. from the barren prison of selfless expression
that only the guilty with the innocent
Souls-know buried in social scar tissue of defective ego

No more relentless sifting through bodies seeking self
Settling through competitive combat for what's left on the shelf.
A mad melee of supply and demand driven by gullible pride that
leads to sedating the you that suffocates inside

No more - forever no more, because I've unshut my eyes
And the differences between God's word and Man's Wills was realized
Seeing opposing parallel lives some liquid, other frozen. Let me to never
seek from man what God has chosen.

Then the negative whispering subsided and the panicking ceased
the undercurrent suppression of pent-up terror was released as the
mystery of the unknown manifested pristine clear A positive message
of truth entered my ear

Now, across my face is a brand new smile
With a newly revealed meaning of a "Destine Child"
A message of hope is being released from my Heart
And I am overwhelmed with dedication to do my part

All I ever wanted was to be as I once was - Unbounded
Somehow it got all twisted and before long sounded
As though life was continuous connive-thrive-drive
Choking out the simple joy of just being alive

Now I am filled with love and I sing a love song
A song for yesterday, today, tomorrow, and beyond
My new prayer is, Thank You God for setting Me Free
