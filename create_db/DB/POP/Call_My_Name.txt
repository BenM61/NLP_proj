How do you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I changed
How do you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

Yes I love you, say it, for the way I know we’ve been apart
It's an endless circle of poison arrow to my heart

Sayin’ I, I love what you do to me, need you to stay with me
I, I love you too much to let go

How do you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I changed
How do you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

How do you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I changed
How do you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

It's a constant thought of my baby taking up my time
It's a non-stop vision of you that's playing on my mind

Sayin’ I, I love what you do to me, need you to stay with me
I, I love you too much to let go

How do you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I changed
How do you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

How do you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I changed
How do you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

When you call my name
When you call my name
Say my name baby
When you call my name
When you call my name
Say my name baby
