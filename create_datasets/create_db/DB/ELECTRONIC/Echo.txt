You
You haunt this room just like a ghost
You've disappeared
No song but I still hear the notes
You
You're gone when I need you the most
I want you near
I need you close

I hear your echo, echo
Telling me you want me
Echo, echo
Just won't let me go
I hear your echo, echo
I still feel your heartbeat (heartbeat, yeah)
Your echo, echo
Echo, echo

You
Never believed in letting go
But now we're here
When we were there, not long ago
You
You said my heart woke up in smoke
But then it cleared
I couldn't see you anymore

Echo, echo
Telling me you want me
Your echo, echo
Just won't let me go
I hear your echo, echo
I still feel your heartbeat (heartbeat, yeah)
Your echo, echo
Echo, echo

Echo, echo
Telling me you want me
Your echo, echo
Just won't let me go
I hear your echo, echo
I still feel your heartbeat (heartbeat, yeah)
Your echo, echo
Echo, echo

Echo, echo
Echo, echo

Echo, echo
