I like Smokey, can I second that emotion?
You're a Pisces, and I'm drowning in your ocean
I'm wasting all my time in your office complex
When I really want to see you in that Black Sundress

May Marie don't misunderstand me
Your eyes like to tease saying "You can't have me."
Hey, Marie, won't you understand me
I really want a piece of your psycho-candy.

You've been running, through my imagination
Like a movie, and I want to be your agent
We can talk all day, about my Electra Complex
But I really want to see you lose that Black Sundress

May Marie, don't misunderstand me
I know it's not for free, your psycho-candy.
Hey, Marie, I don't mean to be demanding
I'm aching for a piece of your psycho-candy.

A figure so divine, with a halo that glows
A wire from Greta told me all I need to know
Shivers down my spine, I wanna paint your toes
I'm twisted inside out, what more do you need to know?

It's a tangle, of intricate emotion
You're an angel
But you give me evil notions

I've wasted every dime, I guess I'm just too complex
Do you really want to see me in that Black Sundress?
May, Marie, this is not the way I planned it
I'm aching for a piece of your psycho-candy
Hey Marie, I won't take it for granted
If I could have a piece of your psycho-candy
