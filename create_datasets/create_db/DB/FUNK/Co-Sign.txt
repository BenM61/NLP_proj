Baby I'm ready, baby I'm ready

I used to think I would never find the one,
Who will know how to love me, boy this is something.
To hear your voice-mail, it make me wanna call and re-play-
The way that you talk yeah, boy you speaking my language
(I hear you saying...)

Love will be right here, (I hear you saying)
I will dry your tears
Ready for a wifey and kids. (I hear you saying)
Never had nothing like this, ooooohh
Baby, if you ask me for my love
Then I will gladly give it up (ooh)
Baby I co-sign, co-sign, co-sign
For your lovin' I
Co-sign, co-sign, baby I'm ready

When I'm you, there is no place I'd rather be
Boy this is not me, don't stop what your doin' (yeah)
When you come around I don't know how to behave
I get so open, from all the words you spoken
(I hear you saying)

Love will be right here, (I hear you saying)
I will dry your tears
Ready for a wifey and kids. (I hear you saying)
Never had nothing like this, ooooohh
Baby, if you ask me for my love
Then I will gladly give it up (ooh)
Baby I co-sign, co-sign, co-sign
For your lovin' I
Co-sign, co-sign, baby I'm ready

I'll sign your name across my heart, ohh what I'll do
To making love with you boy
And I don't care how long it takes, cause I know that

Love will be right here, (I hear you saying)
I will dry your tears
Ready for a wifey and kids. (I hear you saying)
Never had nothing like this, ooooohh
Baby, if you ask me for my love
Then I will gladly give it up (ooh)
Baby I co-sign, co-sign, co-sign
For your lovin' I
Co-sign, co-sign, baby I'm ready
