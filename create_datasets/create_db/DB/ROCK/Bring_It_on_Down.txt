You know it hurts so good
Like all the best things always should 
And I'm being led astray
I'm saying all the words I'll regret someday
But life's too short for me to care
Bring bring bring
Bring it on down
I'm feeling fit to burst
But of all the words I'll choose the worst
And I'm confused
But I know that there's no time to lose
Bring bring bring
Bring it on down
We could spend our whole lives and let it pass by
So let's bring it on down why watch the time fly?
Bring bring bring
Bring it on down
