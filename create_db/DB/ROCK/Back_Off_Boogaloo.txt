Back off, boogaloo,
Back off, boogaloo,
I said, back off, boogaloo, boo
 
Back off, boogaloo,
What you think you're gonna do?
I gonna flash right from the start
 
Get yourself together now and give me something tasty,
Everything you try to do, you know it sure sound wasted
 
Back off, boogaloo, back off, boogaloo,
(What would you do if I sang out of tune?)
I said, back off, boogaloo, boo
(Would you stand up and walk out on me?)
 
You think you're a groove,
Standin' there with your boogie shoes
(Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song)
And your socks that match your eyes
(And I'll try not to sing out of key)
 
Get yourself together now
(Help! I need somebody)
And give me something tasty,
(Help! not just anybody)
Everything you try to do,
(Help! you know I need someone)
You know it sure sound wasted
(Help! somebody)
 
(See how they run)
Back off, boogaloo,
(I said, back off, boogaloo, I said, back off boogaloo, boo)
 
Back off, boogaloo,
I said, what you think you're gonna do?
I gonna flash right from the start
 
Get yourself together now, sunshine
(Good day good day)
You know it don't come easy
(Good day sunshine)
 
(How does it feel to be one of the beautiful?
(Sad because you're on your own?)
 
(What do you see when you turn out the light?)
(I can show you but I know it's mine)
 
Get yourself together now, easy. (red foxes going forever)
(Whoa!)
