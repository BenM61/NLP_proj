Rip out the table
We need room to move
In a life unstable
You're so easily amused
Anywhere you hang
Yourself is home
Throw in a tape, fix the tone

Someone take the wheel
And I don't know where we're going
Anybody say what your feel
Back home I guess it's still snowing

The windows are dirty let's hope it rains
Add another newspaper
Something to do with my change
I see we're fighting again
In some fucking land
Throw in another tape man

Someone take the wheel
And I don't know where we're going
Anybody say what you feel
Everybody's sad, but nobody's showing

Show me one night
Kiss until a long time
Show me one night
Show

The music is pounding
Out in that rain
And we're standing in the shadows
Forever on the brink
Turn it up so I don't have to think

Someone take the wheel
And I don't care where we're going
Anybody say what you feel
Everybody's sad, but nobody's showing

Someone take the wheel
Someone take the wheel
