I can see there's something in your eyes
You just took a fall from paradise
Saw the lipstick on your neck
Maybe you should just confess

I don't wanna lose my head today
But I know there's something in the way
Maybe I made a big mistake last night
When I left you alone with Chelsea

Chelsea's the kind of girl that's cold as ice
Beautiful with nails filed sharp as knives
She called me while you were kissing
So I could hear what I was missing

I don't wanna lose my head today
But I know there's something in the way
Maybe I made a big mistake last night
When I left you alone with Chelsea

When I left you alone with Chelsea

You're just a typical guy and you're typically blind
You can see I'm out of here and that I said goodbye

I don't wanna lose my head today
But I know there's something in the way
Maybe I made a big mistake last night
When I left you alone with Chelsea

When I left you alone with Chelsea
