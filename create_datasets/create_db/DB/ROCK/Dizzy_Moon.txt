Dug myself a hole again
Lost myself control again
Kicked myself in the head again
Made my own dumb bed again 

Dizzy Moon,
Dizzy Moon
The dream is over
Dizzy Moon,

Dizzy Moon
The dream is dead 
Lost myself in the mail again 
Hit my head on the nail again

Slept myself awake again 
Burned myself at the stake again 
Dizzy Moon,
Dizzy Moon

The dream is over
Dizzy Moon,
Dizzy Moon
The dream is dead 

Dug myself a hole again
Lost myself control again
Kicked myself in the head again
Made my own dumb bed again

Lost myself in the mail again
Tossed myself in jail again
Dizzy Moon,
Dizzy Moon

The dream is over
Dizzy Moon,
Dizzy Moon
The dream is dead 

Dizzy Moon,
Dizzy Moon
The dream is over
Dizzy Moon,

Dizzy Moon
The dream is dead.
