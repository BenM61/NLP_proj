Nicky's in the corner
With a black coat on
Running from a bad home
With some cat inside

Now where did you find her?
Among the neon lights
That haunt the streets outside
She says, 'Stay with me'

Beautiful girl, stay with me
Beautiful girl, stay with me
But you wanna go home

From doorway to doorway
Street corner to corner
With neon ghosts in the city
And she says

'Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me'
Stay with me, stay with me

She's so scared
So very frightened
Anything could happen
Right here tonight

Beautiful girl, stay with me
Beautiful girl, stay with me
But you wanna go home

Stay with me, beautiful girl
Stay with me, beautiful girl
Stay with me, beautiful girl
Stay with me, beautiful girl
