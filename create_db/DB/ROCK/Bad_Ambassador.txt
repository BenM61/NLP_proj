I want to chill, I want to sit real still 
I want to sleep like the dead on a bed of roses 
Me and my lovely wife 
We're in the prime of life 
I want to feel real, I want to free-wheel 
I want to steal the show from under their noses 
I want to get you off 
Ain't that enough? 
I'm gonna abseil down my ivory tower
And buy myself a Jaguar 

I'm a bad ambassador for that elusive place you're searching for 
I want to show you so much more
But maybe some other time 

I want to play with the big boys
I want to ride with the tough guys on a Japanese motorbike 
I want to hold your hand
Hey, what's your favorite band?
I want to look like they looked 
I want to shake like they shook, 
I want to take what they took
I want to get you high 
Don't ask me why 
It's just something I've got to do
I'll try to make it up to you 

I'm a bad ambassador for that elusive place you're searching for 
I want to show you so much more
But maybe some other time 

I'm not the Pope and I don't want to be 
The Archbishop of Canterbury 

I'm a bad ambassador for that elusive place you're searching for
I want to show you so much more 
Yeah I could show you so much more 
But I'm a bad ambassador 

Well, maybe some other time
