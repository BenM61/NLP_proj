Too much information 
Well I said you're good for nothing
Come on to the back 
I said your needles count for something 
Guess I'd better sell you now 
Guess I'd be around 

Singing for your questions 
But you've stolen all of my answers 
Too much entertainment drove 
And that's not all the colour 
Tell me that you've seen a ghost 
I'll tell you what to fear the most 

Stop! 
I said it's happening again! 
We're all wasting away! 
We're all wasting away! 

Too much information 
Well I said you're good for nothing
Stitch your part of counterfeit 
I said your far out here 
Taking at the roads 
Where you're taken for the simple codes 

Swimming with the fishes 
While the serpent waves his tongue 
With a belly full of splinters 
Now you see that I'm the one 
Tell me that you've seen a ghost 
I'll tell you what to fear the most 

Stop! 
I said it's happening again! 
We're all wasting away! 
We're all wasting away!
