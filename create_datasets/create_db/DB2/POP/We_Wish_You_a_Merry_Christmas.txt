We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year

Once in a year, it is not thought amiss
To visit our neighbors and sing out like this

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year

We want some figgy pudding
We want some figgy pudding
We want some figgy pudding
And a cup of good cheer

We won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some
So bring it out here

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year

Once in a year, it is not thought amiss
To visit our neighbors and sing out like this
Of friendship and love, good neighbors abound
And peace and goodwill the whole year around

Pace, frieden, salud, shalom
The words mean the same, whatever your home

Why can't we have Christmas
The whole year around
Why can't we have Christmas
The whole year around

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
