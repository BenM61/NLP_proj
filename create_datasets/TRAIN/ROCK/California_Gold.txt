Roach coach Mexican horn
Singing "La Cucaracha"
Suede face, beggin' for bones
Won't stop till he's got ya
Surfer-boy, skating to Hell
Be home by dinner
The rest of us trying to get
Richer, and phatter, and thinner, yeah

Crackers and the crack boys (mixin' it up)
Maria and the boy toys (mixin' it up)
Forty-fives and jet noise (mixin' it up)
Crackers and the crack
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold

Melting into California

Another long day on the floor
Of this desert oasis
That's alright as long as
The man; he pays us
Gonna live forever
Just like Deepak Chopra
'Cause we're cleansing our souls every
Night with a bar of soap opera
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Crackers and the crack boys (mixin' it up)
Maria and the boy toys (mixin' it up)
Forty-fives and jet noise (mixin' it up)
Crackers and the crack
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold

Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting, melting

Another long day on the floor
Of this desert oasis
There's a freak on the Hollywood sign
With a mind that can save us
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Crackers and the crack boys (mixin' it up)
Maria and the boy toys (mixin' it up)
Forty-fives and jet noise (mixin' it up)
Crackers and the crack
Melting into California gold
Crackers and the crack boys (mixin' it up)
Maria and the boy toys (mixin' it up)
Forty-fives and jet noise (mixin' it up)
Crackers and the crack
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold

Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
Melting into California gold
