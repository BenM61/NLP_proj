Just another dead end kid
Can't believe the things I did.
Lots of pretty ladies by my side,
Take it all for number one.
Wasted days with no harm done,
Always leave tomorrow open wide.

You took me by surprise, now my empty eyes had to realise
That my life wasn't the way I want to be.
(No) I'll never change my mind, couldn't be unkind,
Love is hard to find.
And I know by now I should say more,
But I have never been in love before.

Trying hard to make me stay,
I would turn the other way.
Glad that I had freedom at my call,
Every smile could be sincere.
No one ever got so near,
Then one day you came and took it all. 
 
You took me by surprise, now my empty eyes had to realise
That my life wasn't the way I want to be.
(No) I'll never change my mind, couldn't be unkind,
Love is hard to find.
And I know by now I should say more,
But I have never been in love before.
