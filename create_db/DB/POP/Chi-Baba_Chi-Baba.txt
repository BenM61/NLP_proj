(Chi-baba, chi-baba)

Many a year ago in old Sorrento
A certain ditty was quite a thing
Whenever a mother rocked her baby in Sorrento
This little ditty she used to sing

Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep!

Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep!

All the stars are in the skies ready to say goodnight
Can't you see your doll is sleepy too?
Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight
While she sings a lullaby to you

Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep!

All the stars are in the skies ready to say goodnight
Can't you see your doll is sleepy too?
Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight
While she sings a lullaby to you

Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa
My bambino go to sleep!
