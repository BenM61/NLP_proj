Kids today-they're all the same
All call themselves-some crazy name
All those drugs-they can't be sane
All that noise-affects their brains

And it's such a crime
How they waste their time
They can't get nowwhere
They've all gone Beat Crazy

Beat Crazy
They say the world-is in a mess
But they can talk-the way they dress
Can't get no jobs-can't get no careers

With safety pins-stuck through their ears
And it's such a crime
How they waste their time
They can't get nowwhere

They've all gone Beat Crazy
Beat Crazy
And if the Russians ever come
They'll all be beating bongo drums

So who'll defend-in World War III
Where could we turn-where would they be
And it's such a crime
How they waste their time

They can't get nowwhere
They've all gone Beat Crazy
Beat Crazy
