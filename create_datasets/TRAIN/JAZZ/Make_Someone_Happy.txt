Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart to sing to

One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're everything to

Fame if you win it,
Just comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you have found him, build your world around him

And Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy too

Ooh, Fame if you win it
Just comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you have found him, build your world around him

And make someone happy,
Make just one someone happy,
And you will be happy too.
You'll be happy too.
