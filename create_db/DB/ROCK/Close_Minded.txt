You know, everybodies always saying "You're really close minded. You only listen to one type of music, you only go to one type of show." And I say "Well you know what, this is the type of music we grew up on, this is the type of music we play. Punk rock is our way of life. It's how we chose to live. And everyone elses opinion is worth nothing. Don't worry about what I listen to, worry about your own life. Because I'm not going to change for you or anyone. I can't help it if you don't like it, and it's upto me if I don't want to listen to anything else. It's what's in our blood, it flows through our veins, so save your breath 'coz we're here to stay!
