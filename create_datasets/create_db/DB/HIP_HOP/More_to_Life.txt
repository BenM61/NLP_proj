Yeah yeah oh 
I've got it all, but I feel so deprived
I go up, I come down and I'm emptier inside
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
And why can't I let go

There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure, there's gotta be more
Than wanting more

I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment I'm half way out the door
Onto the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing

There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure, there's gotta be more
I'm wanting more

I'm always waiting on something other than this
Why am I feelin' like there's something I missed 

There's gotta be more to life 
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure

There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more to life
More to life, more to life 
There's gotta be more to life
More to life, more to life 
There's gotta be more to life
More to life
