Stealaway
My little darling
Far away
You and I

Lookin' at you and the way about you
Fallin' come easily
No one could ever guess we'd stand here
Lookin' to disagree

Where did it all go wrong?
It seems we had too many stars in our eyes
Now we are lookin' back to see
How many stars were lies

Stealaway
My little darling
Far away
You and I
Helplessly
Hangin' on
So darlin'
Stealaway

How did it get so damn confusin'?
Who cares who's wrong or right?
We gotta move out of all this darkness
To see a little light

Stealaway
My little darling
Far away
You and I
Helplessly
Hangin' on
So darlin'
Stealaway
