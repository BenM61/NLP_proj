There was a time my world belonged with you
But I was so misguided in my youth
I couldn't help but drink this poison brew
You had a strange perception of the truth

Oh, baby, I remember you 
Oh, baby, I remember you 

'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never see or hear the crashing of the sea
The tempers rise, that stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony

I was aware that danger lay ahead
And I couldn't bare this stranger in my head
Have you got a face (have you got a face), have you got a soul
Well, he ain't got nothing, not even a hole

I gave a try a long time ago
When your fate was designed, but you didn't know
Oh baby, I remember you

'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never see or hear the crashing of the sea
The tempers rise, that stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony

'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never hear or feel the crashing of the sea
The tempers rise, that stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony
