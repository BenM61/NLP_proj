Roc (Barack) nation, what up?
Corporation thuggin' what up?
It's a new day!

D.c.-mix
Yeah

My president is black, my maybach, too
And I'll be god damned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
(hey) I'm headed to D.C, anybody feel me?

My president is black
In fact
He's half-white
So even in a racist mind, he's half-right
So if you got a racist mind, you be alright

My president is black, but his house is all white
Rosa parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly
So I'ma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes, already got my own shoes
I was hot

Before Barack
Imagine what I'm gon' do
Hello miss America
Hey pretty lady,
Red, white, and blue flag, wave for me, baby
Never thought I'd say this shit
Baby, I'm good
You can keep your puss
I don't want no more bush (shit)
No more war, no more Iraq
No more white lies, the president is black!

My president is black, my maybach, too
And I'll be god damned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
