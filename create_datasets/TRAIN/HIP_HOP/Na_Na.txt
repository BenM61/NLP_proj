I'll make a pit stop, hit your hot spot
Back seat drop top, 'till your draws drop
Trouble with cops, rooftop will be our next spot
Non-stop going hard just like a sweat shop

(A little bit of nana is good for me)

(Chico)
I got a girl with a kid but I am leavin' town
She's my life, not my wife, but she's not around
I'm on my way out of state and I am counting down
But my girl will never know how I am getting down
(A little bit of nana is good for me)

I got chicks in la just to rub me down
I got ladies on the low hid in chinatown
Even got worldwide chicks hittin' me on my cell
Since they love it how I do it, it ain't hard to tell
(A little bit of nana is good for me)
So tell me what you want

He's been gone five hours and I am settled in
To make it more real the night just began
So when the clock strikes 10 tonight
I'll be dipped and I'll be headin' out
(A little bit of nana is good for me)

No doubt my arms is where you need to be
So grab your things you're comin' home with me
On top of moaning while you're bonin' me
I'll curl your toes and then you off to sleep
(A little bit of nana is good for me)
