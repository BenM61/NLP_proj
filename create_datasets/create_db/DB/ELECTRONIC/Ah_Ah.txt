Who'd you gonna talk to, who'd you gonna see about it?
Some of us cannot imagine having fun without it
Some of us decided we just wouldn't make a mess
Baby, baby, baby, why'd you put on mama's dress now?

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

What you gonna say now, what you gonna do about it?
Girl, you're in that kind of trouble, I can live without it
Mama up and told me, baby, she's already split
Left you for another brother with a cleaner fit now

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

What you gonna do now, what you gonna say about it?
All the guys are home in bed while you keep spinning 'round it
All the little twisted stars will twinkle just for fun
Baby, baby, baby, why'd you borrow mama's gun now?

Who'd you gonna talk to, who'd you gonna see about it
Some of us cannot imagine having fun without it
Some of us decided we just wouldn't make a mess
Baby, baby, baby, why'd you put on mama's dress now?

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
