Back to summertime 
It was almost 6 months to the day
Eyes clock to his hand 
Liquid crystals on his watch catch rays of morning peeking through 
Moving the pillows out of the way 
Tries to make the time 
Falls asleep with his watch on again 
Cracked LCD

He has got last years summertime, the one she liked
On daylight saving time, hoping that the world catch up with him 
Before he catches her 
It happens once a year 
She had better run
Was summertime for all 
Alpine retreat off the A40 
Cracked LCD
