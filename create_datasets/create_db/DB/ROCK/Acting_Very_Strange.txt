If I step into the light
And hold it in my hand
Nothing left to see,
Nothing left for me, anyway
I feel the world is slipping
Out of reach (I'm all alone)
It's a memory
It's a memory that used to be

In a little while
I know it'll be too late
Somebody help me, please
'Cause you're acting very strange
You're acting very strange
You're acting very strange
You're acting very strange

Oh, you never come here any more
You never even call
To see if I'm alright
Get me through the night
Like you used to do

In a little while
I know it'll be too late
Now I'm certain
That you're acting very strange
You're acting very strange
You're acting very strange
You're acting very strange

Another lonely day without you, oh
I'm acting very strange without you, oh
Another lonely day without you, oh
I'm acting very strange without you, oh

Oh, the place is getting very hot
I'm afraid to stay
Something's going on
Something's very wrong with you and me
If I reach out to touch your face
There's nothing there to touch
It's a memory
It's a memory of you and me

In a little while
I know it'll be too late
Now I'm certain
That you're acting very strange
You're acting very strange
You're acting very strange
You're acting very strange

I'm acting very strange without you, oh
Another lonely day without you, oh
I'm acting very strange without you, oh
Another lonely day without you, oh

You're acting very strange

I'm acting very strange without you, oh
