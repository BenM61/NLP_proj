Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'Cause the pain came down like the storm
I remained holdin' on

'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

I've been thinkin' 'bout, I've been thinkin' 'bout
I've been thinkin' 'bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose

I know it's a feelin' that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong?

Emotions th-th-they linger on
I guess 'cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls, I need your warm
The taste of your mouth, girl I need your warm

Good food and love, I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so I'm a keep dreamin' on
It's kinda like 'The Breakup' with Jen and Vince Vaughn

Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'Cause the pain came down like the storm
I remained holdin' on

'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

They say you don't kn-kn-know what you got
'Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such oh a lot
But the feeling's not as strong

We were like two birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at sayin' goodbye

I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you, my God
I spent many years tryin' to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed

The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'Cause the pain came down like the storm
I remained holdin' on

'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way 'cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared

My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together

'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
