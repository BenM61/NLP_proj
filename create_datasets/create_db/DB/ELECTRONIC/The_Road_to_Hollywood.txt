It's a dirty little world
Full of dirty little complications
And I've been kneeling at your feet
I've been holding up the cross for us now
And it's a sad sad sad song
Yeah it's a sad sad sad song

We're all on the road to Hollywood
See you on the road to Hollywood
Hollywood

It's a situation lost in the midst
Of the bitch renaissance
And I've been burying the past
In a place that I can't locate now.
And it's the season of love
Yeah it's the season of love

We're all on the road to Hollywood
See you on the road to Hollywood
Hollywood

I got my teenage kicks
From a middle aged man in slacks
So forgive me if it takes a while
For me to laugh.

We're all on the road to Hollywood
See you on the road to Hollywood
Hollywood
