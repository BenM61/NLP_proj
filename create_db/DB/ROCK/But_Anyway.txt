I lied and told her I loved her
She didn't care but anyway
I told her we'd still be friends
And she didn't care but anyway
I tried last week for to call her
She wasn't home but anyway I think I'll spend my life alone
I really don't care right now, but anyway 

[Chorus]
It's a state of affairs and a state of emotions
The kind of thing that you must understand
I tell you one thing, you'll tell me another
We walk away, maybe even then shake hands

I'm quitting cigarette smoking, it's bad for me
But anyway, I don't think the TV was joking
When it told me this, but anyway
The newsman said not to sit on strange toilet seats
It's my life he's trying to save, but anyway
I found out that I got eye cancer
Too many television waves, but anyway

[Chorus]

Someday an answer will find us, quite a long shot
But anyway, I think the past the past is behind us
Be real confusing if not but anyway
I put all my hope in tomorrow, it's gonna be great
I can tell but anyway I see a new, a new day dawning
I like to sleep late, oh, well but anyway

[Chorus]
