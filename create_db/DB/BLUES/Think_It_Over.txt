Think it over one more time
Think it over one more time
Can't you see that you were meant for me
So think it over one more time

Tell me that you changed your mind
Tell me that you changed you mind
Send your mind, telling him the time
So think it over one more time

We've been together for long
We've been together for long
If we should part, it would break my heart
So think it over one more time

Tell me what I've done wrong?
Tell me what I've done wrong?
You know I'll do anything for you
So think it over one more time

Baby, don't you wanna go home?
Baby, don't you wanna go home?
Baby, don't you wanna go home?
Baby, don't you wanna go home?
Baby, don't you wanna go home?

We've been together for long
We've been together for long
You know I'll do anything for you
So think it over one more time

Think it over one more time
Think it over one more time
Can't you see you were meant for me
So think it over one more time

Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby

Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby

Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby
Think it over, baby
