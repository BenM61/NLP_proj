Where the Nile flows
And the moon glows
On the silent sand
Of an ancient land

When a dream dies
And the heart cries
Shahadaroba 
Is the word they whisper low

Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
Means the future 
Is much better than the past

Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
In the future 
You will find a love that lasts

So when tears flow
And you don't know
What on earth to do
And your world is blue
When your dream dies
And your heart cries
Shahadaroba 
Fate knows what's best for you

Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
Face the future 
And forget about the past
Shahadaroba, Shahadaroba
In the future 
You will find a love that lasts
Shahadaroba
