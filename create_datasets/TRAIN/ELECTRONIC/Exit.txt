Technology can actually increase privacy
The question is
Why are our private details that are transmitted online
Or why our private details that are stored on our personal devices
Any different than the details of the private records of our lives
That are stored in our private journals

I think, you know
The same that you don't care about the right of privacy
Because you got nothing to hide is no different than saying
You don't care about freedom of speech
Because you got nothing to say

It's a deeply anti-social principle
Because rights are not just individual
They 're collective
And what may not have value to you today
May have value to an entire, you know, population
The entire people, the entire way of life tomorrow
And if you don't stand up for it, then who will?
And if you don't stand up for it
Then who will?
