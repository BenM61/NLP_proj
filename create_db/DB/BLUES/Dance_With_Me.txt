I want to dance with you baby
But I don?t move around so fast
I want to dance with you baby
But I don?t move around so fast
You really movin me baby
And you know that I can?t last

Dance in the morning baby dance till the afternoon
Ooh, Dance in the morning baby dance till the afternoon
Well, I feel so good but I know I got to stop real soon

Wake me shake me 
Keep me on my feet
And out of this world
Every time we meet

I?m dancing with you baby, doing the best I can
I gotta keep on dancing baby and then we?ll make romance

I gotta rock with you baby 
Till my feet won't move on the floor
I gotta rock with you baby
Till my feet won't move on the floor
I gotta rock as long as I can baby 
And then I?ll have to rock some more

So, wake me shake me 
Keep me on my feet
And out of this world
Every time we meet

I gotta keep on rocking
Rock as long as I can
I gotta keep on rocking
As long as I be your man
