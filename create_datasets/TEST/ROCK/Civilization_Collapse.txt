Let there be darkness
Let there be blood tonight
Let there be riots
Come start the fires tonight

Can't you see, our people have got no choice
But to fight them back
Can't you see, the change of consciousness
Demands a total attack
Total attack
Total... attack!

Finally they're swarming in a long forgotten youth
The cause of inequality, a paradise for few
Superior, inferior, a vast insanity
When justice is tyranny
Anarchy is breaking out, destruction marks it's way
Burning temples turning into dark crypts of decay
The mighty are the fallen now, the weak are on the hunt
Battle on many fronts

There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
Now let the riots begin
Convulsed by protest
And civilization collapse

Monumental terror spreading like a pestilence
From suburbs to the center of colossal arrogance
Cascade of aggression merely harvest seeds of hate
Storming the barricades
Cities of inception burn into the ashes in one night
Imperators crying at this grand historic sight
Entering a death spiral, tonight they see their fate
Doomed to reincarnate

There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
So let the riots begin
A social unrest
And civilization collapse
