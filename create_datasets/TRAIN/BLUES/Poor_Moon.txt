Ever since I was a kid,
You sure looked good to me.
Now I'm a man full-grown, and I
Know what I hate to see.
(Oh well.)
It might be tomorrow.
(Oh well.)
I just don't know.
(Oh well.)
It might take years.
I wonder when they're going to
Destroy your face?
It may seem silly, but I don't like
What's been coming down.
'Cause you've been looking good too long,
To change your color now.
(Oh well.)
They might test some bomb
(Oh well.)
And scar your skin.
(Oh well.)
I don't think they care, so,
I wonder when they're going to
Destroy your face?
I hope I see you in the sky
At night, when I get old.
I hope you'll look about the same,
As when I was a boy.
(Oh well.)
It gets me to gasping.
(Oh well.)
When I think about
(Oh well.)
What they might do.
I wonder when they're going to
Destroy your face?
Well, you sure look good,
In the sky at night.
And it's sad to say,
You won't shine so bright.
Some day,
When they're through with you.
I bet you've seen the cloud we make,
That covers up our rain.
I wonder if you'll hide behind
A shroud like that, some day?
(Oh well.)
I'm worried about it.
(Oh well.)
It makes me sigh.
(Oh well.)
I just can't help it.
I wonder when they're going to
Destroy your face?
(Oh well.)
It might be tomorrow.
(Oh well.)
I just don't know.
(Oh well)
It might take years.
I wonder when they're going to
Destroy your face?
