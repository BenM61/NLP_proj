As I wandered past through the old gray house
And the children laughed for they'd found me out
And the silly things I do when I'm around you
Make for wanting to believe that I had found you

And if Sunday rain
And if Sunday rain
And if Sunday rain
I don't wanna know
Just like I won't forget your face
When I awake to find you here

Oh my lover won't you get away?
Love or loathe, I need to feel again
It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before, but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to choose the path that we all walk along

Oh my lord I pray for just one day
Love or loathe, I need to feel again
It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before, but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to choose the path that we all walk along

When you love, and your love, it could never lie
Oh, when you love, and your love it could never die
Oh, when you love, and your love it could never lie
Oh, when you love, and your love it could never die

Oh, hymn for her
Oh, hymn for her
Oh, hymn for her
Oh, hymn for her

It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before, but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place
I've been hurt before, but all the scars have rearranged
It won't hurt to choose the path that we all walk along

Oh my lord I pray for just one day
Love or loathe, I need to feel again
