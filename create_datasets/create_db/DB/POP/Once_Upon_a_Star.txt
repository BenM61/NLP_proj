La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ah ah

So far another year,
Face upon the wall now is it really you,
You turn but no ones there,
Lights now the scene is set,
The final act the end of one who
Loved and gave.
Took nothin' in return,
And as the curtain falls you hear,
Them call for more,
But in your heart you know it's over, it's over,

Woh oh don't let it bring you down,
You made them laugh you made them cry you know,
Woh oh, and when the lights are low,
In their eyes you'll always be a star

Remember those were the days,
Your name in lights up in the stars,
Your friends all drinking champagne,
From your hand,
Now all that was only yesterday,
Well so it seems but still the years have passed you by
The times have changed so fast,
Now memories and Norma Jean blues in the night,
Are all that's left of yesterday, yesterday.

Woh oh don't let it bring you down,
You made them laugh you made them cry you know,
Woh oh, and when the lights are low,
In their eyes you'll always be a star

Star, star, star
