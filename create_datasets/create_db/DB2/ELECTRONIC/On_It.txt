Wait (wait), I masturbate
Let another motherfucker come and share my fate and pray (pray)
Catastrophe
I'm a kill a motherfucker with a fax machine and break, it down, for you, to see

'Cause I'm on it, yes indeed
On it, watch me bleed
On it, rest in peace
On it, hide
You are, 
So good so far
So good so far

Better than this, better than that
Better watch out when you get me goin'
Better than this, better than that
Better watch out when you get me goin' (goin' goin' goin' goin')

Fake (fake), I'm not awake
It ain't my fault you can't relate
Towed (towed), corporate accounts
Gonna hurt somebody with my 24 ounce and break, it down, for you, to see

'Cause I'm on it, yes indeed
On it, watch me bleed
On it, rest in peace
On it, hide
You are, 
So good so far

I'm gonna be the one with my face in a magazine
I'm gonna be the one I have to face

Better than this, better than that
Better watch out when you get me goin'
Better than this, better than that
Better watch out
In the morning I have come
Rock the walls, rock the bass
In the morning I'm gone
Putting you in your place
In the morning I have come
Rock the walls, rock the bass
In the morning I'm gone
Putting you in your place
In the morning I have come

Come

'Cause I'm on it, yes indeed
On it, watch me bleed
On it, rest in peace
On it, hide
You are, 
So good so far

I'm gonna be the one with my face in a magazine
I'm gonna be the one I have to face

Better than this, better than that
Better watch out when you get me goin'
Better than this, better than that
Better watch out when you get me goin'
