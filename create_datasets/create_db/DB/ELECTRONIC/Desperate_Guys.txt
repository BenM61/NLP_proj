Was it more than attraction and a physical lust?
Her loins in my imagination have urged an inconceivable touch
I was planning on, I mean wishing on
How embarrassed I'd've been if you knew what I was thinking of

And woah when it started, my first thought was love
Then just lust, 'cause when I heard you start speaking about "warm"
In the evening I saw you, you were warming a bass up
Your hair covered your face up
I was acting indifferent at the Merch booth, putting on make-up

We met up at a party, at a spot on a yacht
Eyes spun around, we were docked
I crossed my fingers, but I didn't beg
Cause I knew you knew
Cause I knew you knew I liked you

I knew you knew I liked you
I knew you knew it
But I figured desperate guys never had a chance

I figured desperate guys never had a chance with you

Plus you were wishing, we're conjoined at the tongue
Can you hear me thinking I should stop?
I crossed my fingers, but I didn't beg
Cause I knew you knew
Cause I knew you knew I liked you

I knew you knew I liked you
I knew you knew it
But I figured desperate guys never had a chance

I knew you knew I liked you
I knew you knew it
But I figured desperate guys never had a chance with you

I figured desperate guys never had a chance with you

I knew that desperate guys never had a chance with you
