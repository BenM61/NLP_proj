Yea, yea, widen your view
And tune on into the frequency
Chill all alone
Love is the rule
Follow it to the frequency

Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Couple clubs and I'm in the zone
Rather take the party home
Took it in the groove
Wet sex passionate in a dark tomb
In a dark tomb
If it twine inside then hold tight, never let it loose
Wet it up
Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Couple girls, couple girls make a nigga feel less lonely
I trust them, my riders
Easing my frequency
Curiosity, is the key to my frequency
Explore what you find
And now

Yea, yea, widen your view

I'm real close stroking in another room
Done up 'til sunup
I'm done up 'til sunup
I'm real close stroking in another room
Wet and passionate
Real close, shed tears and the sweaty groove
And I love the love
Hot sweat in the sheets never speak on cue in the cyclone
Cyclone, wet uh
A couple trippy girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms
Now a couple nudes
Sucking boobs
Seeing double, seeing double
And it zoom

Yea, yeow, oh, boo

Yea, yea, widen your view

Yea, yea, color outside the lines
And tune in to the frequency
Chill all alone
Love is the rule
