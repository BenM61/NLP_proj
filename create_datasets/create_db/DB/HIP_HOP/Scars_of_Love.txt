I've seen my whole world come tumbling down 
Without a reason why 
I've seen lovers walking hand in hand 
And I cry as they pass by 
I take my life one step at a time 
Girl I take it slow 
And I need you to be by my side 
'Cause I love you so 
As we now wear those... 

Scars of love, scars of love 
Determined to tear me apart 
Scars of love, scars of love 
Those deadly scars of love 

People tell me that I'm going mad 
But I don't listen to a word they say 
They don't understand the way I feel 
'Cause I love you more everyday 
Hug me, squeeze me all through the night 
Girl your all I need, girl your all I need 
Love, attention and all kinds of affection 
Are what we need to succeed 
But now we got to wear those... 

Scars of love, scars of love 
Like heavy chains upon my heart 
Scars of love, scars of love 
Those deadly scars of love 

People always talk about the bad things that you done 
But I can't leave you girl cause you are the one 
I love you when you love me and that's all that really matters 
So why are my emotions always being scattered 
Time and time again, I talked to all my friends 
They're saying our love is about to end 
But I can't live without you girl, you know that this is true 
For the simple reason that I love you 

Scars of love, scars of love 
Determined trying to tear me apart 
Scars of love, scars of love 
Like heavy chains upon my heart 
Scars of love, those many scars of love 
Those deadly scars of love, those deadly scars of love 

Knowing me you will find somebody new 
So now I tell you this 
That when your gone you'll be the one I love 
When your gone you'll be the one I miss 
But for now girl you are by my side 
And I hope and pray, girl I hope and pray 
Hope is there that you will always be 
Hope is there you'll stay 
We're wishing on our... 

Scars of love, scars of love 
Determined trying to tear me apart 
Scars of love, scars of love 
Those deadly scars of love 
Scars of love, scars of love 
Like heavy chains upon my heart 
Scars of love, scars of love 
Those deadly scars of love
