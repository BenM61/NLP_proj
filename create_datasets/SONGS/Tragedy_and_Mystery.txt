Winter displayed in a snow white haze
Fires burning brightly in the night

Tragedy and mystery
Open your mind and you will see

From waterfalls I hear romantic calls
Feather in a ray of sunlight

Tragedy and mystery
Open your mind and you will see

Your world is changing though you cannot see
And there's no room for secrecy
Your world is changing faster everyday
And there's no truth in what they say

Two by two
My heaven made blue
Life in a world of love and truth

Tragedy and mystery
Open your mind and you will see

Your world is changing though you cannot see
And there's no room for secrecy
Your world is changing faster everyday
And there's no truth in what they say
