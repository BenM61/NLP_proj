If the tears 
Should ever cloud your eyes 
If the rain 
Should ever darken 
The skies above you 
You'll be alright 
'Cause I'm here, I'm here 
And I'll turn your 
Grey skies back to blue 
'Cause there's nothing 
I won't do for you 

Just a whisper away 
I'm closer to you 
Than the air that you breathe 
Believe me it's true 
I will never leave 
I promise to you 
Forever, forever we will be 

If tomorrow 
Feels like a lonely room 
Without someone 
There holding you 
Know you'll be alright 
I'll be at your side 
At your side 
Hold on tight 
You know I'll never be too far 
'Cause I wrote this promise on your heart 

Just a whisper away 
I'm closer to you 
Than the air that you breathe 
Believe me it's true 
I will never leave 
I promise to you 
Forever, forever we will be 

Whenever you're 
Stranded in the cold 
Remember my love's an overcoat 
I'm here to keep you 
Safe in my arms 
Where you belong 

Just a whisper away 
I'm closer to you 
Than the air that you breathe 
Believe me it's true 
I will never leave 
I promise to you 
Forever, forever we will be 

Whenever you're afraid 
I'll be your hiding place 
I won't be late for you 

Just a whisper away 
I'm closer to you 
Than the air that you breathe 
Believe me it's true 
I will never leave 
I promise to you 
Forever, forever we will be
