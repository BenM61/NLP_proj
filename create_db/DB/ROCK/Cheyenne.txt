Part I
I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to see you cry, I don't want to hurt you once more 
I don't want to leave now, I don't want no sight for sore eyes 
Gone sore of all the tears that we cryed

Part II
Hey, come here with the guitar! Okay?

Recall the times we met - so wild and free 
We had our ups and we had our downs
But the sweet sweet rock'n'roll always played on the radio
We grew up and we learned the rules 
You gotta fight to win otherwise you'll lose
Oh Cheyenne, you imprisoned me in liberty 
Never ever showed me no sympathy

Remember that night, how you made me cry, 
I almost lost my mind 
When it appeared that the winner was you and the loser was me 
That night, that endless lonely nite...
I just can't think of you, with another man 
Oh Cheyenne, you must understand

So stay right where you are, I'll pick you up anyway, any day around I'll be with you
So you don't have to worry, you don't have to worry, Baby, don't you worry no more

You told me that I'm to sensitive but I didn't ask for sympathy,
All I wanted was to love you softly
With the sweet, sweet rock'n'roll played on the radio
I tried hard to fight my feelings down 
I tried to hide 'em inside, tried to push your love away
But you must have seen the fire burn in my eyes - and it's still burning!

It's hard to believe we lived it through, I can't believe we can't relive it 
But if you see me walking down the street
Just raise you window to the sweet sweet sound of rock'n'roll
Sweet, Sweet sound of rock'n'roll
