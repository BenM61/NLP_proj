We're back from the dead
Climbing from the coffin
We don't come here often
Or so it is said

We're back from the grave
Recovered from our coma
More body than aroma
It's life that we crave.

Watch our hearts pump as we go back into action (go!)
Giving satisfaction and getting some too
Hear our blood roar as we roll a lucky seven
From hell or from heaven, we're past but we're due
(But we're due but we're due but we're due)

We're back from the dead
Putting up resistance
Clinging to existence
And ready for bed

We're out of the shroud
An end to the becalming
Reversing the embalming
And back with our crowd

Nothing's more fun than flipping off the reaper (no!)
We're back on our beeper heading straight for the top
It's not so hard to avoid a mid-death crisis
No coffee, no spices, but rock 'till you drop
('Til you drop, 'til you drop, til you drop)

We're back and we're glad
Nothing ever stops us
We're our own synopsis
And here to be had

We're back from the dead
And this time we're not stopping
We've brought some corn for popping
And we're banging your head

Better off dead, still better off living (yeah!)
The gift keeps on giving and it's taking no more
No time like the past, no rhyme like the present
The first shall be last, and we're slamming death's door
(-ming death's door, -ming death's door, -ming death's door)
