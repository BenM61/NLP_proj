If I loved you
Time and again
I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come
In an easy way
Round in circles I'd go

Longing to tell you
But afraid and shy
Id let my golden chances
Pass me by

Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go
In the mist of day,
Never never to know
How I loved you
If I loved you
