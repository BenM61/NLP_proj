There's thieves among us, painting the wall 
With all kinds of lies, the lies I never told at all 
What's in my pocket? You never knew 
You didn't know me well, so well as I knew you

And I know and you know too 
That love like ours is terrible news 
But that won't stop me crying 
No, that won't stop me crying over you 

I'm not a prophet, old love is in me 
New love just seeps right in and makes me guilty 
Why do you look like that? It's not all that bad 
I'll see you sometime, sometimes lonely isn't sad 

And I know and you know too 
That love like ours is terrible news 
But that won't stop me crying 
No, that won't stop me crying over you 

We two are makers, just made this mess 
Two broken hearts don't break any less 
There's thieves among us, painting the walls 
With all kinds of lies, the lies I never told at all 

And I know, and you know too 
That love like ours is terrible news 
But that won't stop me crying 
That won't stop me crying over you 
No, that won't stop me crying over you
