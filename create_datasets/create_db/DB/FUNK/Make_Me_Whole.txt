Darlin' I want you to listen,
I stayed up all night,
So I can get this thing right.
And I don't think,
There's anything missin'.
'Cause a person like you,
Made it easy to do.

I've waitin' for so long,
To sing to you this song.

Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven,
Your smile could heal a million souls.
Your love completes my existence.
Your the other half that makes me whole.
Your the only other half that makes me whole.

I think the angels are your brothers (ya ya)
They told you about me.
Said your just what she needs.
And I find myself,
Thanking your mother.
For giving birth to a saint,
My spirit flies when I say your name.

If there's one that's true,
It's that I was born to love you.

(and) Your eyes are the windows to heaven,
Your smile could heal a million souls.
Your love completes my existence.
Your the other half that Makes Me Whole.
Your the only other half that Makes Me Whole.

You make my dreams, 
Come true over and over again.
And I honestly, truly believe,
You and me are written in the stars.

And in my whole life through,
Just given thanks to you.

Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven.
Your smile could heal a million souls.
Your  love completes my existence.
Your the other  half that makes me whole.
Your the only other half that makes me whole.
