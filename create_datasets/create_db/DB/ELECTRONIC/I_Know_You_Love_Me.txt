Why are you hesitating
How long must I keep waiting
I know you say you love me
Why don't you show me
You talk but you don't listen
You don't know what you've been missing
I just don't have time to play these games
My love is never ending
Too little time we're spending
This broken heart is mending
C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me

I know you love me, love me
I know you love me, love me 
I know you love me, love me 
I know you love me, love me 
Why do you treat me so bad

It's been six whole weeks
And we don't even speak
I don't know what to do
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
The way you've been treating me
Makes it so easy to see
This is not how it should be
I think you wanna be free
I think you wanna be free
Why do you treat me so bad
Why do you treat me so bad

We've been together so long
Why don't you tell me whats wrong
I'm gonna try to hold on
That's why I'm singing this song
That's why I'm singing this song
Why are you hesitating
How long must I keep waiting
I know you say you love me
Why don't you show me
Why don't you show me

I know you love me, love me
I know you love me, love me 
I know you love me, love me 
I know you love me, love me 
Why do you treat me so bad

You talk but you don't listen
You don't know what you've been missing
I just don't have time to play these games
