So get up
So get up
So get up
So get up
So get up
So get up
So get up
So get up
So get up
So get up

Pretty soon it'll all turn to dust (so get up)

The end of the earth is upon us
Pretty soon it'll all turn to dust
So get up
Forget the past
Go outside and have a blast

So get up

The end of the earth is upon us
Pretty soon it'll all turn to dust
So get up
Forget the past
Go outside and have a blast
Go out of your mind, go insane
To a place that you never been before

So get up
