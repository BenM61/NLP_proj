Brave girl replies
When you come back, I'll be gone
Read off her rules,
When in control I move on
Thoughtful or sad,
No need to ask

You in her eyes a sister someone
Who's been where
She's roaming now
Flashes of home
And people there
Pressured caught up she feels,
Measured all up revealed

I still haven't walked my distance
I'm not ready to return

Independent on my way to become I

Sunday no sign,
Why did I meke you meet me here?
No cause for doubt,
But feeling sustains
When mix up clears
Easy and loose,
Unsure confused

It doesn't take much to knock me
I've been living a sheltered life
