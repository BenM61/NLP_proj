I was dreaming when I jumped the lights
Busy scaling dizzy heights
Hummed a somewhat strangely familiar tune
My eyes as wide as open books
And from my ears upon two hooks
A big smile was hanging there like a crescent moon
 
It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the gods of love decide to knock
You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it you'll never know a better day
 
Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour stone cold sober
 
The officer who stopped me said: "lucky you didn't wind up dead!"
And he guessed that I was over and above
I hoped he'd only caution me, and I made a plea for clemency
On the grounds that I was only drunk on love
 
Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour stone cold sober
 
It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the gods of love decide to knock
You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it you'll never know a better day
