I was born and raised in a ghetto
I was born and raised in a ghetto
I'm a woman of the ghetto
Listen to me, legislator

How do you raise your kids in a ghetto
How do you raise your kids in a ghetto
Feed one child and starve another
Tell me, tell me, legislator

How do make your bread in the ghetto?

How do make your bread in the ghetto?

Baked from the souls in the ghetto

Tell me, tell me, Legislator?
I'm proud, free
Black, that is me
But I'm a woman of the ghetto

Strong true
My eyes ain't blue
I am a woman of the ghetto
