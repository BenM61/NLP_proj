Stay way from me cause I'm in my sin
Stay way from me cause I'm in my sin
If this place gets raided, it's me and my gin

Don't try me nobody, cause you will never win
Don't try me nobody, cause you will never win
I'll fight the army, navy, just me an' my gin

Any bootlegger sho' is a pal o' mine
Any bootlegger sho' is a pal o' mine
'Cause a good ol' bottle a gin will get it all the time

When I'm feeling high ain't nothing I won't do
When I'm feeling high ain't nothing I won't do
Keep me full o' liquor an' ill sure be nice to you

I don't want no clo's an' I don't need no bed
I don't want no clo's an' I don't need no bed
I don't want no pork chops, jus' gimme gin instead
