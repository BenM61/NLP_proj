Somewhere down on a back street
Way down deep in the back seat
where I first learned how to moan your name
I remember on the night I met you
Oh, sweet mama, I just can't forget you
And I can't stop thinkin' about your crazy love

Crazy love, crazy love
I love you mama
But your too bad to tame
Crazy love, crazy love
I love you mama ah, ah

Crazy love, crazy love
I love you mama
But your too bad to tame

Laid up here lookin' at my shoes
Stretched out with these hotel blues
I wish you'd only just call me on the phone
There ain't no doubt and I don't mean maybe
Oh, I just can't forget about you baby
I can't stop thinkin' about your crazy love

Crazy love, crazy love
I love you mama
But your too bad to tame
Crazy love, crazy love
I love you mama, oh no
