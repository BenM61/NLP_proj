Hey! 

What a night, what a city 
Girl, you sho' is lookin' pretty 
Tryin' to catch a cool one 
Checkin' for a little fun 

Sarah, oh Sarah, honey, is that you? 
Is that you, baby? 

Got yo' good shoes on 
Ribbon in your hair 
That skirt ain't talkin' to long 
I can see your underwear 

Sarah, oh Sarah, honey, is that you? 
I think it's you, baby 

Hey! 

Girl, I hate to be the one 
to tell you that your day is done 
you best to get your shit and go'n 
Or Tina won't be alone 
I'd never raise my hand to you 
No tellin' what my foot'll do 
Ah, I'm kiddin' baby, that's a joke 
Maybe I just got my heart broke 
There's only one thing left to do 

Sarah, oh Sarah, honey, is that you? 
Is that you? 

Yeah! Oh! Yeah! Ow! Ow!  

Is that you, baby, is that you? 
I think it's you 

(Good, one more take)
