Oh we're goin' out tonight
Finger poppin' you look out-a sight
Won't be no stoppin' all the discotheques
Better be ready we're gonna hit em hard
Hard and heavy
Party strong all night long
Just you girl and me

You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady oh
Oh what a night for dancing
Oh what a night for romancing

We're gonna laugh and dance half the night away
We're gonna scream and shout while the music plays
Then around about two, tell you what I'm gonna do
Girl I'm gonna take you home and stick plenty love to you
Let's get it on all night long, just you girl and me

You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady oh
Oh what a night for dancing
Oh what a night for romancing
