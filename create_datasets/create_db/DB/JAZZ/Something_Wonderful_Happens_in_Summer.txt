Something wonderful happens in summer
When the sky is a heavenly blue
You fall in love - you fall in love
With someone who loves you too

Something wonderful happens in summer
When the moon makes you feel all aglow
You fall in love - you fall in love
You want the whole world to know

You carve initials on a tree
You kiss and exchange a ring
June and July go by
Your heart sings "ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling"

Something wonderful happens in summer
And it happens to only a few
But when it does - yes when it does
You'll feel wonderful - it happened to you
