Late one day, I led Spanish boy astray

His name was Antonio

Took him out, and of his charms I had no doubt
Stayed drinking mojitos
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near
In my ear, he whispered and shed a tear
Oh my bambino
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near

And in the morning when I woke there was no Antonio
Just some money that he'd left for the memory of me
And oh my beautiful guitar, that's what really broke my heart
Had been stolen by the two-faced low lothario

One night stand, lover you got out of hand
Oh yeah you went too far
Big mistake, falling for a first class fake
Who left me for my guitar
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near
Through my tears, I would have to find my dear
Guano Antonio
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near

And in the morning when I woke there was no Antonio
Just some money that he'd left for the memory of me
And oh my beautiful guitar, that's what really broke my heart
Had been stolen by the two-faced lothario

Oh my beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you
My beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you

Oh I know, oh I know, oh I know Antonio
Won't be back as I discovered on his track
He's gone back to Mexico, oh Antonio

Oh my beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you
My beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you

And in the morning when I woke there was no Antonio
Just some money that he'd left for the memory of me
And oh my beautiful guitar, that's what really broke my heart
Had been stolen by the two-faced lothario
Yeah had been stolen by the two-faced lothario
Yeah had been stolen by the dirty two-faced lover bastardo
