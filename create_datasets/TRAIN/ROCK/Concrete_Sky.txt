Faith has a good side still everyone she ever loved they all turned bad
Constance his own way of breathing and you know
You couldn't will him to survive
Couldn't will him if you if you tried, and there's a concrete sky
Falling from the trees again and you know now why
It's not coming round too soon
It's harder than a heartbreak too

I've seen your good side but I still don't know just what it is
That you might want
See you've got your own way of moving
And you know you could save me
Save your soul, I'll save some of you
Save my soul, feel like I'm falling fell like I'm falling
And there's a concrete sky 
Falling from the trees again and you know now why
It's not coming round too soon, it's harder than a heartbreak too
It's tough enough what love will do

So much time gets lost in my mind
But I know now what I must rely on
It's a sound and forgetting, ain't the worst thing 
I've been out walking don't do too much talking
Wouldn't take too much time, wouldn't take all your time
Cos it's as precious as mine Save my soul, I'll save some for you
Save my soul feel like I'm falling feel like I'm falling
And there's a concrete sky
Falling from the trees again and you know now why
It's not coming round too soon, it's harder than a heartbreak too
It's tough enough what love will do
And you're as precious as mine
And you're as precious as mine...
