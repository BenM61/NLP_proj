HA!

I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.

Filled with pain
Bruised and darkened soul.
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.

I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.

That way!

What?!

Filled with pain
Bruised and darkened soul.
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.
I don't want to live that way.

Ha!
