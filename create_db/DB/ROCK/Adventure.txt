I want to have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Just as the four walls closed me within
My eyes are opened up with pure sunlight

I'm the first to know, my dearest friends
Even if your hope has burned with time
Anything that's dead shall be regrown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
You will be fine

Hey yo, here I am, and here we go, life's waiting to begin

Any type of love it will be shown
Like every single tree reach for the sky
If you're gonna fall, ill let you know
That I will pick you up like you for I
I felt this thing I can't replace

That everyone was working for this goal
Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back as pure as gold
To recite this song

Hey yo, here I am,and here we go, life's waiting to begin
I cannot live I can't breathe unless you do this with me
I cannot live I can't breathe unless you do this with me
I cannot live I can't breathe unless you do this with me
I cannot live I can't breathe unless you do this with me
I cannot live I can't breathe unless you do this with me
I cannot live I can't breathe unless you do this with me
Hey yo, here I am, and here we go, life's waiting to begin
Hey yo, here I am, and here we go, life's waiting to begin
Life's waiting to begin
