Pretty falling tears shining (yes)
(What's that girl) 
(What is the difference) 
(It's real)

Whoa oh ah
Yeah...

If it's raining
It's raining tears from my eyes
Since you've gone
All I do is cry

Won't somebody help me
Somebody help me
Can't you see that
My baby has left me


She left me reeling and rocking
Walking the floor
She left a note last night
She won't be back no more

She left me reeling and rocking
(Reeling and rocking)
Walking the floor
(Walking the floor)
She left a note last night
(She left a note last night)
She won't be back no more
(She won't be back no more)
