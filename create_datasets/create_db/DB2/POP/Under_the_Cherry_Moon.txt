How can I stand to stay where I am?
Poor butterfly who don't understand
Why can't I fly away in a special sky?
If I don't find my destiny soon,
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon

I want to live life to the ultimate high
Maybe I'll die young like heroes die
Maybe I'll kiss you some wild special way
If nobody kills me or thrills me soon,
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon

If that's alright

Lovers like us dear are born to die
If they don't find us what will we do?
I guess we'll make love under the cherry moon
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon
