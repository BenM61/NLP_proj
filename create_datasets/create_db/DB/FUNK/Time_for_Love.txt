Love words, blue birds
And sweet baby ways
Wind song, moon light
And my sweet baby makes me feel right
Like waves in the oceans
Leaves in the trees
Nothing ever changes between you and me
Love is the answer
Now is the time for love

Whirl wind, wind fall
now we're floating free that's all
Good friends night whims
Why don't you listen to the snow flakes fall
We're slow but we're fast
Got a good question to ask
Love is the answer
Now is the time for love

Layin' here listening to the silence
As the sunshine slowly fades away
As we slip into each others arms
to face another day

Love words, blue birds
And sweet baby ways
Whirl wind, wind fall
Why don't you listen to the snow flakes fall
Like waves in the oceans
Leaves in the trees
Nothing ever changes between you and me
Love is the answer
Now is the time for love

Why don't you listen to the snow flakes fall

Now we are floating free that's all

Why don't you listen to the snow flakes fall

Now we are floating free that's all?
