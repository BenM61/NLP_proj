I'll always hold dear 
The time that I spend here
The streets are all caved in,
And it's so hard to steer
So I run, and I'm running 
As fast as I can
When the time is right

I wanna hear your heart beatin' loud
And I wanna see you stand up proud
'Cause we go where sunlight is gold

The ending is near
But we're not going far
Put up a cement wall and
Tied a rope to a star
So I climb
And I'm climbin' as fast as I can
'Cause I love ya, I love ya

I wanna hear your heart beatin' loud
And I wanna see you stand up proud
'Cause we go where sunlight is gold and warm
Where sunlight is gold and warm
Where sunlight is gold and warm'

I wanna hear your heart beatin' loud
And I wanna see you stand up proud
'Cause we go where sunlight is gold
