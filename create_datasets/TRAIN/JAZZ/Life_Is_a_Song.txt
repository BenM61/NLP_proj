Life is a song, let's sing it together
Let's take our hearts, end it then in rhyme
Let's learn the words, let's learn the music together
Hoping the song lasts for a long, long time

Life is a song that goes on forever
Love's old refrain can never go wrong
Let's strike the note Mendelssohn wrote concerning spring weather
Let's sing it together and make life a song

Let's strike the note Mendelssohn wrote concerning spring weather
Let's sing it together and make life a song
And make life a great big song
