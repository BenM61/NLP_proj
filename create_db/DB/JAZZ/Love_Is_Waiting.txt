Livin' a dream
Where things are even
Better than they seem
I wanna go
To where the lights
Inside provide the glow

You can believe when
I tell you it's true
Well, take a little ride with me
Can you conceive that
You already knew
Look inside and you

[Chorus]
Love is waiting
It's just around the bend
Waiting for you to turn the
Charm on
Oh, waiting and it will never end
Give it up you're overdue
(Love will see you through)

What'll you do
When all the fancy dancin'
Days are through
Where will you go
When all the neon lights
Have lost their glow

You can believe when
I tell you it's true
Come take a little ride with me
Can you conceive that
You already knew
Look inside and you will see that

[Chorus]
