Big Snoop Dogg
My nephew Hardwell on the beat
Give it to me

I wanna wake up now
And see you there when I turn 'round
I wanna see you smile
When you look back, d'you still feel it now?
I wanna work this out
But I'll admit that I don't know how
Wait up now, wait up now, 'cause

I love how you love me
I love how you love me
Every time you love me so right
Treat me so right, do me so right now
Ooh, I love how you love me

I love how you love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
I love how you love me
Ooh, I love how you love me

Do you think of me when you lay in bed alone?
Do you think that we were always meant to let it go?
Don't wanna fall asleep, 'cause in my dreams you're still with me, ooh
Wake up now, wake up now, 'cause

I love how you love me (I love it)
I love how you love me
Every time you love me so right
Treat me so right, do me so right now
Ooh, I love how you love me

I love how you love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
I love how you love me
Ooh, I love how you love me

Easy on the eyes, dressed to impress
Nonetheless, I guess you can say I'm the best
So you can see why, she's my P-Y-T
She in love with the one D-O double G
S-N, just in the nick of time
Champagne, what a twist of line, just in time
Celebrate, raise your glass, and blaze your blunts
And keep giving me whatever I want
I love how you love me
Kissin' and huggin' me
You're where I wanna be
I don't want no company
As long as you comfort me
And stay with me, come with me
But do it abundantly
Yes, you got a G with you
And I make plans just to be with you
No wishin' well, five star hotel
All kiss, no tell
Now say, Hardwell

I love how you love me (love that you love me)
I love how you love me
Every time you love me so right
Treat me so right, do me so right now
Ooh, I love how you love me

I love how you love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
Love how you love me girl
Love how you love me girl
Love how you love me girl
Ooh, I love how you love me
