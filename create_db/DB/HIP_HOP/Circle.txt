Yeah
You know what's funny?
Seems every time I try to forget about you
My feelings pull you back in
You know, 'cause I got somebody else
And you got somebody else
But you and I both know
What it really is
But still
You know what I'm saying, B?

Ran across a picture you took of me
And you crossed my mind
And it got me thinkin'
'Bout how it used to be
It was just you and me
I still hear you saying you love me
When I close my eyes
Put no one else above me
But that was back then; now you're just a memory
If I didn't go away to school
Then where would we be?
Probably still together and somewhere happy
If I'm supposed to be moved on in a new relationship strong
Then why are you still haunting me?

They say

If you love something, let it go
And if it comes back, then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started
And you're back in my life
The further I go, the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on
Till I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me?
Help me get out of this circle (out of this circle)

I drove past your house the other day
I didn't even mean to
I went the wrong way
I ain't seen your mama in a while
When she looked at me she smiled
And asked me if I'm doing okay
Took everything I had
Not to bring up your name
And wonder if you came home for the holidays, yeah
She asked if I could stay awhile
'Cause you had come in town
And you were just five minutes away

If you love something, let it go
And if it comes back, then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started
And you're back in my life
The further I go, the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on
Till I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me?
Help me get out of this circle (out of this circle)

Anybody who's listening to this
If you got that person that makes you wonder what if
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
If you understand how I feel
Then grab that person now and let 'em know what's real
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah, hey

If you love something, let it go
And if it comes back, then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started
And you're back in my life
The further I go, the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on
Till I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me?
Help me get out of this circle (out of this circle)
