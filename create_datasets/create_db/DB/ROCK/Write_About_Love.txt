I know a spell
That would you make help
Write about love, it could be in any tense, but it must make sense

I know a trick
Forget that you are sick
Write about love, it could be in any form, hand it to me in the morning

I hate my job, I'm working way too much (every day I'm stuck in an office)
At one o'clock, I take my lunch up on the roof
The city's spread below, I'll write about a man
He's intellectual and he's hot, but he understands

The seconds move on (if you watch the clock)
And the sky grows dark (if you're looking up)
But the girls move from thrill to thrill on the tightrope walk (on the tightrope walk)

I know a way (so you know the way)
Get on your skinny knees and pray (maybe not today)
You've got to see the dream through the windows and the trees of your living room (of your living room)
