How come you tell me that we have to get away?
But girl you can't be found.
We'll dine in Paris on the Champs Elysee's
When ever you come around.
There's been a breakdown, breakdown.
Don't change your mind on me.
Just take a little time.
You say the finer things are just worth waiting for.

Just gimme some kind of sign, baby.
I can't wait, wait for a hundred years.
Can't hold back my tears any longer, longer, I canmt wait, wait for a hundred years.
Can't hold back me tears any longer, longer.

Sometimes I think of all the moments that we shared.
I been waiting for so long.
You know it hurts me every time you run and hide.
I look up and now your gone.
I been put down, weighed down.
There's no tomorrow for me.
We can't let love just fade away, baby.

I can't wait for a hundred years.
Can't hold back my tears any longer, longer.
I can't wait, wait for a hundred years.
Can't hold back my tears any longer, longer.

Well, I've been longing for you deep inside.
And I tell my self, baby, baby if this love of ours will survive,
Then let's take this chance together, together, baby we'll know.

I just can't wait, wait for a hundred years.
Can't hold back my tears any longer, longer.
I can't wait, wait for a hundred years.
Can't hold back my tears any longer.

You pushed my heart around, tore me up inside, made me feel so bad.
You took away my pride.
I keep waiting, waiting for a hundred years.
I can't hold back my tears any longer.
I can't hold back my tears any longer.
