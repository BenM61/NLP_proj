I've found something you've been hiding
I know exactly what you've done
No use trying to deny it
You ain't fooling anyone

I don't need a sunny day to see the light
The proof is in my hands, it's there in black and white
So here's some things that I think you might
Wanna pack real careful in your bags tonight

Take that letter from your girlfriend
Take that gold ring off your hand
As long as you're going, don't look back
The door says 'Exit', baby, take that

For a long time I've had my suspicions
And you just fed the fire again
So don't leave nothing to remind me
Of what a fool I've been

You act like you don't know what I'm talking about
You're hoping that I'll see a shadow of a doubt
Trust me that ain't gonna happen now
So do me a favor while you're walking out

Take that letter from your girlfriend
Take that gold ring off your hand
As long as you're going, don't look back
The door says 'Exit', baby, take that

You act like you don't know what I'm talking about
You're hoping that I'll see a shadow of a doubt
Trust me, that ain't gonna happen now
So do me a favor while you're walking out

Take that letter from your girlfriend
Take that gold ring off your hand
As long as you're going, don't look back
The door says 'Exit', baby while you're at it

Take that promise that you gave me
Make this heartache disappear
Take that
Baby, take that
You better, take that
Take that
