Caught up in this house
Trapped my very own self 
In the snare of my mind
No more space than a slither
What I'd give for a deep breath inside
Where the chaos has my captive
Where there's no exist sign
Where I fuel the stupid fire 
With these feeling of mine

Lured into this den, it's bitter 
And I want sweetness again
A taste that I agree with
Get me past these perils and to my Eden
Where the silence is a comfort
Where there is no one else
Where I'll be up from under 
Can uncurl my self
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far

Can I smash all of this open
Can I pass the hurt with a little pain
I want to see all of it crumble 
And start afresh all over again
My eyes are wide open
But I can hardly see
Will laughter find a way 
Around these silent tears

Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
