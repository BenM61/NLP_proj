"There's a worm in my head and a fish in the bed," she said
Confused you will be
He's got the car on the lawn and he's using the horn again
Annoyed she will be

Cartoon boyfriend when you gonna rub yourself out

"There's a girl at my door and she's begging for more," he said
"Abused you will be"
"If you touch a hair on my head then you'd be better off dead"
She said "Oh joking you must be"

Cartoon boyfriend when you gonna rub yourself out

There were pieces of gold in his mouth when they met
And now there's just pieces of coal
There was a thought in his head the first time she said
And now there's just a gaping hole

(They call him the Crayola Kid, yeah look what he did with his crayons
And stuff but, that's not enough, Crayola Kid.)
