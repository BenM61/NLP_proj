Santa Claus, go straight to the ghetto
Hitch up your reindeer, uh!
And go straight to the ghetto

Santa Claus, go straight to the ghetto
Fill every stocking you find
The kids are gonna love you so, uh!

Leave a toy for Johnny
Leave a doll for Mary
Leave something pretty for Donnie
And don't forget about Gary

Santa Claus, uh, go straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus, go straight to the ghetto
Tell him James Brown sent you, huh
And go straight to the ghetto

You know that I know what you will see
'Cause that was once me

Hit it, hit it!
You see mothers
And soul brothers

Santa Claus, go straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus, oh Lord, go straight to the ghetto

Fill every stocking you find
The kids are gonna love you so
Fill every stocking you find

I'm begging you Santa Claus
Go straight to the ghetto
If anyone wanna know
Tell him Hank Ballard told you so

Santa Claus, go straight to the ghetto
Never thought I'd realize
I'd be singing a song with water in my eyes

Santa Claus, go straight to the ghetto
Don't leave nothing for me
I've had my chance, you see?

Santa Claus, go straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus, the soul brothers need you so
Santa Claus, tell him James Brown sent you
