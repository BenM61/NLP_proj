if her hair it ain't no longer 'an mine 
I don't want no w'man, 
if her hair it ain't no longer 'an mine 
Yeah, ya know, she ain't no good for nothin' but trouble, did ya know 'at? 
Vets keep ya buyin' rats all the time 
Yeah, you know I got on the good side of my woman, 
I told her, "Darlin', I's a-comin' to go have some fun" 
You know, I went to make her swing out when a rat fell from her head like, 
one from a burnin' barn 
I just don't want, want no woman, 
boy, if her hair it ain't no longer 'an mine 
Whoa, ya know she ain't no good for nothin' but trouble 
Vets keep ya buyin' rats all the time 
Yeah, you know rats and wigs'll get ya killed 
Yeah, you know I got on the good side of my woman,
