Yo, hi it's me again
Cloud 9 Stryder
The girlfriend taker
Boyfriends hate me
All I gotta do's drop a girl a one liner
And if not miner the necklace'll blind 'er
Them other yutes can't do it like me
I'm in Prada boots with the new Armani
Look, man are on a hype like 'Watch when I see him'
When they come, come, they're a kamikaze
Girls like paper, but I'm more bader
But I'm on your telly so we'll make things easier
And it's so obvious we does this major
From the whips to the garms to the chain, uh
Look high hater, don't get mad 
'cause I got your girl webbed up quick like a spider
Don't get close all my goons mean danger
Don't get clocked on the radar, peace

Yeah, if I do things my way
Oh that's the Bow way
E3 flee, can get, make doe way
Line up girls like plaques in Drake's hallway
Swagger in check like always
And I've been knockin' down girls from school days
'cause I've been a Star in the Hood from school raves
I've got the girls dem lovin' it
Can't get enough of it
I learnt that from the old Will tape
And she's like 'Oh that's Stryderman'

Look, why's your man tryna see me man
He can't see me man, tell him I'm ninja man
You chase girls and labels chase us
Our window's black, your man he's on bus
Look, real talk I ain't tryna start up a fuss
But real g's don't need luck, peace
