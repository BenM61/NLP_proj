Miss a minute, miss an hour
Miss the meeting full of power
Miss the lines of constant depression
Catch my eye, witness my aggression

Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone!
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone!
Leave me alone, leave me alone!

Not for you, not for me
Save me the humility
Knot the tie, time to fill
Meet you there, not until

Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone!
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone!
Leave me alone, leave me alone!

Yes to this, yes to that
Yes it's time to sit back
Three time ten down the line
F*ck you, I'm doing fine

Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone!
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone!
Leave me alone, leave me alone!

F*ck off!!!

(Satanic shit)
