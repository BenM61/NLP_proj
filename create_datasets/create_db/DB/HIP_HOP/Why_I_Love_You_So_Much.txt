Oh baby
You mean the world and everything that I want for
Since I've been your girl
Oh my whole life has been much better than ever before
You got a tender sweet love, yes you do
That weakens me and takes over me whenever we touch

Baby that's just, why I love you so much
Baby that's just, why I can't get enough
Baby that's just why I love you so much
I love only you.

Now you say that your down
Oh you said you won't play around
No, no not with my heart
And when your boys come around
No you're not disrespecting me
And not trying to be Mr.-want to-be-hard
You let them know that I'm yours yes you do
By holding me, and kissing me
Let them know that for sure

Baby that's just, why I love you so much
Baby that's just, why I can't get enough
Baby that's just why I love you so much
I love only you.

Yes, you don't ever say I'm too young thank you baby
I've been around enough to know enough to know just what I want
You don't move too fast or make me rush, no
One day we're gonna talk about making love
No doubt baby when the time is right

Baby that's just, why I love you so much
Baby that's just, why I can't get enough
Baby that's just why I love you so much
I love only you.

Baby no one else
Can do what you're doing to me
You take me and you hold me
You wrap me in your arms baby
And I love you for that baby
You don't front in front of your friends
And you stand up and be a real man
I love you I love you and I love you for that baby
