I can't be anything w/o you. 
Don't ya know it's a shame
I'm sitting at my desk and it's noontime 
And I want just to call you.

Cause we go together just like jam 
And bread or maybe birds of a feather.
I don't know anything about you. 
Don't ya know? that's the game.

I'm sitting on my bed 
And I wonder what will it take for u to call me?

We go together,
Hey can you hear me? when I shout out loud 
I wish that you could be near me.

I don' care if the bills are paid as long as she is with me. 
I don't care if my soul is saved as long as she forgives me. 
I don't care if the moon is wrong wishin' and a hoping. 
I don't need to be an astronaut as long as you are k-k-kissing me.

Cause we go together just like jam 
And bread or maybe birds of a feather.
I don't know anything about you. 
Don't ya know? that's the game.
