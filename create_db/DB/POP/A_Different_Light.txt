And there's a feeling in the morning
That I can get my stomach screams a warning
As my first thoughts are forming in my head
And I can lay between the covers
Remember how I loved another
And postpone my slow recovery

but I can fall asleep tonight
If I can make it home by the daylight
When I recall the times that I was left alone
'cause in the glimmer of your eye
I begin to see myself in a different light

And there's a feeling in the morning
That I can get my stomach screams a warning
As my first thoughts are forming in my head
And they say, "whoa, baby, I gotta go...
And I hate to let you know that this way."

but I can fall asleep tonight
If I can make it home by the daylight
When I recall the times that I was left alone
'cause in the glimmer of your eye
I begin to see myself in a different light

but I can fall asleep tonight
If I can make it home by the daylight
When I recall the times that I was left alone
'cause in the glimmer of your eye
I begin to see myself in a different light
Whoa, oh oh oh...
