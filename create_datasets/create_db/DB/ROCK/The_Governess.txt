Who did you say you were?
I didn't catch your name
Falling down to earth
Down from a higher plane

Oh, it's been decades
Say, what did you see?
Oh, I've been so lonely
Won't you keep me company?

Do you remember me?
We met out on the farm
By the fire, you spoke to me
And held me in your arms

The songs you played for me
I long to understand
All along the watchtower
And castles made of sand

When there was a wilderness, we wandered wild and free
Guilt, she is the governess that guides me back to grief
What if we were dumb enough to spend eternity
Gathering the garbage washed up on the beach?

Do you remember me?
We spoke by telephone
The bad connection had a meaning of its own

Of all the good and all the stupid shit I've done
The worst was all for me
Not hurting anyone

When there was a wilderness, I wandered wild and free
Guilt, she is the governess that guides me back to grief
Wish that I was old enough to end the century
Gather all the garbage washed up on the beach
