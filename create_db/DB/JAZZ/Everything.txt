Beautiful eyes beautiful face 
Beautiful sky on a beautiful day
Beautiful arms beautiful legs
Tell me how did you get such a beautiful aura
Beautiful spirit 
Beautiful voice everytime I hear it
Beautiful mouth I can't resist
Everytime you let me kiss you

Baby all I need is you to love 
You're all I'm ever thinking of
'Cause you're my everything (beautiful, beautiful)
You're my everything (beautiful, beautiful)
You're my everything (beautiful, beautiful)
You're my everything (my everything)
My everything (my everything)

Beautiful words almost describe
The beautiful heart you have beating inside
And in my arms you'll always take 
'Cause you're the song that I sing
You're the music I play

Baby all I need is you to love
You're all I'm ever thinking of
'Cause you're my everything (beautiful, beautiful)
You're my everything (beautiful, beautiful)
You're my everything (beautiful, beautiful)
You're my everything (my everything)

You're the strength I need
You're the air I breathe
With you're love I can do anything
To much of you could never be enough

All I need is you to love
You're all I'm ever thinking of
Baby all I need is you to love
'Cause you're all I'm ever thinking of
'Cause you're my everything ('cause you're my everything, my everything)
My everything
You're my everything
You're my everything
My everything
