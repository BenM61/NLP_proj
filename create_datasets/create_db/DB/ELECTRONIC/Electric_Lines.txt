Everyone's updating their hardware
Plugging in their new gear
Upgrading to all-new components
Replacing the things from last year

Every time I hear something special
Its replacement is something I fear
It's only a working in progress
Only a stopgap idea

The tools that we used to create them
They're no longer welcome 'round here
Everyone's re-routing their cables
Creating paths that are crystal clear

While I like the sound of you dreaming
I like how it sounds in my ear
And I like the sound of adventure
The wind chimes in the air

In this world you've created
There are sounds I'll always hold dear
I'd like things to be permanent
But that's not always possible, I fear

Bring me something back when you go
Bring me something back when you go
Bring me something back I don't know
Bring me something back when you go

Everyone's deleting their plugins
Their path must remain crystal clear
Everyone's sick of their soft synths
Like they're sick of cold market beer

I don't know a real ale from a fake one
I don't know which is more sincere
The music we're making
Or the music we hear

Make your own kind of problems
Make something out of your fears
Make your own music
Let it bring you to tears

Bring me something back when you go
(Will you ride with me for one last time?)
Bring me something back when you go
(I'll be on electric lines)
Bring me something back I don't know
(I can hear the signal passing through)
Bring me something back when you go
(They know what we plan to do)
