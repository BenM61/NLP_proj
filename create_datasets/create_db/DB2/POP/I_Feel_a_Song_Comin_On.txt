I feel a song coming on
And I'm a-warning you
It's a victorious, happy and glorious new strain
I feel a song coming on
It's a melody full of the laughter
Of children out after the rain

You'll hear a tuneful story
Ringing through you
Love and glory, hallelujah
And now that my troubles are gone
Let those heavenly drums go on drumming
'Cause I feel a song coming on

You'll hear a tuneful story
Ringing through you
Love and glory, hallelujah
And now that my troubles are gone
Let those heavenly drums go on drumming
'Cause I feel a song coming on
