You try your hardest to perfect your explanations
You lie until they've run out of questions

You can only move as fast as those in front of you
And if you assume just like them,what good will it do?
So find out for yourself,so your ignorance will stop bleeding through

Only one thing
Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you
It's just a breath away you can breathe today breathe today

So many lies swirling around you you're suffocating
The empty space in you
Steals your breath you're suffocating

Logic forces me to believe in this and now I've learned to see
I can only say what I've seen and heard and only you can choose
And every choice you make will affect you,search your own self

You can breathe today
So many lies swarming around you, you're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath you're suffocating

Big enough to fill the void that's inside of you
It's just a breath away

So many lies swarming around you you're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath you're suffocating

You can breathe today
Breathe today
