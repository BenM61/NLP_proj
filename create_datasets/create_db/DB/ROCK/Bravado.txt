If we burn our wings
Flying too close to the sun
If the moment of glory
Is over before it's begun
If the dream is won
Though everything is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost 

We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost

When the dust has cleared
And victory denied
A summit too lofty
River a little too wide
If we keep our pride
Though paradise is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost 

We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost (oh)

And if the music stops
There's only the sound of the rain
All the hope and glory
All the sacrifice in vain
And if love remains
Though everything is lost
We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost

We will pay the price
But we will not count the cost

And if love remains
Though everything is lost
We will pay the price (we will pay the price)
But we will not count the cost (but we will not count the cost)

And if love remains (if love remains)
Though everything is lost (though everything is lost)
We will pay the price (we will pay the price)
But we will not count the cost (but we will not count the cost)

And if love remains
