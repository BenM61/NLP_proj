Oh, I got a man
Sho 'nuff a real man

Good ol' man is what I got
Good ol' man says he helps a lot
A real man gone be tender
Maybe that's the kinda man I need

For his love I will surrender
'Cause he'll keep his mind on pleasing me
'Cause he's the

Right kinda lover
I'll never need another
Sho 'nuff, he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me

An interesting conversation
Every once in a while
Always prompt and attentive
'Cause me diamond knows that dime is my star
'Cause he's the

Right kinda lover
I'll never need another
Sho 'nuff, he's got the stuff
He's the right kinda lover for me
