I remember when all the games began
Remember every little lie
And every last goodbye
Promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away its still a mystery to me

Well I'm so empty
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well you're so unclean
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me

The lying
The bleeding
The screaming, was tearing me apart
The hatred
Deceiving
The bleeding
It's over

Paint the mirrors black (to forget you)
I still picture your face and the way you used to taste
Roses in a glass dead and wilted
To you this all was nothing,
Everything to you is nothing

Well you're so filthy
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well I'm so ugly
You're better off without me and I'm better off without

The lying
The bleeding
The screaming, was tearing me apart
The hatred
The beatings
Disaster
It's over

As wicked as you are, you're beautiful to me
You're the darkest burning star, your my perfect disease

The lying
The bleeding
The screaming, was tearing me apart
The hatred
The beatings
It's over
Disaster

The lying
The bleeding
The screaming, was tearing me apart
The hatred
The beatings
It's over
Disaster
It's over now
