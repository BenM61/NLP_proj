We used to hang around, and used to be in town almost everyday, 
I used to be a man, you used to understand me in every way, 
But now you don't hardly know me, 
I've changed and I'm different now, 
Oh, you don't even know me, 
I've changed and I'm different now. 

Used to be in school, together played the fool, 
But I let it go, now I'm on the street, 
And if we should ever meet I'd let you know, 
How I've changed and I'm different, 
Changed and different now, no, no, no, 
You wouldn't even know me, 
I've changed and I'm different now. 

You don't know, but I need it so, 
And it's breakin' me down, 
The endless motels they never make me feel at home, 
The way I wanna feel.

We used to hang around, 
And used to be in town almost everyday, 
I used to be a man, 
And you used to understand me in every way, 
Now you don't hardly know me, 
I've changed and different now. 

Ah, look at me, you wouldn't even know me, 
No, no, no, no. Changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now, changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now.

Ah, look at me, you wouldn't even know me, 
No, no, no, no. Changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now, changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now.

Oh, its just the be side now.
