As a measure of a soul 
Like a dumb run: bring your fear 
You and me, we got the same air going 
Breathing here 
You got sent the cold water you're in 
Like someone left to could half breathing 
Maybe me and the Queen could take another order 
Lock it away 

Oh little wish it away 
I got time to wish away 
Little wish it away 

Head look about for freedom 
Like a do-mo bring on feel 
I might take the T-mind looker 
Love and see 
High tongue hit the cold wide looker 
Aw Damien has the free minds mover 
Maybe me and the Queen could give a side order
Love it away, yeah! 

Oh little wish it away 
I got time to wish away
Little wish it away 
She don't hang
