There will be no love that's dying here
The bird that flew in through my window
Simply lost his way
He broke his wing, I helped him heal
And then he flew away
Well the death of love is everywhere
But I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here for me

There will be no love that's dying here
The mirror that fell from the wall was raggedy, that's all
It rest up on a rusty nail, before it made its fall
Well the bones of love are everywhere but I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here for me
There will be no love that's dying here
Four flowers in my Asian vase is not a sign we're dead
I paid for three, a sweet old lady gave me four instead
There's some doubt that's out about this love but I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here for me

There will be no love that's dying here
The bird that flew in through my window
Simply lost his way
He broke his wing
I helped him heal
And then he flew away
Well the death of love is everywhere
But I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here for me

No, there will be no love that's dying for me
There will be no love that's dying for you and me
There will be no love dying here
No, not for me
There will be no love that's dying here
No, there will be no love that's dying here
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
There will be no love that's dying for me
