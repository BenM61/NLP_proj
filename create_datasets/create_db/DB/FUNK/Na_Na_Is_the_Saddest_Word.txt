Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na is the saddest word I ever heard
Baby, don't say it, please, don't say it

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na is the surest way to break my heart
Baby, don't do it, please, don't do it

If I hurt you, baby, if I told you lies
Forgive me, I apologize
Don't you know that I love you so?

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na is the saddest word I ever heard
Baby, don't say it, please, don't say it
Please, don't go

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na)

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
