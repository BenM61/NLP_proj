Fools knockin' on my door, calling out my name
Tellin' me to change my ways but I know
Two hands in the fire won't put out the flame
Yeah, I got your number, I know your game

So why should I lay it on the line?
Everybody's got a vision, everybody's got a plan
You tell me lies, you look me in the eyes
But honey I would rather stand out in the rain

Fools lying in my bed, laughin' in my head
Telling me my dream's gone cold but I know
One city of angels, it ain't goin' put out my flame
Ooh, my love is a fire, no one can tame

So why should I lay it on the line?
Everybody's got a vision, everybody's got a plan
You tell me lies, you look me in the eyes
But honey I would rather stand out in the rain

Why should I lay it on the line?
Well, everybody's got a vision, everybody's got a plan
You tell me lies, you look me in the eyes
But honey I would rather stand out in the rain

Everybody's got a vision, everybody's got a plan
You tell me lies, you look me in the eyes
But honey I would rather stand out in the rain
