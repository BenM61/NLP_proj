Headin' for the islands
We're ready man and packed to go
Ooh
When we hit those islands
There's gonna be a big hello
Ooh
Diggin' all the sunshine
It's easy not to say goodbye
Bye, Bye, Bye

Headin' for the islands
Heyeah, We're really flyin' high
Ooh
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home
Ooh

Walkin' down the beaches
Tomorrow mornin' we'll be there
Ooh
Golden sandy beaches
Say, I can smell the breezy air
Ooh
One more celebration
And then we're ready for goodbye
Bye, Bye,Bye

Walkin' down the beaches
Heyeah, We're really flyin' high
Ooh
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home
Ooh

Going back home
Going back home
Going back home
Going back home

Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home
