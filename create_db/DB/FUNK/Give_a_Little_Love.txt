Oh my love if you'll
Have a little trust, just a little trust in me, oh, I'll
Come through
I know I haven't been good to you
So give a little love, just a little love to me and I'll
Be true
To you, you, oh babe

Have a little faith, just a little faith in me and I
Will do
The things I should for you
Give a little love, just a little love to me and I'll
Be true
To you, you, you, oh, yes I will

I know I've strayed far, far away from your arms
Hey, hey, baby, just like a fool
I hope and I pray that you'll let me return
So I can make love, make love, make love to only you

Oh my love, if you'll
Have a little trust, just a little trust in me, oh, I'll
Come through
I know I haven't been good to you
So give a little love, just a little love to me and I'll
Be true
To you, you, you, honey

Have a little faith, just a little faith in me and I
Will do
Give a little love, just a little love to me and I'll
Be true
Have a little trust, just a little trust in me, oh, I'll
Come through
Give a little love, just a little love to me and I'll
