If you're drifting towards the eye
Where do you go
From the image in your mind
Towards the black hole

I wanna know
I wanna know 
I wanna know 
I wanna know 

I'm waiting for the dark energy
I'm waiting just to see
I'm waiting for the dark to swallow me
I'm waiting just to see

If you enter through the light
Where do you go
When your blinded by the night
Where do you go

I wanna know 
I wanna know 

I'm waiting for the dark energy
I'm waiting just to see
I'm waiting for the dark to swallow me

I'm waiting just to see
