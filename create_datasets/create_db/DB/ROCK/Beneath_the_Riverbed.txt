Have no place I can run to
To rest my tired bones
Kept my nose to the grindstone
Perpetuate my woes
You see, life is complicated
Living in a cage
Sparked a fuse and lit a flame
The beast cannot be tamed, yeah

Just trying to kill some time
So I'll
Drown my sorrows
Kill my pain
And make it last 'til the morning breaks

Drown my sorrows
Kill my pain
And make it last 'til the morning breaks

Appetite for the down time
Where I can catch my breath
I'll hold my tongue when I'm lifeless
Believe in what I said
Life's a bitch when you're worn out
But what did you expect?
All alone you can drown me
Beneath the riverbed yeah

Beneath the riverbed

So I'll
Drown my sorrows
Kill my pain
And make it last 'til the morning breaks

Drown my sorrows
Kill my pain
And make it last 'til the morning breaks
(Drown my sorrows)

Drown my sorrows 
Kill this pain
Make it last 'til the morning breaks

Drown my sorrows
Kill my pain
And make it last 'til the morning breaks

Drown my sorrows
Kill my pain
And make it last, make it last 
And make it last the morning breaks
