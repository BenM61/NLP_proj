Look, yo, no castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
A mummy ain't said 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet
I ain't Jesus but I'm walkin' on water
There's no bombs here, there's no walkers
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws, blud
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms it poured and up the road
You'll never guess who I saw

Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A
Look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym
Honey I'm home this is where I wanna live
Just found it like Nemo on the d-low
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though
On the other side of the fence, bind to the ends
No fence, no stress, no rent, no superficial shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold
And the speech goes like, hi little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swag up on a hundred degrees, no eighty
Look, if heaven had a V-I-P, uh, this is it, white sand, blue sea
But I don't know who they are and I'm damn sure they don't know me
But I come in peace

Cool, white flag, white flag
No war
No guns
No Corps
Just life
Just love
No hype
Just fun
No ties

Just me and my mind
Just me and my wife
But tell me if I'm dreamin'
'Cause I don't wanna wake up 'til the evenin'
And I don't wanna be left sleepin'
From all the diseases that I breathe in
Look, respect the island, no stealin'
And don't bring religion here, no three kings
It's great and we ain't leavin'
We come on in peace, sing
White flag?
White flag
