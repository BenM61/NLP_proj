Just an old fashioned love song
Playing on the radio
And wrapped around the music
Is the sound of someone promising they'll never go.
You'll swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on.
No need in bringing em back
'Cause they've never really gone.
Just an old fashioned love song
Coming down in three part harmony.
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me,
To weave our dreams upon and
Listen to each evening when the light are low.
To underscore our love affair
With tenderness and feeling
That we've come to know.
You'll swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on.
No need in bringing em back
'Cause they've never really gone.
Just an old fashioned love song
Coming down in three part harmony.
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me.
