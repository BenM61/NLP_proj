I am such a peculiar girl
Have my dreams and thoughts in another world
But I live my life
So lost in time, so lost in space
I belong to an unknown human race
But I live my life

Perhaps, I will come back again
But I, I don't bother how or when

See all my dreams don't belong to you
They have nothing with your world to do
They just live my life
So who are you, o' so wise
Who can tell what is wrong or right

And I'll just stay right where I am
My dreams belong to dreaming land

I'm not coming back again, my dreams
Belonging to dreaming land, that's why
I'll stay right where I am, see I
I don't need a helping hand

I am such a peculiar girl
Keep my secret thoughts in a secret world
That's how I live my life
So don't tell me how one's supposed to live
'Cause your eyes don't shine, they have done their time
You have lived your life

That's why, I'll stay right where I am
'Cause I, I don't want to die my friend

No I, I don't want those withered eyes
'Cause I, I want to live my life
No I, don't want those withered eyes
See, I want to live to live my life
