When I came by, I was hopin' you weren't home
You smiled and let me in
I told you that I need a shoulder to cry on
You gave me yours again
You say it's gonna be all right, I turned off the lights
In the darkness you held me tight and,

One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
Best of friends can be lovers after all

I checked the time, it's gettin' late, I've gotta go
You smiled and said, Please stay.
I kissed your lips and though I want to say no
And let you have your way
And mentioned it was not my plan, I don't want a one-night stand
That's when you took my heart away

One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
Best of friends can be lovers after all

When daylight appeared, what else could I do?
I simply whispered in your ear, confronting ,I love you.

One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
Best of friends can be lovers
One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
Best of friends can be lovers
One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
Best of friends can be lovers
