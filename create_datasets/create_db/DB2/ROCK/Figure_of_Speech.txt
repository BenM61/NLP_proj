He'll teach you to wait by the phone
And then won't call
Throw your life in a turmoil
And when you fall
Just when you need him most
He won't see you
Don't let him
Don't let him
Don't let him get you down

When your dreams get shattered
Down where nothing matters
But if he won't have you
You can bet your life
Bet your life
It's not the end
And if he can't see
What a friend you are
That's his loss
It's not the end

Don't let him
Don't let him
Don't let him get you down

Watch his lips while he speaks
And read his eyes
It's a figure of speech
So don't be surprised
When he talks of love
But his deeds can break you
Don't let him
Don't let him
Don't let him get you down
