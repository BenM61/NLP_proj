Crazy Chick
by Charlotte Church

I think I'm gonna need some therapy
Oh babe, I hope you got a PHD
Won't you lay me on your leather couch
I got a lot I need to talk about

I think i'm crazy, think I 'm stupid 
Must of lost my mind
Wonder what I'm thinking lovin' you
cause boy if you were mine
I'd really go insane,
you be my favourite thing
I'd go ballastic
Yea you're making me a crazy chick

You're driving me to insanity
all the things you do 
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need proffesional Help
Help
I need proffesional Help

You've really done it this time
You know you twisted my mind
You got me acting like a whacked out chick
So I won't be responsible cause I'm really not logical
No I won't be to blame
You know i'm really not sane

I think i'm crazy, think I 'm stupid 
Must of lost my mind
Wonder what I'm thinking lovin' you
cause boy if you were mine
I'd really go insane,
you be my favourite thing
I'd go ballastic
Yea you're making me a crazy chick

You're driving me to insanity
all the things you do 
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need proffesional Help
Help

Can't get you out of my head
So let me just confess
For your kisses baby
For your love
You drive me crazy I can't get enough

I think i'm crazy, think I 'm stupid 
Must of lost my mind
Wonder what I'm thinking lovin' you
cause boy if you were mine
I'd really go insane,
you be my favourite thing
I'd go ballastic
Yea you're making me a crazy chick

You're driving me to insanity
all the things you do 
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need proffesional Help
Help 

You're driving me to insanity
all the things you do 
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need proffesional Help
Help 
I need proffesional Help

You're driving me to insanity
all the things you do 
You make me come unglued
I just can't help myself
I need proffesional Help
I need Help
