I like to watch
Wanna make him tremble
He knows that I'm never
Gonna take it further
I can see you
Little baby
Moving close behind me
I wanna go, I gotta turn back
I wanna share an innuendo

I am drifting slowly
Want to play
I -- Well
It's nothing less, it's nothing more than
Simple Innuendo

I like to tell him
Little made up stories
He's all ears
And he never seems to think they're boring
Want to drive you a little crazy
So much fun teasing you
I wanna scare, I wanna shock you
I wanna share an innuendo
