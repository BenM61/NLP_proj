They say there's only one tonight
Oh yeah we're gonna make some changes
Those boys are gonna shake their spades tonight
Raise the doubt yeah, re-arranger

So if you think it safe, yeah you think it's fine
Well you better think again
Because we're coming out
Oh yeah we're coming out
We're gonna turn it all upside down

Oh yeah we're taking this town
Nah nah nah nah
Oh yeah
Nah nah nah nah
Oh no we're taking this town
Nah nah nah nah
Hmmm yeah,
Nah nah nah nah
We're gonna take this town
Nah nah nah nah
Oh oh yeah
Nah nah nah nah

Well it's a kind of a crazy game
It has no face and it has no name
And it's the sign of the drums, yeah
Cha cha, cha cha cha cha

And I'm here to take this town
Get off the street when you hear the sound, yeah
'Cause they're singing the songs, yeah
So you better step aside tonight
We don't have the time for strangers
For strangers

Nobody's gonna keep us down tonight
As for love, we live in danger
Danger
You know the time is now, the time is right
to get this city straight
If you think it's strange
well that's your problem man
'cause you're just a little late
