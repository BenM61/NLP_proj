Well it's time to begin as the summer sets in
It's the scene
You set for new lovers
You play your part painting in a new start
But each gate will open another

June, July and August said
It's probably hard to plan ahead
June, July and August said
It's better to bask in each others

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the summer go on and on

Well they tried to stay in from the cold and wind
Making love and making their dinner
Only to find that the love that they grew in the summer
Froze

February, April said
Don't be fooled by the summer again
February, April said
That half of the year, well we'll never be friends

Gatekeeper seasons wait for your nod
Gatekeeper you held your breath
Made the winter go on and on

Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper, Gatekeeper
Seasons wait for your nod
