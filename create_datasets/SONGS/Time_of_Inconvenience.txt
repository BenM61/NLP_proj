We're living in a time of inconvenience
Compassion fails me with this meanness in the air
Our city streets are filled with violence
So we close our doors to the city
And pretend that it's not there

Here I go again
Back out on these mean streets
The evil seems to cling to the soles of my feet
Cause' I'm living in a time of inconvenience
At an inconvenient time

We're living in the age of communication
Where the only voices heard have money in their hands
Where greed has become a sophistication
And if you ain't got money

You ain't got nothin' in this land
An' here I am one lonely woman
On these mean streets

Where the right to life man has become my enemy
Cause' I'm living in his time of inconvenience
At an inconvenient time

I've turned my cheek
As my history fades
While the clock ticks away
Any progress we've made
I never thought
I'd be ashamed to be human
Afraid to say
My time has seen it's day

Cuz' I'm living in a time of inconvenience
Living in a time of inconvenience living in a time of inconvenience
It's an inconvenient time

This is the time of greed and power
Where everyone needs to have someone to shove around
Our children come to us for answers
Listening for freedom but they don't know the sound

And there they are, our children
Dumped out in these mean streets
The evil sweeps them up
And brings them to their knees

Cause' they're living in our time of inconvenience
They're living in the age of communication
This is the time of greed and power
This is the time that I wish was not mine
Cause' it's an inconvenient time

(time, oh time)
(it's an inconvenient time)
