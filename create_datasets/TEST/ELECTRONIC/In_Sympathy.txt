They're almost falling over you 
Why don't they call a truce 
What ever they are trying to do 
Its of little use 
They're drowning you in compliments 
Trying to furnish proof 
Although they speak with eloquence 
There is little truth 

You're bright, you're strong, you know the right from wrong 
At least to some degree 
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough 
You smile in sympathy 

I'm watching your serenity 
The way your so transense 
The tidiest absurdities 
Your patience never ends 
And as the night begins to fade 
Your heading for the door 
Followed by sad parade 
Your on your own once more 

You're bright, you're strong, you know the right from wrong 
At least to some degree 
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough 
You smile in sympathy 

You're bright, you're strong, you know the right from wrong 
At least to some degree 
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough 
You smile in sympathy
