This is the year of manly livin'
This is way to shake it to the modern beat
This is a statement meant for givin'
This is the real meat
No places for the tightass talkers
The schemer of the scene won't get a single seat
Just an alley for the action walkers
I gotta move and I'm feelin so hot in heat

What a way to get it right now, in a single try
What a way to be a sight now, baby it's time for you to say goodbye
What a way to cut it to the bone now, what a mighty sound
What a legendary power come-on got the bossy moves baby
And I plannin on hangin around

And I know it, it's a night of liquid gold
Gonna take my shit worldwide I'm gonna get it sold
Wanna show it, wanna get my story told
This is momentary magic , it'll never fold

Gonna bend it round the corners, and then I'll set it straight
Gonna give'em every trick in the book now, gonna make'em wait
Gonna take it to the bridge of the bridges, gonna be so cool
Gonna preach it to the waitin masses shut up now baby
Coz I'm sendin' you back to school

What a one off night
What a strikin sight
What a mighty might
What a given right
