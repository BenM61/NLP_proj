We were two in a million
Stars like the ones in the sky
A love scene and a vision
We saw the world and we waved goodbye

Watched the fireworks falling
We kissed and innocence died
The sound of certainty calling
A world that wouldn't be satisfied

I said, you only get one hit, that's the beauty of it
What's the good in crying?
It's always been that way at the end of the day
You gotta keep on trying

Life's a one take movie
And I don't care what it means
I'm saving up my tears
For the crying scene

Tears fall and they haunt me
The sad words of the song
It's like necessity wants me
Sometimes, I long just to belong

I dream of demons and money
I see the straights in the rain
I gotta keep on movin'
Before they drag me down again

You only get one hit, that's the beauty of it
What's the good in crying?
It's always been that way at the end of the day
You gotta keep on trying

I said, life's a one take movie
And I don't care what it means
I'm saving up my tears
For the crying scene

I said, you only get one hit, that's the beauty of it
What's the good in crying?
It's always been that way at the end of the day
You gotta keep on trying

Life's a one take movie
And I don't care what it means
I'm saving up my tears
For the crying scene

The crying scene
The crying scene
