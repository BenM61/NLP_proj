Tell me where you thought you saw me
Tell me why you asked my name
Tell me how you've come to be
In this place

Tell the story how you want to
Make up all the details
Tell me what feels good
I don't care

You're no stranger
You're no stranger
To me

Take me for another body
Come out of the wilderness
Maybe just a window
You could've passed

Take me through your barricades
Push me through your city walls
Take me, I can be
Whoever you want

You're no stranger
You're no stranger
To me
No stranger
You're no stranger
To me

Nothing here is set in stone
Nothing here is set in stone
Nothing here is set in stone
You don't even know
Where I come from
Could I be someone
That you can trust?

Nothing here is set in stone
You don't even know
Where I come from
Could I be someone
That you can trust?

No stranger (no no no)
No stranger
To me (no no no)

Don't even know
Don't even know
Don't even know
Don't even know
Don't even know
