You're not seventeen
To be missing him like you do
Knowing him like you do
He said, how can I

Still be missing you
I'll be missing you
'Til you're missing me
How can I feel

I'm not innocent
And I know that I could

I'm not seventeen
And I know that you're not to blame
And if I could reason
I'd settle this thing

Still be missing you
I'll be missing you
'Til you're missing me
How can I feel

'Til you're touching me alone
Still be missing you
'Til you talk to me alone
I'll be missing you

'Til you talk to me eternal
'Til you're missing me
Come to me yourself
How can I feel

Still be missing you
This is how I'll be missing you
'Til you're missing me
How can I feel

'Til you're touching me
Still be missing you
'Til you talk to me
I'll be missing you

'Til you talk to me
'Til you're missing me

How, how, how can I feel
'Til you're touching me
Still be missing you
'Til you talk to me

I'll be missing you
'Til you talk to me
'Til you're missing me
How can I feel
