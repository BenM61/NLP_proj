Guess what, guess who?
Somebody stole my thunder,
And now somebody's gonna pay!
I'll soon be freakin' out from under
And love to live another day.

Well now, just now, 
Somebody stole my action,
I'm busted but revenge is sweet,
I'm gonna get me satisfaction,
I'm gonna get me sweets to eat!

No one told me lock the doors and window
Of your house or pay the consequence,
No one told me someone's paw-like fingers
Would make off with that which I love best!

That's how, just now 
Somebody stole my thunder 
I'm busted but revenge is sweet,
I'm gonna get me satisfaction,
If they don't pay me back in kind,
I'm gonna lose my tiny mind,
Or did they mean to bug my party line?

They stole my thunder!
I wonder why?
