It's been a while since I've left home 
But I'm coming on back today
Kinda funny but I picture it only 
Exactly as it was back in the day
Sure enough when the train pulls in 
There's so little that I recognize

Is it the scenery or my selective memory 
Or just a simple fact that I gotta realize
My friends have gone and their lives have moved on 
And I guess that's just the way it is
If this town has grown beyond my home 
I guess it all comes down to this

I close my eyes and feel like it was back in the day
But those times have long been through
The dying of the light is gone
But it's back in the day
Like a wish that comes half true

There was a time when it was easy to find 
A hangout that you knew was yours by name
And mine or not I could find the same spot 
But it's never gonna be the same
I've been away and I've seen too much 
Looks like I've been moving on as well
And when I started to not really belong 
I suppose I was unable to tell
But I ain't sad and no it isn't bad 
It's just one more thing I'm coming to know
If you're alive you didn't finish the ride
No telling where it's going to go

I close my eyes and feel like it was back in the day
But those times have long been through
The dying of the light is gone
But it's back in the day
Like a wish that comes half true
