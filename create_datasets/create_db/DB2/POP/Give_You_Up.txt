I'm not sitting with my head in my hands right now
I don't care where you've been
No, I ain't watching the clock or getting my phone out
I won't drink myself to sleep
Oh, oh

You don't, you don't get under my skin no more
No, it's gone, it's gone
I ain't thinking 'bout you no more

I found a way to let you go
So you don't have to stay now
A broken mind, I came close
But you can't rip my heart out
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'll give you up
I found a way to let you go
It's gonna rip your heart out

Got your picture covering up the cracks on the wall
But the lines won't fade
Didn't think that I would be missing you at all
Maybe that was my mistake
Oh, oh

You don't, you don't, get under my skin no more
No, it's gone, it's gone
I ain't thinking 'bout you no more

I found a way to let you go
So you don't have to stay now
A broken mind, I came close
But you can't rip my heart out
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'll give you up
I found a way to let you go
It's gonna rip your heart out

Nothing you say will change my mind
You couldn't wait to leave me behind
Nothing you say will change my mind
You couldn't wait to leave me behind
Nothing you say will change my mind
You couldn't wait to leave me behind

I found a way to let you go
So you don't have to stay now
A broken mind, I came close
But you can't rip my heart out
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'll give you up
I found a way to let you go
It's gonna rip your heart out
