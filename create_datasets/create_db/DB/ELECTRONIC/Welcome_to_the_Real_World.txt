Fact is often much stranger 
Than fiction, no danger 
It's easy to ignore it 
Hide your head and 
Don't look for it 

Ain't no way to run a universe 
Someone's holding the strings of the purse 
Got his finger on the trigger 
Will he pull it do you figure 

Welcome to- 
To the Real World
Welcome to- 
To the Real World

Who's winning the human race 
Who's running, who's setting the pace 
Makes my blood boil in defiance 
I fall to my knees and pray for guidance 

It's raining, it's pouring 
The old man is snoring 
Went to bed with 
A hole in his head 
And didn't wake up 
In the morning 

Welcome to- 
To the Real World
Welcome to- 
To the Real World

Let the world see, let yourself be 
Love each other, just like you and me 
Something's got to give, better sooner 
Than later, uh oh, oh no 

Somewhere, someone, somehow, someday 
We will find a way 
Somewhere, someone, somehow, someday 

Welcome to the real world
