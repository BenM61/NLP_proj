Ain't no gift like the present tense
Ain't no love like an old romance
Got'sta make hay when the sun is shinin'
Can't waste time when it comes time to dance

Slammin' this door with a heavy hand
Signin' this line like a deed to land
Keeping in touch with the windows down
Dreading this night since the rain hit the ground

Long live the heart
Long live the soul
That knows what it wants
That piece you can find
That part is the whole
And it never let's go

Always tryin' to be the one outlaw
Goes where he wants never does get caught
Pushing this line like the Lord ain't comin'
Building this house like he's scared of something else

Be my winter in this living hell
Be my one last dying wishing well
Oh well

Long live the heart
Long live the soul
That knows what it wants
That piece you can't find
That part is a whole
And it never let's go

Got'sta make hay when the sun is shinin'
Can't waste time when it comes time to dance
Keeping in touch with the windows down
Dreading this night since the rain hit the ground

Long live the heart
Long live the soul
That knows what it wants
That piece you can't find
That part is a whole
And it never let's go

Long live the heart
Long live the soul
That knows what it wants
No matter how far
How heavy this load
It never let's go

Long live the heart
Long live the soul
That knows what it wants
No matter how far
How heavy this load
It never let's go
