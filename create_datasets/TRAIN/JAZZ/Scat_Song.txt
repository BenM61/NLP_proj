When your sweetie tells you
Everything'll be okay
Just skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope
Skeetle-at-de-op-de-day

If you feel like shoutin'
Advertise it just this way
And skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope
Skeetle-at-de-op-de-day

Don't give a hang
What words you use at any time
Sing this silly language
Without any reason or rhyme

When you face the preacher
There's only one thing to say
Just skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope
Skeetle-at-de-op-day
