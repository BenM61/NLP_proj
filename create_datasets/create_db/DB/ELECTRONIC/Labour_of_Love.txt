You said, you recall about seven years ago now
You said, that you we're so tough
And I loved it, oh
Loved you for putting me down in a totally new way
Down with, the bad old, sad old days
(Get away now)
But now, too much pain for too little gain
And I feel like I'm gonna strike back right now

Gonna withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart, yeah
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your cold heart
Ain't gonna work for you no more
Ain't gonna work, for you no more

Ha, easy, I noticed you said it never was gonna be easy
But not this hard
You're so cold, so cold
The romance goes when the promises break
My mistake was to love you a little too much

Gonna withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart, yeah
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart, baby now
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart, yeah
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your cold heart
Ain't gonna work for you no more
Ain't gonna work, for you no more

I can't stand it, I said I just don't want it
Never gonna need it, anyway yeah
I can't stand it, I said I just don't want it
Never gonna need it, anyway
I don't want you, I don't need you
I don't need your tricks and treats
I don't need your ministration, your bad determination
I've had enough of you, and your super-bad crew
I don't need your, I don't need your
Pseudo-satisfaction baby
I can't stand it, I said I just don't want it
Never gonna need it, anyway yeah
I can't stand it, I don't want it
I don't need your pseudo-satisfaction baby

Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your cold heart
Ain't gonna work for you no more
