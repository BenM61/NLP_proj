In the first days of the spring time
Made you up and split from one thousand enemies
Made a trail of, of a thousand tears
Made you a prisoner inside your own secrecy

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

At the first hour of the springtime
Made you up and split from one thousand enemies
Now I see you from the corner
Clock strikes
And I know you will be drinking alone

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
Doesn't mean I'm sorry
