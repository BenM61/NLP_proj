First time I laid eyes on you
I checked myself right on out of this world
Just one thing can bring me back from this here heart attack
And that's your sweet lovin', girl 

Ooooh your huggin' and kissin'
I know it makes a dead man's light come on
You put the crush on me
Little girl can't you see that I'm gone 

Now I ain't gonna listen to reason
Ain't no excuse for the way that I feel
Before a word was spoke
I knew it weren't no joke
Baby this love is real 

They say you gotta take time to know her
But I just can't wait that long
You put the crush on me
Little girl can't you see
That I'm gone 

You put the crush, crush
Ooooooh what a rush
I can't begin to speak of all of your charms
You put the crush, crush
Uh
Now I can't be satisfied until
I'm wrapped up in your arms
Ain't that some some lovin baby
You got to know I'm ain't puttin you on
You put the crush on me, little girl can't you see that I'm gone 

You read about these kind of feelin's
But they always happen to somebody else
I got this feelin' from you
That you want me too
Girl, I just can't help myself 

Now this is once in a lifetime
And I just can't get you walk on
You put the crush on me, little girl can't you see that I'm gone
You put the crush on me, little girl can't you see that I'm gone 

You put the crush, crush
Ooooooh what a rush
I can't begin to speak of all of your charms
You put the crush, crush
Uh
Now I can't be satisfied until
I'm wrapped up in your arms
Ain't that some some lovin baby
You got to know I'm ain't puttin you on
You put the crush on me, little girl can't you see that I'm gone
