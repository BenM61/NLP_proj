East to west, north to south
Brand new dance people shoutin' about

[Chorus]
It's called the crawl
Aw, the crawl
Cats on the corner, everybody's doin' the crawl

Well, Jimmie got Jean
Bobbie got Tommy
I got Shirley
Everybody's got a girl

[Chorus]

East to west, north to south
Brand new dance people shoutin' about

[Chorus]
