A little bird told me, you were untrue...
Even though, I had, faith in you
I believe, the liars words
Oh the same, little bird

So with the bird, one day, you flew away
I woke up, to late, you had gone
Fading on....with this song
Of the hurting little bird
Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Chorus]
Still I watch the sky
Still I wonder why
Still I hope that I
Can carry on
If I can't be strong
If you hear my song
You'll know that it was wrong, to say good bye..

Such a cold bird, so hard, captured your heart
Does it matter, I am, falling apart
Breaking fast, as the flesh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Of the dead little bird

[Chorus: x2]

Still I watch the sky
Still I wonder why
Still I hope that I
Can carry on
If I can't be strong
If you hear my song
You'll know that it was wrong, to say good bye
