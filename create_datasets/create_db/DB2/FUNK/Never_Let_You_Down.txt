Here I am take me in your arms
Do with me what you must
I belong I belong to you
Your the one the one I trust

When you need some sweet sweet lovin'
I will always be around
It doesn't matter when or where I am
Cause I'll never let you down
Never let you down

Like a song playing in my heart
Your my sweet my melody
I will sing I will sing to you
Your the one the one for me

If you need some peace and quiet
I won't even make a sound
Don't you worry bout a thing at all
Cause I'll never let you down

And when I look into your eyes
They do hypnotize me

When you need some sweet sweet lovin'
I will always be around
Don't you worry bout a thing at all
Cause I'll never let you down
If you need some peace and quite
I won't even make a sound
It doesn't matter when or where I am
Cause I'll never let you down
