Where can you be?
I woulda laid my life down for you
Nothing seems real, nothing seems real
Now that you're gone

Have you seen the sisters blue-eyed curls of gold
Helen, no one there to be seen
The sun light looks down,
Stripped bear to the ground
Held by the leaves

[Chorus:]
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly i don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you i find
Then it's you i find
Then it's you i find

Two hundred yards in front of the man
He could never see his way to another day
This time meant the same, cold, cold, cold
Cold once again

(chorus)
You brought me two, the mother of mountains
You brought me two
And no one reads to you at night
And all your lies came to pass
Just something i said
Made you turn your life in

(chorus)
(chorus)
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
