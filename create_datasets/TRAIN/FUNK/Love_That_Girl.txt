You can tell by her smile shes such a love child.
And every man in this place would love to be in her space.
As the night settles down shed meet a lot of clever clowns.
And ill do my best to be better than the rest.

She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (so glad we've met girl)
Shes so (so sweet and tender) and I'm glad
(so glad were makin' love) oh I oh I love that girl oh oh

Then she walks my way and said boy I hope your free.
I'm thinking how could this be feels like a dream to me.
Then she give me this kiss that gave my whole body a twitch.
See your just much more than pretty gave my heart an eclipse

She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (so glad we've met girl)
Shes so (so sweet and tender) and I'm glad
(so glad were makin' love) oh I oh I love that girl oh oh

Darling
I'm so glad we found each other
Holding hands
Kissing
And making love and saying 

She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (so glad we've met girl)
Shes so (so sweet and tender) and I'm glad
(so glad were makin' love) oh I oh I love that girl oh oh
