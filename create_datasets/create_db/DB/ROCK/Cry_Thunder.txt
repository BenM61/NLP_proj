Time after time, as we march side by side,
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls,
Night after night, for the glory we fight,
In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old!

Death by our hand, for the higher command,
As the darkness surrounds us and the cries as they fall,
Fire burning steel, and the tyrants will kneel,
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory,
Pray for the master of war
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands
Endless rise with the heroes before

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day, for the demons we slay,
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all!
Chaos still reigns, in the space and the plains,
With the ultimate glory will relentlessly crawl

March on
Through the hell fire
Raging from the darkness beyond
Nightmares return by the thousands
Fearing rise, with the heroes once more

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Unholy darkness,
In the eyes of broken dreams,
Outside of the wasted and torn,
A land of tears still remains

Soldiers of destiny calling,
And the fallen will rise up again,
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Savior of nations, freedom of man

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand
Warriors defending, one final stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Blessed by the union of man!
Cry thunder!
Yeah yeah!
