I've always knew that I'd not be the one that be left alone to weep
'Cos this day I find my friend is inside my own mind and soul to keep
This spirit is letting go and letting the people know
That this ain't the time this ain't the place to test me
This ain't the face to judge nor stress me
This is the place this is the time
My enterprise and this my rhyme

C'mon, 'cos I walk, walk, walk what I talk
Walk, walk, walk what I talk

Deep down and dirty, yeah
Deep down and dirty
Sweat, deep down and dirty
(Deep, deep, deep down)
Deep down and dirty
Deep down and dirty

Reaction in all this
Synchronize

Seeming like you don't know who you was before you came on board this crazy 
ship
You left your clip
You found your skip
You made a move
You made the move to blew it
You never found your crew
And now you're lost upon a sea of dangerous sharks and shoals of fish
You make your own wish and your bed so lie in it
You made your own wish come true
By the thoughts you thought
The things you did
The things you said to me
And all the others
The ones before, the ones who came, the ones that left
But now you're feeling sorry, sad and left alone
You best believe the microphone alone
I'm here to stay
Make you pay and understand
That there ain't no other day but today
Now I'm livin' it up
Now I'm livin' it up
There ain't nothing bringing me down so don't even try
I'll size you up, I'll size you down
Besides you round this crazy uptight town
This burning with love and hate
The things you can't understand
There's too small a grate
I can't wait for this time to come
I can't wait for this time to come
I can't wait for this time to come
Living it true the life, now
Living it true the life, yeah
Living it true the life, now
I must be true to life
I must be true to life

Deep down and dirty
I've slaved enough I have
Deep down and dirty

But I'm not grovellin' on that hot coal
Deep down and dirty
Slavin' to this rhythm, here
Yeah deep down and dirty
Ain't nothing going on but this sound, man

No-one lives and no-one dies
No-one lives and no-one dies
C'mon c'mon c'mon now
No-one lives and no-one dies
C'mon, tell them
Deep down and dirty
Uh, uh
Deep down and dirty
C'mon
Deep down and dirty

(Deep, deep, deep down
Deep, deep, deep down
Deep, deep, deep down
Deep, deep, deep down
Deep, deep, deep down)
