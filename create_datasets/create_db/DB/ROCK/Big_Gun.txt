I heard about ya from a girl backstage 
You were packin' it with nothin' but you carried a 12 gauge 
Everybody told me stay away from this dude 
He's got a nasty reputation, too many tattoos 
I said, "Hey, say what?" 
I hear you carry a big gun, wild one, yeah 
You wanna show me something 
Big Gun, you're not the only one 
I'm never shotgun shy 
I'm just a troubleshooter lookin' for something sweet 
I looked hard and I saw you coming 
Bang, bang, you're in love 
Some like it hot, some like it smooth 
Every cock on the walk has got something to prove 
Hey little rooster you can take what I'm giving 
Got my tongue in my cheek makin' noise for a livin' 
I guess it's pony time 
I hear you carry a big gun, wild one, hey 
You better show me something 
Big gun, you're not the only one 
I'm never shot gun shy 
I'm just a troubleshooter lookin' for something sweet 
Big gun 
I looked hard and I saw you comin' 
Bang, bang, you're in love 
"Hey man, I gotta tell ya. 
I really like those boots you're wearing. 
What size are they?" 
"Well, you know..." 
"They look awfully large." 
"It kind of runs in the family." 
"It runs in your family!" 
"Yeah, it runs in the family, mama." 
"Well... my, my! What, big, eyes you have." 
"The better to, ahhhh, ahhhhhh..." 
"Hey, man does that thing come with a key?" 
"No, honey, you just kick it over." 
Big gun, baby 
Big gun, baby 
Big gun, baby 
Big gun, baby 
Big gun, baby...
