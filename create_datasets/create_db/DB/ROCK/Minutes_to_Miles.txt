Tonight we'll drive
Right through your town to the border line
Seven years cursed but I'll keep on waking up
There's nothing that I'd rather do

It's something that we love
This is the better part of me
That you will never see
This is something I've been keeping locked away
(Away)

Sail the night away
From minutes to miles from home
I'll do it my way
From minutes to miles from home

Tonight we'll drive
Right through your town to the border line
Why can't I ever bring myself
To say goodbye?

I'll never give this up
No, I'll never let it go
With a broken van in every town
Down the Jersey coast

With this lighter in my pocket
And two drinks down the drain
With this broken side view mirror
With out a dollar to my name

Sail the night away
From minutes to miles from home
I'll do it my way
From minutes to miles from home

Tonight we'll drive
Right through your town to the border line
Why can't I ever bring myself
To say goodbye?

Don't leave this story untold anymore
Casualties and memories have made us who we are
Don't leave this story untold anymore
Casualties and memories have made us who we are
