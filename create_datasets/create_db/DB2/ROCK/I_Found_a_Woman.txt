So very hard, hard
Sail on, you've got to believe
In what you believe in
Oh it's all waitin' for you babe

I wonder where I go?
I know only my heart must show
Hands in the dark reachin' out
Tryin' to find you, you know what I'm about
Don't refuse me, hear me out, there's no doubt

I found a woman
I found a woman
I found a woman
I don't want nothin', only your lovin'
I found a woman, to play me out

Hands in the dark, reachin' out
Tryin' to find you, you know what I'm about
Don't refuse me hear me out, don't confuse me
There's no doubt

I found a woman
I found a woman
I found a woman
I don't want nothin', only your lovin'
I found a woman, to play me out
