I got too much time, too much time 
I got too much time to be without love 
 
In my life I've got a deep devotion 
Wide as the sky and deep as the ocean 
Every war that's waged makes me cry 
Every bird that goes by gets me high 
 
Sometimes when it's late and I'm a little bit hungry 
I heat up some old stale beans, 
Open up a can of sardines, 
Eat crackers and dream of somebody to cook for me.
 
I got too much time, too much time 
I got too much time to be without love 

In my life I've got a deep devotion 
Wide as the sky and deep as the ocean 
Every war that's waged makes me cry 
Every bird that goes by gets me high 

I got too much time, too much time 
I got too much time to be without love
