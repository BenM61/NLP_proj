i'm as happy as a king
feeling good and everything
just like a bird in the spring
it's my sweety can't you guess
while the pining i confess
does he love me that's why i shout

Everybody loves my baby
but my baby don't love nobody but me
nobody but me
now
everybody wants my baby
but my baby don't want nobody but me
that's plain to see!
