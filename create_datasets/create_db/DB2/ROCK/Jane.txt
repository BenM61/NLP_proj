Jane, you say it's all over 
For you and me girl
There's a time for love 
And a time for lettin' it be baby

Jane, you're playin' a game called 
Called "hard to get" by its real name
Makin' believe that you just don't feel the same
Oh Jane

Jane, you're playin' a game
You never can win girl
You're stayin' away so I ask you
"Where you been, baby?"

Like a cat and a mouse (cat and a mouse)
From door to door and-a house to house
Don't you pretend you don't know
What I'm talking about

Were all those nights we spent together, hey hey
Only because you didn't know better
I got to know
Jane, you're playin' a game
You're playin' a game, playin' a game

(Jane, Jane, Jane)
Woah Jane you're playin' a game
But why I don't see
Jane you're playin' for fun
But I play for keeps, yes I do
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
That's a game on me, yeah
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
So plain to see
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
Why you foolin' with me, me, me
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
