Hypothermic ice cubes are melting down
With prisoners from BSA and the Royal Crown

Spits out wooden stools

When I came around I asked if you could dance

Anesthetists don't dance
They have balls with masks in France
Place your bets on ego
Won't someone fire me
Curl darling I'm on K hopeless inspire me
A million things to the individuals a million things
A million things to the million singular eyes has everything
