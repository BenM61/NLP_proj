Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't tell me to stop

Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time
Let it fall by the way
Leave me where I lay

Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't tell me, I'll learn
Take the black off a crow
But don't tell me to go

Tell the bed not to lay
Like the mouth of a grave
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf on its knees

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't tell me to stop
