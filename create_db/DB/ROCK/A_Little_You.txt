There's a little truth in 
every lie you tell me 
A little good in all the bad 
you do....yesss 
So instead of running away 
Why don't you listen 
when I say 
All I want is just a little you 

I've been wanting you to say 
the words, I love you 
A little love is gonna make 
all my dreams come true...
So instead of running away 
Why don't you listen to me 
when I say 
All I want is just a little you 

Ooh, there's nothing in this 
world I couldn't do 
If you would only say 
you love me true 
'Cause, baby, all I want is 
a little you 
Through the day and through 
the nighttime too 
Just a little you..... 

There's a little truth in every 
little lie that you tell me 
A little good in all the bad 
you do, yes 
Instead of running away 
Why don't you listen to me 
when I say 
That all I want is just a little you 
Ohhhh, child, 
I said all I want 
is just a little you...
