Please tell me now
How much you care
Before we say good night, my dear

You'll never say
That you'll be mine
Why keep me waiting?
Please tell me now

Day and night I'm wondering
Do you really care?
Must I go on wondering
About this love affair?

My heart will cry
And that's no lie
Don't keep me waiting
Please tell me now
