Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
'Cause, I'm too young to be in misery
Now baby, come back and take this hurt off me

I'll be waiting at the bus station
'Cause that's where you left me standin'
I got my clothes in a twenty-five cent locker
(Fool!) I be here (fool!)
'Till the Greyhound (fool!)
Bring you back again, girl
(Fool! fool! fool! fool!)

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
'Cause I'm too young to be in misery, now
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me

I knocked on my mother's door
She said, a 'Don, walk on in'
'Son, you don't have to say a mumblin' word
I know your woman done and left ya, again'
(She left me! she left me! she left me! yes, she did)

I say, now
Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, now
What kind of love could this be now?
Baby, baby, baby, I don't know what you've got
'Sho' that's it's got me'
(It's got 'em! it's got 'em! it's got 'em!
Mercy!

But now, I've been to see my doctor, yeah
(I been to see the doctor, now)
He did all he could
(He did all he could)
But there was nothin'
He could do for me, girl
You're the only one who could
(Come-come, come, come, come, come)
Come on baby, now

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me

It's hurtin' me
(Hurtin' me)
Heartbreak, now

Heartache

Too much pain

Come back, again
