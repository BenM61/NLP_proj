Bonne nuit good night
Just dream away
The dawn will light a bright new day
Be cheerful in your sleepy time prayer
The tearful never get anywhere so don't despair
Bonne nuit my love
Dream of the land
Where stars above fall in your hand
And some day we'll find this where and when
Bonne nuit 'til then
And some day we'll find this where and when
Bonne nuit goodnight 'til then
