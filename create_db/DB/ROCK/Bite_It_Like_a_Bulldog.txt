Caught red handed, blood drops cover your face
The gun still smoking in your hand
You did not do it, the rest of the world is always wrong
As you see it from where you stand

Always try to find another fool to sacrifice your mother
They probably know that they're in your game
Anybody really will do fine as long as it won't be you
You let the dice decide who's to blame

Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite like a bulldog to the bone, never let it go
Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite it like a bulldog freaking out, foaming at the mouth

You won't take no responsibility for anything you say or do
Friend or foe it don't matter
Anyone can go as long as it won't be you

Always try to find another fool to sacrifice your mother
They probably know that they're in your game
Anybody really will do fine as long as it won't be you
You let the dice decide who's to blame

Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite like a bulldog to the bone, never let it go
Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite it like a bulldog freaking out, foaming at the mouth

You leave a trail of dead behind you
Your dead wrong but you are giving in
To deny the truth you'll make it untrue
Just saying it, don't make you aching pins

Bite it, bite it like a
Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite it to the bone, never let it go

Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite like a bulldog to the bone, never let it go
Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite it like a bulldog freaking out, foaming at the mouth

Bite it, bite it like a bulldog
Bite it like a bulldog to the bone, never let it go
Bite
