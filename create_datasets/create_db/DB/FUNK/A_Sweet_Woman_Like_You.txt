Woman tell me, where did you learn
To handle a man with so much ease
After all of his life
He's used to doin' as he pleased, yeah
You got me doing all the good things
That a man's supposed to do
I know a lot of men who wish they had
A sweet little woman like you
'Cause your kind is so hard to find

Woman tell me, where did you learn
To make a man feel like a king
When all the time he knows
That he hasn't got a thing, yeah

And there is no limit to what I can do
I know some men who'd give their right arm
To have a sweet little woman like you

Because your kind is so hard to find

And that's why I'm so glad I got mine

And how much you mean to me, yeah

I know a lot of men that wish they had
A sweet little woman like you
'Cause your kind is so hard to find
