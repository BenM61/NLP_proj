I remember how we smiled
A devil lived within our hearts
We looked so good there for a while
But I guess we grew apart 

We could have been friends... forever 

I remember how we ran
'Til there was nowhere left to run
I never wanted it to end
But of course it had to end 

We could have been friends... forever
