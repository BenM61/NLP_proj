There was a time
When my life was easy
Stretched out in the sun
Everything was clover
The world was off my shoulders for awhile

But then the sky turned a bomb fire shade
And hit me like a gun
It passed with flying colors
There's no flying over

The storm
We will dance as it breaks
The storm
It will give as it takes
And all of our pain is washed away
Don't cry or be afraid
Some things only can be made
In the storm

Sometimes we get swept away
We're forced to take the change
The desert gives you comfort
You can't stay here all your wounded life
Underneath is the tempest rage
Your secrets come undone
When mountains need movin'
Let me help you through it

The storm 
We will dance as it breaks
The storm
Comes as fast as it fades
And all of our pain is washed away
Don't cry or be afraid
Some things only can be made
In the storm

All your secrets come undone
Every web you've ever spun
All your secrets come undone
Let'em go
Let it come

The storm
We will dance as it breaks
The storm
Gives you more than it takes
And all of our pain is washed away
Stare chaos in the face
We need only to embrace

Don't cry or be afraid
Some things only can be made
In the storm
