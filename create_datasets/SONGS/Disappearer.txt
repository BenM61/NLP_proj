Here it comes again, out of the rain
Seems to have a new, kind of same
Been it playing on a, simple rhyme
The site comes alive and, speaks the mind
It turns to me and, it turns to gold
It turns to see, the fast lane slow

It's been a way too long
It's been the way I'm goin'
It's a-coasting on
To the west star

Looking out I thought I, saw it blink
Coming on to me, like a silver eye
Pick it up and, turn it on and
Head on out to a, western starland

It's been a man and gone 
Now it's a singing song
Like a western star
It's going my way

Looking out I'm back in, time to stay
Into the eastern, silent way 
It comes alive, through the clearer
A ghost arise to, a mirror

You've been away too long 
It's been way too long
An eastern star is on
A disappearer
