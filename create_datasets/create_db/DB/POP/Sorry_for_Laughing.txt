It took ten years to realize
Why the angel stopped crying
When you sail on down the lane
Your happy smile, your funny name

I just don't mean the things that I say
It's only 'cause you're made that way

Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening
Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening

When we grooved on into town
Charles Atlas stopped to frown
'Cause he's not made like me and you
Just can't do the things we do

I'm not being mean, so don't take it hard
When I ask you to run round the yard

Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening
Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening

Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening
Sorry for laughing
There's too much happening
