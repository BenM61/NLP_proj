Here am I, mad about you, mad about you
I can't lie, I'm mad about you, mad about you
Though I said to my heart, don't fall
How I love the enchantment of it all

If you knew all the dreams I've had about you
Then you'd know that I've got it bad about you
Press your lips to my lips and hold me near, so near
Can't you see I'm mad about you, dear?

If you knew all those dreams I've had about you
Then you'd know that I've got it bad about you
Press your lips to my lips and hold me near, so near
Settle down, you, gad about, you
Please, don't make me sad about you
Can't you see I'm mad about you, dear?
