All the things that we've been through
Darling, you should understand me like I understand you
Honey, I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gone do nothing to upset our happy home
You don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
Oh we act like children when we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
(If you don't)
You will never
(You'll never, never know me)
Never know me

If you don't know me by now
(If you don't)
You will never
(You'll never, never know me)
Never know me

Oh, we all got our own funny moods
Honey, I've got mine and you got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we been together

That should be so easy to do
Oh you better get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
What good is a love affair if we can't see eye to eye

If you don't know me by now
(You'll never, you'll never, you ain't gonna know me)
Never know me
If you don't know me by now

(If you don't know me)
You will never
(You'll never, never know me)
Never know me

Whoa baby, I thought you
Oh I thought you knew me by now
But you don't, oh baby, I know you
I thought you knew me by now but you don't

Ha, ha, ha
Yeah, I like to do one of those ha, ha
Sometimes you think you all knowing about them
I think it's kinda like your ego gets in the way
And you take for granted, somebody just knows

What you're all about my dear and they just don't
Awe shucks, I'm a try to talk to you suga
You break your back and you break your legs
And you break your faith
Trying to make these people know you in life

But somehow, they just don't want to try to
So you say to yourself, "Is it something I said?
Is it something I done, is it the way I look?
Is it the way my clothes come unfasten?"

And if that turns you off baby
Then you ain't worth me anyway
Screams so you fasten your clothes
You check your speech and you check you drag
And everything else, your face

And you find out you're still in trouble
So then you say to yourself, "Self is it worth it?"
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no
'Cause it's been ten long years
This is the situation that I'm talkin' about

Ten long years and if you don't know me
I'm not try to prove myself no more
You will never, never, never know me
You'll go on, you'll go on and find yourself, someone else

Because if you think your lonely now
Wait until tonight comes
'Cause I'll be somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
I ain't gonna stop and try to prove myself to you

Because you ain't gonna, you ain't gonna
You ain't gonna, know me
Know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know, know
