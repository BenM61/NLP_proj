Strobe lights flashing in my eyes
Living for this moment, now I realize
I'll never tell a lie lie lie
I'll never let em in, I leave em on the outside
I promise you, I promise you, yeah
I promise you, I promise you, yeah
I promise you, I promise you
Cross my heart until the day I die

I've been around the world and back
Screaming more money more paper
Been doing it major
Even Walkers ain't go this much flavor
They say I'm superbad like Mclovin
Now man are calling me family all of a sudden
And I'm like mum how come you never told me that I had all these cousins
This corner I'm standing in never felt claustrophobic when I came here 10 minutes ago
Now my backs against the wall
It's a good job I'm tall
So I can always see clear
Even with all the smoke in the air
I know some are standing here cause of loving fame
But some of them are here out of fear

Strobe lights flashing in my eyes
Living for this moment, now I realize
I'll never tell a lie lie lie
I'll never let em in, I leave em on the outside
I promise you, I promise you, yeah
I promise you, I promise you, yeah
I promise you, I promise you
Cross my heart until the day I die

It's time to go straight back to the top with them
They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
And all my real friends know I'ma still keep it 10 multiplied by 10
Forgive me if I've been acting a little strange
I never ever knew that one song could make my whole life change
Last week I boarded six planes
But I can't complain this is the moment I've been waiting for
Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door
I'm with Boy Better Know let em all in
But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please, listen to me when I'm talking
The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning
I never had a pen but I made a mark
Even when I top the chart I'll be the same guy that I was at the start
I hope to die I cross my heart

Strobe lights flashing in my eyes
Living for this moment, now I realize
I'll never tell a lie lie lie
I'll never let em in, I leave em on the outside
I promise you, I promise you, yeah
I promise you, I promise you, yeah
I promise you, I promise you
Cross my heart until the day I die
