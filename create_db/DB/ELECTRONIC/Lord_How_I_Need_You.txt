He will come and lift your spirit
He will pick you up
When men put you down
Trust in his name, he's always the same
Lord how I need you
When your friends come and go
Because they depended on you 
For their own selfish needs
The Lord he own't leave you 
Nor will he forsake you
He'll be right by your side
Lord how I need you
He will come oh yes he will
He will come and lift your spirit
He will pick you up
When men put you down
Trust in his name, he's always the same
Lord how I need you
When your friends come and go
Because they depended on you 
For their own selfish needs
The Lord he own't leave you 
Nor will he forsake you
He'll be right by your side
Lord how I need you
He will come oh yes he will
Lord!  Lord we need you
Lord!  Lord we need you
We need your love
We need your peace
We need your joy
We need your spirit
Lord how I need you
