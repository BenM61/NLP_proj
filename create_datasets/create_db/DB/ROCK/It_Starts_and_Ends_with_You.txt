Like a cause without a martyr
Like an effigy of balsa
Like a hairline crack in a radiator
Leaking life

I shout out but it just spins faster
I crawl up but my knees are water
I cling on by my nails to the sweet disaster

And then I fall to the floor like my strings are cut
Pinch myself but I don't wake up
Spit in the wind cause too much is not enough
It starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you

And I've worn so many faces
Shot my love at fifteen paces
My inheritance is all the thoughts I can't sweep away

I shout out but it just spins faster
I crawl up but my knees are water
I cling on by my nails to the sweet disaster

And then I fall to the floor like my strings are cut
Pinch myself but I don't wake up
Spit in the wind cause too much is not enough
It starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you

Shout out but it just spins faster
Crawl up but my knees are water
Cling on by my nails to the sweet disaster

And then I fall to the floor like my strings are cut
Spit in the wind but I don't wake up
Pinch myself cause too much is not enough
It starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you

I shout out but it just spins faster
I crawl up but my knees are water
I shout out but it just spins faster
I crawl up but my knees are water
I shout out but it just spins faster
I crawl up but my knees are water
I shout out but it just spins faster
I crawl up but my knees are water
