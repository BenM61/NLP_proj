What you got if you ain't got love
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You want to shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand (Is just a grain of sand)
What you've been up there searching for
forever
Is in your hands (Is in your hands)
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you sit around thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand (Is just a grain of sand)
What you've been up there searching for
forever
Is in your hands (Is in your hands)
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small
