Just that kiss
Was all there is
Every cell in my body
Lined up for you
Legs a little open
Once again
Awaken my senses
Head topless
Arisen my senses! (Arisen my senses)

Just that kiss
Was all there is
My hands, my palms pulsating of
The things I want to do to you (the things)
(I want to do to you)

Just that kiss (just that kiss)
Is all there is (is all there is)
We're weaving a mix-tape
With every crossfade
Is WWW
For him I heed (Is WWW)
Songs from the
Warmth, once again (I'll send you some)
We're weaving a mix-tape
Weaving a mix-tape (with every)
Song

For who I am
For, for, with love
With love (and)

Awaken my senses
I'll weave it
Just that kiss (awaken my senses)
Was all there is
Just that kiss (kiss, kiss) (arisen)
Was all there is (my senses, my senses)
Once again, just that kiss (arisen)
Was all there is (my senses)

For him I heed
Once again, I'm made to merge
For him I heed
We're made to merge (it's you)
For him I heed (I see)
For him I heed
For him I heed (am I keen or key or not too keen)
Too keen, to see, to be seen (am I keen or key or not too keen?)
With him I heed
He sees me for who I am (am I keen or not keen?)
For him I heed
To key, to see, to be seen (am I keen or not keen?)
With him, him (am I keen or not keen?)
He sees me for who I am (to key, to be?)
