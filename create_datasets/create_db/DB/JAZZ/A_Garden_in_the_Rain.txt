I recall a summer's day
When you and I had strolled away
And suddenly a storm grew nigh
Seeking shelter from the rain
We hurried down a little lane
Found a lovely spot nearby

T'was just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath skies of gray

The raindrops kissed the flowerbeds
The blossoms raise their pretty heads
A purfumed "thank you" they seemed to say

Surely here was charm beyond compare to view
Maybe it was just that I was there with you?

T'was just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And set us happily on our way
