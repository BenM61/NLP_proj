[Missy Elliot]
Yeah, uh huh
See, me and Timbaland
We got the [shit] that hits from here
From here to overseas
Where SWV is
Check it, one time, uh huh, uh huh.
See, um, um, me, I'm Super Fly
Super duper fly
Rub your hands up my thigh
And go super duper high
'Til you see my apple pie
Tell me if you like
Tell me if you like

Baby got me tipsy, tipsy
On the real need you're love
Tasty, baby
You send me crazy, crazy
Can not be a lady
I love the things you say to me
I like it when you're talking dirty

[Chorus]
Can we get kinky tonight
I got so many things on my mind
I never seen a guy so fine
I like it when you do me, do me
Can we get kinky tonight
I got so many things on my mind
I wanna feel you squeeze me tight

Oooh honey, got me
So high, so high
I can't lie
About the way you play me
If you want me, take me
Send me crazy, crazy
Baby, I love the way you taste me
You're so tasty like pastry

[Chorus]

[Lelee]
Spend the night with me
Spend the night with me-ee-ee-ee
(Spend the night)
Spend the night with me
Don't care what we do
Just as long as I'm with you
Oohhh-hhhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhh-hhhh!!!!

[Chorus]

[Missy Elliot]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah
Can we get kinky tonight
I got so many things on my mind
I never seen a guy so fine
I like it when you do me, do me
Oh, uh huh, uh huh
Can we get kinky tonight
I got so many things on my mind
I wanna feel you squeeze me tight

(Rap)
We can sit in the back of my 300
We kissing and we fondling
We high and we blunted
Take me if you want it
To the (Ho-Jo)
Up all night like (No-Doz)
Yes, I got the feeling
(Feel me flow)
Don't ask me if I'm nasty, Freaky Deaky
See, y'all can't see me
Me, Timbaland and SWV
We hit you with the He He
Now shall we? Ha, ha
Check it out

[Chorus]
