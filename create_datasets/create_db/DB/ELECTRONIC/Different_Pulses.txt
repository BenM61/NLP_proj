My life is like a wound
I scratch so I can bleed
Regurgitate my words,
I write so I can feed
And death grows like a tree
That's planted in my chest
Its roots are at my feet,
I walk so it won't rest

Oh, baby I am lost
I said oh, baby I am lost

I try to push the colours
Through a prism back to white
To sync our different pulses
Into a blinding light
And if love is not the key.
If love is not a key
I hope that I can find
A place where it could be

I know that in your heart
There is an answer to a question
Which I'm not as yet aware that I have asked
And if that tree had not drunk my tears
I would have bled and cried for all the years
That I alone have let them pass

And oh, baby I am yours
I said oh, baby I am yours
And oh, baby I am yours
I said oh, baby I am yours
