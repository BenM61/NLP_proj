You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
I found out you ain't a doggone thing

Said the monkey to the lion on a bright summer day
"Say man, there's a big, bad cat livin' down the way
You know he talks about your folks in a heck of a way
And he says a whole lotta things that I'm sorta afraid to say"

Well the lion jumps salty, all full of rage
Like a Harlem cat that's left in his cage
He meets the lion up under a great big tree
And he says "look here, now, big boy, it's either you or me"

They fought all night and they fought all day
Man, I don't really know how but the lion, he got away
He came back to the jungle more dead than alive
And that's when the monkey started to signify

You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
I found out you ain't a doggone thing

You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
I found out you ain't a doggone thing

Well, he worked up his temper when he was jumping up and down
And his foot missed a limb and his head hit the ground
Like a bolt o' lightning in a stricken heap
The lion was on the poor monkey with all four feet

The monkey looks up from the corner of his eyes
And he says "now, mister lion, look now, I apologize"
The monkey on his back, he's slick, he studies up a scheme
He's trying to trick the old jungle king

He said "now, bear with me, mister lion, like a good lion should
Please don't tear me up and throw me all over the woods
Well, the lion jumps up and he squares off to fight
Oh, but the monkey fooled him, he was completely outta sight

You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
You call yourself the jungle king
I found out you ain't a doggone thing
