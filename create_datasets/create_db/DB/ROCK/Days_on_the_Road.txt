I remember the days on the road, tryin' to get somewhere
All the time spent behind the wheel, I remember the faces of people
Who did me wrong there, and they were, oh, so many to know

Country dates and fans who wait for hours it's strange
I don't even remember a name, patiently they wait and see
Where will he run to now? And they were, oh, so many to know

I was born a dream chaser, running away from the country
That made me rock 'n' roll, you're a home breaker turnin' my head
From the family that loved me, and I hate it, how I hate leaving you

But what more can I do than to try and find my way?
Carry me on to somewhere, send me someone who will share it all
Help me to find my peace of mind

I remember the days on the road, I almost died there each year
Harder than those before and I'll remember the faces of friends
If I ever go back again, they were also many to know

I remember the days on the road, I remember the days on the road
I remember the days on the road, I remember the days on the road
Yes, I do, yes I do, oh, I remember the days on the road
I remember the days on the road, and they were so many to know
