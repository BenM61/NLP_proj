Put my lady next to you 
To always feel your touch 
Every little thing you do 
Seems to turn me on 
Even when you're talking nasty to me 
Over the telephone 

Honey Ill stay up late for you 
And wait for your call 
Buzz me up at 5 AM 
And I don't mind at all 

Cause Ill do anything for your loving 
Yes will Ill do anything But with a serious step are you qualified? 

Just can't

First thing in the morning 
Ill be at your door 
O tough 
All day long and 
All night strong

We can begin 
I play your game 
Every time

And Ill take heed 
And lead you in the right direction for affection 
See what I'm saying

But I think I like you 

Do anything for your lovin'
Could you find the time to make me yours? 
Take me out and rock the floors? 
Give me every little bit of your loves what I said 
Make it smooth to the groove 
Like sandwich bread
