Fa la lalalala
Fa la lalalala
Close your mouth except to say
Fa la lalalala
You might get something happening
This season has a secret joy that some are missing
We could all find it If we just once listen

Put your big bank book back in the drawer
Bring your mind and body back from the store
Get to know the people in your house 
You might like them 

There is a million magic things to those who try 
to let it be its magic self and not a thing devised
Sit down and sing a happy song and whistle round your tooth
And be still enough to hear the reindeer on your roof

Put your big bank book back in the drawer
Bring your mind and body back from the store
Get to know the people in your house 
You might like them 

Close your mouth except to say
Fa la lalalala
You might get something happening
Fa la lalala
This season has a secret joy that some are missing
We could all find it If we just once listen

Put your big bank book back in the drawer
Bring your mind and body back from the store
Get to know the people in your house 
Put your big bank book back in the drawer
Bring your mind and body back from the store
Get to know the people in your house 
Get to know the people in your house 
Get to know the people in your house
