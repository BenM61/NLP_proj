Never knew you 
But now I'm haunted by your past, 
How long will this last? 

I thought you loved me, 
You say you love me, 
Loves just a shadow that you cast. 

And all my dreams come round in threes always 
I'm independent but I'm tied to you 
You lied to me, I'd die for you 
But I can't read your mind. 

I'm lost without you 
An empty feeling deep inside 
I want to run and hide 

I'll let you use me 
And just abuse me 
But girl I want you to be mine 

And all my dreams come round in threes always 
I'm independent but I'm tied to you 
You lied to me, I'd die for you 
But I can't read your mind. 

And all my dreams come round in threes always 
I'm independent but I'm tied to you 
You lied to me, I'd die for you 
But I can't read your mind
