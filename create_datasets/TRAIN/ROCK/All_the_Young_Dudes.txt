Billy rapped all night 'bout his suicide 
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25 
Don't wanna stay alive when you're 25 

Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars 
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face 
Funky little boat race 
The television man is crazy 
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks 
Man I need a TV when I've got T. Rex 
Hey brother you guessed I'm a dude 

All the young dudes 
Carry the news 
Boogaloo dudes 
Carry the news 

All the young dudes 
Carry the news 
Boogaloo dudes 
Carry the news

Now Jimmy looking sweet though he dresses like a queen 
He can kick like a mule 
It's a real mean team 
We can love 
Oh we can love 
And my brother's back at home 
With his Beatles and his Stones 
We never got if off on that revolution stuff 
What a drag 
Too many snags 
Well I drunk a lot of wine 
And I'm feeling fine 
Gonna race some cat to bed 
Is this concrete all around 
Or is it in my head 
Oh brother you guessed I'm a dude 

All the young dudes 
Carry the news 
Boogaloo dudes 
Carry the news

All the young dudes 
Carry the news 
Boogaloo dudes 
Carry the news
