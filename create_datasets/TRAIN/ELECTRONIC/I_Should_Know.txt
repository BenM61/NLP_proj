I'll show you thing's that you've never seen
I know places you've never been
To where the grass isn't green
Because I, (yeah)
I should know

Playing away from home is fun
This food is cooked but it isn't done!
But, boy the best is to come
Because I, (yeah)
I should know

I should know
I should know
The pain that grows
I should know

Its always me that gets the blame
If the second single sounds the same
But loneliness is a pain
That I, (yeah)
I should know

I should know
I should know
The pain that grows
Yeah, I should know

Two steps forward
And one step back
The wheels are coming off the track!
But still there's time to get back
Because I, (yeah)
I should know

Waking up in someone's attic
Flying solo on automatic
Look out boy its problematic
Believe me
I should know...
