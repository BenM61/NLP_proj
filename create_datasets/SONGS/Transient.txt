I emerge with a dirge, I'll speak until my death rattle
There's a war outside the blackboard jungle prepare for battle
Those who sleep the American dream will wake tonight
From the words I recite, shedding light with what I write

Second amendment needs amending, not a basic human right
Can't agree with what I see, it's an idiot's delight
When all injuns wanna wear the headdress
But can we convalesce the students strike to a recess

Change a little late now
That your face is down and bloodied
By my one triggered mind
Hate, enslaved to live down
Chamber's loaded I am ready
Shots sound out my cry

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind

Dead finger on the pulse of this nation, no pulsation
Firearms are growing faster than the population
Armed like octopi, preoccupied with bereavement
Growing old's become the new benchmark of our achievement

Every metropolis has turned to a necropolis
Disarm the nuclear family, stifle the rifle not the populous
Relationships are hollow as an empty casing
Time is racing, a brick wall is what we're facing

Change a little late now
That your face is down and bloodied
By my one triggered mind
Hate, enslaved to live down
Chamber's loaded I am ready
Shots sound out my cry

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind

Bring that shit back
Take your life back
Back, back, back
We won't take that f*ck that

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind
