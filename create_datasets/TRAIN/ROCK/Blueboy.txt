Way back in the hills
There's a ploace I know
People comes from miles around
Just to watch 'ol Dooley do the show

Ooh let the blueboy play
Ooh let the blueboy play
Gonna ride the mule
Gonna chase him too
Pullin' on-a pullin' on-a
Pullin' on-a pony
He goes

Soon's the sun go down
That's when the fun begins
Hitch your wagon down the track
Up to the roadhouse
And come on in

Ooh let the blueboy play
Ooh let the blueboy play
Gonna ride the mule
Gonna chase him too
Pullin' on-a pullin' on-a
Pullin' on-a pony
He goes

Sheriff says it late
Closin' time we got to go
But Dooley he don't want to quit
Ain't nobody feels like goin' home

Oh let the blueboy play
Oh let the blueboy play
Gonna ride the mule
Gonna chase him too
Pullin' on-a pullin' on-a
Pullin' on-a pony
He goes
