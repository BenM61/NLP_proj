Well the sun went down
On Easy Street
She's been closed down for the winter
She stopped to take a rest
Or maybe push us from the nest
It's just a dance that the shadows do

And it's goodbye, goodbye Easy Street
Once you say goodbye, it is goodbye
And it's goodbye, goodbye Easy Street
This is goodbye, this is goodbye

At the carnival
In the sweet summer time
You get sick from eating too much candy
And the leaves they change
And you change your train 
It's just a dance that the shadows do

And it's goodbye, goodbye Easy Street
Once you say goodbye, it is goodbye
And it's goodbye, goodbye Easy Street
This is goodbye, this is goodbye

Like a bell that must be rung
Or a song that should be sung
Or a story that's never ending
She'll hold you to her breast
Then she'll put you to the test
It's just a dance that the shadows do

And it's goodbye, goodbye Easy Street
Once you say goodbye, it is goodbye
And it's goodbye, goodbye Easy Street
This is goodbye, this is goodbye
