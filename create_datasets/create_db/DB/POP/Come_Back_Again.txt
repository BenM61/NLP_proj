I'm mopin' around streets late at night
I'm worried because you ain't treatin' me right
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe

I spoke to your mum and I spoke to your dad
They said I was crazy, made me feel sad
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe

Feelin' so sad, so lonely too
You don't know how it is to feel sad and lonely an' blue
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe

I spoke to your dad and I spoke to your mum
They said go away boy and leave us alone
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe

I really don't know what to do
Everything you say just make me feel blue
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe

I went to the dance, but I went all alone
I watched you dancin' then I followed you home
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe

I'm mopin' around streets late at night
Worried because you ain't treatin' me right
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe

I really don't know what to do
Everything you say just make me feel blue
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe
Come back again
I'm just crazy 'bout you babe
