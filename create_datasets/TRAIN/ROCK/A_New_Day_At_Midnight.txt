Oh my world ain't never seen
A day so golden, earth so green
I put my face into the stream
And I might see what might've been

Oh my heart, how time must float
My feet that pass along the stone
I hardly recognize my home
All the paths had overgrown
The music and the laughter gone

Oh my heart, it never felt
So free of all the chains I built
All the pain and all the guilt
Vanished now, beneath the silk

I'm striding 'cross Orion's Belt

Oh my world
Oh my world
Oh my world
