They just stare and whisper
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Everybody's talkin'
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Everybody's talkin'

They just stare and whisper wherever I go
They just stare and whisper, now everyone knows
That the dream I thought I had found
Has come tumbl'in' down

What seemed more perfect than the future that we pla-anned
Walking proudly by your side
I could not see, you-ou were deceivin' me
How could I be so blind to all the reasons why

They just stare and whisper wherever I go
They just stare and whisper-er-er, now everyone knows
That the dream I thought I had found
Has come tumbl'in' dow-own

I found her picture that you safely tucked away-ay-ay
There was no need to explai-ain or to question you
It was written clearly o-on your face
That you love her more-ore and oh-oh

They just stare and whisper wherever I go
They just stare-are and whisper-er, now everyone knows
That the dream I thought I had found
Has come tumbl'in' dow-ow-own

Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh...
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh... (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

They just stare-are and whisper-er wherever I go
They just stare-are and whisper-er, now everyone knows
They just stare-are and whisper wherever I go (I feel like a fool)
They just stare and whisper-er, now everyone knows
