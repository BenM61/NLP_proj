If I was a boy I'd know the things a girl shouldn't know
I'd go where girls shouldn't go
So, oh so girls shouldn't, so

If I was a boy, I'd had come of age a long time ago
It would be a joy, if I was a boy

If I was a boy, I'd do so much a girl can't explain
I'd pack and catch me a train
Go out and raise me some Cain

If I was a boy, there'd be some use in having a brain
It would be a joy, just to be a boy

There is such a lot a girl is got to cope with
There are times I think I'm busting at the seams

But as long as I have something left to hope with
I still have my dreams

If I was a boy, I'd have no wings like girls seem to sprout
Learn things that girls seem to doubt
Spread my activities out

If I was a boy, I'd know what all the shouting's about
It would be a joy, just to be a boy

There is such a lot a girl is got to cope with
There are times I think I'm busting at the seams

But as long as I have something left to hope with
I still have my dreams

If I was a boy, I'd have no wings like girls seem to sprout
Learn things that girls seem to doubt
Spread my small activities out

If I was a boy, I'd know what all the shouting's about
It would be a joy, just to be a boy

Doggone it, if I was only a boy, the things I wouldn't do
I'd take a trip to
