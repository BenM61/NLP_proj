The sound of thunder on the ocean when the darken rise
Sunlight are too nice, the sun and kisses on the far off shore

Starlite are too nice, such faces in such a place to be
Starlite are too nice, such faces in such a place to be

Some raindrops that glistened after downpour on a summer's day
A smoke fire, a love fight, a... in the further fields
Starlite are too nice, such faces and a place to be
Starlite are too nice, such faces and a place to be

The whisper around us
I have this feeling of the roots of stars
The deeper breath and they collide
Take my hand and walk back to the car

Starlite are too nice, such faces in such a place to be
Starlite are too nice, such faces in such a place to be
Starlite are too nice, such faces in such a place to be
Starlite are too nice, such faces in such a place to be

My heart smiles, I'm happy again
