The first time you kissed me at the end of our street
The gas lamps shone above us, young lovers we'd meet
But the old town has gone now and it's winter too soon
Still we waltz beneath our valentine moon 

The streets and the market and the old dog and bell
We've gone through the changes, we've lived our lives well
But the old town is gone now and it's winter too soon
Still we waltz beneath our valentine moon 

Valentine moon, valentine moon
We danced together as old lovers do
Valentine moon, valentine moon
We'll always remember our valentine moon 

Cette fois que tu m'embrasse, au bout de notre rue
Les lampes de gaz nous allumiere, toi et moi jeunes amants
But the old town is gone now and it's winter too soon
Still we waltz beneath our valentine moon
