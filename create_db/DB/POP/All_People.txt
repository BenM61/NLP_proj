Here we go

Everybody wants me to be who they want me to be except you
All I wanna do is be with you
They all tell me that there’s something strange
I don’t wanna be with nobody new
All I wanna do is be with you

Life sounds like
I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
(This is what it sounds like)
Whoa-oh-oh, I’m alive

How could every day something jumps in the way
Gets complicated, I feel devastated
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with you
I can’t afford the rent or remember checks I sent
To pay off all my taxes and feed the president
But there’s one thing I remember, I only wanna be with you

Life sounds like
I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
(This is what it sounds like)
Whoa-oh-oh, I’m alive

(Break it down right here now)
You'll be Bonnie, I’ll be your Clyde
Hop into my car and drive like
Fireworks, we will ignite
Through the San Francisco night
Like John and Yoko
Like Ice-T and Coco
Like Jay-Z, Beyonce
Come be my fiance

Hey soul sister, I’ll be your mister
Don’t wanna be no one-night stand
How many things can I say to make you understand
That I only wanna be your man

Life sounds like
Whoa-oh-oh
This is what it sounds like
Whoa-oh-oh
And it sounds like

I’m alive [x6]
(This is what it sounds like)
Whoa-oh-oh, I’m alive

(Bring it back one more time)

Everybody wants me to be who they want me to be except you
All I wanna do is be with you

Life sounds like
Whoa-oh-oh
(This is what it sounds like)
Whoa-oh-oh
Life sounds like, like, like…

Life sounds like
I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
(This is what it sounds like)
Whoa-oh-oh, I’m alive
