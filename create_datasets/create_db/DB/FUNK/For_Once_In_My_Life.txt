For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know Ill be strong

For once I cant touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, someone like you
Would ever dream of makin my dreams come true

For once in my life
I wont let sorrow hurt me
Not like its hurt me before, oh
For once I have something I know wont desert me
Cause Im not alone anymore

For once I can say
This is mine, you cant take it
Long as I know Ive got love I can make it
For once in my life
Ive got that someone who needs me
Mmm...hmm...hmm...

For once in my life
