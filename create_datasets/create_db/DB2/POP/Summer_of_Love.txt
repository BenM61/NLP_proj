I walked you home
The sky was golden
You knew I wouldn't stay
You pulled me close
Beside the ocean
But I turned away

Oh, why you catching feelings
Under the sun?
Oh, there is only freedom
In the summer of love

Summer of love
Summer of love
Summer of

Summer of
Two hearts, blue stars fallen down
Shoot me up
Summer of love

No bleeding nights
We know it's over
A weight lift from the soul
We say goodbye
We're barely sober
With no self control

And oh, why you catching feelings
Under the sun?
Oh, there is only freedom
In the summer of love

Summer of love
Summer of love
Summer of

Two hearts, blue stars fallen down
Shoot me up
Summer of love

I've fallen out of your arms
You've fallen out of my heart
I've fallen out of your arms
You've fallen out of my heart

Summer of love
Summer of love
Summer of
Two hearts, blue stars fallen down
Shoot me up
Summer of love
