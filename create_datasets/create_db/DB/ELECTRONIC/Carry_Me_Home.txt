There was a time
You and I get faded together
On the floor, so high
And I stayed there forever

You took the high road, I took the bottle
A little taste of freedom
But I get the feeling that I'll be needing
Somebody I can lean on

When I'm drunk and out on my own
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home?
When I'm down at the end of my rope
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home, home, home?

Home, home, home
When I'm down at the end of my rope
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home, home, home?

There was a time
You and I get faded together
That was then, but I know
We're still birds of a feather

You took the high road, I took the bottle
I'm never gonna slow down
But the lights are coming on
They're playing the final song
And I just need to know now

When I'm drunk and out on my own
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home?
When I'm down at the end of my rope
Would you carry me home, carry me home, home, home, home?

Home, home, home
When I'm down at the end, oh I know
You'll carry me home, carry me home, home, home, home

You carry me home
Home, home, home
When I'm down at the end, oh I know
You'll carry me home, carry me home, home, home, home
