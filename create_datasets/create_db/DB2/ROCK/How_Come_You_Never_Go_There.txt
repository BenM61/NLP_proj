How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there

How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there
I went up to your window
Lightly banging on the cymbals
A writ into the night
Came storming to your house

My horse had worked the fields too long
My bear had lost its innate calm
It's true enough for not at peace
But peace is never where the sea sees

Our love is not the light it was
When I walk inside the dark I'm calm
Where we look for where we went
It's only echoes in the melody

How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there

How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there
We waste time on blame I wreak revenge
Wasted energy and rejections
We're living proof, we gotta let go
And stop looking through the halo

We carry on as if our time is through
You carry on as if I don't love you
And so we find the ways out
To cover hard I have a doubt

The room is full of eyes and empty
Like your letters never sent me
Words like a lasso
You're an instrumental tune

How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there

How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there

How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there

How come you never go there
How come I'm so alone there
