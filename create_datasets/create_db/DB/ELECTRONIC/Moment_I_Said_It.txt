The moment I said it.
The moment I opened my mouth.
Let in your eye lids
Bulldoze the life out of me.
I know what you're thinking.
But darling you're not thinking straight.
Suddenly things just happened, we can't explain

It's not even light out but you've somewhere to be.
No hesitation no I've never seen you like this.
And I don't like it
I don't like it
I don't like it at all.

Just put back the car keys or somebody's gonna get hurt.
Who are you calling at this hour?
Sit down, come round, I need you now.
We'll work it all out, together.
But we're getting nowhere tonight.
Now sleep, I promise it'll all seem better somehow in time.

It's not even like that.
Suddenly oh, you've somewhere to be.
No hesitation oh, I've never seen you like this.
You're scaring me you're scaring me you're scaring me to death.

Don't oh (smash)
Please don't oh (I do, please, another one)
Don't oh (smash)
Please don't oh (I do, please, another one)

I'm losing you.
I'm losing you.
Trust me on this one.
I've got it bad for you.
Trust me on this one
You're gonna throw it all away
With no hesitation.

(Smash)
