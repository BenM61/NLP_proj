Dear sister poet, dear brother poet too
These tears are words, i make em, wanna be with you
But I need to spend my body I'm a music makin' man
And no page can release it like this amplifier can.

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Gonna sign it, gonna seal it, gonna mail it away
Gonna mail it today.

Dear Mama, Papa hey your boy is doin' fine
And this energy you gave him keeps on tryin' to unwind
'Cause I see an ancient rhythm in a man's genetic code
Gonna keep on rock and rollin' till my genes explode
