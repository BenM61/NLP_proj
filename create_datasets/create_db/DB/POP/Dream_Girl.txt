There is a girl for all of us, who never finds
The one she'll spend her life with
She's always there but I don't know her name
'Cause she's only in my dreams

Then suddenly I see her face
And realize, I already have met her
I had a chance that I didn't take
Now she's gone for good

Is this true? I walked away from you
Now I just wish you could come back tomorrow

Now she's gone for good

Is this true?
(Is this true?)
I walked away from you
(I walked away from you)
Now I just wish you could come back tomorrow
I wish that you could come back, yeah

I can't go on like this
I wish that you were mine once again
I wish that you were mine once again
I wish that you were mine once again
I wish that you were mine once again

I wish that you were mine once again
I wish that you were mine once again
I wish that you were mine once again
I wish that you were mine once again
