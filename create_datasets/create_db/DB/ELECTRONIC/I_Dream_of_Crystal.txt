So, let me begin with
Laying down the state we're in
With the pills and the gin
I can handle 'bout anything
But this is out of control

Do what you like to me
But please, don't hurt her man
'Cause I will hit you, hard as I can
But that ain't really the plan you see

Please, don't get me wrong
But you can't knock
What you've never done
It ain't always fun
But at least you'll be living some

So get the f*ck off my case
Yeah, she is a legend, man
I don't doubt that
And I will screw it up
I'm used to that

As the radio plays
You can't change this way of life
You can't change this state of mind
