Another dawn, another day, another dollar to be made
I got a pocket in my soul, 
Where a little rock a little roll assimilate
And I don't care what you think you know
'Bout who I am and how it goes
I made it easy to be me so yeah, 
It's easy to be me
And it's why I say

I know you can't stand me 
'Cause I make you so angry 
More and more each day hey hey hey
The way you don't love me 
Kind of makes you look ugly 
And the words you say hey hey hey
Come up and see me, I kind of like the abuse hey hey hey
There's no room in my bed but while you're here 
Just bow your head and you can shine my shoes
Shine my shoes

Get outta my lane boy, you're not in my league
Some are born to thrive and some to underachieve
Here's something that'll make you sick
I'm as happy as a pig in sh-
I've been amused, I've been about, I've been amazed, I've been betrayed
That's why I say

I know you can't stand me 
'Cause I make you so angry 
More and more each day hey hey hey
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly 
And the words you say hey hey hey
Come up and see me, oh oh oh, 
If you can take the abuse hey hey hey
There's no room in my bed but while you're here 
Just lend a hand and you can shine my shoes
Shine my shoes
Kneel down boy

I know you can't stand me 
I make you so angry more and more each day hey hey hey
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly 
Every words you say hey hey hey
Come up and see me, oh oh oh, 
I kinda like the abuse hey hey hey
There's no room in my bed but while you're here 
Then bow your head and you can shine my shoes
Shine my shoes
Shine my shoes
Until I see my face
