It's Christmas again 
Families and friends 
Chasing from store to store 
Here's last minute me 
Hoping to see 
Just what you're wishing for 
We are more than just friends 
As the gift should show 
Standing here, all at once I know 
This gift I bring 
It's yours for the taking 
Wrapped in love 
It took a lifetime making 
From my heart 
Straight to your longing 
This gift I bring 
Is simple and free 
And comes with a guarantee 
I give you me 
It may not be much 
A smile or a touch 
But it's all yours for all time 
It's here for today 
And won't go away 
'Cause I'm not the leaving kind 
Here's my fragile heart 
It is yours to break 
You may say no 
But that's a risk I'll take 
This gift I bring 
It's yours for the living 
Wrapped in love, it's the gift I'm giving 
From my heart 
Straight to your longing 
This gift I bring 
Is simple and free 
And comes with a guarantee 
From now on 
When the wind is blowing 
And the tears are flowing like rain 
You'll be safe 
In the shelter of this gift 
It's yours for the taking 
Wrapped in love, it took a lifetime making 
From my heart 
Straight to your longing 
I hope you smile 
I guess we'll see 
This gift I bring 
It's yours for free 
It comes with a guarantee 
I give you me
