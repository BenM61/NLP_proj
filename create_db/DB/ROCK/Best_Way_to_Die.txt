Count the days and several ways to die
This is the drug that told her she could fly
The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright
The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright 

Feel her pulse beating gently in the vein
Alive but dead, so close, nearly the same 

The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright
The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright 

He is an engine running in the red
Due to the boiling fever in his head 
He dragged her down almost overnight 
An innocent lost burning wrong from right 

The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright
The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright 

You don't deserve this! 

You're empty, I'm empty, it left me dry
You're bending, I'm bending, to save the night
I'm trying, you're crying
At the outstretched hand you found 
Hand you found, hand you found 

You don't deserve this!
