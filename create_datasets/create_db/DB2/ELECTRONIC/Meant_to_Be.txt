When I wake up, up in the morning light
I take a moment, putting the world to rights
And tell myself, it's just not meant to be

Somebody said to me, how could you be so wrong
Telling stories, telling them all day long
I tell you some things are just not meant for me

Now when I'm walking out on a moonlit night
Thinking over all of the things I've had
I tell myself, it just wasn't meant for me

Somebody said to me, how could I be so blind
Wanting mercy, wanting it all the time
I tell you something, it just wasn't meant for me

You make my world so right, because everything
It's just how it's meant to be
I wanna hold you so tight, hold you close tonight
This is how it's meant to be

You make me feel so alive, now every thing's alright
This is how it's meant to be
You make my world so right, because everything
Is just how it's meant to be
