[Verse 1:]
A wind is blowing and a fire's loose 
I couldn't find the words to call a truce 
And tore the temple down to let the spirit rise..ooo 

In the sound of the storm 
I can hear just one voice 

[Refrain:]
All over 
Let us all come closer 

[Verse 2:]
There is nowere to touch that doesn't hurt 
There is nowere that I can't look that isn't blurred 
Wirh all the righteousness and all the holy words...ooo 

In the sound of the storm 
I can hear just one voice 

[Refrain:]
All over 
When the heart sinks lower 
And the healing slower 
Let us all come over 

[Verse 3:]
I need a hand for 
A thread of peace and a send of hope 
I will raise my eyes to see more 
Speak a truth and we shall know...ooo 

In the light of one choice 
We will sing with one voice 

[Refrain:]
All over 
When the heart sinks lower 
And the healing slower 
Let us all come over 

[Verse 4:]
That is where we are 
That is who we are 
That is all we are
