You were all that we needed
To believe in our doubt
The hurt we allowed
We swore to believe them
And scattered across our memories found

You were all that we needed
To believe in our doubt
The worst I'm afraid
The hurt we allowed
We'd find the lines enclosed
Into a great unknown to read all
The words we left out

In all we are
But you were afraid
In all we are
The one thing we can pay
In all we are
But you were afraid
Wishing one day we could be strong

It's over, it's over
It's all coming apart
While you were sleeping, we were stealing your home
It's over, it's over
It's all coming apart
Now I never let this go, I say
It's over, it's over
It's all coming apart
While you were sleeping, we were stealing your home
It's over, it's over
Coming apart
Now I never let this go, I say
It's over, it's over
(Coming apart, coming apart)
While you were sleeping, we were stealing your home
It's over, it's over
(Coming apart, coming apart)
Now I never let this go, I say
It's over, it's over
Coming apart, I know, I know, you know, you know
It's over, it's over
Coming apart (it's over, it's over)
