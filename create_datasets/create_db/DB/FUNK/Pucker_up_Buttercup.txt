Pucker up, Buttercup

I wanna kiss you one time

Pucker up, Buttercup

I wanna kiss you one time
I wanna hug you

Buttercup, I wanna show you how Hey!

Verse 1:

You say you never been kissed before
You always leave 'em standin' at the door
And when they try to kiss you you just say goodbye
You always tell them no and never tell them why

(Pucker up...)

Verse 2:

It won't do you no good to tell me no
Because I've met your kind before
I'll bet you before I'm through
I'll be hearing these same words from you
