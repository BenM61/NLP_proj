After the morning after
After the night before
When all of the fun is over
Would you not want me no more

Oh I, I want you in the worst kind of way
I would be lying to you if I said I didn't want you to stay
I've got somebody and you've got somebody too
What would they think think about us
And what would I think about you

I know you think this is right
But what happens after tonight
Will you be there will you even care
I wannna know this right now

After the morning after, I wanna know, after the night before
What happens when all of the fun is over
Would you not want me no more no more uhh baby uhh baby

I know what you're feeling I've been there before
How will we know what we are doing
And what if we both should want more

I know it looks like it's real
But afterwards how will you feel
Will you feel bad will we both feel sad
I wanna know this right now

After the morning after after the night before
When all of the fun is over
Will you want me anymore
After the morning after after the night before
When all of the fun is over
Will you want me anymore

After the morning after
After the night before
When all of the fun is over
Will you want me anymore

After the morning after
After the morning after
After the morning after
After the morning after
After the morning after
After the morning
Will you want me anymore

After the morning after after the morning
Will you want me anymore
