As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear, 'cause you're here

And now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I felt behind
And I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Lovin' you
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Lovin' you
(Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea)
Lovin' you
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)
Now ain't that lovin' you
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
I be loving you forever
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing (True love don't want a thing)
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last forever, another day

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Lovin' you
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea)
Lovin' you
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)
Now ain't that lovin' you
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Now ain't that lovin' you
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
I be loving you forever
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
I be loving you forever
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
