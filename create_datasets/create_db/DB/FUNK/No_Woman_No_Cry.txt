No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry

'Cause I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
Observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah
Good friends we have now
Good friends we've lost
Along the way

In this great future
You can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry

'Cause I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
When Georgie would make the fire lights
I say, log would be burnin' through the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'd share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
And while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright

No woman no cry

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry

Oh little darlin' don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Oh little darlin' don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Said I re, said I re, said I remember
No woman no cry
You and I and you and I and you and I
No woman no cry
Said I remember when we used to sit there
No woman no cry
In a government yard

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
No woman no cry (you sweet darling)
No woman no cry

No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
