You got yourself a man, and he's good to you
Well sometimes, he just don't know what to do
Well I'm right here, baby, think I'm the best
I don't want it all just a little bit
Honey, won't you let me love you too'

Let me love you too...Let me love you too...
You let us come and run baby let 'em do
'Cause I don't mind eating number two
Honey, won't you let me love you too?

Now you've been good for such a long, long time
Gonna make you feel not even lose your mind
Well all you've got baby it ain't fair
Give it to him if he ain't gonna share
Honey, won't you let me love you too?

Let me love you too...Let me love you too...
You let us come and run baby let 'em do
'Cause I don't mind eating number two
Honey, won't you let me love you too?

On this very night we're gonna see it through
Baby it's all right what we're gonna do
The way you hide and sneak about
There ain't no way he's gonna follow us out
Honey, won?t you let me love you too?

Let me love you too... Let me love you too...
You let us come and run baby let 'em do
'Cause I don't mind eating number two
Honey, won't you let me love you too?
Honey, won't you let me love you too?
Honey, won't you let me love you too?
