Now, once upon a time up on this mic
MCs be really workin' on what they write
With the sound delight, we rock all night
And yes, we're gonna party for the right to fight
We're international like Matt Takei
Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Say what we mean, mean what we say
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll and
What we do now is future molding
Columbine bowling, childhood stolen
We need a bit more gun controlling

Right (right) now (now) what is goin' on?
We (we) gotta (gotta) get it goin' on
Be (be) fore (fore) it's too far gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long

When I get on you scream "Hoo, tight!"
Rockin' this flow I could go all night
I'm not here to fight, or incite
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The US attacking other nations
Anhiliations, on every station
False election's got me losing my patience
Well, I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way, and
I got to say f*ck the KKK, and
Oh, yeah hey, how about today?
If you want to set it off then let me hear you say

Right (right) now (now) what is goin' on?
We (we) gotta (gotta) get it goin' on
Be (be) fore (fore) it's too far gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long

I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down human inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice
So please pass me the Reunite on ice
Well let's go to work and not berserk
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
Try to smooth it out like Levert
Keep the mind alert and not revert

Right (right) now (now) what is goin' on?
We (we) gotta (gotta) get it goin' on
Be (be) fore (fore) it's too far gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long
