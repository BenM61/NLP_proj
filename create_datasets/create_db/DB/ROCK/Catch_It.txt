Reeling in the line
Fully saccharine
All these stagnant words which I confide
Perish in the night
Anyway so
Here we go again
Always faintly preying
Did I note a tremble on your arm
Thereupon alarmed
Just give in

Make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it
Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it

Time moves forward quickly
Moves in twenty-four
Hour segments racing for the soul
To grab chokehold
Of the minute hands
Left without a trace
Just a fleeting face
Flicker as a figment once before my eyes
Perished in the night

You want it, you want it, you want it again
Why don't you come and ask me, I adore you my friend
I said you need it, you need it, you need it again
Trust me, these arbitrary thrills will never fail to transcend

Make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it
Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it

Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it
Come make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it

I said you want it, you want it, you want it again
Why don't you come and touch it, I adore you, my friend
I said you need it, you need it, you need it again
Trust me, these arbitrary thrills, they never fail to transcend
Make me real
You reel in then you catch it
Catch it
Catch it
