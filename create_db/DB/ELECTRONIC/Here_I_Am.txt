Did I hear you crying in your sleep?
Did you feel like you were all alone?
Well, it must have been a real bad dream
You should know I'd never let you go
And as long as, you've got eyes to see
You will always know just where I'll be

Here I am by your side
Just one kiss away
Here I am day and night
And this is where I'll stay
Through the rain or come what may
Baby, here I am

Don't you think that I can tell by now
I know all the words you never say
And I wish, I could explain somehow
You don't ever have to feel that way
You believe one day, you'll find me gone
But when everything is said and done

Here I am by your side
Just one kiss away
Here I am day and night
And this is where I'll stay
Through the rain or come what may

Here I am
(You know I'll always need you)
By your side
(Forever and ever)
Just one kiss away
(I will be here with you)

Here I am
(You'll never have to worry)
Day and night
(I'll be by your side)
And this is where I'll stay
(Forever and ever)
Through the rain, come what may
Baby, here I am
