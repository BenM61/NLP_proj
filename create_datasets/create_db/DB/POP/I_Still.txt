Who are you now? Are you still the same?
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?

And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done

I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see

That I keep coming back
Yeah, I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last
(To last)

I try to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done

I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

I wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Then I will never let you go
(Without you)

Though everything's been said and done
(Yeah)
I still feel you
(I still feel you)
Like I'm right beside you
(Like I'm right beside you)
But still no word from you
(Still no word)
