You, standing there, unaware
I look at you and I understand
That I am such a lucky man

You, slowly turn, slowly smile
And it hits me so hard, once again
I am such a lucky man

Sometimes it's all so clear
There's a reason you are here with me
Life has its ups and downs
But I'll get through
If I can stay with you forever

I look in your eyes and I understand
I am such a lucky man

There's a reason you are here with me
I know I'll get through
If I can stay with you forever

I know I don't tell you enough
But It's the way that I feel

I look at you and I understand
That I am such a lucky man 

Who could have planned
That I would be such a lucky man
