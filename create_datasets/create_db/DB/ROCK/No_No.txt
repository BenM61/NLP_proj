No no
No no
No no
No no
No no

Once we had it all for the takin'
Love was just me and you
You'd better think twice
About the plans that you're makin'
Splittin' one world in two

Put your mind in doubt
Did you think about?
Everythin' that were missin'
Don't you make me see, what is best for me?
'Cause I just won't listen baby

No no no no
I don't need nobody
Anyone to take your place but you
No no no no
I just couldn't fall for anyone new
Nobody but you

Girl you are the life that I am livin'
I just can't go on without you
Let's make it alright
Wake up to what we've been given
Remember the things we've been through
Yeah

Put your mind in doubt
Did you think about
Everythin' that were missin'
Don't you make me see what is best for me
'Cause I just won't listen baby

No no no no
I don't need nobody
Anyone to take your place but you
No no no no
I just couldn't fall for anyone new
Nobody but you

I can't imagine the two of us apart
Can't find a reason
'Cause I still believe
(There's no one like you)
That is why I need

(Nobody but you, yea)
Don't need nobody
To take your place but you
(No no no no no no)
Don't need nobody at all
No no
(No no no no)

(Don't need nobody)
No no no no
I don't need nobody
(Don't need nobody)
Anyone to take your place but you
(I can't love)
No no no no
(Don't need nobody)
I just couldn't fall for anyone new
(No no)
Nobody but you
(No no)

No no no no no no
I don't need nobody
No no no no no, baby
I don't need nobody
No no no no no
I just couldn't fall for anyone new
Nobody but you
