Hey, little boy get your dancin' shoes 
Your gold satin jacket and the silvery blues 
And it'll be alright, dancin' on a Saturday night 

Well, the juke box is playing like a one man band 
It's the only kind of music that we both understand 
It's gonna be alright, dancin' on a Saturday night 

Roller coaster gotta make the most 
And dance, dance, dance the night away 
Helter skelter, maybe I can help and 
Dance, dance, dance the night away 

Blue jean baby, he's the king of them all 
he's the only one who makes me want to rock'n'roll 
Don't have to say good night, dancin' on a Saturday night 

Roller coaster, gotta make the most 
And dance, dance, dance the night away 
Helter skelter, maybe I can help and 
Dance, dance, dance the night away 

blue jean baby, he's the king of them all 
he's the only one who makes me want to rock'n'roll 
I want to hold him tight, dancin' on a Saturday night 

I'm gonna hold him tight, dancin' on a Saturday night
