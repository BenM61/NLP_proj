This is a true story of a slave man 
Who fled his people from the white man 
So I'll say that he showed me the way 
To be brave, brave, don't be afraid 
Zumbi his name, Quilombo his place 
Our root you can never erase 
Zumbi his name, Quilombo his place 
Our root you can never erase 

Thirty thousand Zumbi refugees 
Fight the right, the right to be free 
Rape the city, the masters of greed 
Follow the warrior, the warrior Zumbi 
No more no more no more slavery 
No more no more no more misery 
No more no more no more suffering 

Zumbi Zumbi 
Blow them away 

Here we come, here we come slave drums 
Here we come, here we come Quilombo 
Time for war in tha land of the sun 
I know God will not leave us alone 
I know God will never leave us alone 

Zumbi Zumbi 
Got to be free 

Quilombo Quilombo
