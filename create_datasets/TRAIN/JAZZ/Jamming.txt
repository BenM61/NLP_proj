Baby, I was just a young girl
When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Baby, I was young, I was green
When you showed me the ropes 10 years ago
I thought I was cool, I could break all the rules
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

I was a girl from the streets
Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby
Jammin'

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket, baby
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
And my backbone slipped
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

The square root of a positive groove
Times a happening melody equals a jam
Give some to the back

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket, baby
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket, baby
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice
