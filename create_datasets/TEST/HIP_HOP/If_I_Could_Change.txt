(Featuring Steady Mobb'n) 
Fast livin' got me trapped in this street game 
Before i die i hope i have a chance to make a change 
4x 
I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change 
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang 
feel like I'm trapped in a prison slowly waiting to die 
it's getting harder for my people yet we don't know why 
they cuttin sistas off welfare these kids can't eat 
and it's the children like thuggish minds turned out by the street 
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks 
servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil 
robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me 
blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me 
since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama 
lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did 
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget 
all the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase 
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game 
Steady checkin' myself, God help me to change 
If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave 
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days 
crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these 
days 
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress 
jealous fool of the world trying to put me to rest 
last night i had a talk with my momma 
then the cry, asking god if she'd serve a purpose before she dies 
you can see it in my eyes, a brotha wanta slow down 
I ain't mad at ya daddy cause you didn't come around 
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it 
You see the opportunity, you take it 
but what about my little baby, I got a mouth to feed 
But i still wanta hang on the streets and smoke weed with the O.G.'s 
my homies rest in peace in the game 
I don't think you'll ever know the pain 
I wanta change 
If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave 
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days 
crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these 
days 
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress 
jealous fool of the world trying to put me to rest

Lord know, picute me ballin 
trapped in this ghetto with my young G's callin 
Henacee and weed when they bury P 
a quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me 
fall on my knees to no nigga 
trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigga 
never had a pops, a nigga learned to slang cream 
should have been a chemist, the way i work a triple beam 
life, is like a page, I wanta turn 
I wanta make a change, but Lord you let my brotha burn 
I done seen a nigga lose his life over zurcubian stones 
everynight, my auntie bring a nigga home 
momma worrying cause the rent late 
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate 
I sent him Camel with no filters 
I'm in the ghetto slangin dope with staight killas, ugghh 
I know kids that pack gats cause they bout it, bout it 
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy 
is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep 
cause your best friend turn into your enemy 
crooked cops is dirty in this shaded game 
go on take me out the ghetto 
I wanta make a change 
If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave 
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days
