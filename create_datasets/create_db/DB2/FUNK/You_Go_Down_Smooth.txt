Would it be true to say that I ordered you
Or is it you that ordered me?
I could say you are the only one I see
But I can't stop at two or three

And I am afraid to need you so
And I am too sober not to know
That you may be my problem, not my love
Would I be lying if I said you were too sweet
Though I'm quite sure you've got a bite
I could say that you were just a special treat
Though we both know that's not right

And I am afraid to need you so
And I am too sober not to know
That you may be my problem, not my love
'Cause you go down smooth
Would it be true to say you go to my head
Or is that sentiment too frank
I could say you make it sweet to go to bed
But then it's you that breaks the bank

And I am afraid to need you so
And I am too sober not to know
That you may be my problem, not my love
'Cause you go down smooth
