We were born to sin
We were born to sin
We don't think we're special sir
We know everybody is
We've built too many walls
Yeah, we've built too many walls
And now we gotta run
A giant fist is out to crush us

We run in the dark
We run in the dark
We don't carry dead weight long
We send them along to heaven
I carry my baby
I carry my baby
Her eyes can barely see
Her mouth can barely breathe

I can see she's afraid
She could see the danger
We don't want to die or apologize
For our dirty God, our dirty bodies

Now, I stick to the ground
I stick to the ground
I won't look twice for the dead walls
I don't want a white pillar of salt
I carry my baby
I carry my baby
Her eyes can barely see
Her mouth can barely breathe

I can see she's afraid
That's why we're escaping
So we won't have to die, we won't have to deny
Our dirty God, our dirty bodies
