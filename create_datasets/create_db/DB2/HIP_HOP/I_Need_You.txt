It's been a while since I have had a break from worryin'
Memories of you always creep up into my head
And baby if there was any such a thing as wishin'
I'd wish for you to be right next to me instead

Well, I don't blame you if you don't wanna give it another try
You probably found some other guy to dry your eyes
This situation has got me unattached within
I don't know where my life is goin'
Judgin' all the places that I've been baby

I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you baby?
I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you baby?

I don't want you to think that I've been desperate
I've just been dreamin' about your tender tender kiss
Sometimes I sit and think about how you used to work it
The love you give to me baby you know I miss

Oh, I don't blame if you don't wanna give it another try
You probably found some other guy to dry your eyes
This situation has got me unattached within
I don't know where my life is goin'
Judgin' all the places that I've been baby

I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you baby?
I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you baby?

I need you baby
Oh, I need you baby
Oh yeah

I want you, you want me
You got me goin' crazy
I want you, you want me
You got me goin' crazy

I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you baby?
I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you?

I want you, you want me
You got me goin' crazy
I want you, you want me
You got me goin' crazy

I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you baby?
I need you, you need me
Can't you see I'm goin' crazy for you baby?
