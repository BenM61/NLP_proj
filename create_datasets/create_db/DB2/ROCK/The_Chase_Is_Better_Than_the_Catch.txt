You know I'm bad, the times I've had,
I've got a bad reputation,
I don't care, I get my share,
Don't feel no deprivation,
The more I get the better it is,
I like it fine, like a little whiz,
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact,
You know the chase is better than the catch

Silver tongued devil, demon lech,
You know just what I'm doing,
I like a little innocent bitch,
You know I ain't just screwing,
I love you baby, love you too much,
I like it fine, I feel your touch,
But your appearance don't hold no class,
You know the chase is better than the catch

A little beauty, I love you madly,
Come on home with me,
I know you're hot, I know what you've got,
You know I want to shake your tree,
Come on honey, touch me right there,
Come on honey, don't you get scared,
Come on honey, let me get you in the sack,
You know the chase is better than the catch

All right! let me hear ya!
I can't hear ya!
