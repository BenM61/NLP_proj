If I could make sweet love to you all through the night
All the problems of my world would slowly fade away

How can I be sure that everything you say
Isn't just another line designed to steal my heart away

Just let me hold you now
I wanna feel you in my arms
Let me unfold you now, endlessly
Just let me hold you now
Friend to friend, lover to lover
Hold me now

I feel your touch and it stirs me deep inside
And still I need to know there's more than passion in your eyes

Oh girl, you are much more than something physical, can't you see
You don't have to stay the night, baby tell me what you want from me

Oh, just let me hold you now
I wanna feel you in my arms
Let me unfold you now, endlessly
Just let me hold you now
Friend to friend, lover to lover
Hold me now

If we make love
I need you baby
I wanna lose myself to you
Rise so high above
I don't wanna be alone tonight
Don't leave me now
I just want you to

Hold me now
I wanna feel you in my arms
Let me unfold you now
Baby, hold me forever
Just hold me now
Never let me go
Let me unfold you, endlessly
Just let me hold you
Friend to friend, lover to lover
Hold me
Don't ever let me go, no
Hold me now
