I lied to you
I see it in your eyes
burning questions

I should have talked to you
But I wasn't strong enough
to face you and tell you

I know it's gonna break you
I know it's gonna take you down
But I gotta tell you
It's over girl now

I move out
I walk out on you
Nothing's gonna change, so now
I move out
I run out on you
Cause life is pretty cool without you

Cool without you
Don't want to lie to you
No I can't fool your pretty face, so beautiful
Why should I change my mind, a thousand times
We can't go on
No, we can't go on

I don't want to hurt you
I don't want to break you down
But you've gotta believe me 
It's over girl now

I move out
I walk out on you
Nothing's gonna change, so now
I move out
I run out on you
Cause life is pretty cool without you

Cool without you 
Cool without you 
Cool without you 
Cool without you 
So now 
I move out
I walk out on you
Nothing's gonna change, so now
I move out
I run out on you
Cause life is pretty cool without you

Cool without you
