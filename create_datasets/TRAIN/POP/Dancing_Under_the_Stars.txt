We're dancing under the stars tonight
And you are a vision of loveliness in white;
I see a light of sweet aloha in your eyes of love
Eclipsing the moon the tropical stars above

While dancing under the stars with you
My world is a heaven of make believe come true
And you can make it real; just say you feel the way I do
When we're dancing under the stars tonight
