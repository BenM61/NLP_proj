One two buckle my shoe
Three four step inside the venue and I 
See in the corner of my eye
This beautiful girl 
That's standing by the bar looking fly
She was like a beauty queen out of a magazine
Looked about 19
Five minutes talking next thing
It's her number being written

[Chorus:]
If you're looking for the man that can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say damn
The booty man can
Click off, click on www.CD.com
International bomb
The booty man's really got it going on

One two unbuckle my shoe
Kissing and cuddling 
At my crib after the venue and I
Didn't want to take it too fast so I said slow slow
I gotta make some calls so keep it down low
She was like I can't believe you want to talk instead
Of making love to me
Five minutes chillin', next thing it's my name she's calling

[Chorus]

Bomb bomb the booty man, booty man's really got it goin'
On on the booty man, booty man's really got it going
Bomb bomb the booty man, booty man's really got it going on
On on the booty man, booty man's really got it going on

[Chorus x 3]
