American queen is the American dream
American queen is the American dream

She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tanned hot blonde called Anya
I asked her 'Why would you wanna be a Hollywood wife?'
'Because I don't want to end up living in a dive on Vine'
I'll do anything for a dime
Looking for the golden lie

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain
Oh oh, Living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams
Oh oh, I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

I fight security making plays for me
As soon as I touch down in old LA, he said,

Oh my god, you look just like Shakira
No no, you're Catherine Zeta
Actually, my name's Marina

Your mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign
You're looking for the golden lie

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain
Oh oh, I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams
Oh oh, I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

American dream is the American queen
American queen is the American dream
Is the American dream
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain
Oh oh, I'm living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanna kissing in the rain
Oh oh, I'm living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams
Oh oh, I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
