Oh, baby, yeah 
How come it hurts so babe 
Why does it feel so sad 

To fall in love was something that my heart was dreaming of 
And then there came the day when I found you 
And heaven came to earth and you were my angel 
I fell in love with you 
No one but you 

Suddenly I saw the change that came into your eyes 
I feel you were afraid to tell me why 
I thought the thing called love would be forever 
Thought our love was true 
And now the pain of losing you 

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love 

Tell me how a thing that brings such joy can bring such pain 
And how could something so wrong seem so right 
We never had the chance to make it get better 
We never said goodbye, no 
I never wanna feel the pain of losing love again 
'Cause love just has a way of breaking down 
Next time I'm gonna pray that things will be better 
The second time around 
So here's to love that's lost and found 

I won't cry, no, I won't break down 
Even though inside it hurts so bad 
Next time I will make love last 
Though you will always have a place in my heart 

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love

I won't cry, no, I won't break down 
Even though inside it hurts so bad 
Next time I will make love last 
Though you will always have a place in my heart 

My first love 
No one could ever take your place, no, no 
My first love 
No one could ever take your place, no, no 

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love
