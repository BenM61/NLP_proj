I come back, every year I get newer
I'm the dust on the moon, I'm the trash in the sewer
Let's go, I come back, every year I get brighter
If you thinkin' hip hop is alive, hold up your lighter

Let's go, I come back, every year I'm expandin'
Talkin' to developers about this city we plannin', c'mon
I come back through any endeavor
This is hip hop, we gon? last forever

Hip means to know, it's a form of intelligence
To be hip is to be update and relevant
Hop is a form of movement
You can't just observe a hop, you gotta hop up and do it

Hip and hop is more than music
Hip is the knowledge, hop is the movement
Hip and Hop is intelligent movement
Or relevant movement we sellin? the music

So write this down on your black books and journals
Hip hop culture is eternal
Run and tell all your friends
An ancient civilization has bee born again, it's a fact

I come back, every year I'm the strongest
KRS-One, Marley Marl, yup, we last the longest
Let's go, I come back ?cause I'm not in the physical
I create myself, man, I live in the spiritual

I come back through the cycles of life
If you been here once you gon? be here twice
So I tell you, I come back ?cause you must learn too
Hip hop culture is eternal

Hip hop, her infinite power
Helpin' oppressed people, we are unique and unequaled
Hip hop, holy integrated people
Havin' omnipresent power, the watchman's in the tower of

Hip hop, hydrogen iodine phosphorous
Hydrogen oxygen phosphorous, that's called
Hip hop, the response of cosmic consciousness
To our condition as hip hop

We gotta think about the children we bringin' up
When hip and hop means intelligence springin' up
We singin' what? Sickness, hatred, ignorance and poverty
Or health, love, awareness and health, follow me

I come back, every year I get newer
I'm the dust on the moon, I'm the trash in the sewer, that's right
I come back, every year I get brighter
If you think hip hop is alive hold up your lighter, let's go

I come back, every year I'm expandin'
Talkin' to developers about this city we plannin'
I come back through any endeavor
This hip hop we gon? last forever

We will be here forever
We will still be here forever
Get what I'm sayin' forever
Marley

I come back, every year I get newer
That's that, that's that
I come back, every year I get newer
That's that, that's that
