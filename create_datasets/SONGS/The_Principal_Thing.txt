THE PRINCIPAL THING

Do you have a problem? Do you wanna whine? 
Do you feel the need for a little more time? 
Do you think about a change of scene? 
You should go and ask Peggy 
for the principal thing! 

Do you have no money? Do you wanna know? 
What you wanna do - and where you wanna go to? 
Do you have the foggiest idea what I mean? 

You should go and ask Peggy 
for the principal thing! 

If you don't know what it means, ... you
it's easier than it seems, ... you
if you don't know what it means. 
He's got all the keys... you
you only have to seize... you
and you know what it means, 
do you know what it means? 
Do you know what it means?

He was a showgirl, 
she's been around the world 
and everybody knows. 

Do you feel dizziness? Do you wanna know? 
Where's above and where's below? 
Do you really love it 
when you're in between? 

You should go and ask Peggy,
you should go and ask Peggy,
you should go and ask Peggy
for the principal thing! 

If you don't know what it means, ... you
it's easier than it seems, ... you
if you don't know what it means. 
He's got all the keys... you
you only have to seize... you
you don't know what it means, 
you don't know what it means
if you don't know...

you should go and ask Peggy (go and ask peggy),
you should go and ask Peggy (go and ask peggy),
you should go and ask Peggy,
if you don't know...
