Call me hurricane jane,
Dry season's over, here comes the rain,
Sweeping over your plain, blazing as I go
Call me hurricane jane,
This kind of weather's hard to contain,
Nothing's ever the same, when I start to blow

Far from home, lonely time
Thinking about, you and I
Pictures form in my mind, all of them remain.
Here I go like before, signs that I can't ignore.
Close my eyes, cue the storm
Ready for the change...call me.

[chorus]

Rushing in like a flood
Barren land, turns to mud
Every thought heats the blood,
Temperature will rise.
Ready to pump and it's all good
I love me better than anyone could
You inspire like you should and I cannot deny

[chorus]

Said I rage like a fire, and I flow like the water
Ain't no surprise I was born under aries sign.
This is my body, so I do what I choose
Nothing to hide when I am alone, cause there ain't no rules.

[chorus (x2)]
