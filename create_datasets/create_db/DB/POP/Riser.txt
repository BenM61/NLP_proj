Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You don't have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and bolt the door

I'm strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I won't let that keep us in the ground

I'm a riser
I'm a get up off the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes a-shovin'
Hey I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver, out of the fire
Survivor

If you we ain't got no money I can make it
I ain't afraid of working to the bone
When I don't know what I'm do and I can fake it
I'll pray till Jesus rolls away the stone

And I'm a riser
I'm a get up off the ground, don't run and hider
Pushin' comes a-shovin'
Hey I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver, of the fire, survivor

I'm a trier
I'm a get down low so I can lift you higher
An army couldn't keep down my desire
Yeah

I'm a riser
I'm a get up off the ground, don't run and hider
Hey pushin' comes to shovin'
Baby I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver, of the fire, survivor

I'm a riser
I'm a riser
I'm a riser
