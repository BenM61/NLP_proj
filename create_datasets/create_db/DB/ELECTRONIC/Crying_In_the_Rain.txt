Stop, you breathe you lie 
Loops got ya lost I can't hear ya 
Treason took a try 
Desperate drown in dirty things 
Juvenile Jazz you hide 
Can't loose no love from day I shared 
Faint twinkle in your eyes 
Weary from how you earn your things 
You slip from sliding 
Slowly, slither, sneaky 
Simple for a snake 
Poser in pursuit of passion 
Can't rush my quiver fake a quake 
Betrayer, disarrayer, 
Leave a soft one frying in the pain 
Deceitful, full of that 
Couldn't care less if you're crying in the rain 

Stop that crying, stop that lying 
It's boring me 
I don't want to spend my time with you 
Stop to think that once you brought me to ecstasy 
I want the loving that I really need 

Wooh, oh, hoh 
Stop that crying in the rain now 
No more crying in the rain... 
Who said that crying in the rain 
Could ever wash away a lover's pain 
Wooh, oh, hoh 

Fake, no truth, no real 
Trapped in your toss 
Can't shake aching 
Fictions all you feel 
Make up to hide, make up of self 
Wicked with step ahead of skills 
Menial madness molds your making 
Plot to place for prize 
Weak known wonders for wealth 
You dig the dirt well deep in darkness 
Dare to deal on the down low 
Tripping for treasures, plastic pleasures 
Headline in some kid side show 
A taste of a thrill got to have glitter 
Serpents seem to savor show 
Fool can't afford 
To feign alone you're crying in the rain
