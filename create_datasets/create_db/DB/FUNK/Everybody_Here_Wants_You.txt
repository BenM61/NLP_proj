Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile,
Coffee smell and lilac skin, your flame in me.
Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile,
Coffee smell and lilac skin, your flame in me.
I'm only here for this moment.
I know everybody here wants you.
I know everybody here thinks he needs you.
I'll be waiting right here just to show you

How our love will blow it all away.
Such a thing of wonder in this crowd,
I'm a stranger in this town, you're free with me.
And our eyes locked in downcast love, I sit here proud,
Even now you're undressed in your dreams with me.
I'm only here for this moment.
I know everybody here wants you.
I know everybody here thinks he needs you.
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
How our love will blow it all away.
I know the tears we cried have dried on yesterday
The sea of fools has parted for us
There's nothing in our way, my love
Don't you see, don't you see?
You're just the torch to put the flame
To all our guilt and shame,
And I'll rise like an ember in your name.
You know I, you know I,
I know everybody here wants you.
I know everybody here thinks he needs you.
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
Let me show that love can rise, rise just like
Embers.
Love can taste like the win of the ages, babe.
And  I know they all look so good from a distance,
But I tell you I'm the one.
I know everybody here thinks he needs you,
Thinks he needs you
And I'll be waiting right here just to show you.
