When the sun shines on the mountains
And the night is on the run
It's a new day, it's a new way
And I fly up to the sun

I can feel the morning sunlight
I can smell the new-born hay
I can hear God's voices calling
From my golden sky-light way

Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountain I fly
No one can take my freedom away

Once I had my share of losing
Once they locked me on a chain
Yes, they tried to break my power
Oh, I still can feel the pain

Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountain I fly
No one can take my freedom away
