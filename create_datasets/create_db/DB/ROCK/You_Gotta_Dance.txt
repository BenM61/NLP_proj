We like to throw our bodies around 
We like to feel each other 
We're all slaves when we hear that sound 
Says dance 
Says dance 
Says you gotta dance 
Says dance 
(There ain't no two ways about it )

We're all compelled to rise and thrust 
When we all move together 
We're all hypnotized with savage lust 
Says dance 
Says dance 
Says you gotta dance 
Says dance 

I'm so hot it makes me shiver 
Makes me wet
Makes me slide 
It's some spirit I'm possessed by 
I can't stop 
We just got to dance 
Dance 
Dance 

We gotta blow when he says blow 
And we gotta shake and shimmy 
He got the strings tied to our souls 
Says dance 
Says dance 
Says we gotta dance
Says dance
(And I don't mean tomorrow) 

I'm so hot it makes me shiver 
Makes me wet
Makes me slide 
It's some spirit I'm possessed by 
I can't stop 
We just got to dance 
Dance 
Dance

Dance
Dance 
Dance
