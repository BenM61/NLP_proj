I step from door to door
My mind's misguided
Keep moving on and on forevermore

Was it real what I saw in the mirror?
Was it fear when the end got clearer?

Now as my time's passing by
What am I waiting for?

Who'll grant me wings to fly?
And will I have another try?

'Cause I would not miss my moment again
Yes, I would not miss this moment my friend

No one knows the answer
What could have been
The edge I still fear
The roads they're leading nowhere
There is no end
Oh gods be with me
Carry me along 
In blindness I tried to march on 
Mystified me
Yes, it fooled me

No surrender 
Don't surrender
I hear them calling
I hear them calling
Can hear them scream
Don't be late when aeons pass
Your memories will fade
Even the purest one might fail
Here and deceive
The righteous soul
And then their world will come undone

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once more they return, they will save us all
Now break through

Recall the eclipse
There is none who survive
Defeat, defeat, defeat
There's no more
You've searched for the answer
The answer is creed
They're real no more
You cannot get over

My light shall shine forever
The Nine beyond the wall
They're turning
They're burning
They now understand
I soon will seal all doors
Their stars won't shine here anymore
Their savior won't even try
He can't remember the truth
My words become real
And there's nothing they can do

They may follow a plan they once had
Deeply sad
They have chosen the wrong side and tried to resist
All their visions and music no longer exist
When the morrow will come it shall all be
In between the realms, in between the realms they might move on

That's when all pureness dies in vain
There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return they will save us all
Now break through

Will I 
Yes, will I fail to believe, my friend?
What if it's all done in vain?

Don't be afraid
Will it be me they blame?
See, it's a whole world that I've once condemned
And I shattered it all with a thought as it seems
But it all has been me as the mirror has revealed
Now reveal
Now redeem
I will carry the storm (the savior's coming home)
Yes, I'll carry the grail and I'll wash away the pain

There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return they will save us all
Now break through

I don't look back
There's more in me
My hour shall come
The old gods are calling
Then straight ahead
A door appears
The tyrant must go down
That's when the ancient gods return (they will return)
