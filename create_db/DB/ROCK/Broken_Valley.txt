You came to me with this 
And now I've been robbed  

I bit off my fingertips 
And why'd I even get involved?  

Gave all I had to give 
But that wasn't good enough 
But that wasn't good enough  

Lift yourself off that shelf 
You're not in this alone 
No matter how hard you fall  

Swallowed all your razor blades 
So you could do no harm 
Accepted all the blame 
And tell me, where did we go wrong? 
And tell me, where did we go wrong?   

Lift yourself off that shelf 
You're not in this alone 
No matter how hard  
Did your best and made this mess 
Ignored it all along 
This broken valley's a part of us all  

Lift yourself off that shelf 
You're not in this alone 
No matter how hard  
Did your best and made this mess 
Ignored it all along 
This broken valley's a part 
Lift yourself off that shelf 
You're not in this alone 
No matter how hard  

Gave all I, gave all I had to give 
Gave all I, gave all I had to give 
Gave all I, gave all I had to give
