I've had my share
Of life's ups and downs
But fate's been kind
The downs had been few

I guess you could say
That I've been lucky
And I guess you could say
It's all because of you

If anyone, should ever write, my life story
For whatever reason there might be
You'd be there
Between each line of fame and glory
'Cause your the best thing that ever happened to me
You're the best thing that ever happened to me

Oh there have been times
When times were hard
But always somehow I made it through
'Cause for every moment I've spent hurting you
There was a moment spent
That I spent loving you

If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might be
You'd be there, between each line of fame and glory
'Cause your the best thing that ever happened to me
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
You're the best thing
That ever happened me
You're the best thing
