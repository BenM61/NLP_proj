Well you know your looking fine is like you
Always do, but lately I have seen that's been
A change with you, the smile is not the same
There is a sadness in your eyes is tough you
Cried to every little tear ran try, yeah

And it's still the same old story in the fight
For love is glory there is a winner there's
A looser say goodbye no regrets if your
Looking for a new love just be sure you do
Love so better be a careful chooser there's
A winner there's a looser in the game, yeah

Well is something in the way you laugh to
Easily you may fool everybody but you won't
Fool me why I know every little look that's
In your face and I can see the loneliness that's
Taken place, yeah and it's still the same old story
And the fight for love is glory there's a winner
there's a looser say goodbye no regrets, if your
Looking for a new love just be sure love before
You do so better be a careful chooser there's a
Winner there's a looser in the game

Yes it's still the same old story in a fight there's
Love and glory there's a winner there's a looser
Say goodbye no regrets, if you're looking for a new
Love just be sure before you do love better be a
Careful chooser there's a winner there's a looser
In the game.

Yes it's still the same old story there's a winner there's a loser in the game.
