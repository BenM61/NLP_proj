One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight

Put your glad rags on, join me, Hon
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight
Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight

When the clock strikes two, three and four
If the band slows down we'll yell for more
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight
Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight

When the chimes ring five, six, and seven
We'll be right in seventh heaven
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
we're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight
Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight

When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too
I'll be going' strong and so will you
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
we're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight
Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight

When the clock strikes twelve, we'll cool off then
Start a rocking' 'round the clock again
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight
Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight
