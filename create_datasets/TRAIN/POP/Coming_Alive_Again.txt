In the night we think aloud
We've no inhibitions now
Spirits rising, burning from dreams
We feel the flame of passion

Coming alive again, oh baby
Coming alive again, like a fire
Coming alive again, sweet baby
Coming alive again

All our thoughts communicate
All the love we celebrate
True emotions burning so strong
We feel the flame of passion

Spirits rising, burning from deep
We feel the flame of passion
