Melting asphalt
Running start
Winded tongue ties from a
Heat struck heart

Are you still coursing through my veins
Or is this rain

Whispered message
Ear to ear
Tongued transmissions
Made unclear

Are you still carving out a man?
Is that the plan, is that the plan?

If I could fall out
Of love with you
I need to fall out
Of love with you
Please let me fall out
Of love with you

Ooh it's magic
We somehow imagined
But I don't pretend to
Know what's inside you

If I could fall out
Of love with you
I need to fall out
Of love with you
Please let me fall out
Of love with you
