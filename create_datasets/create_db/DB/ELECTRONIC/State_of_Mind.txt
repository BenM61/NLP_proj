You don't need to hang around
You don't need to talk right now
Can I feel it the same mistake
Can I feel him its gonna break

Somedays, sometimes, this don't feel right
Iiiiiiiiiiioooooooooo

To hard to touch, its getting to much
You know its just a state of mind
Driving you wild get caught up in style
You know its just a state of mind

All I need is to breathe
All I need is to believe
Can I have it now I know
Gotta have it take it slow

Somedays, sometimes, it just goes right
Iiiiiiiiiiioooooooooo

To hard to touch, its getting to much
You know its just a state of mind
Driving you wild get caught up in style
You know its just a state of mind

State of mind
State of mind

To hard to touch, its getting to much
You know its just a state of mind
Driving you wild get caught up in style
You know its just a state of mind

To hard to touch, its getting to much
You know its just a state of mind
Driving you wild get caught up in style
You know its just a state of mind

You know its just a state if mind
