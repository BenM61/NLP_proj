Now I'm gonna tell it like this girlfriend
He don't love u
Never have I seen him kiss or hug u
He don't make effort he don't respect u or accept u 4 u
Tells u what 2 wear and how 2 behave
Comes in ur home and treats u like his slave
Don't need him if he make u sacrifice
Ur freedom get him out ur life
Shout and curse at u in public places
Sleep in ur house on a part time basis
He aint even takin' care of his child he don't make u smile.

I understand u love him and ur down
But that don't mean u got to b his clown

Girl u got 2 put him out
Change them lox and all that
Girl u got 2 put him out
And this time don't take him back
Girl u got 2 put him out
Take the time 2 love urself
Girl u got 2 put him out
U can find real love with someone else

He don't even know how 2 be honest
All he know how 2 do is false promise
Any real man agree he ain't a man after the first
time that he raised his hand
Treat your home like hotel and don't pay his way
Lost count of the times that that dog has strayed
Sleep around creep around bring back disease
what if next time it was HIV
4 baby mummas, 8 kids and no work
U can play strong but I know that it hurt
U make the choices U gotta stop this 'cos
girlfriend the boy worthless

I understand that u all love birds from school
How did u get from being his girl 2 just bein his fool

Girl u got 2 put him out
Change them lox and all that
Girl u got 2 put him out
And this time don't take him back
Girl u got 2 put him out
Take the time 2 love urself
Girl u got 2 put him out
U can find real love with someone else

Girl u got 2 put him out
Change them lox and all that
Girl u got 2 put him out
And this time don't take him back
Girl u got 2 put him out
Take the time 2 love urself
Girl u got 2 put him out
U can find real love with someone else

Ur little girl needs a daddy I agree but the
fool is far from that
Any boy can be a father that ain't reason
enough 2 keep on takin' him back
He never reads with her or takes her out that
shits called neglect u hear
Sure she confused and tired of always seeing
mummas face bruised and drownin' in tears
Look what u showin' her by lettin' him disrespect u
U just growin' her to think that it's something
that all men do
U owe it 2 urself and ur daughter cos she thinks
it's all alright
When she get older follow the footsteps u showed
her how u gonna look her in the eye

Girl u got 2 put him out
Change them lox and all that
Girl u got 2 put him out
And this time don't take him back
Girl u got 2 put him out
Take the time 2 love urself
Girl u got 2 put him out
U can find real love with someone else

Girl u got 2 put him out
Change them lox and all that
Girl u got 2 put him out
And this time don't take him back
Girl u got 2 put him out
Take the time 2 love urself
Girl u got 2 put him out
U can find real love with someone else
