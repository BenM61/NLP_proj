When my work on earth is done,
At the setting of life's sun,
I am going to my home over there.
I will walk the golden stair,
And be free from every care,
I'll be a-happy in my home over there.
In my home over there,
That the Lord did preapare.
There is peace, there is joy everywhere,
I will see His face so fair,
And a golden crown I'll wear.
I'll be a-happy in my home over there.
