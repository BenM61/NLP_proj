Oi P it's your round
Na it's your round
Oi it's your fucking round man I got the last fucking round!
Hey you still owe me five anyway bro! You get the round!
F*ck! It's your round dude.

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

First up, on the dolcet tones,
Of the Craigieburn projects,
Suffa MC came to take you home
I drip lyrics like spits, spit lyrics like drips
In the arms I'll lick ya spirit with my miracle web, web
'Cause what I'm hearing's all shed
On the lyrical tip
Na, I ain't feeling ya kid
We gave ya, something to jock,
But it wasn't no thing, like Bobby,
Gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring (Drinks Party)
And I'm a keep at 'em, crossing my fingers as Eve
Says, keep at 'em, I'm going down on Louise
And I'm a reek havoc
Little man with a big pen
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Titties representing the city I grew up in
We lay the path so you got a way in
It's Hilltop, the three stars at the holiday inn.

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

Next up, when I get loose and they fail
Open the lot, the naked truth and the truth is for sale
So when I leave ya
Ya fucking with my pride I don't see though
Typical MC
My nuts don't match the size of my ego
I seize an opportunity, cause they don't linger
That glass ain't half empty it's half full
That's why I'm a table drinker
Think your on Pressure's level?
Only think type bro, betcha at my shows dressed in several of your wife's clothes
An arrogant fucker
Damage and suckas master fleet, huh,
If I married ya mother ya still wouldn't be half of me
You should run from me
F*ck battaling, ain't nothing sweet,
'Cause I won't beat ya to the punch I'll punch ya to the beat
Don't get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
My foots always in my mouth they just can't stomach defeat
I'm a master these until it's hard to breath
It's Hilltop we the first to come, last to leave.

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager

Man I'm smooth like, Marlon Brando at thirty
At my peak like, Marlon Brando at fifty
And I'm fat like, Marlon Brando at seventy
F*ck it, no one sick can ever better me (no one man)

And half the time half my crew could drink the bar,
And half these cats and half of what they think they are
We independent, a sign on the line
The day me giving you the finger as a sign of the times

Man the rhymes are designed to try this is but why this is
I had rewind to try to find this is man,
I just recline and mind my business,
And I'm thinkin' lines of rhymes of rhyme stitches,
Of the mind of the lines that's time for my... Ay! What the f*ck!

At ten when does the kill
They stab ya neck with the finger until you've bled and my quill
This veteren's ill, thinkin' you can better my skill
Ya need medicine chill, with Pressure vendetta's for real.

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days... I'm the clown prince!

It's your round!
If ya hangin' at the back of the bar
So just bounce!
Like ya bangin' in the back of ya car
We turn it out!
Hilltop we been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager
