I said they call it Stormy Monday
But I said 

I said they call it Stormy Monday
Wednesday's full of sorrow,
I said that Thursday's oh-so, it's oh-so-sad.  
It's oh-so-sad.

I said lord, lord, why don't you have mercy,
You gotta have mercy on me.

I been trying to find my woman,
Won't you bring her home to me?

I said they call it stormy Monday.
