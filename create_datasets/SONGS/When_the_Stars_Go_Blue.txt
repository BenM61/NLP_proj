(Bono) Dancing where the stars go blue
(Andrea) Dancing where the evening fell
(Bono) Dancing in your wooden shoes
(Andrea) In a wedding gown 

(Bono) Dancing out on 7th street
Dancing through the underground
(Andrea) Dancing little marionette
(Both) Are you happy now?

Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely ? I'll follow you...
(Bono) When the stars go blue (bluuuuue)
When the stars go blue (bluuuuue)
(Andrea) When the stars go blue (bluuuuue)
(Bono) When the stars go blue 

Laughing with your pretty mouth
(Andrea) Laughing with your broken eyes
(Bono) Laughing with your lover's tongue
(Both) In a lullaby

Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely ? I'll follow you...
(Bono) When the stars go blue (bluuuuue)
When the stars go blue (bluuuuue)
(Andrea) When the stars go blue (bluuuuue)
(Bono) When the stars go blue 

(Andrea) When the stars go blue (bluuuuue)
(bluuuuue) when the stars go (bluuuuue)

(Bono) When the stars go blue 

(Both) Where do you go (Bono) when you're lonely?
(Andrea) Where do you go when you're blue yeah?
Where do you go when you're lonely ? I'll follow you...
