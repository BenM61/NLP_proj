You walked into my life, when i was down and out
Took away my pain and gave me your smile
And at the time, still lovin someone else
I know why cause baby the reason why I felt the way i felt
And then one day I realize that you were the one for me
I was so blind, but baby now I see
 
[Chorus]
And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Would you spend the rest of your life with me
'Cause I'll never play
Want to let you grow, oh
And I'll never play, no, no, no ,no, no, no, no
I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
'Cause if I would've knew your love was like this
Back then I would've made you mine, oh yeah
If I had to die a thousand times a day
I would do it for you, just to take
The pain that I have given you away
'Cause I love you and I never want to

[Chorus]

I'm sorry (oh yes i am)
I'm sorry (I'm so sorry baby)

[Chorus]

Oh oh
