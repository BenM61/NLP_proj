Here am I with you in a world of blue
And we're dancing to the tango we loved when first we met
While the music plays, we recall the days
When our love was a tune that we couldn't soon forget
As I kiss your cheek, we don't have to speak
The violins, like a choir, express the desire 
We used to know not long ago
So just hold me tight in your arms tonight
