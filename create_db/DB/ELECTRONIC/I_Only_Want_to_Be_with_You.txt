You're the one, you're my choice for life
You, every, every bit of you, I want it all, all of you

I want your love so bad, it makes my nature ache
Oh, let me share with you whatever love it takes
I'll be your fruit, between your sheets, is what you do to me, yeah
I don't make the kind of love that's only for a minute
I'll be inside of you as long as you want me in it

Baby, 'cause I, I only want to be with you

I'm loving you, you're loving me, this could be forever
Make me your fruit, between your sheets
