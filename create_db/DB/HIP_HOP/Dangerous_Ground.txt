Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yea yo 
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo 
All them real live motherfuckin niggaz step up front right now 
Its goin down 
One love to Long Island Hempstead in my heart baby 
Shaolin what? 
Come on  come on  HA! 
Dangerous ground 
Tre pound seven spin around for my bredren the clouds come down 
War and peace  I take it to the street 
Land sharp on my lawn chop the thumbs off a thief 
And curse his first born, is this thing on? 
Send em to the children of the corn we the people 
See, niggaz through the eye of the demon 
My lethal injection, destroyin evil 
Hot Nikkel, private eye one pistol 
Aimin at your brain tissue, do or die 
Said the spider to the fly Could this one be tasty 
Like momma apple pie goodness, Johnny Blaze me 
On the job like Dick Tracy 
Hit the cure for that ill shit like Ben Casey, M.D. 
Symbolic thrill like god he shocked it 
Like a finger in a light socket, too good to be forgotten 
In the rotten apple 
I kick dirt on the sand castle 
Check the flavor all natural 
(Beat your feet) 
Hot Niks son 
(E-mizer) 
Before you get the main course 
(Taste a appetizer) 
Submerged in the word 
Heavy headed verbal 
Smack you, mentally disturb you attack you 
Thirty-six chamb once again comin at you 
Young gun got the body snatch you observe 
Yo eyes work you can only see through the third 
Eyeball baby I'm the norm on the bird 
To shine on mental nourishment, you can dine on 
Track yellin at me get yo arrow god 
Victory is hard 
Regardless to whom or what 
They all get retard its a law 
Runnin through a house and your block party, we wreck-tion 
And Hot rock the body body, St. Bernards 
Couldnt save your enterrage plat lobotamy 
Leave ya mentally scarred, numb and possibly 
Dumb deaf and blind is it 
I keep your spine out the battery pack spark it with mine keep it 
movin 
Now everybody just throw your hands in the......(phone rings) 
What the f*ck? 
Peace - who this? 
[Streetlife] 
Mind detect mind 
A P.L.O. da startin line 
Deep Space Nine 
Designed for knuckleheads who bust guns and throw signs 
Lets converse snatch the tap from your purse 
Body-surf on the verse head first 
Peeped your feet bitch straight beat you know wit the heat 
And you spazzed out spittin out teeth ain't nothin please 
Big boys don't destroy blunt is so pop stare on 
50 men convoy, spends to wear the big toy 
Rumble through the wasteland my hands on the silencer 
40 caliber city slicker Staten Islander 
Synchronize minds combine thoughts that motivate 
don't perpetrate pass the blunt let it circulate 
Street politicians on a suicide mission 
Crime vision finger itchin from a scope-view position 
Dangerous ground 
Tre pound seven spin around for my bredren the cloud comes down 
[Method Man] 
Yo 
Keep ya eyes open 
Love potion number nine poetry in motion 
Knowledge me the seventh sign 
Scold it canivin 
Infiltrate is most of mine 
Play em nonchalantly, calmly expose the nine 
Push and get shoved what the f*ck gods thinkin of 
Comin in the club wit that screw face, actin up 
Is we men or mice, bad moon risin 
We wild for the night 
Kill a skitzofrenic nigga twice 'cause-a 
that's what happened when frontin on this Shaol brotha 
Island of Staten we in here no fear 
Assault wit intent 
To kill your whole regiment its real 
Startin wit yo president, duckin my dart gun 
Tear apart something you don't want it then don't start none 
Blaze one with Jonathon, part man part fly 
Handle my be	-I camouflauge like G.I. 
Fat like Joe, a day in the life 
Your money or your life that's the life 
Everybody can't afford ice in the struggle 
Tryin to eat right another day another hustle hustle hustle 
(Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh) 
Dangerous ground 
Tre pound seven spin around for my bredren the clouds come down 
War and peace, I take it to the street 
Land sharp on my lawn chop the thumbs off a thief 
Motherfuck
