My love
Uhh
Uhh
Uhh
Uhh

I enter the temple of holy Love
And shout your name to God above
I tell myself, "This is no game"
I only hope, you feel the same
They say that, "Love's a two way thing"
And of all the pleasure it may bring
But our love will never be
Until you give yourself to me

How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
(Please tell me)
How can I love you more?
(More)
I give you a love so pure
(Pure)

Losing you would make me feel
Helpless, weak, alone, unreal
Life, I could not contemplate
I need your love, don't make me wait
Don't tell me, "It's not enough"
I try so hard, don't be so tough, I
I never felt this way before
I'm sick, and baby, you're my cure

How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
(Ooh baby)
How can I love you more?
I give you a love so pure

How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
(Ooh baby)
How can I love you more?
I give you a love so pure
So pure

My love
My love
My love
So pure
Holy love

How can I love you more?
(Ooh baby)
How can I love you more?
(More)
How can I love you more?
(Ohh, please tell me)
How can I love you more?
(Yaa)
How can I love you more?
(Ooh baby)
How can I love you more?
(More)
I give you a love so pure
(Pure)
How can I love you more?
(More)
How can I love you more?
(More)
(Please tell me)
How can I love you more?
(More)
I give you a love so pure
