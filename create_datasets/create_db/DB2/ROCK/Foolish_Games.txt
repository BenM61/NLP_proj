You took your coat off, stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.
I watched from my window,
Always felt I was outside, looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well in case you failed to notice,
In case you failed to see,
This is my heart bleeding before you,
This is me down on my knees

And these foolish games are tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning,
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

You'd teach me of honest things,
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone off track with you

Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else,
Somebody who gave a damn,
Somebody more like myself

And these foolish games are tearing me,
Your tearing me, your tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart.

And you took your coat off, stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that
