Well I got a little girl
She's built up from the ground
You know that little girl now she ain't no hand-me-down
I love her
Yes I love that little girl
Well I love that girl of mine cause she ain't no hand-me-down

Well I love her in the mornin'
I love her at night
I like to love my baby all night
I love her
Well I love that little girl
Well I love that girl of mine cause she ain't no hand-me-down

Well I told you my story
I guess this is the end
Hope my baby don't fool with other men
I love her
Yes I love that little girl
Well I love that girl of mine cause she ain't no hand-me-down
