Friends like us never say good bye
There's no reason we should cry
We've got something you and I
This world can't divide
If you miss me just close your eyes
Picture us side by side
Up there like parallel lines
Airplanes across the sky

Here in the heart of me
That's where you'll always be
Deep as the deep blue sea
Close as the air I breathe

Tell me you won't be afraid
Remember all the things we said
You know I'm always here
Just a thought away
When you need to be with me
Just think real hard we'll be together
I'll come reaching out
Across that empty sky to feel you near

Here in the heart of me
That's where you'll always be
Deep as the deep blue sea
Close as the air I breathe

Well the dogs and the people they gather round
As the caravan moves out of town
Moving on with the passengers
To another place
I don't know where love begins
Or how it grows or why it ends
We know when we keep ours
Where it can never change with the wind oh no

Here in the heart of me
That's where you'll always be
Deep as the deep blue sea
Close as the air I breathe

Here in the heart of me
That's where you'll always be
Deep as the deep blue sea
Close as the air I breathe

Here in the heart of me
That's where you'll always be
Deep as the deep blue sea
Close as the air I breathe

Here in the heart of me
That's where you'll always be
Deep as the deep blue sea
Close as the air I breathe
