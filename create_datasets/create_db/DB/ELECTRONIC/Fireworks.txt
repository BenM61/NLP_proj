You keep your cards so close to your chest
You're making me confused

It's hidden deep what you need to address
If you want it to resume

Aching and longing never ending fireworks
Let it be, let it be, let it be oh baby let it hurt

The heat is on for the action to speed up and tension to ease
We could keep talking but only be certain through physical means

Patience is just another word for getting old
Resolution just as impossible as letting go

Is there a hint of a vulnerable you there a drift in your eyes
Could it be that the sharp and the blunt side have shifted this time

I wanted you, you wanted me but he was there
Now let it be, let it be, let it be oh baby let it bare
