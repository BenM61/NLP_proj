It's all about love
You turned my world around and you brightened up my day
When I'm feeling sad and blue all I need in my life is you
I might not be the best, but I'll always try 
We each have to take a chance if we're gonna make it in this life
It's all about love
Day seems like it's going fast and nights seem shorter, too
It doesn't matter how long it lasts, just as long as I'm with you
Sometimes when I'm all alone and I feel like I can't go on
I know deep inside my heart, there's a better place for me
It's all about love
I can't explain how I feel 'cause I never felt like this before
Feels like I'm floating on air. Tell me what's happening to me
