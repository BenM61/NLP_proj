Why so pathetic?
Never thought you, I
Every heavenly light
Such a sinister way
Roll your eyes all day
At all the people kickin
Golden girls, stop and stare
Double decker, so lookin pretty.

Why such a serious miss
Just made my serious list.

Now I demand that you act like you don't know.
Go where you want.
And if it drops to hot,
Better drop it like its hot, so.

Listen up every battle ever had
But if you don't go now, then you might not never.

Listen up every battle ever had
But if you don't come now, then you might not never.

Listen up every battle ever had
But if you don't blaze now, then you might not never.

Listen up every battle ever had
But if you don't go now, then you might not never.

You might call me a medic
And move foreward
So sick of the solar
Hear bombs drop
But God you came to get lost
Oh this fashon
Burnin by fashon

And she told you should shut it
And dare not lazy astetic
And remember this wine stone dangerous
Open wide to it
Shake it like you have to let it drop and let it drown you

Listen up every battle ever had
But if you don't go now, then you might not never.

(?)
Might not dust off your heals
Let it roll let it peel
Quit actin so shy and unsure
So detached and in your cue
Your pullin let it move you
Put your body on automatic

Lose control, let it in
Spin it, ride, you can bend
And guide you 
Under red lights
Well into the night
And if we work it like we wanna
We can swell into the skin tight

Listen up every battle ever had
But if you don't go now, then you might not never.

Go, go.
