Everybody's saying
That I'm not so cool
So I'm going back to charm school
Charm school...

Here in my new neckti
Feeling so refined
Working on my handshake and my smile
And though I'm always late
And I can't stand up straight
I'm sure they'll find me charming in a while

Such a dainty curtsey
Darling little child
Let me hold your hand, keep you from harm
I'm learning everyday
I practice what to say
I'm working in the mirror on my charm

Every little lesson
Every gilded rule
I follow or forget in my own way
Those lovely afternoons
With all those forks and spoons
My charm school made me ready for today
