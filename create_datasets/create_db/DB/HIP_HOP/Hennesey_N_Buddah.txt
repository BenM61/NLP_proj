Adding up what ya brought in from last night
She mad tight with mad bite is that right
Bad lil bitches on my tizeam tizeam

Pussy broke the president yeah it did
And pussy made a pimp rich yeah it did
I live like 'em both as I smoke on my dope
On my boat thumbin' through see notes
Now here's a toast to the coast
Cause we doin' it the most we doin' it the most
Player player high costs
Uno dos I'm bout to get ghost
Stacking what ya macking d o double g
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate 'cause they will never be
There ain't no limit to this melody melody
You niggas sipping on that jealousy jealousy
I pour a tall glass of hennesey want some
Do you want to have a sip with me
Or would you rather try and trip with me trip with me
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
'cause we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine sunshine
On 3 wheels with one 9 ya know
It's time to shine the world is mine the world is mine
I never ever dropped a dime shit
Nigga might cop a dime
Never hesitate to pop a 9 bah
And always come up with the proper line
Stick to the script bitch I'm hurting shit hurting shit
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm working with
What you working with
Don't need no water to go with your order
And you ain't got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable sportable unbelievable feasible and reasonable
We leavin' 'em low
Cause me and my loc keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of hennesey and 16 liters of coke
He done drank and she done smoked
The meters are broke we put the v to the note
I brought the weed to smoke
And Dr. Dre he hooked the beat up indeed it was dope
Stacking what ya macking d o double g
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate 'cause they can never be
There ain't no limit to this melody melody
You niggas sipping on that jealousy jealousy
I pour a tall glass of hennesey hennesey
Do you want to have a sip with me sip with me
Or would you rather try and trip with me trip with me
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cause we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine sunshine
On 3 wheels with one 9 ya know
