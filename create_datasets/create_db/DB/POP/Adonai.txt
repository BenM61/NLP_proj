One single drop of rain
Your salty tear became blue ocean
One tiny grain of sand turning in your hand
A world in motion

You're out beyond the furthest Morning Star
Close enough to hold me in Your arms
Adonai, I lift up my heart and I cry
My Adonai

You are the Maker of each moment
Father of my hope and freedom
Oh, my Adonai
One timid faithful knock

Resounds up the Rock of Ages
One trembling heart and soul
Becomes a servant bold and courageous
You call across the mountains and the seas

I answer from the deepest part of me
From age to age you reign in Majesty
And today You're making miracles in me
