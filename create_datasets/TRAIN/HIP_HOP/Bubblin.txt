Look at you go
Okay you bubblin'
Look at you go
Okay you bubblin'

One in the hand
One in the bag
Bubblin'
Look at the cash
Look at the cash
Comin' in
Come get your man
This lil' nigga buggin' me
Just need a bag
Quit all that jaw-jackery
Don't need to pass me that
I don't want none of it (yeah)
These niggas mad about it
Had enough of it, whoa
Watch what you're sayin'
All that poppin' 'n shakin'
Got me hot as a laser
My posse deep in our rating
We act a fool for the paper
Had a dream and I made it
El Camino on Dayton's
Bitch it's Guess over Bape
Put the bread on me bitch
Bitch you bet I'mma bake it
Think you flatter than bacon
I might just roll out today
I might just roll out to Vegas
Head back to my old ways
Pop the roof from the Asia
Hoes and do blow all day

Look at me baby
Look at me baby
Don't I look like a million
I'm 'bout to clean out the safe

Dont I look like somebody that just be bodyin' everything
All that talkin' is great but now don't be talkin' now air it out
All the problems have gotten easy to bury
I'd rather drown in them in Hendrick's
I'd rather kiss all my mary
I been broker way longer than I been rich so until it levels out
I'mma take your mama to the Marriott and wear it out
Took me so long to get it
Gonna spread it out
Let 'em know all about it when I'm dead and gone

One in the hand
One in the bag
Bubblin' (look at you go)
One in the hand
One in the bag
Bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash
Look at the cash
Bubblin' (okay you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin' (go)

One in the hand (look)
One in the hand (go)
One in the hand
One in the bag
Bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash
Look at the cash
Bubblin' (okay you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin'

I'mma need all the fries you can give me
All the hot sauce, all the pie you can give me
Better be all in that, you don't have me in the middle
You better be all you can, get high in a minute
Superfly for the Dumbos
Plenty slides like a shuffle
Hit the cadence with my young bitch
Isaac Hayes, Billy Ocean
But the ol' hoe with the cane stick
Left my slippers at the function
It's hard to run in Gucci slides
She got that she say you didn't have a husband
I'mma stand no cuckold
Jackie Chan no travel
Can't kill me with a beat
Blood drippin' from the cutthroats
No Lord, not me, I can never be the one you wanna stunt for
Money money that machine
Guns spray the Ferragamo store
R.I.P. the times that I was broke
Actin' like the 9-11 folks
Mad back, lick it clean
Dead prisoners in an envelope
Cookin' up can I, waitin' for the antidote
Runnin' outta town
Patience thinner than a pantyhose

One in the hand
One in the bag
Bubblin' (look at you go)
One in the hand
One in the bag
Bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash
Look at the cash
Bubblin' (okay you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin' (go)

One in the hand (look)
One in the hand (go)
One in the hand
One in the bag
Bubblin' (look at you go)
Look at the cash
Look at the cash
Bubblin' (okay you bubblin')
Look at the cash (look)
Bubblin'
