Baby said you had to be a lover
One way or the other
Nobody wins without once giving in
so don't cry now , don't cry now

Love is just a game you played in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time girls are cruel to be kind
so don't cry now , don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day , makin' love to a paper moon

She said  , boys do fall in love , they make time
They get love on a Saturday night 
And she said , hearts beat as they dance 
in the street to a radio , oh 
Boys fall in love 

Baby knows I like to be excited
No one wants to fight it
It's getting late so I'll just demonstrate
Don't cry now , don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day , makin' love to a paper moon

And she said , boys do fall in love , they make love
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said , hearts beat as they dance
in the street to a radio , oh 

Oh , boys do fall in love ,they make time  (they make time)
They get love on a Saturday night 
And she said , hearts beat as they dance 
in the street to a radio 
Oh, boys fall in love 

Boys, boys , oh , boys , boys , boys , oh 
Boys, boys , boys , oh 
Boys, boys , boys , boys

Boys do fall in love , etc (fade out)
