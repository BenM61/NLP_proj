Then the night is so lonely
And I dream of you only

You are the star in my heavens above
I looked for you and found my true love
I love you, honest I do
And I'm tellin' you

The night is so lonely
And I dream of you only

You are the star in my heavens above
I looked for you and found my true love
I love you, honest that's true
And I'm tellin' you

The night is so lonely
And I dream of you only
