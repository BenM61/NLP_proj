Well listen to me, you young hoods, this is some advice
You do the crime, you're paying the price
Cause if you're in the drug spots, selling crack on the block
Snatching chains, busting brains, like a real hard rock
If you ever hear a cop say you're under arrest
Go out just like a trooper, stick out your chest
Cause you might have been robbing, you might have been whylin'
But you won't be smiling on Riker's Island

Just to hear the name it makes your spine tingle
This is a jungle where the murderers mingle
This ain't a place that's crowded but there's room for you
Whether you're white or you're black, you'll be black and blue
Cause in every cell block, there is a hard rock
With a real nice device that's called a sock lock
Don't ever get caught in a crime my friend
Cause this bus trip is not to Adventure's Inn
They have a nice warm welcome, for new inmates
Razors, and shanks, and sharp edged plates
Posses will devour, punks with power
After the shower it's, rush hour
So watch your back before you get sacked
These a bunch of maniacs that's about to attack
If you're a hustling pro, keep a low profile'n
Cause you won't be smiling on Riker's Island

See-74, adolescents at war
Put your ear to the floor, you can hear the roar
They take you out of BC, they now found you a cage

All eyes are glued to you like you're up on stage
If you're soft as a leaf, don't get into a beef
And God be with you chief if you got gold teeth
Some try to be hard, front and say I'm God
Don't know a lesson say a blessing, you're gonna get scared
(Yo call the C.O.) That won't be necessary
He'll watch him beat you down, and take your commissary-acap
