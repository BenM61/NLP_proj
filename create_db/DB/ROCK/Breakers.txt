Waiting for 
My words to catch like I'm trying 
To strike a match that's soaking wet
See through skull
See through skin
Leave all the lights on
Can't see out, but they see in

Stare down my nose, watching
The color drain from my eyes
Cold cereal and TV
Before I go to sleep

Breathing out, hoping to breathe in 
I know nothing's wrong, but I'm not convinced

No, I know, I know, I've already told, myself
Maybe I'll believe it from somebody else
No, I know, I know, I've already told, myself
Maybe I'll believe it from somebody else

Breathing out
Hoping to breathe in 
I know nothing's wrong, but I'm not convinced 
I can let it happen, just let it happen 
Just don't think so much, don't think so much
