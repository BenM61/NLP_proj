I want a girl that can really blow my mind
I mean an extraordinary one of kind 
A banging body
Like a CL5 double "O" 
But that ain't all oh no

I need a girl that's smart (and really intelligent) 
A girl with heart 
Somebody who don't take no shit 
And if you're out there make yourself known (I mean) 
Because I'm looking for somebody

[Chorus:]
Who will ride with me 
Die with me 
Cry with me 
Live with me 
Who will role with me 
Till the end with me 
That's the kinda girl that I need 
She don't want my money 
She just wants me only 
And I when I need loving 
She quick to put it on me 
Mami's a soldier 
And a roller I mean 
And that's just the girl I need

La dee dee la dee dee dee da de day 
If you?re out there girl I'm on my way
La dee dee la dee dee dee da dee day 
I'ma find you one of these days 

I want a girl that can hook up a shoe (I mean) 
A Gucci sandal or them Jimmy choo's (I mean)
She could find a pair of timbs 
Or some air force ones and still look the bomb

I need a girl that smart (and really intelligent) 
A girl with heart somebody who don't take no shit 
And if your out there make yourself known (I mean) 
Because I'm looking for somebody

[Chorus:]

La dee dee la dee dee dee da dee day 
If your out then girl I'm on my way 
La dee dee da dee dee dee da dee day 
I'ma find you one of these days

(I said I got) I got the material things 
But that don't matter 
I trade it all if I can have her
Perfect girl in my life that will make it right 

I need a girl with finess look good in a dress to kiss and caress 
I need a woman with less drama stress no fethumaness 
I need a female who would know what to do when the cops come through 
Who if things get dim she'll put on her timbs and role with the crew 
I need a girl who smart who thinks with her heart when things falling apart 
I need a girl if I need a point or part a she'll donate a quart
I need a lady who will trust me when I'm out at night one 
Who when it's my darkest hour
She's my ray of light 

She don't want my money 
She just wants me only 
And I when I need loving 
She quick to put it on me 
Mami's a soldier and a roller and that?s just that girl I need

La dee dee la dee dee dee da dee day 
If you're out there girl I'm on my way
