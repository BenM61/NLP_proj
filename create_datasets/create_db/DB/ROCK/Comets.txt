By the meeting of the roads
I just fell to my knees
When I knew I had to make a choice
It's a shame you said
That I may never know
How far I can sometimes go
How far I can sometimes go

While my boat is drifting away
By the shore of Miami Bay
I'm still trying to figure out the end of what I was
Starting to say

And you found all the footprints
That I left In the lawn
When I spied on you every night
And I wish there was a secret that you said in your sleep
Just a word that I could keep
Just a word that I could keep

And I wish I was a comet to crash on your feet
Just to be remembered
And I wish I was a comet to crash on your feet
Just to be remembered
