Seems like being true to the man you marry
Ain't enough anymore
You got to learn to do something special
To keep him from walking out the door
And staying home being a lady
It no longer makes him respect yah
You got to learn the tricks of the street
Or else he's gonna neglect yah

You got to start acting like a ball of fire
Instead of a block of ice, in other words
Ya gotta love him like you're his outside woman
If you want him to treat you like a wife

And being a do right woman all the time
No longer makes the grade
No longer makes him come straight home
Whenever he gets paid
And staying at home seven days a week
Will make him too sure of himself
And then he'll think he doesn't have to worry
So he'll go and find somebody else

So you got to start acting like a ball of fire
Instead of a block of ice, listen
Ya gotta love him like you're his outside woman
If you want him to treat you like a wife

If you're smart you'll take my advice
Believe me I know
For my man I was the perfect lady
And now I don't have him anymore

You got to love him
You got to love him
Like you're his outside woman
If you wanna be treated like a wife
You got to love him, love him
You got to love him
Like you're his outside woman, yeah
If you wanna be treated like a wife
