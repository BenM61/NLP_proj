You are my only escape
You are the reason that I wait
On the corner of this empty street
Oh I just can't wait to meet
There's so much a man can do
And there's so much a man can say
See I have done so many things wrong
That you should've thrown me away

I've got this second chance
I'm gonna take it
I've got this song and dance
I'm gonna take it
I've got all that I need
And I can taste it
I've got you next to me
And I don't want to waste it

You are my only embrace
You are the light that lights my face
And any fool would do the same
To follow in your trace
See people come and people go
And I know I should've been replaced

I've got this second chance
I'm gonna take it
I've got this song and dance
I'm gonna take it
I've got all that I need
And I can taste it
I've got you next to me
And I don't want to waste it

I'm gonna take it
All that I can get
I'm gonna take it

It's beautiful the way you love
The way you take me back
Here she comes around the bend
She's coming to take me back

I've got this second chance
I'm gonna take it
I've got this song and dance
I'm gonna take it
I've got all that I need
And I can taste it
I've got you next to me
And I don't want to waste it

You are my only escape
You are the reason that I wait
