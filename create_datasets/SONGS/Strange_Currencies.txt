I don't know why you're mean to me
When I call on the telephone
And I don't know what you mean to me
But I want to turn you on
Turn you up, figure you out
I want to take you on

These words, you will be mine
These words, you will be mine, all the time
 
Now fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
I'm going to make whatever it takes
Ring you up, call you down, sign your name
Secret love, make it rhyme
Take you in and make you mine

These words, you will be mine
These words, you will be mine, all the time

I tripped and fell, did I fall
What I want to feel
I want to feel it now

Y'know with love comes strange currencies 
And here is my appeal
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance
A fourth chance, a word, a signal
A nod, a little breath
Just to fool myself, to catch myself
And make it real, real

These words, you will be mine
These words, you will be mine, all the time

These words, you will be mine
These words haunt me, hunt me down, catch in my throat
Make me pray, to say love's confines, oh
