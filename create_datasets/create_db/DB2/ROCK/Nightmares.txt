I was afraid of coming undone
Being a burden, being a son
I was afraid of the look in my eye
The tears on your face in the desolate night

'Cause when you're afraid of everything
Everything is a start for nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares, nightmares
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I die tomorrow, would you be upset?
Or would be the one coming to get me?
Fallin' by the wind side of the never changing
So tell me it's alright

If you can reason, if you can stay
To put all the faith in the palm of my hand
I will protect you, I will defend
It never gets you ever again

'Cause when you're afraid of everything
Everything is a start for nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares, nightmares
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I die tomorrow, would you be upset?
Or would be the one coming to get me?
Fallin' by the wind side of the never changing
So tell me it's alright

Maybe I'm just dreaming
Maybe I was wrong
Maybe I was right
'Cause I can't imagine distances in our faiths
Is there any?

Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Oh oh oh oh
