Pull me 'round
And tell me that you never let me drown.
Touch me slow
Like your fingertips might never let me go.

But you know
That I'm caught between the magic
That you gave to me
And the fear that you might leave
Because it scares me

Stop this war
I wish we could leave thing at the door.
These feelings don't wash away.
I wish there was more to me,
More to say, more to say.

But you know
That I'm caught between the magic 
That you gave to me
And the fear that you might leave

Because it scares me
That you could break my heart again so easily.
Don't let us fall apart
Because it scares me
That you could break my heart again so easily.
Don't let us fall apart.

Run me through,
Then pick me up
And tell me that to do.
Cut me, then run away,
I wish there was more to this,
Flesh to kiss, flesh to kiss.

But you know
That I'm caught between the magic 
That you gave to me
And the fear that you might leave

Because it scares me
That you could break my heart again so easily.
Don't let us fall apart
Because it scares me
That you could break my heart again so easily.
Don't let us fall apart.
