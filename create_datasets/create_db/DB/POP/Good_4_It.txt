I might have actually died
You gotta bring me to life
I need you really really
Right now, right now
Where I'm at, I don't know
Phone is dead, zombie phone
I need you really really
Right now, right now
Like really really really
Right now, right now

How to stay alive though
How the f*ck should I know?
Without some help sometimes
Need my friends sometimes
To bail me out sometimes
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it

I don't know how to explain
I got in over my brain
I need you really really
Right now, right now
Super low, ocean floor
Starring in a shit show
I need you really really
Big time, big time
Like really really fucking
Big time, big time

How to stay alive though
How the f*ck should I know?
Without some help sometimes
Need my friends sometimes
To bail me out sometimes
You know I'm good for it

Without some help sometimes
Need my friends sometimes
To bail me out sometimes
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it

Do you remember that one time?
Well this is way worse
Than that one time
Well you needed me then
Like I'm needing you know
Get your ass over here
And help me out

How to stay alive though
How the f*ck should I know?
Without some help sometimes
Need my friends sometimes
To bail me out sometimes
You know I'm good for it

Without some help sometimes
Need my friends sometimes
To bail me out sometimes
You know I'm good for it
(I need you really really
Right now, right now)
You know I'm good for it
(Like really really really
Right now, right now)
You know I'm good for it
(I need you really really
Right now, right now)
You know I'm good for it
(Like really really really
Right now, right now)
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it
