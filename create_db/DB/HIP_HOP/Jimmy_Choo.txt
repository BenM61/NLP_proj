[verse 2]
This is Me!
I'm mostly respected
Ring down to the necklace
Some hos say i'm sexist
'cause all i want to do is stuff coke in they breastes
Sit back, lift stakes, count money
In the zone, roll tha doe
Like this, come on
I need a prada chick
To take this dick, and take this script
And flick this shit, base this shit
We can go shopping and buy some things
Up in harry winston ma, try some rings
How you feel like you is prince di
So much cuts on your wrist
They could draw suiside
No lie, you ain't heard?
Extensive trips, expensive rips
You ain't seen nothing like this
Not in your life
If i ain't that nigga, shit you fuckin right

[Ashanti]

Do them things we do
And can't nobody
Touch me like you do

Love me like you do
And can't nobody
Be like me and you

Just post bail, a million in cash

Niggas talkin real greesy on them rap records

Give it to my soldiers like "hold this"
F*ck you nigga you could never fool this
But anyway back to business

That like girls that like furrs
Ok
