Go fetch another white girl
To play with in the sand
The one I have right now is broke
The one I really want has planned
To get religion, to find another way
She's at the temple, all I have to say

I have to face it, I'm home alone
I feel quite naked, oh, so forlorn
I am united in disarray
I've no intentions, I know to pray

Send me a dreamboat
That I can sail away
Adrift in warm devotion, no memory
I feel no pain
To live for new beginnings
To ride the win to win the day
Out on the ocean, decide I've got to stay

I can't get started, I'm at an end
She's got religion, I've lost a friend
I talk in circles, I make no sense
I get so nervous, no recompense

I have to face it, I'm home alone
I feel quite naked, oh, so forlorn
I am united in disarray
I've no intentions, I know to pray

Bring me the brightest star
That I can wish upon
And close my eyes so very tight
Pretend that you're not gone
So deep is my distraction
Maybe I'll disappear

I can't get started, I'm at an end
She's got religion, I've lost a friend
I talk in circles, I make no sense
I get so nervous, no recompense

I have to face it, I'm home alone
I feel quite naked, oh, so forlorn
I am united in disarray
I've no intentions, I know to pray

I can't get started, I'm at an end
She's got religion, I've lost a friend
I talk in circles, I make no sense
I get so nervous, no recompense

Go fetch another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl 
Another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl
