You, you can walk out the door
Thinking you won the war
But I'm not keeping score
Me, I am used to the game
Win or lose it's the same
Someone lost, what a shame

Stop thinking you are number one
You threw the dice and never won
You never had a chance with me, and that's not hard to see
Each time you played a trick on me
I gave in to you happily
Knowing I had the upper hand, so understand

This is my life, what can I do
I can do very well without you
Without your sneer, without your smile
Without your arms and your awful idea

This is my life, what can I do
I can do it alright without you
This is my life and mine alone
And if you leave, I can live on my own
This is my life, what can I do

This is my life, what can I do
I can do it alright, without you
This is my life and mine alone
And if you leave, I can live on my own

You, think you made a clean break
Left me for your own sake
So you won't feel it again
Me, I can watch you depart
With no piece of my heart
With no pain, just a smile

I'd love to say I told you so
But what's the use, you'll never know
How many times I tried in vain to keep away the pain
Start thinking you are in my past
The two of us could never last
This love of ours was not planned, so understand

This is my life, what can I do
I can do very well without you
Without your smiles, without your sneer
Without your arms and your awful idea
This is my life, what can I do

(This is my life, my life, what can I, can I do)

(This is my life, my life, what can I, can I do)

(This is my life, my life, what can I, can I do)

(This is my life, my life, what can I, can I do)
