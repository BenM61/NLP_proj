My hands are clean
My heart is so pure
The world is sick
I am the cure
I don't want no money, gold or gifts
Give me your minds and souls to lift
Put you faith and trust in me
I'll move your mountains
Part your sea
All you poor all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
All you poor all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
Get off your knees, believe in me
I'll set you free

All I need's a little more power (must have it)
Power, power, power, power, power, power

I have for you a master plan
To lead you to the promised land
I give you peace, I give you pride
I save you from mass suicide
I'm your hope, your one salvation
I'm your one man United Nation
All you poor all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
All you poor all you needy
All you're doin' is givin' to the greedy
Tell me your sins, I'll be your friend
I won't do you in

All I need's a little more power
Power, power, power, power, power 
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power

I'll make you all the master race
Just put me in my godly place
We'll march the world down in defeat
Take the fields of oil and the lands of wheat
Power, more, power I want it
Power, more, power
One thing I must make perfectly clear
Nuclear weapons, all men fear
Their hands sweat, their fingers itch
I'm the only one you can trust with the switch
Give it to me, power

Give it to me, more
Give it to me, more
I need it, got to have it, I must have it
More, give it to me
More, give it to me
More
