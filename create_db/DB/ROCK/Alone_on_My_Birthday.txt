No decoration on, no cake
Nobody remembered this important date
Guitar, pen, brain start to contemplate
They're the only 3 here
For this joyous celebration
Because I'm self-absorbed, I get upset
Mad at the world, how could they forget ?
I was alone at birth, I'll be alone at death
Hope I won't be alone at my final destination
Never really thought it would've happened to me
But that night I say by the telephone
Never really thought it would've happened to me
I spent my birthday all alone
Birth's a costume with a genetic script
We play some role that we'd like to fit
And never admit that we're full of it
And live life in some sort of dazed hallucination
I'll never lament because life is brief
Our bodies are changing like the autumn leaf
It's said that time is the greatest thief
And beats and cheats this entire population
But it's alright, home tonight, just suits me fine
I don't mind spending time with my mind all alone
