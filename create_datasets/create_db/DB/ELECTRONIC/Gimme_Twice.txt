I got it all worked out let settle now
But then you poke around for a better plan
Its not an easy street give it, give it all tonight
I'm such a mess right now, such a mess right now
You better show me how I'm not the simple kind
Its not an easy street give it give it all alright
You go OH, s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you
Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice alright
I said to live this life, said to live this life
It takes a hell lot time making peace at night
Its not an easy street I shouldn't even bother now
I want less in life simply stroke some town
You better sip through all your fancy wine
And come alive once more
Oh but this time I decide
You go Oh s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you

Gimme once gimme twice tonight

Ill just go down baby stay high

Its time to go but I love you so GET OUT!
Oh s-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one for you
S-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one for you
Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice tonight.
