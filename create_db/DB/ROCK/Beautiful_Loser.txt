He wants to dream like a young man
With the wisdom of an old man
He wants his home and security
He wants to live like a sailor at sea
Beautiful loser, where you gonna fall?
You realize you just can't have it all

He's your oldest and your best friend
If you need him, he'll be there again
He's always willing to be second best
A perfect lodger, a perfect guest
Beautiful loser, read it on the wall
And realize, you just can't have it all
You can't have it all, you can't have it all
Oh, oh, can't have it all

He'll never make any enemies
He won't complain if he's caught in a freeze
He'll always ask, he'll always say please

Beautiful loser, never take it all
'Cause it's easier, faster when you fall
You just don't need it all
Oh, oh, you just don't need it all
