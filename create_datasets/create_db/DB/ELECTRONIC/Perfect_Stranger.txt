I didn't have to turn a around
I can feel him in back of my brain 
When I step into the crowd
Something told me that I'd meet you today
Your energy when you touch me 
Lifted me over ground
Your words to me are like music

I don't know (I don't know) 
Who you are (who you are)
All I really know is there's something your heart
That makes me feel (me feel)
It's a new start (it's a new start)
All I really know is there's something your heart

Are you from another world
I never seen someone who looks like you
Beautiful stranger how do you do?
Tell me is there something I can do for you
Your energy when you touch me
Lifted me off the ground
Your words to me are like music

I don't know (don't know) 
Who you are (who you are)
All I really know is there's something your heart
That makes me feel (makes me feel)
It's a new start (it's a new start)
All I really know is there's something your heart

Something, something, something 
Something, something, something
Something, something, something
Oh there's something, there's something I can see it there 

Something, something, something 
Something, something, something
Something, something, something
Oh there's something, there's something I can see it there 

Something, something, something
Something in your heart

I don't know (I don't know) 
Who you are (who you are)
All I really know is, there's something your heart
That makes me feel (makes me feel)
It's a new start (it's a new start)
All I really know is there's something your heart

I don't know (I don't know) 
Who you are (who you are)
All I really know is, there's something your heart
That makes me feel (makes me feel)
It's a new start (it's a new start)
All I really know is there's something your heart

Something, something, something
Oh there's something, there's something I can see it there
Something, something, something
Something, something, something
Something, something, something
Oh there's something, there's something I can see it there
Something, something, something
Something in your heart
Something, something, something
Something in your heart
