I don't want no bald woman
It makes me mean, yes Lord, it makes me mean
I don't want no bald woman
It makes me mean, it makes me mean

I don't want no sugar in my coffee
It makes me mean, yes Lord, it makes me mean
I don't want no sugar in my coffee
It makes me mean, it makes me mean

I'll be standing around a bald headed mountain
Done my time, yes Lord, done my time
I'll be standing around a bald headed mountain
I done my time, done my time
Done all of my time, done my time
Done all of my time, done my time

I don't want no sugar in my coffee
It makes me mean, yes Lord, it makes me mean
I don't want no sugar in my coffee
It makes me mean, yes Lord it makes me mean

I don't want no bald woman
It makes me mean, yes Lord, it makes me mean
I don't want no bald woman
It makes me mean, it makes me mean
It makes me mean, it makes me mean
