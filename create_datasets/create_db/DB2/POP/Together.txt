We're in the same car driving to the same show
You hear me playing our song on the radio
Take a moment now looking at my time
Think I wanna spend it all with you

And I say hey you know I
I'm gonna fly
And I wanna have you by my side

Whatever I do I do with you
Whatever I say we're better as two
For better off or worse
When it's good or when it hurts
You know it's always me and you
Together
You and me
You and me
Together
You and me
You and me
Together

We're in the left lane never going back again
You make me laugh and you're driving me insane
It's like you know me better than I do
And you know I'll be there for you

And I say hey you know I
I'm gonna fly
And I wanna have you by my side

Whatever I do I do with you
Whatever I say we're better as two
For better off or worse
When it's good or when it hurts
You know it's always me and you
Together
You and me
You and me
Together
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
Together
You and me

Whatever I do I do with you
Whatever I say we're better as two
It's only me and you
Together
You and me
You and me
For better off or worse
When it's good or when it hurts
You know it's always me and you
Together
You and me
You and me
Together
You and me
Together
