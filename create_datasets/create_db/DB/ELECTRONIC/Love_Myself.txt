Yo, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Catchin' all the feelings, ah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump

Huh, huh, huh
Hold up, easy on the syrup
We've been goin' a while
Is it time to cut the butter on a couple items?
'Cause I know you gonna slip on me a couple of times
Spark
Will you burn for another lover?
I don't wanna waste time, but my flame's high
Don't wanna put the lifesaver down, 'til it's safe to drown
Everything you're sayin' got me out here lookin' for a meanin'
And I know it might be early, but I'm catchin' all the feelings
I forget that we are only human beings
You've been givin' me extraterrestrial readings (greetings)

I love you, I mean it if you do
Tell me we're sippin' the same brew
Hooked on the Kool-Aid, I'm thirsty for good news

I, I, I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump
I, I, I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump

What, what, what the f*ck? I want you to show up
Would you throw me a bone?
I've been out here makin' lemonade with all your lemons
You would think by now I'd have learned a hundred lessons (1, 2, 3)
But I'm stupid with it
Cut, feel the burn of another scene (Ow)
I don't wanna get mean on my sixteens
But you don't ever wanna listen to me
Won't you play
You've been givin' me extraterrestrial readings

I love you, I mean it if you do
Tell me we're sippin' the same brew
Hooked on the Kool-Aid, I'm thirsty for good news

More than I love, more than I love, more than I love myself
More than I love, more than I love, more than I love myself
(More than I love, more than I love)
More than I love, more than I love, more than I love my-
(More than I love, more than I love)

I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
