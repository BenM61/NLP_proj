There's been so much eye for an eye
Now I can't tell which cheek to turn
Look how we double deal
Just to keep the pack at bay
Ah now I'm asking the whys & when's
He's coming back for a second term
And I'm all fingers and thumbs
Through trying to have my say
What d'you say?

Come again, come again
Oh help me through the night
Come again, oh jesus christ

I found a book in a hotel
Just as I had nothing left to read
And nowhere left to turn
Feltlike I had been drawn
How the wind rocked the trees
Waves were picking up across the bay
And yes the earth moved for me
In a different kind of way
What d'you say? 

Come again, come again
Oh help me through the night
Come again, come again
Second time will be twice as nice
Come again 

A white light at the end of the tunnel
(boop-boop)
Come again, come again
Oh jesus christ

Come again, come again
Oh help me through the night
Come again
Oh jesus christ

Look there's been so much eye for an eye
I don't know which way to turn
Look how we double deal
Just to keep the pack at bay
Ah now I'm asking the whys & when's
I don't know which way to turn
Could end up talking in tongues
Through always trying to have your say

Come again come again come again
Oh help me, oh help me
Come again come again
Second time will be twice as nice
Come again
A white light at the end of the tunnel
Boop-boop
Come again come again
Oh jesus christ

Come again come again come again 
Come again come again come again
Come again come again
