These executives have plooked the f*ck out of me
And there's still a long time to go before I've
Paid my debt to society
And all I ever really wanted to do was
Play the guitar 'n bend the string like
Reent-toont-teent-toont-teent-toont-teenooneenoonee

I've got it
I'll be sullen and withdrawn
I'll dwindle off into the twilight realm
Of my own secret thoughts
I'll lay on my back here 'til dawn
In a semi-catatonic state
And dream of guitar notes
That would irritate
An executive kinda guy...

Well, I guess that one did the trick
If they only coulda heard it
Half-a-dozen of 'em woulda strangled
While they was suckin' on each other's dick

But that was only a bunch of imaginary
Notes I played
Just a little extra somethin'
To keep me goin' from day to day

That's okay
I'll be gettin' outta here pretty soon
Then I won't have to live
In this ugly fuckin' room

Can't wait to see
I can't wait to see what it's like
On the outside now...
Can't wait to see

I can't wait to see what it's like
On the outside now...
Can't wait to see
I can't wait to see what it's like

On the outside now . . .
Can't wait to see
I can't wait to see what it's like
On the outside now...

Can't wait to see
I can't wait to see what it's like
On the outside now...
Can't wait to see

I can't wait to see what it's like
On the outside now...
Can't wait to see
I can't wait to see what it's like

On the outside now...
Can't wait to see
I can't wait to see what it's like
On the outside now...

Can't wait to see
I can't wait to see what it's like
On the outside now...
Outside now...
