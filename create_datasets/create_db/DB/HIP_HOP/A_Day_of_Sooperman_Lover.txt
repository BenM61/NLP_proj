Look! Up in the sky! 
It's a bird... 
It's a plane!
Hee hee hee hee, naw! It's Sooperman Lover, baby! 

Daddy, Daddy! 
Would you please read us a story? 
Alright, get over here and sit yo big ass down  
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover... 

A yo, I was out to lunch and shit 
Puffin' on a blunt to get my head ready
Boogie'n to my Walkman 
With an "S" on my chest 
(Bust a move!) 
Yes I'm a super hero, don't forget 
I smoke mad niggas 
So to hell with cigarettes 
But anyway, 
Let's get back to this skit 
You know who the f*ck I am 
So git off that ol' bull-shucks 
Lunchtime was up, (F*ck!!) 
Let me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks 
On the way back, black, 
I spotted this object, a stray cat 
Stuck in a tree 
With a tag that says that: 
"If found, 
Please return to this address" 
(How did you see it)? 
Nigga! With my X-Ray eye set! 
Like "Pchooooww!" 
I jetted to the closest phone booth 
Quick fast, 
I dipped into my Sooperlover suit... 

(I can leap, 
Tall buildings 
In a single bound...) 

Boom!! 
Right through the fuckin' phone-booth ceiling! 
(It's a plane!) 
Naw, Sooperman Lover's the name 
I can slam King Kong 
And pick up freight trains 
On a mission, 
To save this cat that was wishin' 
He was in his litter 
Watchin' Fritz on channel 6
Relaxin' 
Feet cocked-up just a little 
With a cold cocktail 
And a bowl, of tender vittles 
I snatched, him 
Took off through the air like a pigeon 
Quick so he won't start 
Meowin' and bitchin' 
The letter in cat's tag address
Said the projects 
(Elevator's broke!) 
So I had to take the back steps 
(Knock, Knock) 
The door opened 
Then my eyes swole 
From this bad ass dame (Damn!) 
Sippin' a quart of "Old Gold" 
"Yo, is this your cat?" 
"Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?" 
"He was stuck in a tree, 
Around Uptown Manhattan" 
"Well how the hell did you save him? 
Are you Police Undercover?" 
"Naw baby, 
The "S" on my chest stands for:" 

[Chorus:] 
Sooperman Lover (Yeah!) 
Baby call him the Sooperman Lover 
Something wrong... 
Something wrong, indeed 
Something wrong. Yes, yes indeed... 

She was grateful 
Lookin' for ways to repay me 
No money, 
A donut, and some...um coffee maybe? 
Of course 
What kind of sauce did I take? 
Make my donut jelly 
And my coffee Sanka 
We sat, 
Unhooked the cape from the back 
She felt my arms 
'Cause my pythons looked stacked 
"Goddamn, Sooperlover! 
Your shit looks thick 
Tell me, how strong are you 
With muscles like this? (You bad motherfucker!)" 

(I'm stronger than a locomotive) 

I'll keep hittin ya like Rocky 
She ran to the room 
And came back with a 
Negligee, high-heeled shoes, 
Wit' a blunt in her mouth 
Ready to roll up, 
Hey hold up, she had the dollar folded up 
To mix the coke with the smoke 
Yo, she was no joke 
She took a sniff, 
Some got on her top lip 
That bitch stuck out her tongue 
And gave her top lip a lick 
And said "Here baby, hit it." 
"Naw baby, I ain't wit' it 
You'd need more than a body 
To make me want to hit that shit!" 
But I'll hit the blunt 
So she took out her fronts 
Cracked the Philly 
Opened the bag and laid out the skunk 
Then I took a long pull 
It was hype outta sight 
We ran into the bedroom 
So I cracked my pants for head room 
Later, tossed the covers 
And oh, brother! I was wit' it 
Ready to hit it 
Asked my dick, "Yo, wassup G?" 
"Yo man, shit's thick" 
Licked her down her belly 
And kissed her on her back 
Stuck my hands between the legs 
And I felt the ball sack 
As big as mine (Yo!) 
This bitch must be craze, 
So I threw my suit on 
And I was Swayze... 
'Cause I'm the: 

[Chorus]
