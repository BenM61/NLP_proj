I know it's nothing more than flutes
But something in my heart is loose
There's never been a better day

And if there is nothing more
Then nothing more will add us say
There's never been a better day

Work that inside outside
Work that more
Work that right side left side
More that more
Inside outside left side work the floor
Inside outside up top down with more
Work that inside outside
Work that more
Work that right side left side more that more
Inside outside left side work the floor
Inside outside up top down with more

I put up on a string today
Deciding never taught me a thing
A wooden box breathes the way

Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again

All this talk is getting me down
Nothing's making sense in my brain
I'm moving words in coarse of today
Trying hard to fix through the pain
I'm waiting to the thought that we came
Only to discover I'm aged
And blow a quart of love in your frame
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down

(work that inside outside)
All this talk is getting me down  (work that more)
Nothing's making sense in my brain  (work that right side left side)
I'm moving words in coarse of today (more that more)
Trying hard to fix through the pain (inside outside left side work the floor)
I'm waiting to the thought that we came (inside outside up top down with more)
Only to discover I'm aged  (work that inside outside)
And blow a quart of love in your frame (work that more)
And watch things drop down (work that right side left side more that more)
And watch things drop down (inside outside left side work the floor)
And watch things drop down  (inside outside up top down with more)
And watch things drop down

One day you might realize
That you might need to open your eyes
One day you might realize
That you might need to open your eyes

Work that inside outside (Open your eyes)
Work that more
Work that right side left side
More that more (Open your eyes)
Inside outside left side work the floor
Inside outside up top down with more (Open your eyes)
Work that inside outside
Work that more
Work that right side left side more that more (Open your eyes)
Inside outside left side work the floor
Inside outside up top down with more

One day you might realize
That you might need to open your eyes
One day you might realize
That you might need to open your eyes
