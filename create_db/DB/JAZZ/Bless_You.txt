Bless you for being an angel 
Just when it seemed that heaven was not for me 
Bless you for building a new dream 
Just when my old dream crumbled so helplessly 

In that vine-covered chapel on the hill 
Your face was a hymn that lingered still 
So bless you, my darling, my angel 
Heaven is mine and life is divine with you!
