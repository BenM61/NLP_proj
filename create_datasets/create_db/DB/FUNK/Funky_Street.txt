One used to be the shotgun
Two used to be the bad boogaloo
Three used to be the swing shingaling
Four used to be the funky four fingers

Down on funky street, diggin' the funky beat
Down on funky street
That's where the grooviest people meet

From Atlanta Georgia, goin' on down to the border
Every boy is dancin' with somebody's daughter
Groovin' in the city, got to get down with it

Down on funky street we're diggin' that funky beat
Down on funky street
That's where the groovier people meet

Jump up and down and you're turnin' around
You bend your knees half way down to the ground
You move it to the west and you move it to the south
You turn it around and kiss your partner in the mouth

Down on funky street, diggin' that funky beat
Down on funky street
Where the grooviest people meet

Sweet soul music is in the air
People they're comin' from everywhere
Comin' from the east, comin' from the west
Dancin' with the one that they love the best

One, c'mon everybody, got to hit the floor
Three, c'mon, baby, and go with me
Two used be the bad boogaloo
One, got to have just a little fun

Down on funky street, diggin' the funky beat
Down on funky street, diggin' the funky beat
Down on funky street, diggin' the funky beat
Down on funky street, we're doing the swinging shingaling
