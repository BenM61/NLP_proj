We are all insane
Counting down every single living day
We are prisoners of fate
I smile at the way everybody accepts the pain

Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't feel
Just because I don't feel doesn't mean I don't understand
We are one in the unified field

We are not in the dark
Our animal anger is eating our human hearts
How come everything hurts if nothing lasts
I smile at the way everybody lives in the past

Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't feel
Just because I don't believe doesn't mean I don't understand
We are one in the unified field

We are all the same
Counting down every second every living day
We are prisoners of fate
I smile at the way everybody accepts the pain

Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't feel
Just because I don't believe doesn't mean I don't understand
We are one in the unified field

I don't care
I don't believe
But I feel, I feel
