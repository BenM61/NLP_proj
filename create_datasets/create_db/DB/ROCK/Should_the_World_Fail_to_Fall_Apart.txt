Should the world fail to fall apart
And lock off in a remote sky 
Ideas can matter too much 

Can't hear for lack of sleep 
Breathing in the smoking ruins 
The rockets in the shadows whispering
Singing in the underground 
Love and the never men 
Can't hear for lack of sleep 

Looking for the past
Try to slip the script
Gun the lowest plane
Hidden all eyes know
Try to slip the script 
Gun the lowest plane
Hidden all eyes know

There's some use in treating courage
As a remote friend
Learning what it is to lie 
Stop crash fall
On a leper mass of swelling glass
Cleaning up the swamps 
You are the heart of hearts
Wonder dig and try 
Tear it up and learn to bless the readers eye
