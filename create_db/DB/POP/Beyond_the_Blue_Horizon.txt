Blow, whistle blow away,
Blow away the past.
Go engine anywhere.
I don't care how fast.
On, on from darkness into dawn,
From rain into the rainbow,
Fly with me.
Gone, gone all my grief and woe.
What matter where I go if I am free?

Beyond the blue horizon
Waits a beautiful day.
Goodbye to things that bore me.
Joy is waiting for me.
I see a new horizon.
My life has only begun.
Beyond the blue horizon lies a rising sun.
