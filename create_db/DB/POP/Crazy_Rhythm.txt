Crazy rhythm, here's the doorway
I'll go my way, you'll go your way
Crazy rhythm, from now on we're through

Here is where we have a showdown
I'm too high hat, you're too lowdown
Crazy rhythm, here's goodbye to you

They say that when a highbrow meets a lowbrow
Walking along Broadway
Soon the highbrow, he has no brow
Ain't it a shame, and you're to blame

What's the use of prohibition
You produce the same condition
Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too
