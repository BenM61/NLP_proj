Don't try to tell me why 
You just can't get enough of me 
So fine, so unkind 
I can tell that you're using me 
You just using me 
You know what you do to me 

You just build me up 
And then you let me down 
Make you feel like a man 
And treat me like a clown 

So strong, but you so wrong 
Should've known it all along 
So nice, like paradise 
I got this feeling I'll be paying price 
Paying price for you 
I'll be paying for the rest of my life 
That ain't nice 

You just build me up 
And then you act so cool 
Make you feel like a flame 
And treat me like a fool 

Got me hangin' 
On a string
