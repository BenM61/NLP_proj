The hero is exposed when
His crimes are brought to the light of day
Won't be feelin' sorry, sorry, sorry
On the judgement day.

It wasn't me who said
There'll be a price to pay
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
(Hero takes a fall) oh no.

Your mother told you stories
You substitute with girls who tell you more
Suddenly you sight a fancy chance
Since love is at your door.

We're seeing through you now
I saw it all before
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
(Hero takes a fall) oh no.

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, uh-huh oh.

Emotion is a virtue
For you, it is the one fatal flaw
Sitting on your throne and drinking,
Thinking she'll return your call.

Every story's got an ending
Look out! Here it comes, here it comes
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
(Hero takes a fall) oh woe, woe hoe.

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, uh-huh oh.
