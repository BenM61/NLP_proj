I'm tryin' to forget you, but try as I may
You're still my every thought, Dear, every day
No use tryin' to forget you 'cause I realize
That I'm trying to forget you with tears in my eyes

And those teardrops only remind me
That I love you more and more
So I'll put my foolish pride behind me
And go knockin', knockin' at your door

And I'll be tryin' to impress you
Hopin' to possess you
Now I know I haven't a chance, Dear, there's no denyin'
But you can't blame a fellow for tryin'

And those teardrops only remind me
That I love you more and more
So I'll put my foolish pride behind me
And go knockin', knockin' at your door

And I'll be tryin' to impress you
Hopin' to possess you
Now I know I haven't a chance, Dear, there's no denyin'
But you can't blame a fellow for tryin'
