I didn't question I didn't know,
As far as I'd seen life was endless,
When I realised I had to let go,
We are mere mortals,
As to the rest,
It's not eternal, imperishable,
While on the move,
It's not eternal, interminable,
Progress is the clue,

I though IBM was born with the world,
The US flag would float forever,
The cold opponent did pack away,
The capital will have to follow,
It's not eternal, imperishable,
Oh yes it will go,
It's not eternal, imperishable,
The dinosaur law,

Look at the symbols, they are alive,
They move evolve and then they die.
