Chorus:
Cheryl Moana Marie
 Back home she's waiting for me.
Cheryl Moana Marie
 There on the shore she waits so patiently

Verse 1:
In the sleepy little town 
 Where soft breezes blow
there's a lovely little Maui Miss I used to know
Someday I'll go find my way and I'll return
 from over the sea
To where my island sweetheart waits for me.

Verse 2: (Repeated twice)
Cheryl Moana Marie
 Someday our waiting will end
Safe in my arms she will be 
 My Cheryl Moana Marie
