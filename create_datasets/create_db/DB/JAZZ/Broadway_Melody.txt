Don't bring a frown to old Broadway 
You've got to clown on Broadway
Your troubles there are out of style
For Broadway always wears a smile
A million lights they flicker there
A million hearts beat quicker there
No skies of grey on the great White Way
That's the Broadway melody
 
Don't bring a frown to old Broadway 
You've got to clown on broadway
Your troubles there are out of style
For Broadway always wears a smile
A million lights they flicker there
A million hearts beat quicker there
No skies of grey on the great White Way
