2 o'clock in the morning
God I'm still awake
Thunder rolls like I'm wounded
My hearts about to brake

Lying here beside you
Where love used to be

Deliver me
Deliver me
I'm losing ground
You're the only one can't you see
Deliver me
'cause I hear the sound
Of your voice and I feel whole again, babe
Please deliver me

I never could understand it
Why something so strong
As hard as you try to hold it
Can turn out so wrong

Lying here beside you
Down on my knees

Deliver me
Deliver me
I'm losing ground
You're the only one can't you see
Deliver me
'cause I hear the sound
Of your voice and I feel whole again, babe
Please deliver me

From the words we should have said
Deliver me
From the shadows in my head
Baby please
Deliver me
Deliver me

Deliver me
Deliver me
I'm losing ground
You're the only one can't you see
Deliver me
'cause I hear the sound
Of your voice and I know you'll deliver me

Deliver me
'cause I hear the sound
Of your voice and I feel whole again babe
So baby take me home again
Or set me free
Deliver me
Deliver me
I'm down on my knees
