You light me up
You bring the crowd
I think about this
Every time the stars come out

You light me up
You chase the clouds
I think about this
Every time the stars come out

Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out

Every time the stars come

You light me up
You bring the crowd
I think about this
Every time the stars come out

You light me up
You chase the clouds
I think about this
Every time the stars come out

Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out

Every time the stars come

You light me up
Every time the stars come
You bring the crowd
Every time the stars come out
You light me up
Every time the stars come
You chase the clouds
Every time the stars come out

Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
