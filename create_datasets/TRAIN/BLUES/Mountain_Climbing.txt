I'm just a poor man working day by day
Lost in the struggle, there's a mountain in my way
So strap your boots on get ready for that first step
The uphill battle that I ain't even started yet

Chance is you'll find me
Out in the fields
Pounding my hammer
Between stone and steel
Done my fair share of
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, it's troubles, I've got 'em
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, it's blues at the bottom

Ain't no map to follow, just follow your own path
Get close to the edge and there's no turning back
The wind and the rain gonna push you around
Hard times try to break you, don't ever let 'em back you down

Chance is you'll find me
Working away in the fields
Pounding my hammer
On the stone and steel
Done my fair share of
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, it's troubles, I've got 'em
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, blues at the bottom

Blood on my hands and there's holes in my jeans
You scrub all day but you never get them clean
It's a hard rock bottom, there ain't nothing down there but the blues
At the top of the mountain you still gotta pay your dues

Chance is you'll find me
Out in the fields
Pounding my hammer
On the stone and steel
Done my fair share of
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, troubles, I've got 'em
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, blues at the bottom
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, it's troubles, I've got 'em
Mountain climbing (mountain climbing)
Whoa, it's blues at the bottom
