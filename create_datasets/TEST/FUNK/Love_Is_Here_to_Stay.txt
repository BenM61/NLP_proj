It's very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year, forever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
They're all just passing fancies
That in time may go

Oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
Oh, our love is here to stay
