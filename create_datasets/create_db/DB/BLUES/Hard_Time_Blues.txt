My man said he didn't want me
I'm getting tired of his dirty ways
I'm going to see another brown
I'm packin' my clothes
I'm leavin' town, getting outdoors
Lettin' him know and he'll see a hard time
Now there's no need of cryin', just put me off your mind,
Then you'll see a hard time
When your good woman is gone you'll see a hard time

(Don't say a word, just listen)
The risin' sun ain't gonna set in the east no more
The risin' sun ain't gonna set in the east no more
'Cause I'm a good woman I can get a man any place I go

You can say what you please, you will miss me
There's a lots-a things you are bound to see,
When your friends forsake you and your money's gone
Then you'll look around all your clothes is gone
Down on your knees you'll ask for me,
There's no one else you will want to see
Then you'll pray a prayer that men pray ev'rywhere, Lord
When your good woman is gone
When your good woman is gone
