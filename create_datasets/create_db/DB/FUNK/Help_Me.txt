I've been living this life for a long time
And I still ain't got it all down
Never claimed to be the one
That's always right

Truth is it's getting real hard
And there's somethings I don't understand
It ain't easy to live in this way
Believe me, I''ll try

What's wrong, with loving on the weekend
Or missing church 'cause I wanted to sleep in
And if I drink once a week, gotta sneak
Is that the way it is or is it just me?

God help me, I just wanna understand
God help me, I don't wanna be wrong again
God help me, 'cause everyday I'm struggling
But if You help me I know I'll make it through another day for You

I'm the last one to point my finger
'Cause having done my share of err
But I'm getting tired of always being on trial
Yeah

I'm the topic of the he say, she say
When I don't wanna I gotta love my neighbor anyway
Am I wrong if I don't always wear a smile

What's wrong, with loving on the weekend
Or missing church, if a brother want to sleep in
And if I drink once a week, gotta sneak
Is that the way it is or is it just me?

God help me, I just wanna understand
God help me, I don't wanna be wrong again
God help me, 'cause everyday I'm struggling
But if You help me I know I'll make it through another day for You

Now is it necessary, not necessarily but a
But the way they talking to me got me wondering what a
What's right from wrong, are you here the stress in the song
Well, it's enough for a brother to quit keeping on

I hear the preacher say, don't but my body say, do it
'Cause nobody will know about the gender juice fluid
Yeah, baby girl with the girls trying to get me to pursue it
But to keep it way real God knows everything you're doing

He knows I'm trying, I'm fight
Trying to follow the writing
All the preaching the, teaching
And the what the elders are speaking

I know you feel like sometimes
He ain't preaching
'Cause you party Saturdays
And then you Sunday go to meet Him

God help me, I just wanna understand
God help me, I don't wanna be wrong again
God help me, 'cause everyday I'm struggling
But if You help me I know I'll make it through another day for You

Coming Lord, I'm coming and I can't get up
Really want to break 'cause I had enough
Help me, tired of falling down
Help me, just trying to get off the ground

Help me to be like You 'cause I wanna do what You do
I'm begging You, Lord help me
Come and see above me
Help me, I need to love, please yeah, yeah
