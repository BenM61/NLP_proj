Here it is, another summertime swing 
Cool ... beats, do ... my thing 
...
Gotta go for your fresh with the flow 
Come down and don't come late 
Summer is here so let's celebrate 
Everybody comes south to the east, to the west 
It's time to party, no time to waste 
So all the ladies out there give me what you got 
You're looking so fly and you're looking so hot 
I hope you're feeling good, I hope you're feeling fine 
Everybody in the summertime 

Let it all be sunshine after the rain 
Let it all be joy, laughter and pain 
Let it all be sunshine, oh-you-o-0 
Let it all be, let it all be, let it all be the same 
Oh baby, so let it be the same 
Let it all be, let it all be, let it all be the same 

Once again I'm gonna make you party 
Shake that ass, move that body 
Kicking it once, kicking it twice 
Everybody's out there feeling nice 
Guys out there here's your chance 
Girls are looking for the summer romance 
So just stop standing, let's go do it now
