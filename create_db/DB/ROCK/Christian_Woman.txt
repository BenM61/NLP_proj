A: body of christ (corpus christi)
B: to love god
C: j.c. looks like me

A cross upon her bedroom wall
From grace she will fall
An image burning in her mind
And between her thighs

A dying god-man full of pain
When will you cum again ? 
Before him beg to serve or please
On your back or knees
There's no forgiveness for her sins
Prefers punishment ? 
Would you suffer eternally
Or internally ? 

For her lust
She'll burn in hell
Her soul done medium well
All through mass manual stimulation
Salvation

Body of christ
She needs
The body of christ

She'd like to know god
Ooh love god
Feel her god
Inside of here - deep inside of her

Jesus christ looks like me
