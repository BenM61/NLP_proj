I will love you anyway 
Even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you want to be
I just want to satisfy ya 
You're not mine and I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talkin' baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, Sweet thang
Don't ya know you're my everythang
Whoa oh, Sweet thang
Don't ya know you're my everythang 
Yes you are

I wish you were my lover
But ya act so undercover
Love ya child my whole life long
Is be right or be wrong
I'm only what ya make me, baby
Don't walk away,
Don't be so shady
Don't want your mind,
Don't want your money
These words I say, they may sound funny but

[Chorus]

You are my heat, you are my fire
You make me weak with soft desire
Love ya child my whole life long
Is be right or be wrong
I just want to satisfy ya 
Cause you're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't ya hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talkin' baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
You're my heat, you are my fire
You're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
