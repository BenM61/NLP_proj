I'm in love with you
Want you to love me too
Want you to be my man
Baby, understand

I'll never let you down
Always wear your crown

Come on spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Come on spread yourself over me like peanut butter

You are my heart's desire
You set my soul on fire
You know this love is for real
The one that you can feel

I always think of you
I'll never make you blue

Come on spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter

Oh I'm in love with you
Want you to love me too
Want you to be my man
Baby, understand

I'll never let you down
Always wear your crown

Come on spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter
Spread yourself over me like peanut butter
