Oh I am, a big butter & egg man
From way down in the South
Oh I, gettin' tired of working all day
I want somebody, who wants me to play, oh

Pretty clothes, have never been mine
But when my dreams come true, oh
The sun is going to shine

And I am, a big butter & egg man
I'm a great big butter & egg man
From way down South

I ain't nothing but a great ol' big butter & egg man
From way down, way down in the South
New Orleans

I'm gettin' tired of working all day
It's about time I find somebody, that wants me to play

Pretty clothes, na they never been mine
But when my dreams come true, oh
The sun's going to shine

I ain't nothing but a great big butter & egg man
I'm a great big butter & egg man
From way down South
