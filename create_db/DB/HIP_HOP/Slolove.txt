And all that you're showing me

Express our lovin' in the music
Baby don't you realize that this is the time
That I am yours and you will be all mine

Oh I wanna tell you all I wanna do do is

Take it up, nice and slow

Slow slow loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Don't wanna get it out of my head
Can't control the heat
When our bodies meet
Baby, take it to another level tonight
So excited I'm beyond control
