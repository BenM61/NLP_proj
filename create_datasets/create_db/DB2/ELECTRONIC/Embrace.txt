On a night like tonight
You saved my life
Red and green
Wet shoes slip on refracted lights

Running faster than my legs can take me
Shouting louder than my lungs allow me

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now

Light a match,
Bring the flame over to your eye
Slipping past, you won't see me before you die
Breaking down our sleep, my head's still aching
This war is killing you and all around me

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now

You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, go
You go, go, go, go

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now

Why has the river flood
Still gotta die for someone
Feel my embrace now
Feel my embrace now
