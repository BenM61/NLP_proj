Beautiful girl, you're a lovely picture
Beautiful girl, you're a gorgeous mixer
Of all that lives under those big blue skies

My heart cries, beautiful girl
You're a dazzling icon, beautiful girl
I could never travel if I have you
You'd be my dream come true

There may be blonds and brunettes that are hard to resist
You surpass them like a queen
You got those lips that were meant to be kissed
And you're over sweet sixteen

Oh, beautiful girl, what a gorgeous creature
Beautiful girl, let me call the preacher
What can I do but give my heart to you

If I could write like poets do
I sang my songs that's all to you
Beautiful girl, you're my desire

But when I search for words of praise
I'm like a schoolboy in a daze
When you come my way, this is all that I can say

Can't you see my heart just cry
Beautiful girl, you're a dazzling icon
Beautiful girl, I could never travel if I have you
You'd be my dream come true

There may be blonds and brunettes that are hard to resist
You surpass them like a queen
You got those lips that were meant to be kissed
And you're over sweet sixteen

Oh, beautiful girl, what a gorgeous creature
Beautiful girl, let me call the preacher
What can I do but give my heart to you

Beautiful girl
