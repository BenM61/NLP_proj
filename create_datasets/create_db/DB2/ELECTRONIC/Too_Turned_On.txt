Love's a cliff 
And I'm pushing you over it 
You may not know it yet 
Hey boy, you're gonna go for a tumble 
You'll never forget 
You will not forget 

'Cause I'm too turned on 
Can't turn back 
All heated up and can't cool down 
Too turned on 
I can't turn back now 
I'm too turned on 
Can't turn back 
All heated up and can't cool down 
Too turned on 
I can't turn back now 

Love's a spark 
Could light out of the dark 
But then, you just wanna dance 
Oh boy, I'm gonna take this matter into my hands 
I'll take you in my hands 

'Cause I'm too turned on 
Can't turn back 
All heated up and can't cool down 
Too turned on 
I can't turn back now 
I'm too turned on 
Can't turn back 
All heated up and can't cool down 
Too turned on 
I can't turn back now 

Love's a chance 
Let me take it 
While you sit back and play the tape 
I'm gonna find someone who gives me more than just a taste 

Love's a spark 
Could light out of the dark 
But then, you just wanna dance 
Oh boy, I'm gonna take this matter into my hands 
I'll take you in my hands 

'Cause I'm too turned on 
Can't turn back 
All heated up and can't cool down 
Too turned on 
I can't turn back now 
I'm too turned on 
Can't turn back 
All heated up and can't cool down 
Too turned on 
I can't turn back now 

I've always wanted you 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Got to tell you 
I've always wanted you 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Got to tell you 

Too, too turned on 
Too, too turned on 
Too, too turned on 
No, no no 

Too, too turned on 
Too, too turned on 
Too, too turned on 
No, no no 

Too, too turned on 
Too, too turned on 
Too, too turned on 
No, no no
