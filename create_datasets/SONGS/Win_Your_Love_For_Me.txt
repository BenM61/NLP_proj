Wo oh oh oh little girl, how happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me

Wo oh oh oh little girl, how happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love for me
Win your love for me
Wo oh oh oh wo win your love for me

Many's the day I've longed for you, to hold you in my arms
Many's the night I've cried for you, for your many charms
If you'd only come to me, my heart wouldn't be full of sorrow
But now all I can do is hope & pray that you'll come to me tomorrow

Wo oh oh oh little girl, how happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love for me
Win your love for me
Wo oh oh oh wo win your love for me

To me you are so beautiful, beautiful as a song
And whenever I look at you, my heart beat like a tom-tom
If you'd only come to me, this torch I wouldn't have to carry
And if everything goes right, to the church we will go to marry

Wo oh oh oh little girl, how happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love for me
Win your love for me
Wo oh oh oh wo win your love for me
