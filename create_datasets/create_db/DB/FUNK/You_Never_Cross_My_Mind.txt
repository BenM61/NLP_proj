Now see here, why'all calling me.
We both agreed it was gonna be a one-night thing, no strings attached.
I go my way and you go yours, and look what happened.
Yeah, but...

I lay there every night while you loved me,
And I'm used to nights that go by slow.
And I wake up every morning where you left me
Wondering which way the day is gonna go.
But you never cross my mind,
Though I cry from time to time.
No, you never cross my mind.
You just stay there all the time.

I got a letter from you. You promised you wasn't gonna do that.
But from time to time my eyes found a picture,
The very one I forgot to put away.
Hmmm.
Just another memory trying to make me miss you,
And I found one more without you in my mind.
But you never cross my mind,
Though I cry from time to time.
No, you never cross my mind,
But you just stay there all the time.

You want to know why I'm calling you.
I want to know why you wrote to me.
Well, I-I--I just wanted to say hi.
I can understand that, 'cause...

Now and then, a friend will say they saw you, 
And I said what could all that matter to me.
You know what, late at night, when I'm content with being lonely,
I get this unwanted visit from old misery.
And that's why, that's why you never cross my mind.
And you never cross my mind.
No, you never cross my mind.
You just stay there (Stay there.),
Stay there (Stay there) all the time.
I said you never, never cross my mind,
Even though, I find myself crying from time to time.
I don't care what you say, 
I know you never cross my mind.
Oh, no. Stay there. (Stay there)
Stay there all the time.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, eh.-ac
