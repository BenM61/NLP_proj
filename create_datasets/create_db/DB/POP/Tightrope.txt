I keep dreaming
That I'm falling
There's no safety net.
You look up with,
Arms wide open,
Then you smile and walk away.

I guess I thought you'd have an answer
You say that I was twisted and confused and just insane
(Couldn't blame him)
I feel like lately
All the things I took for granted flipped and changed.
Now I'm losing grip again

Oh oh, I'm walking a tightrope
Between who I love and what I love
Oh oh, I'm watching the sharks
With their lips as they circle far below.

I'd slip my skin and lose this face if
We could find a secret place to hide
Say the words I need to hear, and
I would leave it all behind

My psychic says she sees disaster
My heart is begging that 
I take a giant leap of faith
See are you really worth the risk
Of losing everything I have
For what might be one stupid kiss

Oh oh, I'm walking a tightrope
Between who I love and what I love
Oh oh, I'm watching the sharks
With their lips as they circle far below.

I don't know why it is
That you won't say you love me
I don't know what it is

I keep slipping
Back to you when
You're not good for me
I keep wanting
What I can't have
Mister Freud, would you disagree?

Oh oh, I'm walking a tightrope
Between who I love and what I love
Oh oh, I'm watching the sharks
With their lips as they circle far below.

I don't know why it is
That you won't say you love me
I don't know what it is
This tightropes got me!
