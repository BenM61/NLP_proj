I can't forget the night you told me that you loved me
The stars were shining so bright
How could I constantly resist you when you're lips were sweet
And your arms held me tight

You said you'd give me your heart
But you just lied to me from the start
Won't you please, please stop pretending
And just say goodbye

No, I won't sigh and I won't cry
You're not my guy, just say goodbye

I can't forget how soft you're voice was when you told me
You needed my sweet caress
And when you begged me for my love I though at last I found
My whole life's happiness

You said you'd give me your heart
But you just lied to me from the start
Won't you please, please stop pretending
And just say goodbye

No, I won't sigh and I won't cry
You're not my guy, just say goodbye, just say goodbye
You're not my guy, so just say goodbye
