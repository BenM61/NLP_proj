The seconds run away, minutes passed
At speeds we can run at
As hours start to fade deep into night
I’m not in the mood for laughing

It’s slipping away
There’s nothing we can do
It’s slipping away
There’s no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours
Would never end
Oh in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand

24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You’re still mine

If this isn't real, just can't deal
In a way you could say I was always a cynic
Hopeful for a while, lost in denial
I wish this could last forever

It’s slipping away
There’s nothing we can do
It’s slipping away
There’s no tomorrow without you

It’s slipping away
There’s nothing we can do
It’s slipping away
There’s no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours
Would never end
Oh in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand

24 hours
We still have time
If 24 hours
You’re still mine
I wish these 24 hours
Would never end

I I
I I
I won’t tell no one
I won’t tell no one
I won’t tell no one
Cause in 24 hours
Cause in 24 hours
You’ll be gone
You’ll be gone
You’ll be gone
In 24 hours

In 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You’re still mine
I wish these 24 hours
Would never end

I wish these 24 hours
Would never end
Oh in these 24 hours
Wish to forget nothing
