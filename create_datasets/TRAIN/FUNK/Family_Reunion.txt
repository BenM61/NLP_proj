It's so nice to see
All the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout
All the things that's been goin' down

It's been a long, long time
Since we had a chance to get together
Nobody knows the next time we see each other
Maybe years and years from now

Family reunion (Got to have)
A family reunion
Family reunion
(It's so nice to come together) To come together
(To get together)

I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace

And if grandpa was here
I know he'd be smiling for me a tear
To see what he has done
All the offsprings from his daughters and sons

A family reunion (Gonna have)
A family reunion (Ooh, ooh)
Family reunion
(It's so nice to come together) To come together
(To get together)

Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
At least once a year we should have

Family reunion
A family reunion (We need to do it for the young )
Family reunion
(It'll be nice, it'll be nice to come together) To come together
To get together

Family reunion (Sister knows, heaven knows)
A family reunion (It's good to see you)
Family reunion (I said we are sinkin' hands, makin' plans)
(Maybe next year) To come together (Maybe next year)

A family reunion (Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...)
A family reunion (We gotta have, we gotta have)
Family reunion (It'll be nice, it'll be so nice)
(To come together) To come together
(To get together)

You know the family is the solution to the world's problems today
Now let's take a look at the family
In the family the father is like the head, the leader, the director
Not domineering, but showing love, guidance
For everyone else in the family
Now if we could get all the fathers of the world
To stand up and be fathers
That would be great
Then we have mothers
Who are the right arm of the father
They're supposed to-to-to do the cooking
Raise the children, do the sewing
And help the father to guide and direct
Then there's the son
The son, most sons are like imitators of their father
So we're back again to the father
And he is guiding in the right way
The son is definitely gonna be alright
Then we have the daughter
Watching her mother
Be-because sooner or later she's gonna be a mother
And she'll have her own sons and daughters
It don't, it don't just stop there with the family or
Of-of yours or mine
It's a universal family
Under one divine purpose
And one divine father
That is if we all come together no matter what color, race, creed
Because that's all in the head whether you wanna believe it or not
'Cause you'll bleed

Hoo...
Family, family reunion
It'll be nice, so nice, so nice
