Though you failed at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will mend your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time its time its time you felt like that again

There is just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again and love at last
Come with me leave your yesterday your yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind

You stare at me with disbelief
You say for you there's no relief
But girl I swear it won't do you no harm
Don't sit there in your lonely room
Just looking back inside that gloom
Mama that's not were you belong
Come with me I'll take you where the taste of life is green
And everyday everyday hold on woman just got to be seen
Come with me leave your yesterday your yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind

Though you failed at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will mend your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time its time its time you felt like that again

There is just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again and love at last
Come with me leave your yesterday your yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind
