Hello, I don't even know your name, but I'm hopin' all the same
This is more than just a simple hello.
Hello, do I smile and look away? No, I think I'll smile and stay
To see where this might go.

Cause the last time I felt like this, I was falling in love,
Falling and feeling, I'd never fall in love again.
Yes, the last time I felt like this, was long before I knew
What I'm feeling now with you.

Hello, I can't wait till we're alone, somewhere quiet on our own
So that we can fall the rest of the way.
I know that before the night is thru, I'll be talking love to you,
Meaning every word I say.

Cause the last time I felt like this I was falling in love,
Falling and feeling, I'd never fall in love again.
Yes, the last time I felt like this, was long before I knew
What I'm feeling now with you.

Oh, the last time I felt like this I was falling in love,
Falling and feeling, I'd never fall in love again.
Yes, the last time I felt like this, was long before I knew
What I'm feeling now with you.
