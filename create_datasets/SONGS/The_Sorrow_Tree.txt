Down my love and held nowhere
He will come and meet me there
Oh he'll wait for me
Beneath the sorrow tree

Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree
Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree

Tell my love I'm waiting there
Oh, and he'll know where
My love will mourn for me
Beneath the sorrow tree

Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree
Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree

Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree
Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree

Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree
Ooh
Beneath the sorrow tree
Beneath the sorrow tree
Beneath the sorrow tree
Beneath the sorrow tree
Beneath the sorrow tree
