Slamming all your drinks
You don't have to think about me
You've got all your friends, used up all their meds, honey
I'll still be okay when, you walk my way publicly
But when I get home, I can't be alone, can't you see?

You scare me with your indifference
I like you best when you're a mess

Spacing out again at your suburban retreat
Did I freak you out?
Oh, what's that about? Tell me
From what I can see reciprocity is boring
But I'm tired of unrequited love stories

You scare me with your indifference
I like you best when you're a mess

I don't even fantasize about what life would be like 
If I were to find a one true love
The kind they say I should be dreaming of

You say you can't get close, hurt the ones you love the most
Is that why I try to win you over
Singing crimson and clover?

I wanna do everything
My, my, you're such a sweet thing
