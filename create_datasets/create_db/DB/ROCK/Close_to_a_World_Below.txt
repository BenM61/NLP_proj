Silent is the storm that awaits
As our crumbling world starts to give way
Falling around us a new kingdom rises
billions of souls sinking and sinking

The flames from below dance at our feet
Soon to rise up and carry us through
The burning gates ablaze in glory
Marvel at the fall of man

Glorious flames...Rise above
Show us pain...and cleanse our world

Our selfish eyes see no wrong
Closer and closer to God we believe
But farther and farther from grace we'll fall
Closer and closer to our kingdom of fire

Comfort us with words of hope
We stare into the coming dark
Blanket us with eternal night
The sweetness of death upon our lips

Far are we...From everlasting joy
Close are we...To a world below

A world of hate...A world of pain
A world too blind to see
A world of judgments ...A world of sadness
A world void of truth
A world of the power mad...A world of corrupted lives
A world destroying itself ahead of its time
A world of lust...A world of corrupted lives
A world destroying itself ahead of its time
A world of lust...A world of greed
A world with no hope

Bastard son, you spread your arms to save us from ourselves
This weak attempt has failed us so, just like your fabled father above
This shadow you've cast upon our world still conceals the light
So pick a God, for there's no one left that can save us from our end

We'll beg for life
We'll beg for forgiveness
We'll beg for pity
We'll beg to be closer to God
Foolish souls will never see
The closer to God the closer to our end
For Christ can't undo this sorrow and pain
For when he died his soul went below

Glorious flames...Come us all
Bring us closer...To a God Below
Far are we...From everlasting joy
Close are we...To a world below
