One hundred and third BPM

We're all bitches
We're all whores
We crave attention
Like some wannabe stars
We're all posers
We're all Gods
Pretend we're perfect
Like some fucking attention whore

Some fake
Some f*ck
Bend down and suck
Some pose
Come close
Slut overdose
Some crave
Some cry
Shut up and die
Some smile
Some lie
F*ck off and die
