Early one morning here as I look at across a worn out plain
Early one morning here as I look at across a worn out plain
Dust bowl memories you can hear me shout
Dust bowl memories you can hear me shout
I want to roll away the stone

Two-step slumber come on lead my eyes, lead me I wanna go
Two-step slumber come on lead my eyes, I wanna go
Teach me Lord that righteous way
Teach me Lord that righteous way
I want to roll away the stone

See that gate down yonder road, which one will I follow?
See that gate down yonder road, which one will I follow?
I lose my shackles here
I lose my shackles here
I want to roll away the stone

Tell me why, tell me why my brother gonna fall down
Tell me why, tell me why my brother gonna fall down
Pick him up, pick him up high
Pick him up and take him home, lay him down there
I got to start a crown when will I die
For the last time, for the last time
Teach me Lord that righteous way
Teach me Lord that righteous way
I want to roll away the stone
