Kickin' back with a palm tree, 
Keeping me shaded with my lady.
Never thought a thing about a thing ever back in those days, 
And it's so sad but things they do change.
We've been fussing and fighting since the day we're born, 
Just to get on by and love each other more.
Learning lessons every single second, 
Second guessing our expressions.
Time to let things slide.

Good times

Just keep on rockin' that cool shit, 
Keeping it funky 'cause I dig it.
Making rhythms so slick like the ocean, 
Man you got the blues we got the potion.
Got these hip-hop sneakers on some old time feet, 
Got the same old licks with a brand new beat.
Girls I love the motion that your hosting toasting on the
Microphone, 
Time to get things right.

Good times

It's you in the morning.
It's you in the night time sky.
The truth is unfolding, 
And man we got to get it right.

Good times
