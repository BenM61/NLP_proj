Out on these Texas plains
You can see for a million miles
There are a thousand exits between the interstate line,
Bout the last time that I saw you
Call me Pandora, call me a fool
I'm thinking to you that it would do you some good
Drop these scales and take a look

[Chorus]
This forty acres,
There's redemption to be found
Just along down the way
There is a place where no plow 
Laid has turned the ground,
And you will turn it over hay,
Cause out here hope remains,
Cause out here hope remains

Out in a Texas sky
It is big as the sea
And your alone in your room
Like an island floating free,
Spirits hanging in a bottle out on a tree,
They say that your the black sheep,
I still say your family
Throw that bottle to the waves 
Now bring you into me
From the shore you will see

[Chorus]

Out in Texas rains
The hardest I've ever seen
Washed your house away
Little loss, so major green
Love is rocks than
Crying to
This little lamb is calling out for you

[Chorus]
