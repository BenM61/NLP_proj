Here on the outskirts of life
Dreams seldom come true
Flippin' through photographs emotional holographs
Cutouts of all the figures you might've been
Reflections of a life that you once lived

As the evening descends
Your conscious of every breath
And every moment is a crisis, I guess
Starin' out the windows of your hotel room
You lit one too many fires underneath that spoon
Well I guess you deserve the chosen few
Real life, just out of view

Well that's just here,
On the outskirts
Yea, that's here,
On the outskirts of your life

And there's a picture we've all seen
It was taken in the lobby of the L.A. Ambassador Hotel
It's the silhouette of a man in another's arms
So turn off your TVs, and let that train go home
'Cause everyone warned you that California
Wasn't goin' to be the end
California wasn't gonna be the end.

And tell me where can you hide when
The whole world is ugly and strange
Yea tell me where you gonna turn when
This whole world knows your name
And these four walls are screamin'
And all your friends were so deceiving
Yea you forgot the lines of a part you rehearsed so well
Lyin' awake in the Brazilian Court Hotel

But that's just here,
On the outskirts
Yea, that's here
On the outskirts,
Of your life
