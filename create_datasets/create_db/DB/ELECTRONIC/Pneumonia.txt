Is it depression or disease?
Tell it to the millipedes

The casserole was good 
And the drives were so nice 
Welcome to the worst part of your life

I'm hard to fix because 
It took me so goddamn long 
To figure out that I broke down

Mold spores fill my lungs
Silverfish hide in the venetian blinds
In the wintertime

In the bathroom
With the shower running and my clothes on
I figured out that I hate you all

I'm hard to fix because 
It took me so goddamn long 
To figure out that I broke down
