She faced the hardest times you can imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders
Bore the weight of all her tears
And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence in her ears
 
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

And if by chance that I should hold her
Let me hold her for a while
And if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from her garden to be mine
Be careful how you touch her for she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you look into her eyes you won't believe
For the way she's always paying for a debt she never owed
And a silent wind still blows that she can only hear, so she goes
 
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
 
She's my free and gentle flower, growing growing growing wild
She's a free and gentle flower growing growing wild
She's my flower, growing growing growing wild
Growing growing growing growing wild
She's my free and gentle flower
