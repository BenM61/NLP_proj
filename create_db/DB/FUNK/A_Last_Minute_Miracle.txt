I thought I'd found the right guy, but another girl caught his eye
When he turned his back on me, oh I thought I'd die
I'm just a-hanging on; most of my hope is gone
Lonely nights still linger since he slipped through my fingers
Last-minute miracle is all I can hope for

I'm getting hysterical, praying he'll walk through the door
I didn't miss heartache at last, oh heartbreak in my own past
(Last-minute miracle) is all I can hope for (last-minute miracle)

This infatuation can't last in his heart; I'm anticipatin' makin' a new start
If I can't share in his sweet lips, my life will cease to exist
Last-minute miracle is all I can hope for

Giving my love to a stranger, leaving my heart in danger
All hope's fading away; please let him come back to stay
(Last-minute miracle) is all I can hope for
(Last-minute miracle) hey hey hey
(Last-minute miracle) is all I can hope for (last-minute miracle)

I need some love so fast in this confusion, this heart wearing the pain
Never have I been so disillusioned; when I ever love again
Last-minute miracle is all I can hope for

I'm getting hysterical, praying he'll walk through the door
I didn't miss heartache at last, oh heartbreak in my own past
(Last-minute miracle) is all I can hope for
(Last-minute miracle) is all I do
(Last-minute miracle) I'm beggin' you please
(Last-minute miracle) last-minute miracle
