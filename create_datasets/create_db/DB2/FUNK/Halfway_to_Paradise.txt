I want to be your lover,
But your friend, is all I'll stay.
I'm only half-way to paradise,
So near, yet so far away. 

I long for your lips to kiss my lips,
But just when I think they may,
You leave me halfway to paradise,
So near yet so far away.

Bein' close to you is almost heaven, (heav-en)
But seein' you can do just so much.
It hurts me so to know your heart's a treasure, (trea-sure) 
And that my heart is forbidden to touch

So put your sweet lips close to my lips, and tell me
That's where they're gonna stay,
Don't leave me half way to paradise
So near yet so far away,

So near yet so far away,

So near yet so far away,

So near yet so far away.
