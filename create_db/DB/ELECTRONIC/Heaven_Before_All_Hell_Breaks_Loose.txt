Fate has humbled me, I've never known a love like this
It's something quite like heaven, makes me forget hell exists
It's easier to close your arms, give your sweetheart a kiss
We know what's going on outside, yet ignorance is bliss
Is what they say, yeah
Ain't it true though, yeah, yeah

They sold us a dream, the one they know that won't come true
They made me question what they tell us, they run my back out of fuel
Full of sweet distractions there to throw us off the trail
I put normalization, we won't be set up to fail

Heaven before all hell breaks loose
Let's just enjoy ourselves while we still got it good
For if heaven on earth is true
Be sure that hell is too

Feel that we're all sleeping 'neath our memory, wide awake
Trenches drag down deeper, it's more with every step we take
Situation worsens while we wait for things to change
Just the ones we expect to put things right that everyone seems to blame
Yeah they know, oh
Know it's true bro, yeah, yeah

Heaven before all hell breaks loose
Let's just enjoy ourselves while we still got it good
For if heaven on earth is true
Be sure that hell is too

Ooh, they keep on running right back
Yeah, they keep on running right back
To the lie they first sold us
So we question what they told us

Ooh, they keep on running right back
Yeah they keep on running right back
To the lie they first sold us
So we question what they told us

Heaven before all hell breaks loose
Let's just enjoy ourselves while we still got it good
For if heaven, oh, on earth is true
Be sure that hell is too
I said be sure that hell is too

Yeah, yeah
