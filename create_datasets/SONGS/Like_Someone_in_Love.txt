Lately I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
I bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love

Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
I bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
