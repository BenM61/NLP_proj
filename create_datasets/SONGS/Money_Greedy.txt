Trample on my
Trample on my soul
Kill me with a quickness
Trample on my soul
Kill me with a quickness
Trample on my soul
Money greedy
Money greedy
I trust you over all
The way you brake my heart
The way you trample on my soul

Kill me with a quickness
Kill me with a quickness

Money greedy
I trust you over all
Money greedy
I trust you over all
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul

Tricola-ola
Donde este bien je t'aime je tombe
I be dead when I'm strong

Tricola-ola
Donde este bien je t'aime je tombe
I be dead when I'm strong

I love I fall
It's a crime how I crawl
I grin and bear it
You can't compare it

Marathons of comparisons

The 't' to the 'are' to the 'icky'
You can't get close
Brag then I boast
What have I got to boast about

Ghetto traps didn't trap me, I got out
Security social
Standing in government lines
Standing in government lines
Standing in government lines
I takes what's mines
I takes what's mines
Money greedy
I love you over all
Money greedy
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul
You trample on my soul

Kill me with a quickness
I guess it's strictly business
Kill me with a quickness
I guess it's strictly business

Remember we used to sit in the brits
Never won any awards
That's not what we used to look towards
Money greedy
Tricola-ola
Donde este bien je t'aime je tombe
Comparison, marathon
Comparison
Can't get close
Brag when I boast
What have I got to boast about
Ghetto traps didn't trap me, I got out
Standing in government lines
Take what's mines
Tricola-bola
Tricola-ola
I love you over all
You trample on my soul

I trust you over all
I trust you over all
