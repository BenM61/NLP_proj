Somewhere, somehow
Sometime, some place
I did someone wrong
And now I'm suffering with the blues

Don't know just where 
Or why, or how
I must have been wrong
'Cause now I'm suffering with the blues

Why does your love taunt me
Haunt me through the night?
When I know that you don't, oh want me
If you did you'd be here by my side

Somewhere, somehow
I must have hurt you deep down inside
Or why else would I be here
Suffering with the blues?

Oh-oh, why else would I be here
Suffering with the blues?
