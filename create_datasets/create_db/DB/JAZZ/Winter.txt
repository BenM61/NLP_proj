I feel the snow
On my eyes
It touches me
Deep inside

And now I'm here
So high
A cloud
Up in the sky

And this has got me thinking
It's all because of you
My heart is dark
And my mouth so dry
Where were you
All this time?

My love is yours
You know
Every song I sing
Belongs to you
And as days like these
Come and go
I still remember
It's true

And this has got me thinking
It's all because of you
The night is dark and the moon so high
Where were you
All this time?

And as days like these
Pass me by
Through clouds or skies of blue
Then upon this heartbeat
I could fly
Just to sing this song for you
For you...
