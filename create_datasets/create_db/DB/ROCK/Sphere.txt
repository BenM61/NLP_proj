Crawling back up from the floor now
I look above me and there you are
I see your smiling face so pure, its gold
Reaching your hand out to touch mine
Perhaps all I needed was your smile
A nice compliment or two

Where were you a few weeks ago?
When I was wanting to, wanting to die
I felt so worthless but you saved me
Watching me almost fall under
You were with him I was with her
Wanting each other more then life
A kiss away from being perfect

Cry out you're watching over me and I can't be with you
All I wanted was to end me, now to be in love with two
I hate my thoughts now
I'll leave her alone to live in bliss
Your my savior my dream come true
Why

Trying to figure out a way
I'll lick your wounds I'll heal your sores
I can never face my past
Not together I felt so sick inside
Death will come very soon
I tear as we drift away
Picture me dead would you cry
