Alone, so alone that I could cry
I want to be wanted
Alone, watching lovers passing by 
I want to be wanted

When I am kissed, I want her lips to really kiss me
When we're apart, I want her heart to really miss me
I want to know she loves me so, her eyes been misty
That's the way I want to be loved

Alone, just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted, right now
Not tomorrow, but right now
I want to be wanted

I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone somewhere meant for me?
Alone, so alone that I could cry
I want to be wanted
