Just in time my love
Made a wish tonight
This old daddy's gonna
Keep you away from nasty Satan

Kiss this on the lips
And leave a swig for me
I'm so glad you could 
Come on over and

Sit on my knee
And fall in love with me
Hey it's alright
I can sit here all night

I'm the araldite 
On your broken dream
I'm the green percent 
In your nicotine
I'm your friend for life
And I cross my heart
And it's fair to say we
Made a good start

Sit on my knee
And fall in love with me
Hey it's alright
I can sit here all night
