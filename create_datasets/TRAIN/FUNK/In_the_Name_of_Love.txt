People try to create feelings just the same as love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.
For the sake of silly passion make a game of love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.

Jumping up and down on your emotions.
Just another way to break your heart.
And it really makes you wonder what became of love.
In the name of love.

They make all the sacrifices for the sake of love.
What they make of love, is old heartbreak of love.
When there ain't no giving in the give and take of love.
But blame on love, in the name of love.

Jumping up and down on your emotions.
Just another way to break your heart.
And there really ain't no feeling quite the same as love.
In the name of love.

People try to create feelings just the same as love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.
For the sake of foolish passion make a game of love.
In the name of love, in the name of love.

Coming up and down with real devotion.
There's a better way to win my heart.
And there really ain't no feeling quite the same as love.
In the name of love.
