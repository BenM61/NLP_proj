Hey!

Something's the matter baby, I'm going insane 
Something inside of me keeps talkin' to my brain 
Why can't I stop this demonic lust? 
I know I shouldn't hold you, but my body says I must 

I'm possessed
And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
Ooh, I'm possessed, yes, ooh 
I'm stone crazy in love with you, baby

Something's the matter baby, you're all I see 
Your voice is all I hear beggin' to me 
I wish I didn't need you, wish I didn't care 
I wish you'd find another soul, your love's too much to bear

I'm possessed, yes I am 
And I don't know what to do 
I'm possessed
I'm stone crazy in love with you, baby 

Does anybody want this body?

Something's the matter baby, my mind's in a daze 
I'm trippin' on your love, it's so hard to relay
Can't stop this yearnin', Lord knows I've tried 
Free me from this spell, I'm much to young to die 

I'm possessed, ooh 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
I'm possessed, ooh (I'm) 
Stone crazy in love with you, baby
Does anybody want this body? (Ooh)

I'm possessed
Stone crazy in love with you, baby 
Yeah, I

I'm possessed
Please, stone crazy, love with you, baby
And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
Gosh, I love it when the horns blow, everybody watch me dance 

Possessed, ooh! 
I'm stone crazy in love with you, ooh 

Listen, if you relate to the feeling, lemme hear you say yeah, say yeah!

Hurt me, hoo!

Mm, I said now if you relate to the feeling, lemme hear you say yeah, say yeah!
Alright, if you relate to the groove, lemme hear you say ooh (ooh), ooh (ooh)!

Hoo, hoo
P-O-S-S-E-S-S-E-D
P-O-S-S-E-S-S-E-D
P-O-S-S-E-S-S-E-D
P-O-S-S-E-S-S-E-D

Have you ever had the feeling that someone was tearing you up
Into little bitty pieces and contemplating selling you for a jigsaw puzzle?

You are like an animal running around
Inside the cage of my heart
Aren't you due for a vacation, dirty liar?

Someone's in my body 
Someone's in my body 
Someone's in my box
Someone's in my body 
Someone's in my body 
Someone's in my box
