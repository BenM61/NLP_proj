Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care 
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
