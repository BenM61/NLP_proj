Are you sad that I'm leavin'
Baby, bye-byes
Aren't always pleasin'
Would you come along
If I was needin'
And down on my knees long enough for pleadin'

But Anyway Bye Bye
Many thoughts have passed between us
When words aren't made clear
They become meaningless
I gotta get away from here
I'm tossin' in sleeplessness
Wonderin' who has the right to happiness

I got to clear my head
Changes that I dread
Are waitin' for me
Waitin' for me
But Anyway Bye Bye
