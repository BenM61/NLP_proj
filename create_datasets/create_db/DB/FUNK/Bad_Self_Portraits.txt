I bought this camera
to take pictures of my love
Now that he's gone
I don't have anybody to take pictures of
Along some highway
is pretty good subjects
I'm gonna make myself make use of this thing

I'm taking landscapes
I'm taking still lifes
I'm taking bad self portraits
of a lonely woman

I've spent my life
so lost on lovin'
I could have been a painter or a president
But after 25 years
I should be good at something
Gone are the days of me being so innocent

I'm taking night classes
I'm making sculptures
I'm painting bad self portraits
of a lonely woman

I bought this camera
to take pictures of my love
Now that he's gone
I don't know what to do with this thing, well
I don't care about the time or money
I just never thought that I'd be
through with this love

Stuck taking landscapes
Stuck making still lives
Stuck making sculptures
I'm out here taking bad self portraits
of a lonely woman
Bad self portraits of a lonely girl
Sad self portraits of a lonely woman
