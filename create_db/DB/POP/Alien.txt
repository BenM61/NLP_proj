Everything's neat and compact 
There's not much to shout about 
But winter is breaking inside of me 
Now life is so incomplete 
But you're one of the boys again 
But is that all you want to be? 

Now that you feel the weather 
Was it all in vain? 
Now that we're together 
We seem so alien 

Slowly descend from heaven 
Anyway we turn we win 
But how can you always be so sure? 
Nightporters sleep on weekdays 
Living a lifetime too 
Walking away without a cure 

The noise on the stairs disturbs me 
Somebody walks my way 
But can you rely on everything I feel? 
Driving through endless buildings 
The desert is so serene 
But Mondays were never really my ideal
