I'll give you what I hear
When she walked in with her painted lips
Did she tease you for your flirty quips
Did she leave you frozen with the wrong words chosen
You gotta show her why she can't resist
Make her blush now, you put your hands on her hips
She's gonna keep on playing until you stop chasing
So wrap your arms around her body, tell her all she needs to know

Give a little heart and soul
Let your body lose control
Give a little oh oh oh
Give a little
Wrap your arms around
Give a little

You gotta show her when she can't decide
You gotta hold her, with that look in your eyes
When you move in close take your time
Leave an empty shoulder, let her move in closer
And wrap your arms around her body, tell her all she needs to know

Give a little heart and soul
Let your body lose control
Give a little oh oh oh
Give a little
Wrap your arms around
Give a little
(Wrap your arms around her body)
(Know you wanna hold her body yeah)
(Wrap your arms around her body)

When she loves to keep you in suspense
Know she loves to keep you in suspense
But she knows she just wants to dance

Give a little heart and soul
Let her body loose control
Give a little oh oh oh
Give a little
Wrap your arms around
Give a little
(Wrap your arms around)
(You know you wanna hold her)
(Wrap your arms around)
Give a little
