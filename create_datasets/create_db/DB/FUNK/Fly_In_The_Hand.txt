I catch a fly in my hand
My knuckles go white
I wanted to fly
It didn't help me understand
But it sure felt good to hold

Heavy change is what I need
No bag of silver with a smiling queen
I got a spider in a box you see
Someday I'll take a little sum for me

From Rome to my very hand
Slipping through like each grain of sand
I open letters to the sound of air
But, aw get away I don't want to share

Look for the silver there's a finders fee
And there's an acre for every tree
I wanna go share it around
I drop a penny and I hear no sound

I close the box, hide it away
And put a value on their currency
That's ten to them for every one to me
Swallow the key for another day

Look for the silver there's a finders fee
And there's an acre for every tree
I wanna go share it around
I drop a penny and I hear no sound

Its through the nose, this shit is true
My favourite letters, I.O.U
I cut some feathers with some amber beads
I got an empty bag of some whales teeth
Show me the blood to pacify
Its what makes mothers leave to babies cry
I wanna go share all around
I change the time for every pound of pounds
