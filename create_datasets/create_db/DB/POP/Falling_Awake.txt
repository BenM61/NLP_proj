That was then but this is now
What's really changed
Black is black and white's still white
And gray is a waste

I don't mind, to my own time
And I see her again
Now I fall to her eyes
I'll see you on the way down

She's got me falling, oho
She's got me crawling, oho
She's got me falling, oho
Falling awake

She's got me falling, oho
She's got me crawling, oho
She's got me falling, oho
Falling awake

Pick it, put it away
I'll never find it again
I was right to take you back
I see you at the hay stacks
I could see wild ones
Falling obsolete
In the dark, touching my chest
I see you on the way down

She's got me falling, oho
She's got me crawling, oho
She's got me falling, oho
Falling awake

She's got me falling, oho
She's got me crawling, oho
She's got me falling, oho
Falling awake

I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm Falling awake
You got me falling awake
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm Falling awake
You got me falling awake!

She's got me falling, oho
She's got me crawling, oho
She's got me falling, oho
Falling awake

She's got me falling, oho
She's got me crawling, oho
She's got me falling, oho
Falling awake
