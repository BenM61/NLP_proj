I hear you choking on your words again
The secrets in your throat
And I really wish you'd say
What you're thinking

We've been down this road
So many times before
My stomach can not take it
I've been killing time
You've been crossing lines
You say

Get ready, get ready, get ready for this
I'm taking out my dagger
Just say it, just say it, just say it for me
I'm holding it up to your throat
are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for this
you don't wanna hear it
just say it, just say it, just say it again
It will tear your soul apart again

I'm leaving you out in the cold again
I'll let you freeze to death
I wont let you see the flames
Just the chimney
Where there's smoke there's fire
But I'm such a good liar
You cant read the signals
And my lips are sealed
Saying words that deal
Your shame

Get ready, get ready, get ready for this
I'm taking out my dagger
Just say it, just say it, just say it for me
I'm holding it up to your throat
are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for this
you don't wanna hear it
just say it, just say it, just say it again
It will tear your soul apart again

Stick to your guns
You've been betting it all on a long shot
16 ways
You gotta call a spade a spade
There is no ace up your sleeve
How can you believe you will win

Get ready, get ready, get ready for this
I'm taking out my dagger
Just say it, just say it, just say it for me
I'm holding it up to your throat
are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for this
you don't wanna hear it
just say it, just say it, just say it again
It will tear your soul apart again

It will tear your soul apart
I will tear your soul apart
It will tear your soul apart
Tear your soul apart again
