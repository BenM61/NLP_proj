No feelings left for you 
My perspectives out of view
Call me distant
But my sympathy won't do

Your love was a golden maze 
It look me one thousand ways
To rise above it and discover brighter days

Tears running dry
Years passing by
When i see our future disappearing in the sky

I'm tired of this endless race
Its time for us to close the case
Call me cold and blind
there's nothing left to see

No feelings left for me
Its impossible for us to be
Call me cold and blind
But there's nothing left to see

Tears running dry
Years passing by
When I see our future disappearing in the sky
