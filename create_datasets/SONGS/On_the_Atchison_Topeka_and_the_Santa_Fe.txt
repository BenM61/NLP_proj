What a lovely trip
I'm feeling so fresh and alive
And I'm so glad to arrive
It's all so grand
It's easy to see you don't need a palace
To feel like Alice in Wonderland

Back in Ohio where I come from
I've done a lot of dreaming and I've travelled some
But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
(want to take a ride on the Santa Fe)

I would lean across my windowsill
And hear the whistle echoing across the hill
Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

What a thrill (what a great big wonderful thrill)
With the wheels singing "westward ho"
Right from the day I heard them start
'Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart

When I'm old and grey and settled down
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town
Then I'll spend my busman's holiday
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

All aboard! (we came across the country lickety-split)
(rolling ninety miles an hour)
I can't believe I'm here at last 
Woo-oo-ooo!
(when you go travelling, it's best for you 
to take the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!)
I can't believe that anything could go so fast

Then you pull that throttle, whistle blows
Huffing and puffing and away she goes
All aboard for California, hey!
On the Atchison (on the Atchison)
On the Atchison, Topeka (on the Atchison, Topeka) (2x)
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
