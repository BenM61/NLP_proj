Dumb the dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl

The dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
Another sigh with no regret
More coins inside her hands.
One time to own respect
Now mercenary she stands.
I'm no boy stealing pennies from the poor

Break it down can you see she's.
Dumb the dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
. ...
Another hand up on her hair
Time probably erased.
Distate and so he's left where guilt is out of place.
I'm no boy stealing pennies from the poor
. ...
Dumb the dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
. . .
I'm no boy stealing pennies from the poor
. . .
Dumb the dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
The dumb dumb girl
. . .
