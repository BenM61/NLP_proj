Hey boy, you got the address
On the street of unknowns
Big man smokin' on a cigar
Dealin' on the telephone

Hey boy, look out for flim-flam
If you want to go real far
Been there,
And I believe,

You got to be what you are
In my lifetime
In my lifetime

Hey boy, you look like a million
Hey now, show 'em what you got
Hey boy, what you got to run from?

I'll teach you all that I forgot
In my lifetime
In my lifetime

Hey boy, when you write a rock tune
You give up a piece of your soul
Stay boy underneath a rockin' moon
Try before you get too old

Hooray, got yourself a road gig
Any gig's gonna be fine
Okay, you gave up your real life
And I know why

In my lifetime,
I have been there
I have dreamed it
In my lifetime
L, I, F, E

In my
T, I, M, E
In my lifetime
(Holly Holy love)
In my lifetime
(Holly Holy love)
(Shilo, when I was young)

In my lifetime
In my lifetime
In my lifetime
In my lifetime
