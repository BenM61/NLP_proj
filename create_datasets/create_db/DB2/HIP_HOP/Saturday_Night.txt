Dip, dive, socialize
Get ready for the Saturday night
Get ready for the Saturday night
Get ready for the Saturday night
Get ready for the Saturday night

Imagine wakin' up
Solidarity is evident
Harmony rules
Time is irrelevant
People to places
The message basic
From raised fist to sit in
Resist to change shit
Peep this scenario
To the future, bro
2020 and some number of years ago
People rose up
Governments froze up
World-wide block party
Everybody shows up
Up on rooftops
Ghettos and hot spots
People celebrate
No more souls rot
No more bloodshed over false deficit
Even hip hop gets a fuckin' face lift
The latest fashion
Stock markets crashin'
It's Saturday
Time to get the party crackin'
If the time and the day is right
The revolution will begin
This Saturday night

Dip, dive, socialize
Get ready for the Saturday night
Get ready for the Saturday night
Get ready for the Saturday night
Get ready for the Saturday night

Hey, hey, hey
Futuristic, I'm killin' 'em 
With every synonym
Sending 'em back with syllables
Venom up in 'em
Too terrific
Epitome of a pendulum
Digital rap
Got animal stamina in him
Son, your soul and backbone
Where the clap come from
Action Jackson
Matter of fact, we
Move you from the front
To the back, see
Plug us up
And then bump this new fat beat
When this drops
Stores out of stock on me
Shop till you drop, homie
That's not me
Rush and attack
From the back on three
Stop on beat
Shout "world peace"
Live from the block
Love peace, oh please
We don't need bouncers or police
It's Saturday night
It's nothing better
Spread the word that we coming together
So come and help me now
