I've got a crush on you
You turn me on
It's hitting home again, what I left behind
I don't want to sleep alone
I don't want to go home
I don't want to walk the streets
I want to satisfy your needs
'cause, that's what life's about
'cause, that's what love's about

She says "no, no, no, no, no, never again"
She says "no ,no, no, no, no never again"

You've got nothing to loose
So just hear me out again
I don't understand why people say I just don't give a damn
I don't want to make the same mistake
I don't want to waste another day
I don't want to play another game
I want to make it up this way
'cause, that's what life's about
'cause, that's what love's about

She says "no, no, no, no, no, never again"
I say "no, no, no, no, no never again"

Take me out of the rain 
Take me out of the rain

Some say, I stepped out of line
Some say, just leave it all behind
It's never too late, to turn it around
It's never too late, to turn it around
All I want is you tonight
All I want is you tonight, to

Take me out of the rain
Take me out of the rain

How can I change your mind
How can I change your mind to

Take me out of the rain
Take me out of the rain

Rain, rain, rain
