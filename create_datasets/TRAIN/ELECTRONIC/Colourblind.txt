Feelin' blue
While I'm trying to forget the feeling that I miss you
Feelin' green
When the jealousy swells and it won't go away in dreams

Feelin' yellow
I'm confused inside
A little hazy but mellow
When I feel your eyes on me

Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes, I'm color blind
You make me color blind

Feelin' red
When you spend all your time with your friends and not me instead
Feelin' black
When I think about all the things that I feel I lack

Feelin' jaded
When it's not gone right
All the colors have faded
Then I feel your eyes on me

Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
You make me color blind

Blinded by the light you shine
The colors fade completely
Blinded by you every time
I feel your smile defeat me

I'm color blind
I just can't deny this feeling

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind

You're the light, you're the light
(You make me color blind)
When I close my eyes I'm color blind

You're the light, you're the light
(You make me color blind)
When I close my eyes I'm color blind

You're the light, you're the light
(You make me color blind)
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
I'm color blind
