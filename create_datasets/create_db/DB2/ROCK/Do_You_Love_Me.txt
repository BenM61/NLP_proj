You give me double vision, strange transmission
When you walk in the room
Tongue tied feeling, can't see the ceiling
You've turned out the moon

Tell me, darling, what you're trying to do

You give me double vision, strange condition
When you act that way
I'm walking sideways, my nights become days
But I feel okay

Tell me, darling, what you're trying to do

You give me double vision, soul transmission
When you act so cruel
My mind is reeling, can't see the ceiling
'Cause you've turned out the moon

Tell me, mama, what you're trying to do
You got me jumping like a man with the voodoo
Tell me, darling, what you're trying to do
You got me mad like a man with the voodoo
