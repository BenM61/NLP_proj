(Hey! Grand hustle Bad Boy south lets ride nigga)
Chevy super clean, two or three screens
Watch a nigga be to the left I lean
50 karats in the crown, niggas no more scheme
Just to let you sucker niggas know I'm the king
This green I smoke we call it dro'
It's deadliest from Memphis Tenn
You see my folk we ain't no joke
Don't turn this into a murder scene
I'm paranoid, tone misquoted
Should not since my early teens
But I'm drop that note, grab me under sixteen
You can bring all the niggas you want to bring
Hey! I thought you were running things
All you did was run the screens
Must be out his mind thinking' the steel won't touch him
See it on the bush let it burn like Usher
Click, click, bang you can end the discussion
Ain't shit sweet cause I seen you unpleasant
I steal would spray broad day ain't nothing
The lilac one AK doing something
I'm immuned to the drama
Act a fool if you want to
Lean in my pocket, 40 calb by the stomach
He acting' like he want it, I'm show a nigga somethin'
Somebody finna to have put ?
I don't tolerate suckas who be trying me
Take a special kind of nigga to defies me
Similar to 8ball and MJG been coming that hard since 93
Niggas know, ain't no out shinning me
I've been the G you're trying' to be
I mob with gorillas, squaders and robbers
And killers true niggas gonna ride me

Take a look at my wheels, rolling through the south
Still spinning and I'm still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills, my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp twist I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game come major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
F*ck a twist, f*ck you bitch
I don't really want to have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggas pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Niggas try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker want to take my style
Cause niggas out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters want to see me fall
How can I let y'all niggas play me
Shitted on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball and MJG
Twista bitch and I from the shy
With my Memphis connect and I ain't going' lie
We be specializing in and up coming with dope shit
And pulling up in cool whips that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
While I bump kamikaze shit, while I scream look at my grill hoe

Old grill smile, wiling out up in the VIP
The club close at five 'o'clock, we pulling up around three
Wood grain wheel gripping, Cinderella sipping
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken
Money players is demon like I'm willy beaming
Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She screaming dreaming, wishing she can be my number one
Forever young, mama I just want to' to have some fun

Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You mine as well, jump of a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin' back to perpetrators
We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now hurt you later
But I ain't worried, I smoke one on you fucking haters
And I'm hiding gators on the refrigerator
Down south Memphis Tennessee pimpin' gotta rep it
The third I did, that nigga rugg, boy that nigga pimpin'
