Just once in a lifetime
A man knows a moment
One wonderful moment
When fate takes his hand
And this is my moment
My once in a lifetime
When I can explore a new and exciting land

For once in my lifetime
I feel like a giant
I soar like an eagle
As though I had wings
For this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may be just once in my lifetime
I'm gonna do great things
