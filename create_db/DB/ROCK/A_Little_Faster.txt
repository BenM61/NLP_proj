You keep calling it a crash and burn
Just waiting your turn
You might have time to speak
There barely was a lesson learned
Cause it will return no favors back to me

I'm sure it tasted oh-so sweet
But it was never good enough for me
I bit the tongue behind my teeth
It was never good enough for me

You say you always keep your word
Show me what you're after
I thought you'd promise me the world
Tell me what you're after
Go on and take it way too far
Cause here we are waiting once again
You say you always keep your word
Show me what you're after
Just a little faster

Are mine the only eyes that see
Thiis cut-and-dry routine?
Even when you're by my side
I still need time to feel the company

I'm sure it tasted oh-so sweet
But it was never good enough for me
I bit the tongue behind my teeth
It was never good enough for me

You say you always keep your word
Show me what you're after
I thought you'd promise me the world
Tell me what you're after
Go on and take it way too far
Cause here we are waiting once again
You say you always keep your word
Show me what you're after
Just a little faster
Just a little faster

Hold your breath now
The bad blood's wearing thin
From the pain that settles in
When we learn too much too soon

Hold your breath now
The bad blood's wearing thin
From the pain that settles in
When we learn too much too soon
Too soon

You say you always keep your word
Show me what you're after
I thought you'd promise me the world
Tell me what you're after
Go on and take it way too far
Cause here we are waiting once again
You say you always keep your word
Show me what you're after

It was never good enough for me
Show me what you're after
Just a little faster
