I was dreaming in my dreaming 
Of an aspect bright and fair 
And my sleeping it was broken 
But my dream it lingered near 
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognized 
And my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 
That the people have the power 
To redeem the work of fools 
From the meek the graces shower 
It's decreed the people rule 

People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 

Vengeful aspects became suspect 
And bending low as if to hear 
And the armies ceased advancing 
Because the people had their ear 
And the shepherds and the soldiers 
And they lay among the stars 
Exchanging visions 
And laying arms 
To waste in the dust 
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognized 
And my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 

People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 

Where there were deserts 
I saw fountains 
Like cream the waters rise 
And we strolled there together 
With none to laugh or criticize 
And the leopard 
And the lamb 
Lay together truly bound 
I was hoping in my hoping 
To recall what I had found 
I was dreaming in my dreaming 
God knows a purer view 
As I lay down to my sleeping 
I commit my dream to you 

People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 
People have the power 

The power to dream to rule 
To wrestle the earth from fools 
It's decreed the people rule 
It's decreed the people rule 
 
I believe everything we dream 
Can come to pass through our union 
We can turn the world around 
We can turn the earth's revolution 
We have the power 
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

The power to dream to rule 
To wrestle the earth from fools 
It's decreed the people rule 
It's decreed the people rule 

We have the power
We have the power
The people have the power
We have the power
