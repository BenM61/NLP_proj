Save Me, Save Me, Save Me, Save Me. 
Wake Up In The Night, Stare Into The Dark.
You Can Feel Your Fear,Tearing At Your Heart.
Trying To Lock Your Door, There Is No Escape.
I'll Be Watching You, Every Move You Make. 

Someone Please, Please Save Me.
No One Will Save You - They Won't Try.
Someone Please, Please Help Me.
Everyone's Lonely When They Die,
Everyone's Lonely When They Die. 

No One In The World Will Want You - Save Me!
No One In The World Will Need You - Save Me!
No One In The World Will Love You - Save Me!
No One In The World Will Miss You - Save Me! 

Walking Down The Street, Footsteps Close Behind.
Dare Not Turn Your Head, Don't Know What You'll Find.
Trying To Shout For Help, Your Words Turn To Dust.
Looking For A Friend, No One You Can Trust. 

Someone Please, Please Save Me.
No One Will Save You, They Won't Try.
Someone Please, Please Help Me.
Everyone's Lonely When They Die,
Everyone's Lonely When They Die. 

No One In The World Will Want You - Save Me!
No One In The World Will Need You - Save Me!
No One In The World Will Love You - Save Me!
No One In The World Will Miss You - Save Me!
