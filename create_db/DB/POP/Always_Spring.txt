I wanna be fast,
I wanna be slow,
I want somewhere to go home!

I wanna be high,
I wanna be low,
I want it all, you know!

I wanna be good,
I wanna be bad,
I need some satisfaction!

I wanna be up,
I wanna be down,
I need a new direction!

Somewhere is summer,
Somewhere is always spring!

I wanna be "I",
I wanna be "You",
I don't know where to go home!

(I wanna be "I",
I wanna be "You",
I don't know where to go home!)

I wanna be yes,
I wanna be no,
I want it all, you know!

(I wanna be yes,
I wanna be no,
I want it all, you know!)

Somewhere is summer,
Somewhere is always spring!
Somewhere is summer,
Somewhere is always spring!
Somewhere is always spring!
Somewhere is always spring!
Somewhere is always spring!
Somewhere is always spring!
Somewhere is always spring!
Somewhere is always spring!
