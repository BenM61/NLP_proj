Was I wrong
Off all night long
So high
As the stinking sun
I came alive
Then I felt
Oh uh oh
Some guys
Have everything I know
It's alright
I've done a lot of
Crawling around outside
(And I heard)
It's alright

Your sno-cone
And it's piss and blood
It's in the cards
(oh, oh)
Get well soon
Everybody!!
Do all lies
Have a taste?
Let it go
I don't know oh
A cow's neck
Bad shave
In the low blow slo-mo
It's alright
You won't set the kids on fire
Oh but I might
Ho

You come on
Sentimental
If the
Solar car's coming
I'm home
The Magna Carta's
On a Slim Jim blood
Brutha!
The sunk soul
With the coal clean toe
Is the mutha!
Yea. That's right
When you gonna find out
I'm all inside
You still might

It's all right
It's all right

It's alright
You won't set the kids on fire
Oh but I might
Ho

It's all right
It's all right
