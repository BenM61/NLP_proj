What you never know won't hurt you
What you never know won't lie
What you never know won't desert you
What you never know won't say goodbye

What you never know won't hurt you
What you never know won't lie
What you never know won't desert you
What you never know won't make you cry

What you never know
What you never, never, never, know
What you never know

What you never know won't hurt you
What you never know won't lie
What you never know won't desert you
What you never know unless you try

What you never know won't hurt you
