It wasn't my fault 
She led me here 
Canadian plains 
To disappear
It started one night 
When I'd had too much 
Of being alone 
Of collecting dust
So I went to see her 
Like a thief in the night 
I gave her my death 
And stole from her life
And it killed me each time 
That I saw her man 
A friend of mine 
If you could call me a friend
And on Sunday morning 
The preacher preached on deceit 
He spoke of a fire 
Of unspeakable heat
So now I drive 
Cross frozen plains 
Nowhere to hide 
Just to escape

I traded it all 
To match my desire 
I traded it all 
I traded for fire
I traded for fire

And Father forgive me 
Because I knew 
What I was doing
I set a snare 
For myself and fell headlong 
Into ruin
Don't let me settle 
Down in a small northern town 
To die
Burn my lips 
With coals and burn my insides
