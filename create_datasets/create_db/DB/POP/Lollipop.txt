Call my baby lollipop 
Tell you why 
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie 
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance 
Man, I haven't got a chance 

I call him, lollipop, lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop 

Sweeter than candy on a stick 
Huckleberry, cherry or lime 
If you had a choice he'd be your pick 
But lollipop is mine 

Lollipop, lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop 

Crazy way he thrills me 
Tell you why 
Just like a lightning from the sky 
He loves to kiss me till I can't see straight 
Gee, my lollipop is great 

I call him, lollipop, lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop 

Lollipop, lollipop 
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli, lollipop 
Lollipop
