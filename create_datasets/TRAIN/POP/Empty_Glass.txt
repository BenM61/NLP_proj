Why was I born today
Life is useless like Ecclesiastes say
I never had a chance
But opportunity's now in my hands

I stand with my guitar
All I need is a mirror
Then I'm a star
I'm so sick of dud TV
Next time you switch on
You might see me, oh.what a thrill for you

I've been there and gone there
I've lived there and bummed there
I've spun there, I gave there
I drank there and I slaved there

I've had enough of the way things been done
Every man on a razors edge
Someone has used us to kill with the same gun
Killing each other by driving a wedge

My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass

Why was I born today
Life is useless like Ecclesiastes say
I didn't get a chance
Opportunity's in my hand

I stand with my guitar
All I needs a mirror
Then I'm a star
I'm so sick of dud TV
Next time you switch on
You might see me

I've been there and gone there
I've lived there and bummed there
I've spun there, I gave there
I drank there and I slaved there

I've had enough of the way things have been done
Every man on a razors edge
Someone has used us to shoot with the same gun
We where killing each other by driving a wedge

My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass

Don't worry smile and dance
You just can work life out
Don't let down moods entrance you
Take the wine and shout

My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass
