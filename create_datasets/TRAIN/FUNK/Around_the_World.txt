Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous

I knew sometime, some place, some how
You'd look at me, and I would see the smile
You're smiling now

It might have been in 
Or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
No longer will I go all around the world
For I've found my world in you

Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous

I knew somewhere, some time, some how
You'd look at me, and I would see the smile
You're smiling now

It might have been in 
Or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
No longer will I go all around the world
For I've found my world in you
I've found my world, found my world in you
