I can do what I want 
I'm in complete control
That's what I tell myself
I've got a mind of my own
I'll be alright alone
Don't need anybody else
I gave myself a good talking to
No more being a fool for you
Now that I see you
And all I remember
Is how you make me want to surrender

damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna say 
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes

it's always the same
You say that you'll change
Somehow you never do
I believe all your lies
But look in your eyes
You make it all seem true
I guess I see what I wanna see
Or is it my heart just deceiving me
But with a look I know so well
I fall completely under you spell

damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay 
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes

you keep deliberately deceiving me
Making me see what I wanna see

damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna say 
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me wanna say
