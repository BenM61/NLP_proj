How sweet you are, how sweet you are,
How dear your tenderly smiling face,
Through days all bitter and gray and grim,
Through nights when even the stars are dim,
How sweet to know my heart can glow
From just the warmth of our first embrace
The world's a lovelier place by far
When I remember how sweet you are.

How sweet to know my heart can glow
From just the warmth of our first embrace
The world's a lovelier place by far
When I remember how sweet you are.
When I remember how sweet you are.
