Climbing up the tower
Just a boy and his computer
I'm still in my bathrobe
Hiding in the shadows
I'm not used to losing
Bye, bye, sugar blue eyes
You're home with the angels
Thank you for being so kind

I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go, oh
Yeah, it feels like summer
Yeah, it feels like summer to me
Yeah, it feels like summer
Yeah, it feels like summer to me
And she was a lover to me, to me, to me, to me

Which way is the graveyard?
I'm an iceberg with a warm heart
I'm spiritual, not religious
I'm a Libra, if it matters
Shattered by an email
Your words will fade away
Castle built in the sand
Will only last one day

I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go, oh
Yeah, it feels like summer
Yeah, it feels like summer to me
Yeah, it feels like summer
Yeah, it feels like summer
Yeah, it feels like summer to me
Yeah, it feels like summer
When she was a lover to me

June bride, shine so bright
Flowers in her hair, but it just ain't right
June bride, shine so bright
Flowers in her hair, we look good together, oh yeah
We look good together, oh yeah

Yeah, it feels like summer
Yeah, it feels like summer to me
Yeah, it feels like summer
When she was a lover to me

Let me see the smile, stay with me awhile
I cried for you, you were the song in my life
Let me see the smile, stay with me awhile
I cry for you, you were the song in my life
