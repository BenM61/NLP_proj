The hurry's gonna bring you to your knees
I know this much is true
Your eyes are gonna rob you of your thunder
Show you everything but you
We're caught when are hands are off the wheel
And our foot is on the gas
Like a moth to a flame, the fire moves us
We're just waiting on the crash

You know we will

Let the drumbeats wash you over
Let the songs come and take you under
Push the life that brought you here away from you tonight
There's a place where the pain can't touch ya
And there's a fire where the heat won?t burn ya
It?s in the sound of your voice tonight singing in one song

You can hear it in the trail behind your voice
There's a multitude who claim
They've been through the fire of fallen angels
And they'll never be the same
We live with the weight of what we've done
The cracks that we slip through
No time to forget about our future
Just the things that we won't do

Cause I know you'll hear
The power in the way
Your voice can sound
When there's nothing left to say
I know you'll feel
The way that I have felt tonight
Without a single thing in mind
It sounds just right
