I've been lost and I've been broken
I've been down the bottle hoping
I'm still reaching for the sun
'Cause my best is yet to come

I've been rich and I've been poor
Had the houses lost them all
But my father told me son
Your best is yet to come
I've been lost and I've been broken
I've been down the bottle hoping
I'm still reaching for the sun
'Cause my best is yet to come

I've been rich and I've been poor
Had the houses lost them all
But my father told me son
Your best is yet to come
So, let it go
Let it go

'Cause we always make mistakes
When were young
'Cause our best it yet to come

So let it roll
Let it roll
All the haters, yeah they said that we were dumb
But out best it yet to come
But out best it yet to come
But out best it yet to come

La da dee da da da, la da dee da da da da, la da dee da da da
Ain't no trick gon' get me down
La da dee da da da, la da dee da da da da, la da dee da da da
Ain't no trick gon' get me down
La da dee da da da, la da dee da da da da, la da dee da da da
Ain't no trick gon' get me down
La da dee da da da, la da dee da da da da, la da dee da da da
Ain't no trick gon' get me down
