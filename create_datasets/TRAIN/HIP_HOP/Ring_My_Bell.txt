Intro Yo yo yo yo Yo yo yo yo (Ring my bell, ring my bell) Yo yo yo yo Yo yo yo yo (Ring my bell, ring my bell)

Verse 1:

I'm just a telephone call away
You can pick it up and call me any day
And Ima listen to all you got to say
Cause I'm the type of man that never turn a woman away
Think of this as an invitation
Your heart to mine in a conversation
So when things get to much to bare like The Jackson 5 "I'll be there"
Just call me up on the telephone
Call me up when you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell

Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell, ring my bell) Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell) RI-I-ING!!!

Verse 2:

I hate to see you cry, tear after tear while this guy
Plays you like your life is a game
I've seen his type and there all the same
Breaking your heart without a care
Girl if I was in you shoes he'd be outta there
Your man is wak good for nothin' but flack
I'd tell him to pack and hit the road Jack
Who loves ya baby I do you know he doesn't care about you let him go
Where he at now? You don't know Layin' up under some
hold up wait just let me chill
no need for me to get ill
Cause yo I'm the best but yo time will tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell

Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell, ring my bell) Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell) RI-I-ING!!!

Verse 3:

Now I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look at
What the future holds for you and if you lunch then you might ruin
Something great don't make a big mistake pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and downs
It's sort of a mission now you're on a rocky road
But you could get up just make that decision
That you want someone to love you adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way baby you can ring my bell

Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell, ring my bell) Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell) RI-I-ING!!!
