Black top blazin', hometown fadin'
Out of sight in the rear view mirror
Stevie Ray blasting on the radio
As I slam it into higher gear

My baby's by my side, tears in her eyes
Writing a goodbye letter
Sayin' Johny and me are running' wild and runnin' free
Just like you did momma

Don't know where we're goin'
But when we get there we'll know
We're gonna follow the code of the road

Jump into the fire
Keep our love alive and kickin'
Down the dorr, it's what we're livin' for
Rockin' side by side
Keep your love alive and kickin'

We got everything we own in the trunk and on the roof
And she's got baby sitting money in her pocket
We're drivin' fast, ain't no looking back
We're flyin' through the desert like a rocket

White line widin' up interstate five
The road goes on forever
And it does't matter where it's gonna take us
As long as we're together

We're talkin' our chances
Gonna do it our way
Pedal to the metal shooting down the highway

Jump into the fire
Keep our love alive and kickin'
Down the walls, that's when
Freedom calls
Rockin' side by side
Keep your love alive and kickin'
