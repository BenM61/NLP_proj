Time has a way of going by
Tomorrow becomes today
If the beat goes on
When the song is gone
Harmony finds her way

Another lover may walk you home
Another goodnight kiss
But there will never be
Oh there'll never be
Another night like this

Some other arms may hold you tight
A love you can't resist
But there will never be
Oh never be another night like this
Oh there'll never be
Oh there'll never be another night like this

Because one day we may look back
On where we've been
One lonely night we might
Wish we could be there once again

Another star might guide you home
Moonlight through the mist
We'll never recreate this simple twist of fate
No other night like this
No there will never be another night like this

Time has a way of going by
Tomorrow becomes today
If the beat goes on
When the song is gone
Harmony finds her way

Another lover may walk you home
Another goodnight kiss
But there will never be
Oh there'll never be another night like this
Oh no no there'll never be
Oh there'll never be another night like this
Oh there'll never be another night like this
