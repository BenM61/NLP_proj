Met you by surprise
I didn't realize
that my life would change forver
Saw you standing there
I didn't kinow i care
There is something special in the air

Dreams are my reality
The only kind of real fantasy
Illuisons are a common thing
I try to live in dreams
It seems as if it's meant to be

Dreams are my reality
A different kind of reality
I dream of loving in the night
And loving seems alright
Although it's only fantasy

If you do exist
Honey, don't resist
Show me a new way of loving
Tell me that it's true
Show me what to do
I feel something special about you

Dreams are my reality
The only kind of reality
Maybe my foolishness is past
And maybe now at last
I see how a real thing can be

Dreams are my reality
A wonderous world where I like to be
I dream of holding you all night
And holding you seems right
Perhaps that's my reality

Met you by surprise
I didn't realize
That my life would change forever
Tell me that it's true
Feelings that are cue
I feel something special about you

Dreams are my reality
A wonderous world where I like to be
Illuisons are a common thing
I try to live in dreams
It seems as if it's meant to be

Dreams are my reality 
I like to dream of those close to me
I dream of loving in the night
and loving you seems right

Perhaps that's my reality
