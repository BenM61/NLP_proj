Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed

Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine

Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make 'em smile

Your clothes are dirty but your hands are clean
And I'm the best thing that you've ever seen
(Stay lady stay, stay with your man awhile)
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You can have your cake and eat it too
(Why wait any longer for the one you love?
I am standin' in front of you)

Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay, stay with your man awhile

You long to see me in the morning light
You long to reach for me in the night
(Stay lady stay, stay while the night is still ahead)
So maybe I'll stay, stay while the night is still ahead
(Stay lady stay, stay while the night is still ahead)
So maybe I'll stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
