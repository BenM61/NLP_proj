Cold and bare with your naked stare
Oh but no one knows, why you take them there,
Cause you're full of charm, and so full of harm
As you carry me, to where you'll bury me

In your killer eyes chilling through me
Your killer eyes keep staring through me

Tangled in, this unhealthy feeling, 
As I magnetize I feel hypnotized.
Got to get away, but you know I'll stay
As you hold me close, till I almost choke.

In your killer eyes chilling through me
And those killer eyes staring through me
Those killer eyes are tearing through me
The love deep inside me I know it can hide me
Those killer eyes are staring through me 
Those killer eyes

I don't know (I don't know) what they do to me
(Those killer eyes) you don't know, what they do to me

In your killer eyes, chilling through me
Those killer eyes, staring through me
Those killer eyes are tearing through me
The love deep inside me, I know it can hide me
Those killer eyes, keep staring through me
Those killer eyes... 

You don't know, in your killer eyes staring through me
Those killer eyes keep tearing through me
The love deep inside me, I know it can hide me
Those killer eyes keep staring through me.
