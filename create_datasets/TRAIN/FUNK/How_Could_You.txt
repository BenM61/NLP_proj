All I can do is sit alone in my room baby 
Thinking about ya 
How could this be that you are not here with me 
When I gave you the best of me 
I face each day (each day) 
Without a smile 
And life seems so unfair 
I feel like I want to (like I wanna) die 
You didn't even give me a last 
You didn't give me a last goodbye baby 
I've waited weeks for your call 
I've waited here by the phone 
But when the silence grew long (it grew to long) 
I knew that something was wrong (ooooohhhhhhhh) 
Right then I knew it babe 
How could you do it babe (how could you do it) 
How could you tear my poor heart in two (why did you have to do it 
oooohhhhh) 
How could you do it babe 
How could you do (how could you do) it to me (to me) 
Do it do it how could you do it baby 
And tear my poor heart in two 
Ain't no more blue up in my sky 
Only cloudy moments ha 
And the tears like rain you left behind 
All of those memories in the corner of my mind 
I started looking at a picture in a frame 
As I start to cry 'cause I can't picture us apart 
Oh my God can you help me 
Can you help me with this pain 
With this pain I've buried deep down inside. 
I've waited weeks for your call (yes I did) 
I've waited here by the phone (everyday) 
But when to silence grew long (too long) 
I knew that something was wrong (Yeah) 
Right then I knew it babe (baby) 
How could you do it babe 
How could you tear my poor heart in two 
(how could you do it how could you do it to me baby) 
Girl tell me it's not true (all my life) 
Do I have to spend the rest of my life without you baby 
How can I get through 
How can I get through this pain this pain no deal baby 
I've waited weeks for your call (I've waited for your call) 
I've waited here by the phone (By my phone) 
But when to silence grew long 
(I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it) 
I knew that something was wrong 
Right then I knew it babe 
How could you do it babe (why you do this why you went away) 
How could you tear my poor heart in two (yeah yeah) 
Yeah baby oooohhhhh 
I've waited weeks for your call 
I've waited here by the phone 
Break it down, break it down (But when to silence grew long) 
Break it down, break it down (I knew that something was wrong) 
Break it down
