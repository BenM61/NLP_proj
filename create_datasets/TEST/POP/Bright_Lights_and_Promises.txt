Bright lights and promises, a pocket full of dreams
That's what they pay me to be
Gold lame and diamonds - I am a hometown queen
Honey, would you sing it just for me?

When I was good... then I was bad
I never thought i'd end up this way
with no dreams to hide me - bright lights to guide me
How long does it take to make the grade?

Everywhere I hear a ringing in my ears
Drummer, let the music play
Small-town blues, make it loud, make it do
Listen to the music sway

Bar rails and cocktails - have you got a light?
That's all it pays to keep in sight
Overused and much abused promises of delight
Honey, would you care to spend the night?

Take a little time - some memories and wine
Loosen up the sucker by the bar
And if he wants to hold you, if he wants to know you
Honey, that's what you're here for

Until all I see is them reaching out for me
Drummer, play that old-time melody

Bright lights and promises, that's all it's for
Leave and enter by the service door
Now I'm gold lame and diamonds, even if my gold is worn
Honey, who could ask for more?
