I'm giving a party tonight
With champagne and pink party lights
I hope you'll attend if you're free
Come as you were before you stopped loving me

The party is B.Y.O.L.
So bring your old love you once felt
Don't bother to R.S.V.P.
Just come as you were before you stopped loving me

If you're sorry you hurt me
Honey, you've seen the light
Do me a party favor
And love me tonight

My party, it would be such fun
If only you'll just say you'll come
If here is where you belong
Come as you were before you stopped loving me

Hey, hey, hey
Come as you were before you stopped loving me
