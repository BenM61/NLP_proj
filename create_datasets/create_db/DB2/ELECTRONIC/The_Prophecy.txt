I was down on luck on the other side
Your love was the only way to have a hide
Is was flying into the face of danger
Acting like a lonely stranger
Down on luck and it seems all over

Bent the restless heart of mine
I'm always on the other side
Heal my wounds, keep the change
There will be another way

The prophecy - the legacy
When strange things goin' on

I saw you running the streets of pain
I tried to hide but it was all in vain
I didn't know I really hurt you
Sometimes it's tough, I don't had a clue
Down on luck and it seems all over

Bent the restless heart of mine
I'm always on the other side
Heal my wounds, keep the change
There will be another way
