(When your best friends are strung out)
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

Feeling, sleeping, in the field again,
Oh, I can feel, I can feel
I can feel, it's beginning to end

Yeah, premonition smiling in the dark
Oh, I can see, I can see
I can see the story starting to arc

Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's comes up
I've been a spoken word
I've been a river bed
I've been a rabid voice
And let it flow up from within

Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white

Ah, ah, ah, ah
And colors so

(When your best friends are strung out)
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, you say it's what you need
And hide your eyes when you're close to me
(When you feel up in the clouds)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

Waits, and fed us, slipping into dreams
Oh, I can feel, I can feel
I can feel the celestial beings

Oh welted pleasures leaving with the breath
I can see, I can see
I can see the beauty in the mask

Oh, oh, oh, oh

It draws up
I've been a river bed
I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes I feel like I only dream in black and white

Oh, oh, oh, oh
But colors so

(When your best friends are strung out)
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, you say it's what you need
You hide your eyes when you're close to me
(When you feel up in the clouds)
You ought to know
That I'm here no matter where you want to go
(In your head hanging upside-down)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

I'm here, no matter where you are
So let it in with, open arms, no matter where you are
Sometimes, you'll have to wait,
And it passes by like a satellite or star
No matter where you are

(When your best friends are strung out)
You know when (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
(When you feel up in the clouds)
Oh, yeah, you know when (Ooh-hoo-hoo)

(When your best friends are strung out)
Oh, yeah, you know when
You ought to know
That I'm here no matter where you want to go
(In your head, hanging upside-down)
Yeah, you know when
That's how you know
When your best friends are strung out
