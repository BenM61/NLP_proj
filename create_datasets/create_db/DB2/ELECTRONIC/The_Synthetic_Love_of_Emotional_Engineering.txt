I just noise to your finally pierced hands 
And just the other thing that wants broach it to tears 
You wanted me to love you, now you got that, oh it's so bore 
Want me to adore you, now you got that, but you never wanted more 

I can talk to you like other girls, the one I only want to bake 
I think of you night and more than that, only makes you hit the break 
Only makes you flake, thriving away like a blind snake 
Floating afloat like crowns of cake, for the taste I used 

Well I move, yeah I move, 'cause I'll no moved anymore 
Yeah you push, and I pull to uh in pieces on the floor 
Yeah I move, I'll move on, well I'll no moved anymore 
'Cause you won't know what love is, until you've touched to be 

When you got your clouds on me, just dirty finger nails 
That's what you wanted isn't it? My aim just removes me
But in it just ain't isn't it? 
You're under paralyze, I know that's what made you hide
It's just a state of mind, but maybe I should have lied 
And told you I didn't care 

I won't be your tiny bow present for you to unwrap 
I don't come with a gift for see for you, just to give me back 
And the true torn behind a flagging phase, 
And a true touch behind your full haze 
No I won't be the well it comes time, that you want me to stave 

Yeah I move, yeah I move, 'cause I'll no moved anymore 
Yeah you push, and I pull to uh in pieces on the floor 
Yeah I move, I move on, well I'll no moved anymore 
'Cause you won't know what love is, until you've touched to be
