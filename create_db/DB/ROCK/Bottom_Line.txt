The horses are on the track

There's a new dance that's going around
When the hits start flying you gotta get down
All the young people dance round the square
That old time groove is really nowhere

When you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Don't know what you're waiting for

A dance to the tune off economic decline
Is when you do the bottom line
Nagging questions always remain
Why did it happen and who was to blame?

When you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Don't know what you're waiting for

They've been doing it down at the zoo
And I can show ya here's what to do
All of the States and over UK
Even the Soviets are swinging away

When you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Don't know what you're waiting for

The road ahead's clear as a motorway
Give us this day our daily bread and send us on our way
Perchance to dream or take a holiday
Romeo oh Romeo
You gotta have your say

So when you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Anything you want is yours

When you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Don't know what you're waiting for

So when you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Anything you want is yours

Part two, part two
I'm gonna take you to part two part two
