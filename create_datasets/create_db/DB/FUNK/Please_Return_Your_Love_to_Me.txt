Please return your love to me, girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done

And, oh, baby
I cry myself to sleep at night
For fear of a-never holdin' you tight at all, baby (whoa, baby)
I miss ya more with each passin' day
Every night on my knees I pray
Please

Return your love to me, girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love, I'm just no good
For I am just a lonely boy

I'm sorry for the wrong I've done
Now I know how it feels to lose that special someone (whoa, baby)
I need you more than words can say
Without your love I can't face another day
Oh, (please)

Return your love to me, girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love, I'm just no good
I am just a lonely one

What I want you know is that if there's a heav'n above you'll be my one and only love (and, oh, baby)
I can't control this glow in me
Girl, come on and an' see about me

(Oh, please)
Return your love to me, girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love, I'm just no good
I am just a lonely one

I'm a lonely one
I'm a lonely one
I'm a lonely one
I'm just a lonely one
(I am just a)

Please, return your love to me, girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love, I'm just no good
I am just a lonely one
