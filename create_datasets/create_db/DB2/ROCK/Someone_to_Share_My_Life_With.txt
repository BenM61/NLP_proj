I don't want a girl who hangs on every word I say
Who shows me off to her parents over roast beef on Sunday
I don't want a girl who thinks she has to fake
I don't want a girl who laughs on every little joke I make
Cause I just want someone to share my life with
I just want someone to share my life with

I don't want a girl who thinks there's only me to please
I don't want a girl who thinks it's fun to tease
I don't want a girl who thinks she has to cater for my every need
I don't want a girl to go down on her knees
I just want someone to share my life with
I just want someone to share my life with
And that someone could be you

You could be that someone
You could be that someone
