And it only takes a moment
To step outside and let the rain
Kiss your pain away
And surrender it to the sun
Cause the world is still spinning around
So cease the day
Cause you have come so far
Watched a million frowns turn into smiles
Lost all track of time
Felt the energy of a million stars

You will feel love again
You will feel love again
After the rain

You will feel love again
You will feel love again
You will feel love again after the rain
