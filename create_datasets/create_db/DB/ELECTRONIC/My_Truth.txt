Robyn ? My Truth

If I don't say what you wanna hear
If I don't dress in what you want me to wear
If I don't think the way you do
I can't help it cause that's my truth

If my humor makes you bored
If my religion isn't yours
If my authority doesn't fit my youth
I can't help it cause that's my truth

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

If my culture is something you don't know
Is unfamiliar and uncomfortable
I suggest you get to know my rules
Before you judge me, cause that's my truth

If your opinion is different from mine
If where I say go, is where you draw the line
Even if I may not agree
I will except cause it's your truth and it sets you free

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

Don't you loose your truth
For whatever it's worth
Don't you try to compromise 
With your own lies

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true
