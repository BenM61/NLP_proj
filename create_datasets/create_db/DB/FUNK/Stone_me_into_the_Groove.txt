I woke up and the sun was dressed in blue 
the Panavision colours ran out of my room 
I want to paint them where ever you go 
I want to thrill you but I want it slow 
I want to fly in the room of your arms 
I want to enjoy all of your charms 

So just stone me into the groove 
You're making everything beautiful 
and I think it's wonderful 
Stone me into the groove 
I want to go! 

Oh, my saviour, my friend, just take me away 
from tonight and into today 
Just take me out on a carpet ride 
into a place where I mustn't hide 
'cause I'm bored of the ancient truth 
I'm a car crash in the blue 

So just stone me into the groove

Just name a place where I would not got 
'cause I want to fly, love, move, cry 
fly, love everything that you do 

So just stone me itno the groove
