Only children sometimes comprehend
Loneliness can often be a friend

Have to shut yourself in
Don't know how to begin
Telling it to someone
Who doesn't fit in

I am sunken in biology
I cannot control that part of me

I don't want to hurt you
But I know I will do
Maybe we could find out
What are we to do

I don't have long fingernails to use
Would we care if we were black and blue?

We're both sick but still you hold my hand
We're together but I understand

Walk along the seaside
This is not a joyride
Tell me in the meantime
It's okay
