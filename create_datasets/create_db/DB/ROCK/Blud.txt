You've got a problem
I cannot face it
Hear the anger through the ceiling
I wish I missed it

Quit your employment
We can work without it
If it means you will not suffer

You're in my blood
I'm in your blood
You're in my blood oh oh oh oh
Let's just forget oh oh oh oh
Let's just forget

Get up before they shoot you down
This is not worth the risk
The shouting's dampened by the ceiling
Oh, and I am worried, for this is

I'm in your blood
You're in my blood oh oh oh oh
Let's just forget oh oh oh oh
Let's just forget
