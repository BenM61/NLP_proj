A stranger
I want you

Out one night to seek a mate
I asked a stranger for a date
And guess what she said
I like her, man, was cool
But I was sexier than any guy
She'd ever met

Maybe if I took a chance
To find a night of sweet romance
Love wouldn't be, wouldn't be
Waiting for my ship to come
And catch this player on the run
I wanted to see her eyes

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Stranger's eyes staring at me
Her eyes were filled with danger

She was such a pretty thing
Maybe that's why I was game
Walkin' the line
So we took a rendezvous
To satisfy each other's mood
Time after time

As I looked into her eyes
Wondering if they were disguised
A mystery to me, what could it be?
All I felt was instant lust
Knowing it was dangerous
But I had to see her eyes

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Stranger's eyes staring at me
Her eyes were filled with danger
Stranger, danger, I want you

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
A stranger's eyes staring at me
Her eyes were filled with danger

Her eyes on me
I feel her eyes on me

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Stranger's eyes staring at me
Her eyes were filled with danger
Stranger, danger, I want you

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
A stranger's eyes staring at me
Her eyes were filled with danger

Her eyes on me
I feel her eyes on me

She's a mystery
Baby, can't you see?
She got me hypnotized
Baby, mesmerized

Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Her eyes were filled with danger
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
Her eyes were filled with danger
Her eyes were eyes of a stranger
