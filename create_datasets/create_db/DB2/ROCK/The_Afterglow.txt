I can see the sunset just inside of your bedroom
I know it's too soon to let it go
Everything you said echoing in my head
Into the afterglow

Street lights swaying in the wind at night
The freeway's feeling like paradise
No, time won't change it
Can't erase it
It's a long drive home, we can pass the time
By counting all the stars and the satellites
No, time won't change it
Can't erase it
I wanted you to know

I can see the sunset just inside of your bedroom
I know it's too soon to let it go
Everything you said echoing in my head
Into the afterglow
I remember that night like it was the first time
Two of us caught in the undertow
Everything you said echoing in my head
Back and forth into the afterglow
 
I took a beating last time we talked
Still adding up the costs of the cheap shots
No, time won't change it
Can't erase it
Now I'm carving our names in the table top
Heartbreak in a St. Louis parking lot
No, time won't change it
Can't erase it
I don't want you back
It's just that I wanted you to know

I can see the sunset just inside of your bedroom
I know it's too soon to let it go
Everything you said echoing in my head
Into the afterglow
I remember that night like it was the first time
Two of us caught in the undertow
Everything you said echoing in my head
Back and forth into the afterglow

I don't want you back
It's just that I wanted you to know
You still run through my head
But I will ride alone
(But I will ride alone)
 
I can see the sunset just inside of your bedroom
I know it's too soon to let it go
Everything you said echoing in my head
Into the afterglow
I remember that night like it was the first time
Two of us caught in the undertow
Everything you said echoing in my head
Back and forth into the afterglow

Into the afterglow
Into the afterglow
