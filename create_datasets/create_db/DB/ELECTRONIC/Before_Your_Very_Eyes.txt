Look out of the window
What's passing you by
If you really want this 
Bad enough

You're young and good looking
The keys to the kingdom

Sooner or later
Sooner or later
Sooner or later
And before your very eyes
And before your very eyes
And before your very eyes

Old soul on young shoulders
How you look when you're older
Time's fickle card game
with you and I

You have to take your chances
The book of forgiveness

Sooner or later
Sooner or later
Sooner or later
And before your very eyes
And before your very eyes
And before your very eyes

(Sooner or later)
(Sooner or later) 
Sooner or later 
And before your very eyes
And before your very eyes
And before your very eyes
