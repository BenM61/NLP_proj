How many times have you heard someone say
If I had money, I'd do things my way,
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man with a satisfied mind.

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
A friend, when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over and my time has run out.
My friends and my loved ones, I'll leave them no doubt.
But, one thing's gone for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Satisfied mind.
