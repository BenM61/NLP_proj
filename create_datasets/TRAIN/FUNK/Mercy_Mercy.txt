Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

Well, I went to see a gypsy and had my fortune read
She said, "Don, your baby's gonna leave you"
Her back is packed up under the bed and I cry

Have mercy, have mercy, baby, yeah
Have mercy, yeah, have mercy on me

I said, if you leave me baby, girl, if you put me down
Well, I'm a goin' to the nearest river, child
And jump from above to the ground but don't leave me

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Mercy, yeah, have mercy, have mercy on me

Well, now hey hey baby, hey hey now, what you tryin' to do, huh?
Hey hey baby, hey hey now, please don't say we're through

I said, if you stay, baby, I tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna work two jobs seven days a week
And bring my money home to you

Well, I said mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy
