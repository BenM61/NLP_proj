Your money's dripping like honey sticking
Just as foreign to me
Been wasting my time convincing you to buy
What you can't afford to need
Oh I've come through this phase
I'm out, your race
I said I'm washing my hands of you, with my industrial broom
Sweeping you under my carpet, it covers the room
I've been clearing my head for days
Of the incredible waste
Making it easy to forget you darkened the place
Oh you're a coward and I'm empowered
To keep track of everything, yeah
Those who you can trust, those who become dust
It's more fun than you might think, yeah
I said I'm washing my hands of you, with my industrial broom
Sweeping you under my carpet, it covers the room
I've been clearing my head for days
Of the incredible waste
Making it easy to forget you darkened the place
So I killed your pride for fear of suicide
I think it's all for the best
I'm only human, that's more than you've been
I'm leaving you to the rest, yes
I said I'm washing my hands of you, with my industrial broom
Sweeping you under my carpet, it covers the room
I've been clearing my head for days
Of the incredible waste
Making it easy to forget you ever darkened the place
You ever darkened the place
So fucking easy
