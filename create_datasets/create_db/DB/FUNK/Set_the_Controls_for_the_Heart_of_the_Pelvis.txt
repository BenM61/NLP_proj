(Save me from my own hand)
Ooooooh, set the controls for the heart of the pelvis
Haven't you heard my name rhymes with Elvis
And one thing I know is this
That your mouth is telling me to give you a big kiss
(Now my guard's down)

(Save me from my own hand)
Ahhh, can't you see what's on offer
Yeah babe it's going cheap today
I enter a room and all the girls say
C'mon Jarv, can I be the first?
Oh you make us so hot we feel we're gonna burst
(Now my guard's down)

So please, so please
Don't leave me alone in this double bed
It smells of damp towels and asthma inhalers
Say you're gonna call back later
Save me from these glossy photographs
Save me from my mother's laugh
Save
(Now my guard's down)
That's right girls
That's right girls
Save me from my own hand
