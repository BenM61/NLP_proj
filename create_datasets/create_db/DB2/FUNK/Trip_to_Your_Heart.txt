You treat me like summer sunshine
Takes you all the way around
To find out
That you're just like sunshine

You lost, yeah, you lost
'Cause you never stood your ground
You waited
For something my sunshine

Oh no
The colors are black and gold
The dawn
The dawn is asking for more

Hey, she wants
Wants to be treated whole
Hey, yeah, she wants
To be loved like sunshine

You hoped you'd never be wrong
You hoped you'd someday belong
To someone, somewhere, somehow
And stand up

They taught you how to deceive
Never threaten or you'll be beat
And no one said it'd be this bad

Oh no
The colors are black and gold
Hey, the dawn
The dawn is asking for more

Hey, she wants
Wants to be treated whole
Hey, yeah, she wants
To be loved like sunshine

Just like sunshine
Oh like sunshine, yeah

Here, yeah
The colors are black and gold
Hey, the dawn
The dawn is asking for more

Hey, she wants
Wants to be treated whole
Hey, yeah, she wants
To be loved like sunshine
