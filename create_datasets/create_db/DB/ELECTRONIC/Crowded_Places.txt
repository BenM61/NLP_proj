Hey, hey, hey, hey

I wanna get you in my spaces
I wanna take you different places
I know the touring is romantic
I know you see me as a frantic girl
But I can give you what you want
I know you like the way I held my temper
When I gave you to the world, gave you to the world
I can be your heart to let go

'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home

I know I messed with your head
It was just when I left you
When I was just blowing up when I said
Remember when I loved you right before that tour?
You said you didn't want to see me anymore
And then when I got home when I played that show in L.A
All your shit was gone
It was the only time I thought I'd made a mistake
And when I only want to hold you
I thought I wanted you to hold me

'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home

It falls to death so talk with me
This life, what if it's you and me?
Don't know, oh no
Maybe that means we'll fall from grace
It'd be ok, I'd have your face with me
You'll see, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see

'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places

Hey, hey, hey, hey
