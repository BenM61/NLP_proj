You look so fine
But are you too old too be the first in line
Die hard dedication
Would you give me a standing ovation

So bad you stand in her place
You better go now
Oooh you better look out
The lady in the front row

Someone took your spot
But nobody's gonna knock you off
Jealous thieves
It's invisible the power you keep

So bad you stand in her place
You better go now
Oooh you better look out
The lady in the front row

I know your face but what's your race
Are you a homosapien from space
A barometer of the mob reaction
Simple love everything we know as action

So bad you stand in her place
You better go now
Oooh you better look out

It's show time
It's show time
It's show time
It's show time
It's show time
