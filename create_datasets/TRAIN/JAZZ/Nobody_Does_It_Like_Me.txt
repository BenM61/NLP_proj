If there's a wrong way to do it 
A wrong way to play it
Nobody does it like me 
If there's a wrong way to do it 
A right way to screw it up
Nobody does it like me 
I've got a big loud mouth 
I'm always talking much to free
If you go for tact and manners 
Better stay away from me
If there's a wrong way to keep it cool 
A right way to be a fool
Nobody does it like me 
I hear a love song or ballad 
I toss like a salad
Nobody tosses like me 
And when my evenings get tougher 
I just take two bufferin' 
And drink a hot cup of tea
Last night I met an old acquaintance 
At a fancy corner pub
He said: Come on, let's have some supper 
So he used my credit-club
If there's a wrong way to take a guy 
The worst way to make a guy
Nobody does it like me 
If there's a wrong bell, I ring it 
A wrong note, I sing it
Nobody does it like me 
If there's a problem, I duck it 
I don't solve it, I just muck it up
Nobody does it like me 
As though I try to be a lady 
I'm no lady, I'm a frog
And when I talk like I'm a lady 
What I sound like is a frog
If there's a wrong way to get a guy 
The right way to lose a guy
Nobody does it like me 
Nobody does it 
No, nobody does it
Nobody does it like me 
Nobody does it like me
