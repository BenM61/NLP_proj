We are the voices in the dark
Inside the fire we are the
Eternal spark that will guide the way

We are the stars up in sky
We gather winds so you can fly
We are the light when you're sleeping

All your dreams can come true
"where do we go?"
We're just a heartbeat away

Follow the signs of the crimson thunder
We will stay by your side
Let our voices be there to guide you

We are forces in the rain
Inside your heart we are the
Unending answer to all your fears

So take a step towards the light
The crimson sky fulfills the night
The revelation is near

All your dreams can come true
"where do we go?"
We're just a heartbeat away

Follow the signs of the crimson thunder
We will stay by your side
Let our voices be there to guide you

All your dreams can come true

Follow the signs of the crimson thunder
