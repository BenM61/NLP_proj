Someone tell me it ain't true 
Why my heart belongs to you 
WEll I don't know everyday 
Ow you take my breath away 
'Cause I'm flying high 
I'm a rocket in the sky 
Sonic Boom Boy 
HA Sonic Boom Boom Boy 

If the stars are in your eyes 
They come to me out all the time 
It's comming back to me now 
And It's not gonna slow down 
'Cause I'm flying high 
I'm a rocket in the sky 
Sonic Boom Boy 
HA Sonic Boom Boom OW 

No one would believe me 
They say it would be so easy 
To say what's on my mind 
I'll be round some time 
'Cause I'm flying high 
I'm a rocket in the sky 
Sonic Boom Boy 
HA Sonic Boom Boom Boy 

I'm flying high 
I'm a rocket in the sky 
Oh Yeah 

I'm flying high 
I'm a rocket in the sky 
Sonic Boom Boy 
HA Sonic Boom Boom Boy
