well swingin' on the front porch swingin' on the lawn
swingin' where we want 'cause there ain't nobody home
swingin' to the left and swingin' to the right
if i think about baseball i'll swing all night yeah

swingin' in the living room swingin' in the kitchen
most folks don't 'cause they're too busy bitchin'
swingin' in there 'cause she wanted me to feed her
so I mixed up the batter and she licked the beater

i scream you scream we all scream for her
don't even try 'cause you can't ignore her

she's my cherry pie
cool drink of water such a sweet surprise
tastes so good make a grown man cry
sweet cherry pie oh yeah

she's my cherry pie
put a smile on your face ten miles wide
looks so good bring a tear to you eye
sweet cherry pie yeah

swingin' to the drums swingin' to guitar
swingin' to the bass in the back of my car
ain't got money ain't got no gas
but we'll bet where we're goin' if we swing real fast

swingin' in the bathroom swingin' on the floor
swingin' so hard we forgot to lock the door
in walks her daddy standin' six foot four
he said you ain't gonna swing with my daughter no more
