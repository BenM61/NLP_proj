Melodies without a sound kissing you 
Million miles up off the ground it's what you do... 
Don't need no one to rescue me you feel so good 
Nothing sends me there the way that you could 

Cruising on a journey to your heart 
Cruising every secret little part 

When you're making love with me 

I want to be lost in your love night and day 
And let the sight of every star light the way 

Cruising on a journey to your heart 
Cruising every secret little part 
Cruising to eternal mysteries 
Cruising when you're making love to me 

Making love with me 
Rockets are blasting off 
Time is set free 
The way 

You're making love to me 

Cruising on a journey to your heart 
Cruising every secret little part 
Cruising to eternal mysteries 
Cruising when you're making love to me
