It was like a movie scene
A cut out from a magazine
We are not even real
Nor are the things we think we feel

Going back to 030
Fly for twenty hours or so
Thousand miles apart in heart and soul
Now the rub is burning
Now the wheels are turning
I don't care as long as you don't

We go driving in your black car
Pick me up and love fast
We go driving in your black car
Pick me up and love fast

I met you on the dance floor
I was high and you were bored
I asked you for a lighter
And you thought, "oh, I like her"

Going back to 030
Back and forth but we go forth
Nothing lasts forever, no
You spent all our money
Used to call me honey
I know that you're sorry, ooh

We go driving in your black car
Pick me up and love fast
We go driving in your black car
Pick me up and love fast

We're dying for connection
Hoping that we get some
Some sort of reaction
Maybe we just need attention?

We go driving, we go driving
We go driving in your black car
We go driving, we go driving
We go driving in your black car

We go driving in your black car
Pick me up and love fast
We go driving in your black car
Pick me up and love fast
We go driving in your black car
Pick me up and love fast
