I know a girl named Renee from around the way
She like to do it all day sippin' Alizae
Brought her back, from Atlanta, GA
Posted up in the Bay she say she do whatever I say
Got a cousin named Shanee who loves to play
Doin' it "My Way" like Usher Raymond
A bad chick
From the Camen Islands
Profilin', stylin'
Bout to have 'em both wowin'
Smilin' at the ass
In high heels
I sit back
An watch 'em peel off they clothes
They want to serve me like Vogues
In a sideshow
The main shows are high an dope
Remote controlled like Tyco
"Bad" like Michael Jackson
Stone cold mackin'
Lights, camera, action
They got me laughin', 'cause I'm high
And I'm filmin' low budget
And I'm rubbin' on a stomach
Renee lovin' it
Shanee suckin' her lips
Rubbin' her hips
Talkin' bout call up some mo friends
Aight, I'll hit Mr. Taylor in the Benz
Tell him "Once again it's on, I got to turkeys in the ozone gettin it on, 
Come on homes?"

I love a girl like Tish, that works the twist
Does the twist
Make a brotha yell "Baby girl don't stop that twist!"
Watch her ass clap as she shake it from the back
I hate when the tush looks like it's been mushed
I give the girl a push
If not, she have ya spot smellin' like the "Dock Of The Bay"
Front the girl off, an send the girl on her way
No B.S. doubt
But Dorthoy used to work a playa like straight on out
You swore you had a date with hope
But I couldn't cope
'cause the broad needin' major Scope
And a halitocious and majortroticious a playa couldn't focus
Pour some brew an cut like hocus pocus
"Who beeped me?"
Can it be who stay in apartment "see" remindin' me of Tooty wit the bodacious 
Booty
Know me as "Pooky"
Wants to swoop me an bob her head on my Suzuki
Now why's that?
'Cause Mr. Taylor knows where it's at!

Everybody know how we do it in the Bay
Big flossin' an grindin', everythang all day
The playas on the turf
The girls in skirts
Gold diggas in the club puttin' in work
Store clerks actin' like jerks while we flirt
Shootin' the lip
Wit this tight lil' chick
Will mommy help this little Filipino trick
That I met on Reno-Novado
Playin' Keno drinkin' Vodka out cans
Stop ???
When I feel that I got ya
An I'm still watchin'
We both jockin'
She was not too spoiled ridin', forget, forgot 'em
I hollerd at that ass an I kept mobbin'
"Baby keep it poppin", is what I hollered on my way out the doe'
I take a shower
Hit the airport in a Supersport
Ballin' on the court
Hit a triple double
An I quickly go for broke no joke
Ask my playa folk how burn rubber leave 'em smoked
Man I'm from the "O"
From the "O".
