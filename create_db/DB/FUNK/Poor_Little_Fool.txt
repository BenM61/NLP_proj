I used to play around with hearts 
That hastened at my call,
But when I met that little girl 
I knew that I would fall.

Poor little fool, oh yeah, 
I was a fool, uh huh

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes,
She'd hold me close and kiss me 
But her heart was full of lies. 

Poor little fool, oh yeah, 
I was a fool, uh huh

She told me how she cared for me 
And that we'd never part,
And so for the very first time 
I gave away my heart.

Poor little fool, oh yeah, 
I was a fool, uh huh

The next day she was gone 
And I knew she'd lied to me,
She left me with a broken heart 
And won her victory. 

Poor little fool, oh yeah, 
I was a fool, uh huh

I'd played this game with other hearts
But I never thought I'd see,
The day that someone else would play 
Love's foolish game with me. 

Poor little fool, oh yeah, 
I was a fool, uh huh
