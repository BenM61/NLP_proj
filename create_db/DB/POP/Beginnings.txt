What have you done?
Yes I'm talking to you
Your only son
The one you dressed in nails
I know how hard it is for you to show

Show your love
For your love I take
The nails and thorns
That will never be enough
Still I beg and crawl
For your God-damned love

I've just begun
To understand your ways
You need blood
So no one goes away
I know how hard it is for you to show

Turn the other cheek again
Will I?
Maybe let me in this time

Show your love
For your love I take
The nails and thorns
That will never be enough
Still I beg and crawl
For father and son
I'm your son
For your God-damned love
