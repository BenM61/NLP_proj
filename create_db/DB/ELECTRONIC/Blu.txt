You don't seem to understand me when I say I'm feeling blu love
Blu love
When you touch me in that way, I just don't know what to do, love
I'm so in love

I can't get you out my mind
You send me pictures
I ain't calling crisis
You send the pictures

You don't seem to understand me when I say I'm feeling blu love
Blu love
When you touch me in that way, I just don't know what to do, love
I'm so in love

If your harp is charged and loaded
Wait for time to come
It might take you to Rome
It's all about religion
It's all about constructing the chemical reliance on

You don't seem to understand me, when I say I'm feeling blu love
Blu love
When you touch me in that way, I just don't know what to do, love
I'm so in love
