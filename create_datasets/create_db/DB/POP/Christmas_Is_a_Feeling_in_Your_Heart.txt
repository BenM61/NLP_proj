There are toys for girls and boys
Silver bells make merry noise
Yet you should remember from the start
Christmas is a feeling in your heart

Holly wreaths and mistletoe
Carols by the candle's glow
These are not the most important part
Christmas is a feeling in your heart

Faith and hope, goodwill to man
Love and peace, and faith again
Let the prayers that Christmas bring
Brush your heart like angel wings

Christmas Day will soon be gone
Yet the joy will linger on
If you only learn to do your part
Let Christmas be a feeling in your heart

Faith and hope, goodwill to man
Love and peace, and faith again
Let the prayers that Christmas bring
Brush your heart like angel wings

Christmas Day will soon be gone
Yet the joy will linger on
If you only learn to do your part
Let Christmas be a feeling in your heart
