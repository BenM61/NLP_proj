Hold your hands up
Hold your head up to the painted sky
Breathe in spirit, you can feel it
Let your ego die

Be a vessel, never settle
For the status quo
Love will lead us and complete us
This is what I know

We've got to raise vibration
Wake up and raise vibration
We've got to raise vibration
Wake up and raise vibration

Just like Jesus
As he teach us, do it like the Lord
Just how Martin got it startin'
And without a sword
Just as Gandhi went to war
And never used the gun
We can join together
And through love we'll get it done

We've got to raise vibration
Wake up and raise vibration
We've got to raise vibration
Wake up and raise vibration

We've got to raise vibration
Wake up and raise vibration
We've got to raise vibration
Wake up and raise vibration

Raise, raise vibration
Raise, raise vibration
We've got to raise, oh yeah
Raise vibration
Raise, oh, raise, raise vibration
We've got to raise, oh, raise
Raise vibration
