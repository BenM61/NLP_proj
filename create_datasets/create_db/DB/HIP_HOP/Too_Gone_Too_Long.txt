Did I hear you say that you want another chance
You need another try
You're ready to reclaim your prize
So you want my love back
Why did you let it slip away
Why did you every let me go
Your change of heart has come to late
Well the door is locked
You can't get in

The game is changed
You've been too gone too long baby
To ever get back again in my heart
Too gone too long baby
You're too many tears too late
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
Been gone, too gone, too long
Did you hear me say that
You'd be a fool to leave

You'd regret the road youn chose
You'd come running right back to me
You had such a good love, sugar
You'd never find with no one else
What I knew all the time
You had to find out for yourself
But now you'll never know the love again
You're on you own
You've been too gone too long baby
To ever get back again in my heart

Too gone too long baby
You're too many tears too late
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
Been gone, too gone, too long
Did you really think I'd take you back
Let you right in my life baby
Just like that
Someone new is loving me

Loving you was what used to be
Baby you're too late to win my heart again
You've been too gone too long baby
To ever get back again in my heart
Too gone too long baby
You're too many tears too late
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
Been gone, too gone, too long
