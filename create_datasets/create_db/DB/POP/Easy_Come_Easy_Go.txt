Easy come and easy go
That's what they say
When they're about to go broke
So try not to choke
Put your arms around me and don't ever let go
Went to see the priest
He was singing the blues
Glossing in songs, and spinning the noose
Tending the gardens, gathering leaves
Polishing coffins, and running out fears
Easy come and easy go
That's what they say
When they're about to go broke
So try not to choke
Put your arms around me and don't ever let go

Call it chance, call it choice
Words at stake, on the breath of your voice
Spinning the magic, as they arrive
Its not fatal, when it's a shallow dive
Easy come and easy go
That's what they say
When they're about to go broke
So try not to choke
Put your arms around me and don't ever let go
