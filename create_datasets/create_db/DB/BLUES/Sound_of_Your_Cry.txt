The clock by the bed is ticking too loud in the quiet night
I lie in the darkness thinking I must go before it's light
Before you open up your eyes and you beg me to stay
I'll leave 'cause I can't stand to see you hurt this way
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Though I knew the time was coming and our love would end somehow
I just couldn't bear to tell you exactly just when or how
I know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start
But if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you, kiss you, kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you
