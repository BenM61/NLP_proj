She's an animal, whoa, a party animal, whoa

Like an animal, on the dance floor
Silent murderer, haunting after you
She's untamable, but you never know
Make one move, she now out of control
Come on danger girl, let me volunteer
I'm all bulletproof, let's get out of here
Shawty you're the one, but incognito
Kill the lights, let's get loose on the floor

She's the lady I wanna know
Kind of chick, out of control
She's a diva and she knows why the club goes wild
She's an animal, whoa
She's the lady, I wanna know
Kind of chick, out of control
She's a diva and she knows why the club goes wild
She's an animal, whoa

Party animal, whoa, party animal

I got a rocket full of love , most crazy
Way you move that ass, baby not too fast
Could feel my blast,I'm gonna lose,I'm gonna lose
A party animal, I make you move

She's creeping in, through your back door
Silent killer queen, looking out for you
She's invincible, never let your go
'Cause tonight she'll be out on patrol
Come on danger girl, let me volunteer
I'm all bulletproof, let's get out of here
Shawty you're the one, but incognito
Kill the lights, let's get loose on the floor

Party animal, whoa, come party animal, whoa

She's the lady, I wanna know
Kind of chick, out of control
She's a diva and she knows why the club goes wild
She's an animal, whoa

Yes you are, party animal star
The way you move in them spot lights
Turns me on
Faze me, go on and chase me
Got a rocket full of love and, tasty
Yeah it's no grind kryptonite
I raise the tone, I load the gun, party animal, whoa
Let's go

She's a diva and she knows why the club goes wild
She's an animal, whoa,
She's the lady, I wanna know
Kind of chick, out of control
She's a diva and she knows why the club goes wild
She's an animal, whoa
