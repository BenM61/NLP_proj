You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes 
As they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh! You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now 

Does your dad appreciate 
That you are merely great? 
Does your mother realize 
You're such a treat for the eyes? 

You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes 
As they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh!, You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now (she's a cutie!)
Baby look at you now
