Shots go off
In the next the way you go
The shots go off
Like you demons
And the next the way you go
As if you wanna dance
Shots go off
Dance stuff super clean
Blaf fast patched up
Strapped up, but I got back off for
Anything that drama brings
Married the game too long

Too little to the mother fucker same old song
But is drots go off everybody get down
Always get spring as the day goes long
Get down, everybody get down
Get down, everybody get down
Everybody get down
Pull the shots go off
We hit em with the absolute
Gotta get them ? tryin rase the ..
No steps for two
When I look down the..kind of shoot
Droppin the ? whick and..on you

Check it's on look to the dawn
I know what's own
Put em in the headlock head their thrown
Usually we..we kk home
Stop the screaming and fight your demons
All about a nightmare no more dreaming
Fight your demons
'cause this is only.. get down
Shots go off
You can't blame me street trade me
The world show me

Back to the love for the fake for the phony
Keep the..dot when you're lonely
Homie, and that's the way you go the drama falls
Guns and ..I rap for the soul and dangerous
F*ck what it was I wanna cash
What it could be
'Cause this what it is
Live it how we live
F*ck the hood you feel me
Let the ..to kill me

Get down, everybody get down
Get down, everybody get down
Everybody get down
Pull the shots go off
Stop the screaming and fight your demons
All about a nightmare no more dreaming
Fight your demons
'Cause this is only.. get down
Shots go off
