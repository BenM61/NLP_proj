Tell me if you want to say something,
Because I'm sitting here looking for clues
Sixteen days I've been turning upside down,
Thinking of you

Don't know if it was your intention,
But I'm lost, and feeling confused
Sixteen days since you left my life I'm still looking for you
I feel high just being with you
Now I'm low don't know where to go

I'm just like you,
Don't know what to do
I'm caught here in the middle of a life,
I can't live but I want to
I'm just like you,
Dont know what to do
I'm caught here in the middle of a life,
I can't live but I want to
Don't know how to do it though

Don't want to be caught in the middle,
But I don't want to be left on my own
Sixteen weeks of emotional static, it makes me feel like Im hollow
I just want to get your attention,
But I know that you're looking away
Sixteen weeks since you left my life I'm still looking for you
I feel high just being with you,
Now I'm low,
Don't know where to go

I'm just like you
Don't know what to do,
I'm caught here in the middle of a life,
I cant live but I want to
I'm just like you
Don't know what to do,
I'm caught here in the middle of a life,
I cant live but I want to,
Don't know how to do it, though
Don't know how to do it, though

I wonder, wonder, wonder what you're doing, where you are
I wonder, wonder, wonder what we could have been
I wonder, wonder, wonder what youre doing, where you are
I wonder, wonder, wonder what we could have been
