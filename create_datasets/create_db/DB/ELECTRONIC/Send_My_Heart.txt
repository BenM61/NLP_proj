That's something
I wipe the tears from your eyes.
Say nothing and still you seem so surprised.
Though tears fall like rain
It's gone too far.
Keep saying
It's time to break it 
The tears and the pain and the tears and the pain.
This music keeps running through my head now
Ooh.
I'm climbing out
I'm drifting away from you.

Aaaaah just send my heart
Aaaaah my heart

Aaaaah just send my heart
Aaaaah 
And now I find a second time.

There's nothing
Nothing I would not give for you.
No feelings is all I have to show now
Ooh.
Don't say who's to blame
Is this still a game for you?
Aaaaah just send my heart
Aaaaah my heart

Aaaaah just send my heart
Aaaaah my heart

Aaaaah just send my heart
Aaaaah just send my heart
Aaaaah.
