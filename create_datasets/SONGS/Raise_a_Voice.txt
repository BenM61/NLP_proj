We're all on our own 
Look at us all 
How can we not raise 
A voice 
Against the madness 

There isn't the time 
To worry or wait 
'Cause only the young 
Can carry the weight 
And face the silence 

Do we run 
Do we stop 

Do we lie down? 
I think not 
There is an answer 
That we've got 
We are not helpless 

The vision will stand 
As blindness will fall 
Now we must look 
For the light 
In the darkness 

Do we run 
Do we stop 

Do we lie down? 
I think not 
There is an answer 
That we've got 
We are not helpless
