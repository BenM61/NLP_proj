Getting caught has made me think it over 
And it told me that you're never coming back here again 
We've been doing things the same way for so long 
That it took me aback 
And I don't think I'll ever hear that sad song again 
Don't tell me I've lost you 
Advance cassette 
I just can't believe it 
No don't say that I've lost you 
Advance cassette 
I just can't believe it 
You'll know by the look on their faces when they pass you 
You've been dropped off on the texas highway 
I've been out here for so long that I'm not sure 
How you wound me so tight 
I'm afraid I won't ever hear that sad song again 
So don't tell me I've lost you 
Advance cassette 
Oh no I just can't believe in it 
No don't say that I've lost you 
Advance cassette 
I just can't believe it
