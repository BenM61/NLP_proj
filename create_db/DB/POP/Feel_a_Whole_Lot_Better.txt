The reason why I can't say 
Gotta let you go babe and right away 
After what you did I can't stay on 
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone

Baby for a long time you had me believe
You said your love was all mine and that's the way it would be 
I didn't know that you were putting me on 
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone

I got to say that it's not like before 
And I'm not gonna play your game anymore
After what you did I can't stay on 
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone*
