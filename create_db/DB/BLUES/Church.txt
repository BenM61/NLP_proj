Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

I'm in love
With a woman
Who's in love
With a man
That I can't be
It ain't me

I was taught
To be patient
And I was taught
To be kind
But I unwind

Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

Well, I worked
Long hours
Now I'm drunk
And I'm stoned
I'm all alone
Miles from home

Oh Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand
