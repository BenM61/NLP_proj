Picture yourself by yourself,
No tomorrow yesterday,
Drowning in your own decay,
You'll never be alone this time,

So follow the trend break or bend,
It's your funeral long goodbye,
Shut tight an open eye,
You'll never be alone,

Over out,
It's all over out,
It's a slow decay,
You'll never be alone,

In the shade of the fire,
No desire for the comfort,
Pleasure's pain,
Lost on your motorway,
Just look the other way again,

And the better the drain,
Force again and the push to,
Stall within,
Cornered by the cinder's sin,
Just look the other way,

Over out,
It's all over out,
It's a slow decay,
You'll never be alone,

Over out,
It's all over out,
It's a slow decay,
You'll never be alone,

All has begun and the empty is falling
Over the edges and in though your walls,
And it's harder to win and harder to take,
And we live for the day,
We're no longer awake and it's

Over out,
It's all over out,
It's a slow decay,
You'll never be alone,

Over out,
It's all over out,
On your way down,
All it's lost,
On your way down
