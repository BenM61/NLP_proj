Be, 
All that you want,
Me to be,
I won't take this lying down
All the time
All the time
All the time

And see 
All that you want
Me to see
I won't take this lying down
All the time
All the time
All the time

You can make it,
Don't sigh,
I know, I know, I know
Its not a bed of roses, 
I know, I know, I know,
You can make it,
Don't sigh,
I know, I know, I know,
Its not a bed of roses, 
I know I know I know

Break, 
All that you want
Me to break, 
You won't keep me quiet now
All the time
All the time
All the time

And dear, 
You hurt yourself,
Oh dear,
You won't keep me quiet now
All the time
All the time
All the time

You can make it
Don't sigh,
I know, I know, I know,
Its not a bed of roses
I know, I know, I know,
You can make it
Don't sigh,
I know I know I know,
Its not a bed of roses
I know I know I know,

Oh you, 
I find,
The worst of you inside,
It won't fill you with love like here

I can see you in the dark
I can see you in the light
Oh what, a sorry sight
