Trust is all it takes
People make mistakes

Sunshine fades to grey
The second I'm away
Minutes turn to hours, without you
Time keeps marching on
Summer's been and gone
I'm still here alone, still waiting

I'm on my own
A million miles away
Temptations all around
It won't be long
So please be strong
Cause, I'm holding on for you

Trust is all it takes
People make mistakes
Cause, we are only human, let's face it
I struggle through the day
Pretending I'm okay
Make believe that you're here, beside me

Yes I'm on my own
A millions miles away
Temptations all around
It won't be long
So please be strong
Cause I'm holding on for you

You are the one that I can truly believe in
So don't ever think, that I'll ever deceive you baby
Without a doubt, you are my rhyme and my reason
And I won't let you down

Cause I'm on my own
A millions miles away
Temptations all around
It won't be long
So please be strong
I'm holding on for you

I'm on my own
Feeling blue
Miles from home
I'm lost without you
But I'll be strong
Keep holding on
Holding on for you
