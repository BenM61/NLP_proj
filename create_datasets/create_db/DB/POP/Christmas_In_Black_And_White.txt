A teenage girl, a Nazarite
Who loves Yahweh and does what's right
Is visited by an angel

She's terrified, mystified
'Till he clarifies that he's here to prophesize
And says, "Fear not
You who are highly favorite of God
The Lord is with you"

Still Mary was greatly troubled by his words
(Christmas in black and white)
And wondered what kind of greeting this might be
And he said, "Do not be afraid, Mary
For you have found favor with God?

You will be with child, and will give birth to a son
And you are to call His name Jesus
(Christmas in black and white)
He will be great, He will be called the Son of the Most High
Mary replied, "How can these things be
Since I have not yet been with a man?"

The angel answered and said
"The Holy Spirit shall come upon you
And the power of the Most High shall shower you
So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God?
(Christmas in black and white)

Even Elizabeth, your relative
Is going to have a child in her old age
And she who is said to be barren is in her sixth month
For nothing is impossible with God"

"I am the Lord's servant", Mary answered
"May it be to me as you have said"
Then the angel was gone
