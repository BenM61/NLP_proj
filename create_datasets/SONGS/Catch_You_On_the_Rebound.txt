You've been gone now almost a year
And you ask me to forget and forgive
Later, baby
Catch you on the rebound
The rebound

You didn't even write me or drop me a postcard
Now you want to come back and make a new start
Later, baby
Catch you on the rebound
The rebound

Oh, you were the first love that I ever had
But you've been gone so long now I don't feel so bad
Later, baby
Catch you on the rebound
The rebound

Rebound

I was hopin' and prayin' that I'd see the day
When I could tell you to your face
Later, baby
Catch you on the rebound
The rebound
Rebound
Rebound
