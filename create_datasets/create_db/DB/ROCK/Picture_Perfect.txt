Picture perfect
That's what it seems
They've got this whole thing figured out
But not me
We'll leave this place behind
Doesn't that feel right?
Picture perfect, it's picture perfect

Through the fire
Through the smoke and the flames
In my reflection in the window
Match in hand, and I'm running

Everyone's screaming, "You're never gonna get there"
Waking up shaking feels much better
And everyone's saying, "Shape up and get a life"
If nothing goes wrong, then how will it feel right?
Picture perfect doesn't mean much to me

Is it true what they're saying
I gotta settle down in place just like the rest?
Living the dream, is this what it feels like?
Picture perfect
It's picture perfect

The days are fading
Like they're one in the same
I point the finger
And it shows me I'm to blame
And I'm running

Everyone's screaming, "You're never gonna get there"
Waking up shaking feels much better
And everyone's saying, "Shape up and get a life"
If nothing goes wrong, then how will it feel right?
Picture perfect doesn't mean much
Picture perfect doesn't mean much to me

I've had enough time to figure this out
But I can't believe that I waited this long
I've seen the truth in another light
This is everything I never wanted to be

Wake up, shape up
You're never gonna get there
If nothing goes wrong, then how would it feel right?
Wake up, shape up
You're never gonna get there
It's picture perfect, it's picture perfect

Everyone's screaming, "You're never gonna get there"
Waking up shaking feels much better
And everyone's saying, "Shape up and get a life"
If nothing goes wrong, then how will it feel right?

Everyone's screaming, "You're never gonna get there"
Waking up shaking feels much better
And everyone's saying, "Shape up and get a life"
If nothing goes wrong, then how will it feel right?
Picture perfect doesn't mean
Picture perfect doesn't mean much to me
Picture perfect doesn't mean much to me
