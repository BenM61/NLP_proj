I don't think it's gonna be a change 
Oh I'm never ever gonna leave it 
But I hope it's gonna get better 
In my heart 
In my heart 

I hope things will get better 
'Cause that's what I need 
I think about the good times that we had 
And now I see that you are living in two different places 
And I don't think it's gonna be a change 

But I'm never gonna leave it 
I'm always gonna keep it 
In my heart 
In my heart 

I'll keep it all together 
In my heart 
I know it's gonna be better 
In my heart 
In my heart 
In my heart 
Oh I'll keep it there forever 

You said that it never should be like this 
And when I was a little child 
I never had this on my mind 
But now it is like it is 
And I don't think it's gonna be a change 
But I'm never gonna leave it 
I'm always gonna keep it 
In my heart
