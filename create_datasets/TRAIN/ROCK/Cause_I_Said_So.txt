I wake up in the morning and I feel like a king
Make love not work I can do anything
Can rule my own world and never have to listen
I'm living like there's no tomorrow
You know there really isn't
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
Every day's a thrill when you're living like me
Don't read Baudelaire's poetry
And I don't need no Ph.D.
'Cause I'm ten times smarter than you'll ever be
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
Now listen all you peoples to what I have to say
Every night's a gas if you want it that way
All you need is money and a little bit of luck
I ain't greedy baby all I want is all you've got
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
'Cause I said so
