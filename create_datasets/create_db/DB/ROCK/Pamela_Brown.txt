I'm the guy who didn't marry pretty Pamela Brown
Educated, well-intentioned good girl in our town
I wonder where I'd be today if she had loved me too
Probably be driving kids to school

I guess I owe it all to Pamela Brown
All of my good times, all my roamin' around
One of these days I might be in your town
And I guess I owe it all to Pamela Brown

Seen the lights of cities and I've been inside their doors
Sailed to foreign countries and walked upon their shores
I guess the guy she married was the best part of my luck
She dug him cause he drove a pickup truck

I guess I owe it all to Pamela Brown
All of my good times, all my roamin' around
One of these days I might be in your town
And I guess I owe it all to Pamela Brown

I don't have to tell you just how beautiful she was
Everything it takes to get a guy like me in love
Lord, I hope she's happy 'cause she sure deserves to be
Especially for what she did for me.

I guess I owe it all to Pamela Brown
All of my good times, all my roamin' around
One of these days I might be in your town
And I guess I owe it all to Pamela Brown
