Shut down, tangled up in your machinery
No sound, just the faceless press of words and wheels
Surrounds me like molasses on my soles and eaves
Come out, could anyone come out and play?

All I want is an aeroplane
Rubber banded with paper wings
All I want is to steal again
All I want is a wet dream, ice-cream
All I want is vanishing
All I want is God

Pushed down by an undeserving dumb man
No ground, just an empty room of words and steel
Why be down, drowning in the afternoon
Come out, could anyone come out and play?

All I want is an aeroplane
Rubber banded with paper wings
All I want is to steal again
All I want is a wet dream, ice-cream
All I want is vanishing
All I want is God

Come out, could anyone come out and play?

All I want is an aeroplane
Rubber banded with paper wings
All I want is to steal again
All I want is a wet dream, ice-cream
All I want is vanishing

All I want is an afterglow
A forty-five on my gramophone
All I want is a thick skin to crawl into
Everything's vanishing
All I want is God
