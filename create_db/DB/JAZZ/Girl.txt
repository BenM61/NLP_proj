Been searching all my life just to find you
In love with something about you
My soul feels empty without you
Where you've been hiding

So hold-a-me follow me come to me bet on me come beside-a-me and talking toxic
What's your name, your claim to fame GIRL
You make me feel like heaven
Intoxicate me on your game GIRL
Make me want to ball till seven
I'm fascinated by your ways GIRL
There's no way I'm leavin
Voluntarily violate me GIRL
Show me what I've been missin

I will never find another girl like you that looks so grand
I want to be that one to hold your hand
I hope to be the one to change you understand to overstand
But I will have you live to see true love a-one day

I wanna be be that special light that shines just like the northern star
That way you'll know just where you are
Fantasize feelin you hold me tight don't let me fall too far
So I will know you will live to see true love a-one day
