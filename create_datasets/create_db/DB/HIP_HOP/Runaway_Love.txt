Now little Lisa is only nine years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone, and they never met her family
Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mama's knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back

Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty, and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions; she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy, and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back

Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops Ex to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by, and her belly gets big
The father bails out; he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor, so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's about to run away and never come back

Runaway, runaway love
Don't keep runnin' away
I'll runaway with you if you want me to
Love

Yeah, I can only imagine
What you going through, ladies
Sometimes I feel like running away myself
So do me a favor right now
And close your eyes, and picture us running away together
And when we come back, everything is going to be okay
Open your eyes
