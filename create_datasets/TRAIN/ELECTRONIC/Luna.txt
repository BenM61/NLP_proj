I will bathe myself
Then I'll wear you for the night
Colours fading, frayed at the sight

(You're changing in the night)
Oh why is your face so pale and white?

There's a lot of words to call out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

Now the night has fled
Just like everything I said
When the moon was out instead

(Not sun, gold, soft and rain)
You burn through my mind, again and again, again, again
And again and again

There's a lot of words to call out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

There's a lot of words to call out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
