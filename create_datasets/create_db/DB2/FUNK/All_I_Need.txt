You're all I need
You're all I need

How can I ease your mind? 
Baby, can I come and see you tonight? 
Let me hold you, baby look into my eyes 
So you can see 
I'm down to be 
The only man you'll ever need 

Girl, you're the one for me 
I am down faithfully 
All I really want 
All I really need is you 

Baby, girl you're the one for me 
I am down faithfully 
All I really want 
All I really need is you 

I can't be 
Always right by your side 
Trust me, you're always on my mind 
Don't be, mislead by what others say 
'Cause they don't love you like I do 
Don't let them come between me and you 

Girl, you're the one for me 
I am down faithfully 
All I really want 
All I really need is you 
 
You're all I need 
All I really want 
All I really need is you, baby 
 
I'll show and prove 
You're the only one in my life 
And if you're down 
Then we can set this off tonight 
I'll leave no doubt 
About the lovin' I can give 
Girl, ain't no need to trip on me 
I'll leave no room for second guessing
