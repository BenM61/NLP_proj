Giant Steps
From their album "The Book Of Pride"
The world don't need another lover
The world don't need another lover
I've had a pocketful of love in my time
But the best of all's you
I guess we perfected the emotional thing
Just we two
I searched all over for the permanent one
And then I found you
'cause' no one's better when the lights go down
And there's just we two
Chorus:
The world don't need another lover
Now it's got you now it's got me
The world don't need another lover
'cause' our love's more than the whole world needs
Baby
You can't buy passion like it every day
From a second hand heart
You just can't separate the meant to be
They can't tear us apart
[Chorus]

Girl our love's invincible
I''m so proud with your hand in my hand
Catch a wind and fly away
We're on a one day trip to wonderland

[Chorus]
Girl our love's invincible etc.
