Lay your hands into my hand
I've been rude
I don't care what you do
Some recall is not enough
I've seen a few
Creeping like you do

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line
My foolish friend
Don't tell me if I'm right

Teenage tears the saving grace
Of this fool
But no one's watching you
Save this mirror for your face
There are two
No matter what you choose

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line
My foolish friend
Don't tell me if I'm right

When I can really rebel
Yes I'm really saddened

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line
My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
