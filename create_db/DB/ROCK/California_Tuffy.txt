A ball of light comes down to bite me on the ass, the legs, the breasts.
I'm falling from my nest, my earth, my pride, are laughing from inside.
My eyes are closed, and I'm dripping like a rose.

Old palm trees sway in the breeze,
Lick my lips,
I'll be alone forever,
You'll never get my heart.

A nickel, a dime, you find, still rolling on the ground.
You found a pearl in a strange and tangled girl.
You laid her down and her face screwed up your mind.
It's all a dream that is bursting at the seams.

In tortoise, in shell, in hell, you'll find me on my back.
I crack, once more.
Yes I am just a tart, a heart on stilts.
Pick the flower and it will wilt, to die in bliss, for greedy lover's kiss.

Old palm trees sway in the breeze,
Lick my lips,
I'll be alone forever,
you'll never get my heart.

Old palm trees sway in the breeze,
Lick my lips,
I'll be alone forever,
You'll never get my, you'll never get my, you'll never get my,

Old palm trees sway in the breeze,
Lick my lips,
I'll be alone forever,
You'll never get my heart.
