Malaika
Qui-Ji's angel Malaika
Malaika
Qui-Ji's angel Malaika
Float your spirit to me
Come take my blindness away
Ask the board for me and lead my hand
Vou can transmit me Malaika
Will the prophet come to Zulu land
God only knows Malaika
The wise man said '
Long ago the wise man said
That to our land
Soon the prophet will be sent
We will cross many rivers
Until we can find the truth
We will someday reach the promised land
Will Qui-Ji tell us Malaika
We will someday reach the promised land
Can Qui-Ji know Malaika
Malaika
Qui-Ji's angel Malaika
Malaika
Qui-Ji's angel Malaika
Float your spirit around us
Come take my blindness away
Will the prophet come to Zulu land
God only knows Malaika
