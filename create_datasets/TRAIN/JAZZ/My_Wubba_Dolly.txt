My mommy told me
If I was goody
That she would buy me
A wubba dolly

So don't you tella
I kissed a fella
Or she won't buy me
That wubba dolly

I know
I've been up to tricks
Uh oh
I'm in a fix

I want that dolly
Indeed I do
But what a fella
I want him too

(Is it the fella or the dolly or the dolly or the
fella or the fella or the dolly for you?
Is it the fella or the dolly or the dolly or the
fella? What are you gonna do?)

I'll be a goody
Just watch and you'll see
And she will buy me
A wubba dolly

(Oh, yes, I'm sorry
About the dolly
Because we told her woo-hoo
About this feller)

Boo-hoo
Oh, why did you?
Oh, boys
I wouldn't do it to you

Why did you tella
I kissed a fella?
Now she won't buy me
A wubba dolly

(We didn't tella
You kissed a fella)
Oh goody, goody, and now she'll buy me
That wubba dolly

Oh, look, here comes my mommy
And just look what she's got me
My mammy bought me
A little bitty wubba dolly

(She sho' did, she sho' did)
