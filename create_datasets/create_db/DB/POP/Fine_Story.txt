Well, well, well, well
Fine story to tell
This lovemaking is heart unbreaking me

Oh, you and your big cheeks
Have got me spinning around now
You and your warm mouth have got me
Talking pr, talking profoundly

Singing together and I'm closing my eyes
Just to reach you I've been
Building bridges too large
Ever since I met you, baby

Well, well, well, well
Fine story to tell
This lovemaking is heart unbreaking me

Made me brand new man
Fire with a big banner
Well, well, well, well
Fine story to tell

Your heart, baby, is just as big as Russia
And I'm, going to see to romance
And you'll be the, you'll be the usher my heads

My heads swarming round like a nutter
And trying to mess me up
My heart over boils with desire
And fills up my cup

Now, oh
Well, well, well, well
Fine story to tell
This lovemaking is heart unbreaking me

Made me brand new man
Fire with a big banner
Well, well, well, well
Fine story to tell

It's in the soil now
In the roots too
In my boots wow
All around now

On my CD
In my TV
On your lips
They're just as smiling

Quietly crying in the rain, falling
And you, bought me out of the cold
Trying just to seek out your name, darling
You, bought me out of the cold

Well, well, well, well
Tough story to tell
That lovemaking was damn heart breaking me

It made me brand new again
Sat me down with this pen
Well, well, well, well
Fine story to tell

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Fine story to tell
