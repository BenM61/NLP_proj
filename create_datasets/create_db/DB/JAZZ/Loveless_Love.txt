Love is like a hydrant: it turns off and on
Like some friendships when your money's gone
Love stands in with the loan sharks when your heart's in pawn

If I had some strong wings like an aeroplane
Had some broad wings like some aeroplane
I would fly away forever
Never to come again

For love, oh, love, oh, loveless love
Has set our hearts from gold-less gold
From milk-less milk and silk-less silk
We are growing used to soul-less souls

Such grafting times we never saw
That's why we have a pure full law
In everything we find a flaw
Even love, oh, love, oh, loveless love
Just to fly away from loveless love
