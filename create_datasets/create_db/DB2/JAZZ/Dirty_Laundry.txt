I've got a bad boy and that's alright with me
His dirty laundry is nothing that I can't keep clean
And when he needs an alibi
He can use me all night

What's the fun in playing it safe?
I think I'd rather misbehave

Your way

I'm just a bad girl, that's why we get along
Won't make excuses for anything I'm doing wrong
I'll pull the trigger in a flash
Watch out honey, step back

What's the fun in playing it safe?
I think I'd rather misbehave

My way

Oh baby show me the money my evil friend
Let's go to Mexico, drink margaritas in sin
I'll light a candle for good luck
Now come on baby let's

What's the fun in playing it safe?
I think I'd rather misbehave

Our Way

We're simply mad
Simply mad
