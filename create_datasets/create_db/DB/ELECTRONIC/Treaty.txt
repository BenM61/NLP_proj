Well I heard it on the radio 
And I saw it on the television 
Back in 1988 
All those talking politicians 
Words are easy, words are cheap 
Much cheaper than our priceless land 
But promises can disappear 
Just like writing in the sand 

Treaty Yeh Treaty Now 
Treaty Yeh Treaty Now 

Nhima Djatpangarri nhima walangwalang - 
Nhe Djatpayatpa nhima gaya nhe- 
Matjini... Yakarray - nhe Djat'pa nhe walang - Gumurrtijararrk Gutjuk - 

This land was never given up 
This land was never bought and sold 
The planting of the Union Jack 
Never changed our law at all 

Now two rivers run their course 
Separated for so long 
I'm dreaming of a brighter day 
When the waters will be one 

Treaty Yeh Treaty Now Treaty Yeh Treaty Now 
Treaty Yeh Treaty Now Treaty Yeh Traty Now 

Nhima djatpa nhe walang 
gumurrtjararrk yawirriny Nhe gaya nhe matjini 
Gaya nhe matjini Gaya gaya nhe gaya nhe 
Matjini walangwalang Nhema djatpa nhe walang - Nhe gumurrtjarrk nhe ya- 

Promises - Disappear - Priceless land - Destiny - 

Well I heard it on the Radio - And I saw it on the Television 
But promises can be broken Just like writing in the sand 

Treaty Yeh 
Treaty Now ...
