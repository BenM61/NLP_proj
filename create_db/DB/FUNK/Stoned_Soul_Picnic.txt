Can you surry,
Can you picnic?
Can you surry,
Can you picnic?
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey
Sassafras and moonshine
Stoned Soul

Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Rain and sun come in akin
And from the sky
Come the lord and the lightning
Stoned Soul

There'll be trains of blossoms
There'll be trains of music
There'll be trains of trust
Trains of gold and dust
Sweet trains of thought
Can you surry?

Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey
Sassafras and moonshine
Stoned soul
