Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys living next door
Are never what they seem, oooh
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall

Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Talking Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting

I don't need a boy
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I don't wanna feel, oooh
You're breathing, you're touching
But nothing's for free
I never want this to happen to me
Don't try to change me you're wasting your time
Now I've got something much better in mind

Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Talking Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talk talk talk talk talk
Talking oooh
Talk talk talk talk talk
Talking
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall

Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Talking Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Talking Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting (Talking Italian)
(Italian)
Talking italian
(Talking Italian)
Talking Italian (Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Talking Italian)
