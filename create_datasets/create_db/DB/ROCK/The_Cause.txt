Headline in the paper tells of fighting in the streets
Teenage battles; six arrested
Mutters in the council chambers, something must be done
Before our city streets become infested
And mummy turns to daddy says "where was our little boy that day
Why can't he just stay at home and watch the silver screen" 

Ch: All we wanted was a cause that we could fight for
One chance for the heroes to win the day
All we wanted was a chance to see the world
In black and white instead of a hundred shades of grey

Watch the raving maniacs go carving up the night
See the barmy smiles on their faces
See the crazy bombers going cross their deadly wires
Blow themselves into a million pieces
The bands play it hard and fast go ripping through their sets
Adrenaline going flowing drink and no regrets 
What do we tell our grandchildren
When they ask us about the good old days
Boring empty daytime jobs and frozen up inside
Do you not remember what your daddy told you long ago
God, how those old men used to fight
