(Please stay) don't go
Please stay

If I got on my knees and I pleaded you
Not to go but to stay in my are-arms
Would you walk out the door like you did once before?
Or would this time be different, would you sta-a-ay?

Don't go (please stay)
Don't go (please stay)

If I called out your name like a prayer in the night
Would you leave me alone with my tears?
Knowing I, I need you so-o, would you still turn and go?
Or would this time be different in some wa-a-ay?

Don't go (please stay)
Don't go (please stay)

You took me away from the rest of the world
When you taught me to love you like this
Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
But I still can be saved, by your kiss

If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
Not to go but to stay in my arms
Would you walk out the door like you did once before?
Or would this time be different, would you sta-a-ay?

(Don't go) (please stay)
(Don't go) (please stay)

(Don't go)
(Please stay)
