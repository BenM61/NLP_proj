"Let's get the message across
Crazy Christian nightmare men
Don't come here in the house of pain
Or we will cause you misery and shame
When I get you in these arms the party's over..."

6:30 in the morning
Wake up it's time to go
A priest, a smile
Names in a file
Last act of the show
Can you hear them coming
Keys ring cross the floor
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause you know what they came for
And here we go

Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark

Two cops you've sent to heaven
And now it's time to follow
You don't mind they should have known
A bullet's hard to swallow
One last wish is granted
Kind of last romance
Lock your cell take off your shoes
And then you start to dance
And here we go

Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark

Yeah
Someone's gonna miss you
Throw flowers on your grave
Dance your soul out of your body
Smile brother be brave
Five steps to the gallows
And a direct slide to hell
Enjoy your last steps in the light
Before you leave the cell

Here we go
Yeah
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark

Here we go
Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Hmm hmm hmm
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark

Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark

Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark

Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
Here we go
Dancing in the sunshine of the dark
