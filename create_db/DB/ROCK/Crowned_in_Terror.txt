It's not over yet - Consuming flames of the faceless one
There's no time to repent - As you bow before the serpent god
There is no turning back - Festering demons to hatred sworn
And ready to attack - The jaws of death are hungry like a war
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war
The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might
It's not over yet - Racing down these dead-end streets
There's no time to repent - Festering demons to hatred sworn
What we have sown - Is ours to reap
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war
The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might
As we watch the angels die
In the lake of sulphur - We'll watch 'em drown
A massacre divine
Blasphemous locust in genocide reborn
The beating of your heart
Echoing in silence - The sound of death
As your soul is torn apart
A violent cry of pain - Riding your final breath

It's not over yet - Consuming flames of the faceless one
There's no time to repent - As you bow before the serpent god
There is no turning back - Festering demons to hatred sworn
And ready to attack - The jaws of death are hungry like a war
Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever
Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul
Our hearts are rotten to the core
Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war
The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might
