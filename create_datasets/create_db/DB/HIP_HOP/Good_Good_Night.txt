How they let me go and get a beat from kane,
I swear these 808s and snares make me go insane
Ay hold up baby girl I really wanna know your name
And let me be your superman and you be Lois Lane
Its showtime like cable, get up on that table,
I love your sexy body and I know you love this paper
Bottles coming like they got legs on them
The way I kill 'em man this beat will
Make 'em wanna call the feds on me

I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get you home
Girl you better give it up
And we gon' have a good (good) night
Good (good) night (night, night)
Good (good) night
Good (good) night
And we gon' have a good (good) night
Good (good) night (night, night)
Good (good) night
Good (good) night

(Man!) I got an open palm with cash in it
I could be up for MVP
I'm just tryna out do my last visit
Pockets fat like they pregnant
And 'bout to have triplets
I got twenties flyin' send ghetto benji to ad lib it (I do!)
Haha, get it,
I'm so far ahead
Of my time no c-section
Y'all club we v.i.p section
Party bus full of women
Like weed next to me
Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin'
Line full of sexy ladies tryna get with me
I'm just tryna grand slam like the boy Ken Griffey
And I'm at the bar nine shots no fifty (50)
Bring a hundred more
Everybody gettin' tipsy

I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get you home
Girl you better give it up
And we gon' have a good (good) night
Good (good) night (night, night)
Good (good) night
Good (good) night
And we gon' have a good (good) night
Good (good) night (night, night)
Good (good) night
Good (good) night

We gon' have one hell of a time
Girl I am feelin' fine
You know what's on my mind
Give it up (Please!)
This mad in my swisher got me fine
This switch on got my mind
Your sexy little body got me stuck, so whats really good
Girl I wish we really could do what we really should
I know yo last boyfriend was only really good
Well I'm excellent,perfectionist
I creep up behind ya,no exorcist
That's that extra,real (real) extra (extra)
A different type of breed a upgrade from that metric (metric)
Its time to make ya question all the rest you messin' with
I'm tryna tell ya I'm the one to hit the exit with
