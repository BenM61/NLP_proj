Begging, pleading lose your love to me 
It's all that I need 
No fool can ease my heart, my love 
The way that you do 
I will follow you
Lovers on main street

Well, don't forget me when you're laughing 
Disbelieving in all that I said 
When you're lying back to back 
With your problems 
Satisfaction comes slow 
You will never know 
Lovers on main street 

But if you need somebody to love 
Think of me 
But if your time has come 
Lovers on Main Street 

Argumentative, self-conceited 
You console all the love I possess 
But you'll conceal your own misfortune 
Leave heartaches behind 
You can always find 
Lovers on main street
