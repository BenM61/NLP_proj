When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me

If I know she's worried
Then I would feel that same old misery
We've been through so much together
We spoke as one and that's what makes it better

When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me

Just what she means to me now
Oh you just oh you just wouldn't understand
And the people say oh they say she's no good
Oh but she's my woman
And I know I'm her man
If she's got a problem oh yeah yeah
Oh I know I'm gonna have to help her solve it

When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me

If something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
