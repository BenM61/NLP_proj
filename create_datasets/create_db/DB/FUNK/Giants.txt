Pictures start to fade
As borrowed yesterday playing old love songs
You had aces and spades
Dark side and mind games turn right to wrong
Burning bridges, building walls
[?] weak your [?]
There's no way over, no way over
Fray the edges of my soul
Stolen heart you took it all tied up in knots
But the chains unlocked

I walk like giants, with well defiance
Stronger than I've ever know, alone
Gold as lions, eyes like diamonds
'Cause you hit me with a heart of stone
But you won't take the best of me

Know you won't take the best of me

It ended at the start
I kid myself like a fine art for all to see
The story with no parch, just emotion made of glass
Of fantasy, cold fantasy
You crossed my heart, I draw the line
See the pictures either side, there's no way over, now that it's over
Nothing left that's [?]
Underneath it all, tied up inknots
But the chains unlocked

I walk like giants, with well defiance
Stronger than I've ever know, alone
Gold as lions, eyes like diamonds
'Cause you hit me with a heart of stone
But you won't take the best of me

Don't wanna be wrong
I don't wanna be wrong
I don't wanna be wrong
Your heart don't wanna be wrong
Don't wanna be wrong
I don't wnna be wrong
I don't wanna be wrong
I don't wanna be wrong
No I don't wanna be wrong
Gold as lions, eyes like diamonds
Stronger than I've ever known
