All the flowers fade
And all the stars pale
As this bitter beauty
Grabs you by the tail

How long will you hesitate?
Halfway up the trail
Yes, it's dark in the trees
And some wounds never heal

And you're dreamin'
With eyes wide open
Your heart has spoken
For the first time

All the gun-for-hire poets
Who try to sing so loud
Just to drown out the roar
As the bombs hit the ground

And the band is whistling Dixie
For its sentimental sake
Yeah, that's the sound and the fury
Of this new dark day

And you're dreamin'
With eyes wide open
Your heart has spoken
For the first time
For the first time

All the penny wishes
And the trickle-down schemes
And the Cracker Jack box prizes
Splitting at the seams

And you're standing in the doorway
With your hair all in a mess
You in all your glory
Wondering what comes next

And you're dreamin'
With eyes wide open
Your heart has spoken
For the first time

And you're dreamin'
With eyes wide open
Your heart has spoken
For the first time

And you're dreamin'
With eyes wide open
Your heart has spoken
For the first time

You're dreamin'
With eyes wide open
Your heart has spoken
For the first time

And you're dreamin'
