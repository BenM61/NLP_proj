Wonderful lady
Such a beautiful baby
Gonna teach him what's wrong and what's right
Gonna show him direction
With love and affection
Gonna make his connection in life
But now things didn't go the way she thought they would
He thinks God is the devil and evil is good
He probably wouldn't change it even if he could at all

All you know is what you feel
You got to read between the lines
What is not and what is real
You got to learn how to recognize
What you're holdin' in your hands
What you see before your eyes
If you're gonna understand
You got to learn how to recognize

Heart is in danger
Well, love is a stranger
When the fear turns the anger to rage
It's not makin' any sense
'Cause you don't know the difference
Wouldn't know it if it slapped you in the face
Now it's all mixed up
It's all a big mistake
He don't know the difference between love and hate
He probably wouldn't change it even if he could at all

All you know is what you feel
You got to read between the lines
What is not and what is real
You got to learn how to recognize
What you're holdin' in your hands
What you see before your eyes
If you're gonna understand
You got to learn how to recognize

Why should I understand
When I could not comprehend what you say
Just shove it in my face
But if I cannot be made
I'm gonna understand

But now things didn't go the way she thought they would
He think's God is the devil and evil is good
He probably wouldn't change it even if he could at all
