Maybe maybe nothing could prepare you
But that something and that someday always comes
And the only thing around worth hanging onto
Is a love of twisted symmetry demanding it be done
This way, this way

you're always the last to know
Your cigarettes and suitcases
And so on the story goes
You're shell-shocked in your shoelaces
And now that you're on your own..

and it won't be so far away tomorrow
Everybody says cause everybody knows
All one by one in single file we follow
Paying out the drop like dominoes
Today, today

you're always the last to know
Your cigarettes and suitcases
And so on the story goes
You're sweet dreams and your sci-fi sunsets
And now that you're on your own (now that you're on your own)
Now that you're on your own
Where are you gonna go?

And so on the story goes
And so on the story goes
And so on the story goes

you're always the last to know
Your cigarettes and your suitcases
And on and on you go
You're shell-shocked in your shoelaces
Now that you're on your own
Now that you're on your own
Now that you're on your own, on your own
On your own, your own, your own
(now that you're on your own)
