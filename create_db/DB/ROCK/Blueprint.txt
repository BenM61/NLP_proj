I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I clean forgot how to play
But you can still come around
In fact, I invite you down
Maybe together we can wipe that smile off your face
'Cause what a difference...a little difference would make
We'll draw a blueprint, it must be easy
It's just a matter of knowing when to say no or yes
Frustrating, frustrating
Always waiting for the bigger axe to fall
A patient game that I can't find my way to play Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying and receiving undefiled
