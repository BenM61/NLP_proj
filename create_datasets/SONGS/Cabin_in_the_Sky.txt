In this cloudy sky overhead now
There's no guiding star I can see
And I would be lost by each wild tempest tossed
Oh, if I didn't know of a place we two can go

There's a little cabin in the sky, Mister
For me and for you
I feel that it's true somehow

Can't you see that cabin in the sky, Mister
An acre or two of heavenly blue to plow?

We will be oh-so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by

And that is why my heart is flyin' high, Mister
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky

We will be oh-so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by

That is why my heart is flying high, baby
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky
