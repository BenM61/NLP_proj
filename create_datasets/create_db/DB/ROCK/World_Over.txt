Did you ever see a thousand miles away
A man in a room, with what you say
Looks may different are really the same
He could be me in another frame 

It's all over
The world over
It's all over 
The world over 

And a man looks up to infinity
Opens his eyes
to look at me
His looks may be different, his eyes see the same
No borders between us a thousand names 

It's all over
The world over
It's all over 
The world over 

Up and down
Let go light
What ever difference makes the whole thing right
Don't ask where
Don't ask why
Everybody knows you can live and die
The world over 

And you can see the world a thousand miles away
Here I am here's what I say
But we all look different, but were one in the same
No borders between us, there's no one to blame 

It's all over
The world over
It's all over 
The world over
