Boy is it coming to me
Lotta bodies I don't know
Hoped I could get some sleepin'
Hope that they will go

That boy is crying
Forget about the lying
He's not singing
'Cause his ears are ringing

I've gotta hit the sheets again
Gotta catch an hour before I go
Down to the streets beneath me
Out into the crowd below
Take me to the outer reaches
Rock me to and fro

This boy is crying
Fed up with the lying
I'm not singing
'Cause my eyes are stinging

Get me on a roll again
Look me in the eye and flash your smile
Flash your smile
