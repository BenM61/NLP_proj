(Barry)
Nobody knew who he really was
But they called him Mambo when he played

(Kid Creole)
He became the King
King of Latin Swing

(Both)
And oh, the music that he made
Hey Mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo
Did she know what she begat

(Kid Creole)
They used to come in their fancy threads
And he always turned them inside out

(Barry)
They would jam the floor

(Both)
They would beg for more

(Barry)
And when they got it they would shout

(Both)
Hey Mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo
Did she know what she begat

(Both)
Take it away
Hey Mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo
Did she know what she begat
Take it away
Do it again
Hey Mambo
Hey Mambo
Hey Mambo
Hey Mambo
