The night moves keeping me up
I don't want it no more
Until your heart goes every night
The night moves keeping me up
I don't want it no more
Until your heart goes every night

The night moves keeping me up
I don't want it no more
Until your heart goes every night
Your night moves keeping me up
I don't want it no more
Until your heart goes every night

The night moves

There's no reason to hide
You know the night moves on and on
Takes us out of the light
You know the night moves on and on
