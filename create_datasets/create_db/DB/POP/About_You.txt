It don't make me sad when I think about you
'Cause I'm over that, now I'm feelin' brand new
And I learned so much from workin' through the grievin'
Yeah, I found myself when you ended up leavin'

That's the shit that I tell my friends
I won't be tellin' them, "I can't hold it together"
It's just a cover-up, don't know I'm still in love
I keep sayin', "No, never"
All day, it's the end
That's the shit that I tell my friends
I won't be tellin' them, lie

That really I sit at home, all alone
And I still think about you
My eyes are red, wine in bed
Tonight, I'll drink about you
Got Bridget Jones repeatin'
'Cause she knows how I'm feelin'
Crying into my pillow, I just hope
That I won't think

About you
About you
About you
About you

I got so much goin' on with all my free time
Always goin' out and I'm even back online
And I changed my hair, I'm trying Kylie's make-up
Swear it's almost like it wasn't even a breakup

That's the shit that I tell my friends
I won't be tellin' them, "I can't hold it together"
It's just a cover-up, don't know I'm still in love
I keep sayin', "No, never"
All day, it's the end
That's the shit that I tell my friends
I won't be tellin' them, lie

That really I sit at home, all alone
And I still think about you
My eyes are red, wine in bed
Tonight, I'll drink about you
Got Bridget Jones repeatin'
'Cause she knows how I'm feelin'
Crying into my pillow, I just hope
That I won't think

About you
About you
About you
About you
