A strange kind of love 
A strange kind of feeling 
Swims through your eyes 
And like the doors 
To a wide vast dominion 
They open to your prise 
This is no terror ground 
Or place for the rage 
No broken hearts 
White wash lies 
Just a taste for the truth 
Perfect taste choice and meaning 
A look into your eyes 
Blind to the gemstone alone 
A smile from a frown circles round 
Should he stay or should he go 
Let him shout a rage so strong 
A rage that knows no right or wrong 
And take a little piece of you 
There is no middle ground 
Or that's how it seems 
For us to walk or to take 
Instead we tumble down 
Either side left or right 
To love or to hate
