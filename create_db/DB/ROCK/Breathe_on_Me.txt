I been known to say the wrong things in my time,
Stumble when I was in my prime
We cannot have it our way all the time,
And you cannot have it your way all the time 

Does it have to happen like this?
Does it have to be this way? 

Open your mouth and breathe on me
I need your sensitivity
Through the desert and ravine
I see you in places you ain't been
Pass me up and stall me one more time
Distant arrangements in your mind

Still another reason to live
Still another reason to die

Open your mouth and breathe on me
I need your sensitivity

Open your mouth and breathe on me
Sting the very core of me, sting it now 

Won't you come and see me some time?
Now that we've laid it on the line
Linger a while and the truth
Linger a while on the lies
Won't you come and see me in my dreams?
The only way we meet it seems
Oh why lead me on?
Oh why lead me on?
Open up your mouth and breathe on me
Open up your mouth and breath on me
