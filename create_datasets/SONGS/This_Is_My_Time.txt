Oh, uh-huh, this is my time
Oh, at time it felt like I had lost myself
'Cause people try to make you someone else
I had to learn to trust my heart so things can change
I came into a point where I can speak my mind and not feel
I'm living in a box to keep the girl I am concealed
And oh, I finally found the strength so I can leave that all behind

This is my time to shine
This is my place to find
All that I have inside I never knew (I never knew, no)
This is my time to show
What I must have always known
That nothing's impossible
And dreams come true, and dreams come true

Oh, everybody's got the strength inside
All it takes it time to realize
That you and only you can be the one to decide

I can, I will, I know that everything I want I can do
Believing in myself that every wish I make will come true
And oh, it took a while to get this far but I'm here now

This is my time to shine
This is my place to find
All that I have inside I never knew (I never knew, no)
This is my time to show
What I must have always known
That nothing's impossible
And dreams come true, and dreams come true

Overcoming all these things
Here I finally found my wings
Now I know I'm ready to fly

This is my time to shine
This is my place to find
All that I have inside I never knew (I never knew, no)
This is my time to show
What I must have always known
That nothing's impossible
And dreams come true, and dreams come true

This is my time, this is my time
Yeah, this is my time, this is my time, oh yeah

This is my time to shine
This is my place to find
All that I have inside I never knew (Ooh, yeah)
This is my time to show
What I must have always known
That nothing's impossible
And dreams come true, and dreams come true
