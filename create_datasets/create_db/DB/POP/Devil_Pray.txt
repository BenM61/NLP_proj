Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away

I've been swimming in the ocean
Till I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

Ooo, save my soul, ooo, save my soul
Ooo, save my soul
Devil's here to fool ya

Ooo, save my soul, ooo, save my soul
Ooo, save my soul
Devil's here to fool ya

Ooo, save my, ooo, save my
Ooo, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Ooo, save my, ooo, save my
Ooo, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary can't you help me
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

Ooo ooo sing hallelujah
Ooo save my soul
Ooo ooo the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story is told

I said ooo ooo sing hallelujah
Ooo save my soul
Ooo ooo the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story is told

I said
Ooo, sing hallelujah, ooo
Until my story's told
