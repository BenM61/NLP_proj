I have a universe inside me
Where I can go and spirit guides me 
There I can ask oh any question 
I get the answers if I listen 

I have a healing room inside me 
The loving healers there they feed me 
They make me happy with their laughter 
They kiss and tell me I'm their daughter 
I'm their daughter 

They say 

You have a little voice inside you 
It doesn't matter who you think you may be 
You're not free if you don't know me 
If you don't know me 
See I'm not the lie that lives outside you 
And it doesn't matter what 
You think you believe 
You're not free if you don't know me 
If you don't know me 
See I am the universe inside you 
You come to me and I will guide you 
And make you happy with laughter 
I joy in seeing you're my daughter 
You're my daughter 
So believe you're not free if 
you don't know me 
If you don't know me 
If you don't know me 
If you don't know me 
If you don't know me 
If you don't know me
