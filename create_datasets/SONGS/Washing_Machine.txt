Yeah, I take my baby down to the street and I buy him a soda-pop
He's so sweet

Alright now, alright now, alright now
You said that

If you want I'll be the one
Take you out and have some fun
I never never ever ever tell no one
Till the end, till the morning comes

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and 
I buy him a soda-pop
Hmm hmm

Alright now, alright now, alright now

If you want I'll be the one
Take you out and have some fun
Flip a quarter for the toss
I'd like mine with apple-sauce

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and 
I buy him a soda-pop
Cause he's so neat, sweet

Alright now, alright now, alright now
Okay now

If you want I'll be the one
Shake my legs and have some fun
My hearts spinnin' round like a washing machine
Never saw the devil look so damn clean

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and 
I buy him a soda-pop
And he said: "honey, you look so fine"
And I said: okay, alright, okay, alright

I was walking up Lafayette street
It's real empty
And I looked out and it turned into a big field
And I looked up in the sky
And I looked up in the clouds
And I saw this face looking down at me
And it's a women's face
And she threw a quarter down at me and she said: 
"Honey, here's a quarter go put it in the washing machine"
And then I looked up at her, 
I looked up
