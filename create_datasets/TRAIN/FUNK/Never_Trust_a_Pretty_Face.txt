Never trust a pretty face
You could regret it
Never trust a pretty face
It's so inviting
Never trust a pretty face
You could regret it
I've lived and loved
And I've been hurt
I could explain
I've lived and loved
And I have learned
And there was so much pain
And this is what I've learned
Never trust a pretty face
You might regret it
Never trust a pretty

Never trust a pretty face
You could regret it
I've lived and loved
And I've been hurt
I could explain
I've lived and loved
And I have learned
And there was so much pain
And this is what I've learned
When you're walking alone
On a sidewalk in Rome
There he is Smoking a cigarette
You get neat
And you get lost
Or is it in Florence at sunset
Realise it's already too late
Like a lamb you fall into the trap
And you know you won't get out alive
Never trust a pretty face
Oh what a charming smile
Never trust a pretty face
Don't fall for those blue eyes
Never trusts pretty face
You could regret it
A pretty face
Is like a mask
Invitation
A pretty face
Is like a trap
A temptation
Don't say I didn't warn you
You walk across a crowded room
She's smiling a little too soon
She dresses like a movie star
Mmm, there she is
In the light
Pretty face
Misty eyes
Never trust a pretty face
Oh what a charming smile
Never trust a pretty face
Don't fall for those blue eyes
Never trust a pretty face
You could regret it
A pretty face
Is like a mask
An invitation
A pretty face
A rotten heart
I warned you from the start
