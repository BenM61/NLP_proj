You should see my favorite people
You catch a glimpse of gold through their skins
I walk on air whenever I'm with them
They're where the happiness begins
And I'm alright on my own, but with them I'm much better
They're like diamonds and diamonds are forever

They stand taller than giants
They outshine all the stars
They are the love above the love
They're my army of fortune
They win every war
They are the love above the love

They're a boat when I'm underwater
They tame the sharks and they calm the waves
When I choke they pat my back harder
My load is light, my secrets are safe
And I'm alright on my own but with them I'm much better
They're like diamonds and diamonds are forever

They stand taller than giants
They outshine all the stars
They are the love above the love
They're my army of fortune
They win every war
They are the love above the love

They stand taller than giants
They outshine all the stars
They are the love above the love
They're my army of fortune
And they win every war
They are the love above the love
