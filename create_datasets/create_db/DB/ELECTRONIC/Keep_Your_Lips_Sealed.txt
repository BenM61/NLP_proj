Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 
Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your sweat cold 
Don't betray 

Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 
Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your sweat cold 
Don't betray 

Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 
Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your sweat cold 
Don't betray 

Someone took me by surprise 
I was cast among the stars 
Read my lips I'm lost for words 
Felt like just another jerk 
I bumped into rainbow walls 
Heard a million voices call 
Why didn't I understand 
Someone's hand was holding out 

Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 
Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your sweat cold 
Don't betray 

I must have been missing out 
This looks like a brand new start 
Once in a while things collapse 
We can make it better next 
Where's my courage where's my spine 
Made a million voices lie 
Woke up in a frenzy 
Someone's hand was holding out 

Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 
Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your sweat cold 
Don't betray 

Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 
Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 

Nothing 
Now 
Like a 
Dark

Nothing 
Now 
Like a 
Dark

I must 
Listen 
This next 
Brand new 

I must 
Listen 
This next
Holding out 

Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your lips sealed 
Walk away 
Now 
Just do as I say 
Keep your sweat cold 
Don't betray
