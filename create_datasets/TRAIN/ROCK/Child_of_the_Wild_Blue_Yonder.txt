She has the wind as a witness
She has feelings that fly by night
She believes in forgiveness
But it's not love if it holds too tight

And you can fly beside her
But you gotta go where your heart says go
She lets the bright lights guide her
Through the rain and the drivin' snow
Where she comes from she don't know

She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's wing

If you see her falling
That's just a little trick she does
She makes a dive for the pain that's calling
Then heads for the clouds like a little dove

She can't help her laughing
She can't stop your crying days
Sometimes it hurts to be having
To hold on a love that surely must fly away

She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's wing
Medicine woman raised her
Spirit father praised her
Through their love she was set free
From a baby kicking and screaming
To a full blood woman dreaming
With the power just to be

She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's wing
