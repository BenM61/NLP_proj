Got ready for the night and
She's heading for the lights
She see's the vision going
Cutting out, left alive

See how she looks for trouble
See how she dances and
She sips a Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference and

That's what you're coming for and
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You ask her what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips a Coca Cola
She can't tell the difference yet

Oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (She can't tell the difference yet)

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (She can't tell the difference yet)

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (She can't tell the difference yet)
