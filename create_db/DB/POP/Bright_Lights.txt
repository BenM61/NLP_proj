She got out of town
On the railway New York bound
Took all except my name
Another alien on Broadway
There's some things in this world
You just can't change
Some things you can't see
Until it gets too late

And baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world
And maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find something
That's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
You should turn yourself around
And come on home

I got a hole in me now
Yeah, I got a scar I can talk about
She keeps a picture of me
In her apartment in the city
Some things in this world
Man, they don't make sense
Some things you don't need
Until they leave you
And they're things that you miss, you say

Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me

From all I'm up against out in this world
And maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find something
That's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
You should turn yourself around
And come on home

Let that city take you in, come on home
Let that city spit you out, come on home
Let that city take you down, yeah
For God sakes turn around

Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against in this world

Now well, maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find something
That's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you, well

Turn yourself around, girl
Come on home
Yeah, come on home
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Come on home
Yeah, come on home
Yeah, come on home
Yeah, come on home
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Come on home
