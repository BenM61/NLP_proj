Stand here by my side, let me hold you near me
Here where there is love you're not alone
Here where there is love no other man has known
In good times or in bad times I will be there
And I'll take your hand oh, how I'll love you

Here where there is love you will be strong
I'll always be there when you need me
Here where there is love you know that you're in love
For no man is an island and we need love

So just come along with me and we'll walk on together
For all times and through all kinds of weather
I want you I need you
I always will love you

Here where there is love you're not alone
(Never, never let them hurt you)
Here where there is love no other man has known
In good times or in bad times I will be there
And I'll take your hand oh, how I'll love you

Here where there is love you're not alone
(I'll always be there when you need me)
Here where there is love no other man has known
In good times or in bad times
