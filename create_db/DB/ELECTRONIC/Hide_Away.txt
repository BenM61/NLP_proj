World was born in endless night,
In million years we got the light,
The mountains coming and the seas,
Earth and heaven harmony
Animals were born to live,
Trees and plants had much to give,
But when man came there was fear -
Their creation was the tears

[Chorus]
Hide away now, man is comin'!
It's the time now, you'll be running
For your life (2 times)

Thousand dreams about the die
As the world begins to cry
loneliness is all around
In the air a silent sound

Tears are falling from the sky,
Weeping souls begin to fly
In the skies of no return
Searching for a better world

[Chorus: x3]
