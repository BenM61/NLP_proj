Whenever your shadow falls on stony ground
And there's not a hand for you to hold
Whenever the dreams you dream come crashing down 
Every time you think of home
Remember that you're not alone
And we'll be with you heart and soul
Wherever you are

And if you should lose your path along the way
And find yourself walking in the dark
Whenever the ones you love seem far away

Every time you think of home
Remember that you're not alone
And we'll be with you heart and soul
Wherever you are

Whenever the fears you hide come reaching through

Every time you think of home
Remember that you're not alone
And we'll be with you heart and soul

Every time you think of home
Remember that you're not alone
And we'll be with you heart and soul
We'll be with you heart and soul
Wherever you are

We're with you heart and soul
