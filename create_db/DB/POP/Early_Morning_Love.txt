Early, early
Early morning love before I wake up
Early, early
He gives me early morning love before I wake up

On this morning paper, coffee in his cup
(Cup running over)
Sweet things he does I can't get enough
(Can't get enough)
I love the way he takes the time
To talk to me before he gets up

He never asked for breakfast in bed
(What does he ask for?)
He reaches out to me instead (Reach on out, baby)
He knows just what to say (Such a sweet thing)
He knows just how to start my day

He gives me early morning love
W That's when I wake up (Early)
Such sweet early morning love before I wake up
Ooh, early morning love 
That's when I wake up (Early)
He gives me early morning love before I wake up

Just as sure as the sun will rise
That look of love is in his eyes
He's running late for work sometimes
But leaves me smiling and left behind

Though he never asked for breakfast in bed
He reaches out to me instead
He knows just what to say
He knows just how to start my day

He gives me early morning love
That's when I wake up (Early)
Such sweet early morning love before I wake up
Early, sweet, early
Sweet early morning love before I wake up

Early, that early morning love
Give it to me now
Early, that early morning love
Give it to me now

Mm we made love (We made love)
All through the night (In the night)
Something about (Something about)
That morning light (I see the light)
Hey, shines through my window
That wants me more, that takes control
But if you wake before I do,
Touch my shoulder, turn me over

Early morning love that's when I wake up
Everybody ought a try some (Early morning love)
Early morning love (Before I wake up)
I need some early morning love when I wake up
(Early)
I love that early morning love before I wake up
Ooh, that early morning love when I wake up
He gives that early morning love before I wake up
Got to have that early morning love
That sweet early morning love
