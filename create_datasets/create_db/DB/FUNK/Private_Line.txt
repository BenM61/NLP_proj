(Verse)
It's good to see you glad to be in your company
And it's so funny 'cause it brings back old memories
How it used to be and now you wanna come back
You said I was in too deep
You said I was too serious
And girl you broke my heart
When you broke it off between the two of us
Now it's a shame and now you wanna come back

(Chorus)
I can't give you my private line
'Cause you be calling me all the time
A year ago would have been fine
Now I gotta give you my service line
You can call me anytime

(Ad lib)

(Verse)
I never thought that I would get over you
You left me broken down lonely, sad and blue
And it's a shame and now you wanna come back
I finally realized that I could make it on my own
And it don't hurt no more that I'm all alone
Ain't it funny baby that you wanna come back

(Repeat chorus two times)

(Adlib)

I'll call you back I'll swear I'll get back with you
All you gotta do, gotta do is call me
Call me, call me, call me on my service line
I've gotten over you baby
And I don't need that attitude
You can call me anytime

(Repeat chorus)

(Ad lib)

(Fade)
