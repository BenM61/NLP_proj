I'm always late to everything
I'm sorry
I'll send a photograph
I never think of anything
Until the moment?s already passed
I can't be patient
I don't think it?s working
I haven?t noticed yet
I spend my days inside a screen
The more I look the worse it gets
The worse it gets, the worse it gets
The more I look the more I look the worse it gets

I got a car that I call Jenny
I take her out when there?s too much noise in my head
She?s always there to take me anywhere
Just the same way we do it again

I'm wide-awake and never sleep
Don?t worry
I can't control myself
Don?t wanna make another scene
Just wanna become someone else
I can?t decide on anything important
Don?t tell me I'll forget
I've seen my face too many times
The more I look the worse it gets
The worse it gets, the worse it gets
The more I look the more I look the worse it gets
