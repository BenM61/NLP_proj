(Break the chain now, come and break the chain now)
(Break the chain now, come and break the chain now)

I been waitin' boy to to do some talkin'
To lay it on the line, talk love or start walkin'
There'd be no better love if only you would free it
To start the fire, love this is how I see it

If there's a mountain in our way, babe
(We could break it down)
We could keep the tide at bay, babe
(We could turn it round)
I can't do it on my own now
Don't you know that it takes two
While we stand face to face
I'll tell you what we got to do
What we got to do

Let's break the chain
Let's break the chain
Don't fall in love to fall out again
Why do you lead me in this crazy dance
Just give it up and give our love a chance
All the heartache will be worth the pain
Say there'll be no more fighting
No more lovin' in vain
Come on baby
Break the chain

(Breaking, break the chain)

Why do we fall in love only to break up
And if that ain't enough, we fight and then we make up
And boy if you don't give what you expect to take out
We got a chance to fly but first we got to break out

And if there's a fire all around us
(Love put out the flame)

I will show that love has found us
(Just you call my name)
You come out and say it, be loved or be free
Come on and stay and take this love from me
If we can find the key

Let's break the chain
Let's break the chain
Don't fall in love to fall out again
Why do you lead me in this crazy dance
Just give it up and give our love a chance

All the heartache will be worth the pain
Say there'll be no more fighting
No more lovin' in vain
Come on baby
Break the chain

(Breaking, break the chain)
(Breaking, break the chain)

(Break the chain now, come and break the chain now)
(Break the chain now, come and break the chain now)

Let's break the chain
Let's break the chain
Don't fall in love to fall out again
Why do you lead me in this crazy dance
Just give it up and give our love a chance
All the heartache will be worth the pain
Say there'll be no more fighting
No more lovin' in vain
Come on baby
Break the chain

(Breaking, break the chain)

(Break the chain now, come and break the chain now)
(Break the chain now, come and break the chain now)
(Break the chain now, come and break the chain now)
