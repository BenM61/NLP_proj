From the day we met
You made me forget
All my fears
You knew just what to say
And you kissed away
All my tears
I knew this time I had finally found 
Someone to build my life around
Be a lover and a friend
After all my heart had put me through
I knew that it was safe with you
What we had would never end...
Wrong Again.

Everybody swore
They'd seen this before
We'd be fine
And you'd come to see
That you still love me
In good time
And they said there's nothing you can do
It's something that he's going through
It happens to a lot of men
And I told myself that they were right
That you'd wake up and see the light
And I just had to wait till then
Wrong again...

And it seemed to me the pain would last
My chance for happiness had passed
Nothing waited 'round the bend
I was sure I'd never find someone
To heal the damage you had done
My poor heart would never mend
Wrong again
Wrong again
