Now its the mad magician with the ill deposition
No repetition holdin down Bronx tradition
My composition simply squash the competition
Step up and get beat into submission
Cause this musician with the street intuition
7-35 fuel-injected transmission
My opposition will have to recognize my steez
Exotic trees leave a trail of scuffed up knees
So please you couldn't touch this cat with a stick
Quick to inflict tricks blaze up in the flick
Son I'm sick and you could put that on my mama
Exclamation point, quotation, comma
Lay up on the beaches when I'm down in the Bahamas
The skills go back to the days of wonderama
So pass the scama, son its time to get this money
So we can relax and recline where its sunny

I went from standin on the corner sellin cocaine
To rippin shows live on stage the hoes yellin my name
To be precise rippin mics is the light of my life
You frontin like you trife but never pulled a heist in your life
The price of my ice is sky high, I'm a fly guy
Its every thugs dream I really love cream, its in my blood stream
You mad cause I got more chicks than you, more bricks than you
More nines and extra clips than you
Where I live it ain't a nice town
You can't walk around with ice down
Some clown probably gettin stuck right now
Peace to D-I-T-see, Show and AG, Fat J-O-E
Diamond D, Lord Finesse, and me
I'm from the East Coast, this is how we roll in New York
A bunch of rowdy niggas holdin the fort
Jackin creeps, packin heat, these Harlem streets is for keeps
Much love to all my peeps who got a couple of sheets

Yo, most these rap cats don't know
Where it started, where it came from
We been rappin this shit since Day One
Diggin' In The Crates originators
Why niggas playa haters
Knowin' damn well you can't fade us

You better take me out quick
'Cause I'm accurate when I bust mine
And make it count like Jordan at crunch time
Just in case I play Fishburn and double up on nines
You can never make it rain or stop my sunshine
So I keep eyes on these chumps the whole time
Take note of your technique like we scheme on dimes
Disregard your crew, f*ck your heart 
Put a slug in me, it'll be marriage
'Til death do us part
Until then master this art and kill them 
With the pen that's dramatic, automatics I commit sins
Hold my head, but when I've had it I test chins
If that ain't real then feel the stainless steel
Bang'em and hang'em like they did our relatives	
Thought he was the best on the mic that ever lived, negative
Wu-diggity if you with me then say word
Lets get twisted like bottlecaps [and] create like Spielberg

Check the referral, man my whole squad's thorough
We worldwide niggas is nice in one burrough
We all gleam, plus we feind for more cream
You got some nice players they just on the wrong team
Nahmean...as the world turns
Avoid concern we'll set you straight like a perm
Rap apostle lyrical type picasso kinda hostile
Nothing less than colossal, you dig me like fossils
Be the cat with the groovy soul
Lotta rappers out here acting with no movie roles
You know the deal I represent skills
And niggas with bank reels that live to make a mil
On the real that's my motto
To hard to follow
When dinasour perform goin out like bravado
Hard to hit like lotto underworld role model
D.I.T.C. we be them cats to tomorrow

Yo, most these rap cats don't know
Where it started, where it came from
We been rappin this shit since Day One
Diggin' In The Crates originators
Why niggas playa haters
Knowin' damn well you can't fade us

Holdin it down for D.I.T.C niggas stink like feces 
Goin against raw dogs ya lost 
The way I simulate rhyme and rhythimatic timin
On beat off beat drunk flow here we go
Assignments handed out each individual stand out
Carryin his own clout
Phenomenal motions of rap I pose a threat
Foes I put em on a block like a hole in a pin
Lyrical genocide on the witty side
Niggas give me respect due like the pope in a synagogue
Who waitin my odds O.C. far from a fraud
You waste my time nigga so I bagged your broad
Blow your mind ditto with no conscience
I decide the law motherfucker I'm Congress
This concludes my repetoire what I be on
MC's make way for mine or get peed on
F*ck that
