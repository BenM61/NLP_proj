I've been holding out for some silver in the clouds
It just gets dark, it just gets hard to see
Well you told me go for broke
You go first, I'll hold the rope
And make your way down to solid ground with me

You are the universe
You see it 'til you feel it hurt
Only energy
Stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all fall down
You're only human
You're only human

When your words stuck in your throat
Find a love through a telescope
Yeah the view below
It gives me vertigo
So just keep your fingers crossed
Sign your love, can't sing your lost
Until you love so loud, if you listen you,
You hear it shout

You are the universe
You see it 'til you feel it hurt
It's only energy
Stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all fall down
You're only human
You're only human

I get out of the boxes I'm living in
I get out of this sin that I'm swimming in
Break it down, spit it out
Won't drown, won't track me down
I get out of the boxes I'm living in
I get out of this sin that I'm swimming in
Break it down, spit it out
Don't burn it, the color burst

You are the universe
You see it 'til you feel it hurt
It's only energy
Stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all fall down
You're only human
You're only human
You're only human, ooh
You're only human, oh no
You're only human
