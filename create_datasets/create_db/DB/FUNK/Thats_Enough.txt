Baby, if you want me to love you
Here's somethin' that you gotta do
You got to love me
(That's enough)
You got to kiss me
(That's enough)

You got to squeeze me
(That's enough)
You got to miss me
You got to hold, hold me in your arms
And that's enough, well
Oh, that's enough

Baby if you want me for your man
There's a few things that you better understand
I want my baby
(That's enough)
I don't mean maybe
(That's enough)

I want my pretty baby
(That's enough)
Ain't talkin' maybe, no
You got to hold, hold me in your arms
And that's enough
Hey child, that's enough

Baby if you want me by your side
You got to be prepared to keep the man satisfied
I want my baby
(That's enough)
I don't mean maybe
(That's enough)

Every day
(That's enough)
In every single way
You got to hold, hold me in your arms
And that's enough
Well, it's more than enough
