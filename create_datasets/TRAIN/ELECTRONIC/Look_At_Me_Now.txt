I've been caged by you for such a long long time
You had your own particular way to fill my mind
With low esteem, regarding myself
So I kept me hidden within my shell
And it took so long for me to see
How demolishing you were to me

Look at me now I'm stronger than before
'Cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
And I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men

I've been blind and foolish but I was just a girl
You seduced me with your lies and promissed me the world
Now I've had it with you and your twisted games
And no longer will you make me feel so ashamed
I have found the power to open the cage
I left you behind me I turned the page 

Look at me now I'm stronger than before
'Cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
And I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men

Look at me now

I've been caged by you for such a long long time
You had your own particular way to fill my mind
With low esteem, regarding myself
So I kept me hidden within my shell
And it took so long for me to see
How demolishing you were to me

Look at me now, look at me now

Some time ago I walked away
You thought I'd never be the same
I recovered on my own
Without you now I'll carry on

Look at me now I'm stronger than before
'Cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
And I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men

Look at me now I'm stronger than before
'Cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
And I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men 

Look at me now
