When the moment arrives 
You know I will be waiting 
Kicking into survival 
The seas of life divide 
It might seem to appear 
That I am dead already 
I left it all on the ground 
At your feet 
Yes 
Christobel (gone away) 
Christobel (gone away) 
Why won''t you just fall in love 
With me? 
Christobel (gone away) 

Let the temperature rise 
The birds of prey are mating 
And with you by my side 
The instinct is alive 
It might seem to appear 
That I am dead already 
I left all at your feet 
On the ground 
Before I died 
Yes 
Christobel (gone away) 
Christobel (gone away) 
Why won''t you just fall in love 
With me? 
Christobel (gone away) 

Yes 
Christobel (gone away) 
Christobel (gone away) 
Why won''t you just fall in love 
With me? 
Christobel (gone away)
