I was crying over you
I am smiling I think of you
Where your garden have no walls
Breathe in the air if you care, you compare, don't say farewell

Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear that your love's for me
Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear that your love's for me

I was crying over you
I am smiling I think of you
Misty morning and water falls
Breathe in the air if you care, you compare, don't say farewell

Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear your love's for me
Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear your love's for me
Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear your love's for me

Virtuous sensibility
Escape velocity
Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear your love's for me
Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear your love's for me
Nothing can compare 
To when you roll the dice and swear your love's for me
Breathe in the air if you care, you compare, don't say farewell
Nothing
