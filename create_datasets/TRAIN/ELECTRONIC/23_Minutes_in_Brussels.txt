left my hotel in the city
everything was clear and set
you were on your way and sittin' pretty
that was just a bait and switch

say a prayer
for you and me
say a prayer
tell me do you miss me

23 minutes in brussels
why can't they just leave us alone
are we gonna to get into a tussel
cannot take an airplane home

say a prayer
for you and me
say a prayer
tell me do you miss me
(repeat)
(repeat)
