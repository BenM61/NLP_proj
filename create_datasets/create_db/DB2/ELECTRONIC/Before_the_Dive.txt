Never found an answer, never found a reason
There was no talk back, 'cause you could never take back
Different conversation, little adulation
Took you to the bath-house, we waited at the entrance

I hope that we will never forget
Seeing sinners of the night
I hope that we will never regret
Seeing sinners of the night
'Cause we can not, we can't ever
No we can not, take it back
No

I walk into to the bedroom, waiting for the master
It's simple understanding, I talk you understand me
Oh
I wait till its over, when will it be over

I hope that we will never forget
Seeing sinners of the night
I hope that we will never regret
Seeing sinners of the night
'Cause we can not, we can't ever
No we can not, take it back

Now here we are
Another voice from the afterlife
Who are we now? We know we're alive
We call you out
To discover why we were left behind
The sun creates a different escape while we're still alive

Now we'll go,
And know the answers are with us now
Console yourself, we already cried
Do we know too much?
Are these pieces meant to be side by side?
I held my breath, you close your eyes, before the dive
