Our love happened today
You started to say no
But I did anyway
Love made it right to happen
On this very day

No, it won't go away
This smile on my face
It's comin' from every cell inside my body at play
'Cause our love came today

Felt so good
Knew it would
Felt so good
Knew it would
You make love sounds all I hear
You made my year

You gave me such a high
I started to fly
Don't ask me to tell you
Why love made me feel so happy
I thought I would cry
No, I can't let you go
I'm breathing your soul
And it is warm inside my lungs
It makes me know how your face can glow

Felt so good
Knew it would
Felt so good
Knew it would
You make love sounds all I hear
You made my year

Our love happened today
You started to say no
But I did anyway
Love made it right to happen
On this very day

No, it won't go away
This smile on my face
It's comin' from every cell inside my body at play
'Cause our love came today

If we do it again
I promise to lend you
All of my hard earned love thing
And you will be my friend
Our love will never end

Felt so good
Knew it would
Felt so good
Knew it would
You make love sounds all I hear
You made my year
