I'm looking at a rainbow
Way out across them hills
And my baby's love is with me
And I know that it's for real

I ain't got no diamonds
Girl you know I ain't got no gold
I ain't never been a rich man
But girl I got you here to hold

We dance out in the moonlit sky
But it pales beside her light
When she puts her arms around me
Yeah I tell her it's all right

I ain't got no diamonds
Girl you know I ain't got no gold
I ain't never been a rich man
But girl I got you here to hold

When you find what really matters
In that moment you will see
Far beyond our selfish wonders
Love is simple, love is free

I ain't got no diamonds
Girl you know I ain't got no gold
I ain't never been a rich man
But girl I got you here to hold

I ain't got no diamonds
I ain't got no gold, I ain't got no gold
But I have you, love you darlin'
