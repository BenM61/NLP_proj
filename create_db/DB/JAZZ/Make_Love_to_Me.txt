Instead of making conversation
Make love to me
Make love to me, my darling
While there is still a moon

Must I extend an invitation?
Make love to me
Make love to me, my darling
Tonight will end so soon

There are moments when my lips adore addressing you
But tonight my lips are only for caressing you
How about you?

Before the mood that I'm in changes
Make love to me
Make love to me, my darling
I'm so in love with you

Must I extend an invitation
To make love to me?
Make love to me, my darling
Tonight will end so soon

There are moments when my lips, my lips adore addressing you
But tonight my lips are only for caressing you
But how about you?

Don't let the mood I'm in change
Make love to me
Make love to me, my darling
I'm so in love with you
