Waking skies, at sunrise
Every sunset too 
Seems to be, bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, every where
Scenes that we once knew
And they all, just recall 
Memories of you

(Oh) How I wish I could forget those, (those) happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams,in my dreams
(In) Spite of all (that) I do
(And) Everything,seems to bring
Memories of you
