Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
With them windshield wipers slappin' time, And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang every song that driver knew, yeah

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free, 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But if feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
