Who needs the noise of a party crowd
Who needs the records turned up loud
Oh, when two, we two can have a party all alone? (two can have a party)
Oh yeah (two can have a party)

Oh, pretty music, a cozy chair
Lights down low and I'm holding you near
Oh baby, we two can have a party all alone (two can have a party)
Oh yeah

When we are together, I'm like a feather
Floating in the air
Oh, I don't care where we're going
Just as long as you are there
Baby, baby
Me and you, you and me
We can have a party, just wait and see
Oh well, two, we two can have a party all alone (two can have a party)
Yes we can (two can have a party)

When we are together, I'm like a feather
Floating in the air
Ooh, I don't care where we're going
Just as long as you are there
Oh baby
Me and you, you and me
We can have a party, just wait and see
Oh well, two, we two can have a party all alone (two can have a party)
Baby, two, we two can have a party all alone (two can have a party)

Nobody else, you and me, hah, all alone
Pretty, pretty music, a cozy chair, yeah
