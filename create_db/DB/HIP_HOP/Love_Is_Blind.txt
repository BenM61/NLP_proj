Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you

She was in love and I'd ask her how? I mean why?
What kind of love from a n**** would black your eye?
What kind of love from a n**** every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a n**** make you wish he would die?

I mean s*** he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That n**** had the power to make you crawl for him

I thought you was a doctor be on call for him
Smacked you down cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?
That wasn't love, babygirl you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen

[Chorus: x2]
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by your a** and you ain't giving no help

Uh-huh big time hustler, snake motherf***er
One's born everyday and everyday she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your children?
How could you tell her that you lover her?

Don't give a f*** if she lives
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby didn't even know she was your mistress

Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your b****es
Floss like you possess her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the f*** out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip

[Chorus: x2]

I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead

Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up

You heard my gun c***
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but n**** I'mma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets

?Member cops comin' in, watch me going to jail
N**** whatever my b****, f*** it my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about

I considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker

[Repeat Chorus]
