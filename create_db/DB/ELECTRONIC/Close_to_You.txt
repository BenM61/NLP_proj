I wouldn't call it time well spent
Repeating to myself again
Find comfort in an endless stream of moments
I don't even care, about the way I feel today
Because it changes anyway
Something will make me cry or smile
Another picture on my pile

Now I'm standing close to you
It's just something that I do
When I need love to be enough
I wish love could be enough
'Cause there is nothing more appealing
Than the thought that I could be enough

Do you find solace in the sun
Do you consider life as one
Do you believe there is a limit
To how fast a man can run

Someone said you're born alive
Well I don't feel that alive
No I don't feel that alive
I don't feel that alive

Now I' standing close to you
It's just something that I do
When I need love to be enough
I wish love could be enough
'Cause there is nothing more appealing
Than the thought that I could be enough
Enough

I could be enough, whoa
