It's not the pale moon that excites me
Baby the thrills and delights me
Oh no, it's just the nearness of love of you

It's not the sweet conversation
Baby you know that stirs my imagination
Oh no, it's just the nearness of love

When you're in my arms
And you feel so close to me
Oh my wildest dreams
Baby come true, yes they do

Not the sweet conversation
Baby that stirs my imagination
Oh no, it's just the nearness of love 
And you, nearness of you

And when you're in in arms
I can feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams baby come true
Oh yes they do

Not the sweet conversation
Baby that stirs my imagination
Darlin', it's you, it's just the nearness of love 
And baby it's you, and the nearness of love
Baby it's you and all the stars above
And just the nearness of love, love
Love and you
