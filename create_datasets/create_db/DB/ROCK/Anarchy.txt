You break my back
You won't break me
All is black
But I still see
Shut me down
Save me from myself
Shoot me up
Let me burn in hell

Trapped under ice
Comfortably cold
I've gone as low as you can go
Feel no remorse
No sense of shame
Time's gonna wash away all pain

I made a god
Out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king
Of deceit
Now I sleep in anarchy

Sacrifice to the cause
Turn your code into law
Compensate to validate the loss
Take a thief, nail him to a cross

Gospel of rage
Faction of hate
Deviate from the absolute
Born of revenge
Raised on cement
Chaos created government

I made a god out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king
Of deceit
Now I sleep in anarchy

I made a god out of blood
Not superiority
I killed the king
Of deceit
Wake me up in anarchy
