Life, Look, Pic, Peek always print a beautiful cast 
And another thing they love 
Is a certain photograph 
You take the Time, Tide, Newsweek, ev?ry editorial staff 
Over a beer they agree 

The man of the year 
Is the air minded executive 
Who dearly loves to fly 
He was an up to date go-getter 

His lady friend was even better 
She went along to take a letter 
Just to be nearby 
The air minded executive 

Will take off on the sly 
He was a most romantic feller 
And all the things he used to tell her 
About the role of his propeller 

Somewhere in the sky... 
Foggy or fair, 
Gotta be there 
Lightin' a flare at the airport 

Fillin' the tanks 
Callin' the banks 
Tellin' them, "Hold up the contract!" 

Contact!
Air minded executive became a wealthy guy 
And so he wed his secretary 
They settled down in Waterbury

And they commute by stratos-ferry
My, they love to fly 
Even as you and I... 

(Conversation between Tex Beneke and Dorothy Claire:) 
TB: (whistle, whistle, whistle) 
DC: Hi, Texecutive, whattaya say? 
TB: Ah man, I just flew in from the Milky Way 
DC: Well, how's the missis, Tex, can you stay a spell? 
TB: Ah, sure is nice to see you all, oh, well... 
Foggy or fair, gotta be there 
Meetin' a square at the airport 
Gotta arrive 
Happy new jive 
Maybe I'll get me a contract 
 
Contact! 

All: My, we love to fly! 
Even as you and I... 
My...!
