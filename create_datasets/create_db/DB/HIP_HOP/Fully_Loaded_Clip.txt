High speed Ferrari movement
3rd lane switchin' lanes, whuddup?
Brooklyn, whuddup?
Far Rock, whuddup?

While Jay and Beyonce was mmm kissin'
I was cookin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
While Nas was tellin' Kelis, I love you, boo
I was shinin' my nine, you know how I do

I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip

You wann' problem wit' me? No problem, it's all good
I ain't fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Black rims, black Hemi, nigga see me when you see me
I appear and disappear wit' the heata like Houdini

That parry and bullshit'll git cha azz popped
Don't believe me, ask Fab, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do dirt like worms
Smoke weed, now I'm sure, nigga it's my turn

I fire on your azz, dem hollow tips burn, baby, burn
I'm screamin', f*ck the cops, ride 'round wit' my glock
There's my pistol on my bitch, nigga f*ck that box
Dat's how P. got knocked, that's a jewel I drop

But you ain't peep that, nigga, go 'head repeat dat, nigga
You might learn a lil' summin' if you learn to stop frontin'
I make it look easy on three piece bb's, rollin' loccin'
Up early wit' the dopemane

When Janet and Jermaine was mmm kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Puffy just tellin' Kim, I love you, boo
I was shinin' my nine, you know how I do

I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip

At the dice game I bet it all, you hear what I'm sayin'?
Take grand, I form betta nigga I ain't playin'
I'm trynna git it, holla at me if ya wit' it
And lace up the chuckas, we can rob these motherfuckers

My stomach is growlin', they say that I'm wyllin'
I'm doin' my numbas, I'm gettin' violent
They hearin' me rap and they think that I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame

I need full co-operation, man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill, we ain't playin'
I fire that thang, it sound insane
Holla, I got that nose candy mayne

When Jeezy and Keisha was mmm kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Trina was tellin' Wayne, I love you, boo
She was just runnin' games, she told Buck that too

I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip

Lemme, lemme show you how I do this right here
Now the rugger hold 16
(I got, I got a fully loaded clip)
I put 16 in the clip, I put it in, I cock that
One in the head, till it fell
(I got, I got a fully loaded clip)

I put another one in it the clip, I put it back
(I got, I got a fully loaded clip)
That was big wit' all that, let the bullets breathe
(I got, I got a fully loaded clip)
I need a fully loaded clip
