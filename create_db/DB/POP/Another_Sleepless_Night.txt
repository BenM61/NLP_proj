The nights have been so lonely since you went away
I could not get to sleep try as I may
But now you're back, and you're here to stay...

[Chorus:]
Still it looks like another sleepless night
Oh but darlin', that's alright 
Just as long as you are holdin' me tight
Makin' love 'till the early morning light
Only whets our appetite
This will be another sleepless night

Hold me, while the moon shines in through the window
Let your love flow
Hold me, we can orchestrate love's scenario with the radio
Still it looks like another sleepless night
Oh but darlin', that's alright
Just as long as you are holdin' me tight

Hold me, while the moon shines in through the window
Let your love flow
Hold me, we can orchestrate love's scenario with the radio
Still it looks like another sleepless night
Oh but darlin', that's alright
Just as long as you are holdin' me tight

[Chorus]
