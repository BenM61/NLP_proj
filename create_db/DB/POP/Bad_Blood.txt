You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey) now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

(Hey) did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining, now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? baby I couldn't breathe
And rubbed it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

(Hey!) did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
