Somehow we've always been together
But never got together
I never felt the pressure 'til now
There's something in the air
I'm here and you're just there
I can't pretend that I don't care

Yeah, one day I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Stuck, can't get off my mind

I don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Should have seen the warning signs
Now we're running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
Stop me from falling

For you
For you, stop me from falling
For you
For you, stop me from falling

One risk from lying on your shoulder
When I was feeling colder
And now I can't get over
One kiss, a dangerous situation
I'm lost in hesitation
My heart's a little shaking

Yeah, one day I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Stuck, can't get you off my mind

I don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Should have seen the warning signs
Now we're running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
Stop me from falling

For you
For you, stop me from falling
For you
For you, stop me from falling

I don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Should have seen the warning signs
Now we're running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
Stop me from falling

For you
For you, stop me from falling
For you
For you, stop me from falling
