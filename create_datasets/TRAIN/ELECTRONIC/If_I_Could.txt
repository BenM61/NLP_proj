(Seal) 1994 

There's no reason for you to lose your mind,
'Cause I've seen something,
That's gonna change our time.

If I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, I'd make you understand.

Ah...
There's no hurry,
It's gonna come for sure,
'Cause I know that someday,
We're gonna end our war.

If I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, I'd make you understand.
Yes, I'd stay, and if I...I...

If I could I would now.

Oh my baby, oh baby...

And if I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, then I'd make you understand.

There's no reason for you to lose your mind. (Seal&Joni)
'Cause I've seen something that's gonna change our time. (Seal&Joni)

If I... could     if I... could   and if I... could... (Seal)
  ...If I could       ...if I could            if I could... (Joni)

Oh oh, oh hoah     whoah oh, oh oh oh, oh... (Seal)
           ...if I...                        (Joni)

If I could...            If I could...                     (Joni)
            If I could...           Woah, oh, oh, oh oh... (Seal)

If I could I would now baby.

If I could I would.
I would...            (Joni)
If I would I could now.
