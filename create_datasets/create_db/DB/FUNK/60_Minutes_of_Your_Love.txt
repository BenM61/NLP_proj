All I want is just a little time
To make your sweet love mine
Please put all you've got in it
'Cause all I want all I want is sixty minutes
Sixty minutes of your time

If I can't be your full time lover man
Honey do the best you can
Ask and you just might get it
All I want is sixty minutes

Well gimme five, ten, fifteen, twenty
Don't stop now, I haven't had a minute
Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
Gonna tell your Mama, crazy 'bout her daughter
Forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty
Sixty minutes of your love
