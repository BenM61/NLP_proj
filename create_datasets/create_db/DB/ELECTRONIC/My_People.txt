I'm here with all of my people
Locked up with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me

So let's head in your room lovely
I'll follow all around the world for you
And you'll find out tonight, oh it's a world of extreme

Oh, they'll take all our ceremony
They'll never find a happy hope for you
But know that's not the only chance you'll get, yeah you'll see

Oh, I'm here with all of my people
Locked up with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me

I'm here with all of my people
Shut down with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me

Still the celebration haunts
Today I heard it on the radio
You've gone and found a way to get me out from this place

Soldiers on the waterfront
They wanna ship me far away
I'll find my way tonight so I can find my way to you

I'm here with all of my people
Locked up with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me

I'm here with all of my people
Shut down with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me

I'm here with all of my people
Locked up with all of my people
I'm here with all of my people
Shut down all of my people

And it feels so and it feels so good
And it feels so and it feels so good
And it feels so and it feels so good
And it feels so and it feels so good
And it feels so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so

I'm here with all of my people
Locked up with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me

I'm here with all of my people
Party time all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me
