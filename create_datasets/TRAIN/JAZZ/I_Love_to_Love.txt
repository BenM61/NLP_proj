Oh I love to love 
But my baby just loves to dance 
He wants to dance, He loves to dance, He's got to dance 
Oh I love to love 
But my baby just loves to dance 
Oh I love to love 
But there's no time for our romance 
No no no oh 

Oh I love to love 
But my baby just loves to dance 

The minute the band begins to swing it 
He's on his feet to dig it 
And dance the night away 
Stop I'm spinning like a top 
We'll dance until we drop 
But if I had my way 

Oh I love to love 
But my baby just loves to dance 
He wants to dance, He loves to dance, He's got to dance 
Oh I love to love 
But my baby just loves to dance 
Oh I love to love 
But he won't give our love a chance 
No no no oh 

Oh I love to love 
But my baby just loves to dance 

Stop I'm spinning like a top 
We'll dance until we drop 
But if I had my way 
Sundown instead of going downtown 
We'll stay at home and get down 
To what I'm tryin' to say

Oh I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance yeah yeah 
Yes he does, ooh, get down, oh
