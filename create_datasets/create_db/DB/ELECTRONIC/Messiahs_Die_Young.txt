All of those things that I wanted to say
Well you can take those things and throw them all away, hey hey

Because he who points the finger well only he gets hung
That's why I don't to be a messiah, messiahs die young

All of those things that I wanted to be
Well you can take those things and throw them back at me, he he

Because he is only just as good as he who is the one
That's why I don't to be a messiah, messiahs die young

Messiahs die young
Messiahs die young!

They die young,
Messiahs die young!
Messiahs die young
Messiahs die young!
They die young
Messiahs!

Why get in line if you don't want to wait
They say that time is money, sell your watch today, hey hey
And if you've never been to China well the slow boat leaves at one
That's why I don't want to be a messiah, messiahs die
I don't want to be a messiah, messiahs die
I don't want to be a messiah! I just want to have fun
Not die young
Messiahs die young!
They die young
Messiahs die young!
Messiahs die young
Messiahs die young!
Messiahs die young
Messiahs
