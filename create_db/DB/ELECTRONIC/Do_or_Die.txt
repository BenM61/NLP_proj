In the middle of the night
When the angels scream
I don't wanna live a life
That I believe
It's time to do or die

I will never forget
The moment
The moment
I will never forget
The moment

And the story goes on
On
On

That's how the story goes
That's how the story goes

You and I will never die
It's a dark embrace
In the beginning was a life
Of a dawning age

Time to be alive

I will never forget
The moment
The moment
I will never forget
This night we sing
We sing on
On
On

That's how the story goes

Fate is coming
That I know
Time is running
Got to go

Fate is coming
That I know
Let it go

Here and now
Under the battle of every dream aloud

Do or die
And the story goes (on)
(On)
(On)

And the story goes on
On
On

This is the story

Fate is coming
That I know
Time is running
Got to go

Fate is coming
That I know
Let it go

Here and now
Under the battle of every dream aloud
Dream aloud

Fate is coming
That I know
Time is running
I

Fate is coming
That I know
Let it go
