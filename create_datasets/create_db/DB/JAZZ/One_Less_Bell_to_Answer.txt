One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy

But all I do is cry
(Cry, cry, no more laughter)
I should be happy
(Oh, why did he go)

I only know that since he left
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget
It just can't be done

Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him

'Cause I still love him so
I spend each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out
(One less bell to answer)

I should be happy
(One less egg to fry)
One less man to pick up after
No more laughter, no more love

Since he went away
(One less bell to answer)
(One less egg to fry)
One less man to pick up after

No more laughter, no more love
Since he went away
He went away...
