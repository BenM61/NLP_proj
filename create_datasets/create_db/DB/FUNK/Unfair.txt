Hope my mistakes don't make me less of a man
'Cause lately it feel like dem shits really can
I'm prayin' I don't wake up all alone
It's hard to say it so I write a song
But that ain't equal to me rightin' wrong
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
And I might have to figure this out the hard way
We may not end on our best terms
Maybe we should love and we should learn

I don't wanna fight or be at war
With you
But you
Got around the same things
I don't wanna fight or be at war, no, no
With you
But you
Got around the same things

So if you ever fall
You know that I be there
I know how to put my ego aside
Yeah
Correct me if I'm wrong
You said you never wanna share
But now I'm stuck between
What I love, and who I love, and
I know it's how I feel
