She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
(Jump sturdy)
Jump sturdy jump sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool

Jump sturdy jump sturdy was her name
(Jump sturdy)
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
(She came, she came)

People say she used to dance with the fish
Some people say she juggled fire in a dish
Clear day on the bayou of St. John
She raised her hands and caused a 'lectrical storm

She was a treacherous lady
She never met much harm
One day she ducked past the station house
She turned on the fire alarm

Somehow she got tangled up with Queen Julia Jackson
Down on Melba, meeting near rattle street
Queen Julia Jackson dropped a Zozola brick
And jump sturdy died with her soul in defeat

Jump sturdy, jump sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
Jump sturdy, jump sturdy was her name
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool

Jump sturdy, jump sturdy was her name
(Jump sturdy)
She came out the swamps like a crazy fool
(She came, she came)
Jump sturdy, jump sturdy was her name
