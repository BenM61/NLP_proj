Awaken in sweat, my skin chilled and cold.
May have seen my own death, but can't see what I know.
Attempt to piece it together, illusions of the mind.
Dark starts to alter formations of my find.
Fulmination termination of your life to be.
Malignant euseration that the body cannot flee.
Lachessis upon you signing your epitaph.
Extinction of humanity is far too much to grasp.

Malevolent hatred of life, seeing death fall from the sky.
Resisting the view from my eyes,
Receiving pleasure from watching you die.

Martyrdomic terror flash through yellowed eyes,
Purgatoric laughter fills your hallowed cries.
We are all participants of this malevolent creation.

Streaks of red flying through your tortured mind.
Crowds of undead trying to see unheard crimes.
Blasphemy achieving sadistic malicious intent.
Society is hanging on to greed and selfish threads.
Insidious demon debilitating all souls.
Warmongers infiltrating, blood heavily flows.
Ravenous leaders try to determine our fate.
To these gluttonous regimes we must assassinate.

Malevolent hatred of life, seeing death fall from the sky.
Resisting the view from my eyes,
Receiving pleasure from watching you die.

Martyrdomic terror flash through yellowed eyes,
Purgatoric laughter fills your hallowed cries.
No one can destroy this malevolent creation.
