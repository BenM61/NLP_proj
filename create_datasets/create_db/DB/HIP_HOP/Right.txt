Today she made the pain stop
With the sound of her voice
I've learned to live with doubt
And I've learned to live without
But not by choice

I've had enough sad memories
To last me all my life
I've learned to live with doubt
And I've learned to live without
But not this time

Well, I was walking wounded
I said never again
She makes it easy
She's my best friend, my best friend
She's right

I look in her eyes
I like what I find
I've learned to live with doubt
And I've learned to live without
But not this time

We speak the same anguish
When we make love she smiles
I've learned to live with doubt
And I've learned to live without
But not this time

Well, I was walking wounded
I said never again
She makes it so easy
She's my best friend, my best friend
She's right

Well, I was walking wounded
I said never again
She makes me happy
To be her best friend
She says she's my best friend
She's right
