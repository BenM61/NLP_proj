Should I place all of my faith in you should I
Open up and let you in

Cos I fell for you
And I feel well on you
Open up and let me in

I have this place for you
I'll make it safe for you
Don?t make me wait for you now
Just come right next to me

Should I place all of my faith in you should I
Open up and let you in
Cos I fell for you
And I feel well on you
Open up and let me in

I have this place for you
I'll make it safe for you
Don?t make me wait for you now
I have this place for you
I'll make it safe for you
Don?t make me wait for you now

Just come right next to me
