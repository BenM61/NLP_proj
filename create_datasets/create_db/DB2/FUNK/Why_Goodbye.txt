So are we over now
Do we just turn the page and let the story end
Do we just walk away just like we never met
I know we said some things and now you want to leave
But baby, that's no reason to let it good love die

Why goodbye
Why must it be this way
So many words
So many other words that we could say

Why goodbye
After all this time
Can't we try
Why goodbye

Why can't we work it out
Why can't we talk it out a little more this time
Search through the rain and find a ray of hope still shines
We can't just close the door
We're still worth still fighting for
We've come too far together to leave it all behind

Why goodbye
Why must it be this way
