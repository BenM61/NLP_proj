It's a cold-blooded world
When a man has to pawn his shoes
It's a cold-blooded world
When a man has to pawn his shoes
That's the fix I'm in today
I swear I've been abused
Yes, the woman is a devil
She will trick you if she can
Yes, the woman is a devil
She will trick you if she can
She will tell you that she love you
An work out some other plan
Got those alimony blues
An I sure got to pay some dues
Got those alimony blues
An I sure got to pay some dues
And if I run short of cash
It's the road camp, I've got to choose.
