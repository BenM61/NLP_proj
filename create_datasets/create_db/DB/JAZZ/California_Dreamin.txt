All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (If I was in L.A.)

(California dreaming)
On such a winter's day 

Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees 
(Got down on my knees)
And I pretend'd to pray 
(I pretend'd to pray)
You know the preacher likes the cold 
(Preacher likes the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay 
(Knows I'm gonna stay)

If I didn't tell her

I could leave today
