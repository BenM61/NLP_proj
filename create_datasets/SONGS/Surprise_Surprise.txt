Surprise, Surprise there's a man downstage.
Surprise, Surprise I'm in a bar.
Surprise, Surprise It's my turn to play.
I'm overworked and underpaid.

I drive to work in a rented bus,
200 miles or more a day,
Just so that you can get a look at us
And figure out if we're worth you paid.

Too many potential flings
Too many bands to depened.
Over 60,000 miles I travelled
To drink more beer than Al Capone bottled
(and did he bottle...)

I used to live the nightlife,
But now the nightlife's living me.
Too many times I had too many
Because there's too many people watching me
They're watching me.

Surprise, Surprise I remember them all.
Surprise, Surprise we ain't pissed them off.
Surprise, Surprise I kind of miss the past
Surprise, Surprise it went by so fast.
Surprise, Surprise .
