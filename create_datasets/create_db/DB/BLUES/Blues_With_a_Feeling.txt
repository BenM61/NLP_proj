Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
I'm gonna find my baby
If it takes all night and day

What a lonesome feelin'
When your by yourself
What a lonesome feelin'
When your by yourself
When the one that you're lovin'
Have gone away livin'

Girl you know I love you baby
I wanted the reason why
You only left me baby
Then you left me here to cry
Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
I'm gonna find my baby
If it takes all night and day
