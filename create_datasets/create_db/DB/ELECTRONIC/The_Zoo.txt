GOT TO GO,GOT TO GO TO THE
GOT TO GO,GOT TO GO

I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO...I GOT TO GO,I GOT TO GO TO THE ZOO.
I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO...I GOT TO GO,I GOT TO GO TO THE ZOO.

It's the story of a kid...extremely allergic to fur...
It's the story of what he did...he went where the animals were...
To go to the zoo,a dumb thing to do...turned out a lethal lesson...
Logic overthrown by passion...

'Tigers and monkeys and lions and donkeys...make me...happy.
I know I shouldn't resist it,I couldn't,I went to...the zoo.'

I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO...I GOT TO GO,I GOT TO GO TO THE ZOO.
I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO...I GOT TO GO,I GOT TO GO TO THE ZOO.

If you never lived,you cannot die...better to crash than never to fly...
From your shadow you cannot hide...sometimes desire is suicide

I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO...I GOT TO GO,I GOT TO GO THE ZOO.
I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO...I GOT TO GO,I GOT TO GO

'Deadly allergy? not enough to stop me...from going to...the zoo...'

I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO(I want to go to the zoo...)
I GOT TO GO,I GOT TO GO TO THE ZOO!!!...
WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO(I want to go to the zoo...)
GOT TO GO,GOT TO GO TO THE ZOO!!!

'Tigers and monkeys and lions and donkeys...make me...happy.
I know I shouldn't resist it,I couldn't,I went to...the zoo.'

'Deadly allergy? not enough to stop me...from going to...the zoo...'
