Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
The pain of my heart
Can you can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Can you can you feel it
The pain of my heart

Pain pain pain
Don't you feel my pain
Droppin' down on you
Like drops of rain
Soak'n wet just full of tears
Of the pain I felt
When you're not here or around
I start to frown
Face full of tears
Looking like a clown
So you can't feel this pain
That I'm feelin'
If you could girl
You would go wheelin'

Ain't no feelin'
I'm gonna start killin'
You think it's love I think it's illin'
So get it together
Let's stay together
Sat through the storms
And all kinds of weather
Don't leave me here just all alone
Without your love I'm not so strong
Just one question that's in my brain
Can you feel this pain

Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
The pain of my heart
Can you can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Can you can you feel it
The pain of my heart

Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
Yes it's still the same
I wake up early in the morning
My face still streaming
My heart's still burning
Oh my god what could it be
Is it deep love or is it just me
Damn girl I wanted you from the start
Can you feel the pain
The pain of my heart

Ain't no feelin'
I'm gonna start killin'
You think it's love I think it's illin'
So get it together
Let's stay together
Sat through the storms
And all kinds of weather
Don't leave me here just all alone
Without your love I'm not so strong
Just one question that's in my brain
Can you feel this pain

Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
Can you feel the pain
The pain of my heart
Can you can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Can you can you feel it
The pain of my heart
