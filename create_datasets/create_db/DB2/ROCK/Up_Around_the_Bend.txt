There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind,
We're goin' up around the bend

Oh

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon's turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind,
We're goin' up around the bend

Oh

You can ponder perpetual motion,
Fix your mind on a crystal day,
Always time for a good conversation,
There's an ear for what you say

Come on the risin' wind,
We're goin' up around the bend.

Yeah

Oh

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree,
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me

Come on the risin' wind,
We're goin' up around the bend

Yeah

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do yeah
Do do do do
Do do do do
