We know the f*ck why y'all really want
Why y'all want us, right, right?

Let's get it pumped up, pumping, the jump-off to jumping
Hey yo I'm looking in your eyes you look a little drinking pumpkin
You buzzin'? Oh really, you faded kinda early
These my homeboys, introduce your homegirlies
What's your name? (Shirley) Well this my nizzle swivel
He like the way you pop it, like the way your booty wiggle
Why'all bout it? (We bout it) Everybody crowd around it
Mouths hit the floor, all my niggas look astounded
Dom P? Hell naj, that shit a waste of money
We drink that Cristal, Dom P be tasting funny 
You a Likqit bunny, and I'm Hugh Hef'
After Tash get to mackin', why y'all can have who's left
Cause, with this game, Tash legal and all
If ain't home, call me back, cause I've been screening my calls
All why y'all gotta pause, cause we (we) know (know)
What (what) why y'all (y'all) broads (broads) really want

You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best you can

He's on his way to the club, puffin on a dub
He never wait in line, cause he always get love
He's drinking it, drinking up, drinking all the time
He can't hold it back, he's looking for a dime
He say two drinks and the ass is mine
She play dudes like him just passing time
So they hop inside, the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off, and it never came back
She say, "Ay daddy, do you like that?"
He say, "Yeah mami, just like that"
She say, "You know I never did this before"
He say, "Yeah, sure tell me more"
Knock on wood grain, the whole hood saying
You give good brains, I ain't playing
A little champagne, but no damn rain
And the next week it was the same damn thing

You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best you can

Yo, I know you want me little mama,
But tell me what you think about
Girls like you drain a motherfucker bank account
The cars, the ice, the clothes, the dough
All that for sliding down a motherfucking pole?!
I'm state of the art, you still playing your part
A nigga like Tash'll make it pump from the start
Game pump from my heart like oil through a pipeline
You waiting on some chips, you might wait like three lifetimes

Mack and Ro, cracking hoes
Drop them fat back down to the flow
Do it for the dough, professional
Make a dude want to blow his whole cash flow
(You know you want me mama) I know you want me mama
(You want me to be your man) Show me you want me girl
Neptunes make it bounce around the world and back
Make you do the damn thing, when the club is packed, yeah

You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best you can

You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best you can
I can tell you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best you can
