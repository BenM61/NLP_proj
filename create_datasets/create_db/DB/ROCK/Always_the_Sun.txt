How many times have you woken up and prayed for the rain?
How many times have you seen the papers apportion the blame?
Who gets to say?
Who gets to work and who gets to play?
I was always told at school, everybody should get the same

How many times have you been told if you don't ask you don't get?
How many lads have taken your money, your mother said you shouldnt bet
And who has the fun?
Is it always a man with a gun?
Someone must have told you, if you work too hard you can sweat

There's always the sun
Mm-hmm, there's always the sun
Always, always (always the sun)

How many times has the weatherman told you stories that made you laugh?
You know it's not unlike the Politicians and leaders, when they do things by half
Who gets the job
Of pushing the knob?
That sort of responsibility, you draw straws for it if you're mad enough

There's always the sun (always the sun)
Mm-hmm, there's always the sun
Always, always (always the sun)

There's always the sun (always the sun)
Mm-hmm, there's always the sun
Always, always (always the sun)

There's always the sun (always the sun)
There's always the sun
Always, always (always the sun)

(Always the sun)
(Always the sun)
There's always the sun (always the sun)
There's always the sun
Always, always (always the sun)

There's always the sun (always the sun)
There's always the sun
Always, always (always the sun)
