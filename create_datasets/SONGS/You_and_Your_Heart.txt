I'll watch you when you say
What you are
And when you blame
Everyone, you broken king

I'll watch you change the frame
I'll watch you
when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

Bur you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can't choose what you take
Why you gotta break and
Make it feel so hard

You lay there in the street
Like broken glass
Reflecting pieces of the sun
You're not the flame

You cut the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy
It's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can't choose
What you take
Why you gotta break and
Make it feel so hard
You and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can't choose
What you take
Why you gotta break and
Make it feel so hard

You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How you gonna scratch any backs
Better hope the tide
Will take our lines away
Take all our lines and,

Hope the tide will take our lines a,
Hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines away
