More and more
I'm forgetting the past
More and more I'm livin' at last
Day by day I'm losin' my blues 
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you
 
You know how I tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried when you said "goodbye"
Day by day I'm losin' my blues 
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you 
 
But oh how I tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried when you said goodbye
Day by day I'm losin' my blues
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you

Day by day I'm losin' my blues
More and more I'm forgettin' 'bout you
