Don't open the box
Take the money
Take it to the shops 
Where we can spend it all honey
On 90's memorabilia and rock n roll records
And experience the genius of Terrence and Leonard
Send them victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
In the studio for us
My eyes hve seen the glory of
The legend and the story of
Feather cropped and blow dried hair
Clever clogs and Lionel Blairs

And I won't be watching TV any more
I'll poke my TV eyes out at the door
Nail my other records to the record shelf
Enlighten, educate and entertain myself
Listening to the sound of Lenny and Terrence
