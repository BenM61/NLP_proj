[Gina]
The very first time I laid my eyes on you
I knew just then exactly what it was to me, oh baby
But when I approached
You told me you were taken
But I didn't give a damn, no
I knew I had to have you
So just

[Chorus]
 Take my number down, give me a call
 When you get home, I want to talk wit' you
 Pick up the phone and dial my number
 I really want to be with you

 Take my number down, give me a call
 When you get home, I want to talk wit' you
 Pick up the phone and dial my number
 I really want to be with you

[Gina]
I won't take no for an answer, no
Case it's something about you that makes me want to get with you
Could it be the way you move?
Could it be the things you do?
Well all that I can say is that I'm feelin' you babe
So why can't you come my way yeah

[Chorus]
How can I make you understand
That I want you for my man
I'll cherish you both nigh and day
Don't take this thing away
There is nothing I won't do
To prove my love to you
You're the only one for me sweet
So please don't go away

Oh ho
Oooh, oooh, oooh, ooh yeah
Oh baby
Call me
I want to, I want to get with you

[Chorus]
