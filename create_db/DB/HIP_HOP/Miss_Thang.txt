Miss Thang (ooh)

Miss Thang (Ooh ah ooh)
Miss Thang (Oh yeah)
 
Couldn't wait to understand
I grew up faster than the rest
It affected the ways of my attitude
But don't take it as I'm rude

Now I'm fly as I can be
Got responsibilities
But I know when I'm right I'm right
And when I'm wrong as I can be

But it's all right for me to think it's all about me
Too many people tryin' to check, but they can't see
I know you wouldn't want to think that I'm naive
Said I may be young, but I'm experienced
In all I need to know, that's why I'm 

Miss Thang (Because I know I've got it goin' on, they call me)
Miss Thang (Miss Thang, yeah)
Miss Thang (It's the way that I carry on, that I'm Miss Thang)
Miss Thang (Miss Thang, baby)

I meet guys that are my age, but they can't relate to me
Because I'm too much for their minds, and their young mentality
Confidence is what you bold
And my friends are much too old
But I swing out when they swang
And that's how I got my name

But it's all right for me to think it's all about me
Too many people tryin' to check but they can't see
I know you wouldn't wanna think that I'm nieve
Said I may be young, but I'm experienced
In all I need to know, that's why I'm 

Miss Thang (Because I know I got it goin' on, they call me)
Miss Thang (Miss Thang, yeah)
Miss Thang (It's the way that I carry on, that I'm Miss Thang
Miss Thang (Miss Thang)

Miss Thang (Don't you know I got it goin' on)
Miss Thang (And you can't do nothin' with meee)
Miss Thang (It's the way that I carry on, that I'm Miss Thang)
Miss Thang (Miss Thang)

Miss Thang
Miss Thang
Miss Thang
Miss Thang
Miss Thang (Ooh)
Miss Thang (Miss Thang)
