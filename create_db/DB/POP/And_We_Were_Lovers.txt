I saw you smiling,
As if I could forget!
And we were lovers
The moment that we met!
And we would wander,
Content to wander,
Through the golden Summer,
With nothing to regret.

And we were happy,
That moment in our lives,
And through my sadness
That happiness survives!
And I'll remember,
As the tears go by,
Till the day I die,
That we were lovers!

And I'll remember,
As the tears go by,
Till the day I die,
That we were lovers,
You and I,
You and I.
