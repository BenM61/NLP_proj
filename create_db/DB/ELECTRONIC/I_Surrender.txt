I opened up the pathway of the heart
The flowers died embittered from the start

That night i crossed the bridge of sighs and i surrendered

I looked back and glimpsed the outline of a boy
His life of sorrows now collapsing into joy

And tonight the stars are all aligned and i surrender
My mother cries beneath a southern sky and i surrender

Recording angels and the poets of the night
Bring back the trophies of the battles that we fight

Searchlights fill the open skies and i surrender

Outrageous cries of love have called me back
Derailed the trains of thought, demolished wayward tracks

You tell me i've no need to wonder why i just surrender

I stand too close to see the sleight of hand
How she found this child inside the frightened man

Tonight i'm learning how to fly and i surrender

I've travelled all this way for your embrace
Enraptured by the recognition on your face

Hold me now while my old life dies tonight and i surrender
My mother cries beneath the open skies and i surrender

An ancient evening just before the fall
The light in your eyes, the meaning of it all

Birds fly and fill the summer skies and i surrender

She throws the burning books into the sea
"Come find the meaning of the word inside of me"

It's alright the stars are all aligned and i surrender
My mother cries beneath the moonlit skies and i surrender

My body turns to ashes in her hands
The disappearing world of footprints in the sand

Tell me now that this love will never die and i'll surrender
My mother cries beneath the open skies and i surrender
