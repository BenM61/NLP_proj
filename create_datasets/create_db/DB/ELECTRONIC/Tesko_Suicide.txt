Phone me and I'll hang up
Sick and tired of being bubble gum chewed up
Dark lane, bleak house shrinking rose, you're over and out
Tie a cherry bootstring, put your candy teeth in
Feeling up the sweetheart, hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls solo,
Go on girls take a chance,
Go on girls trust it,
Go on girls the truth is 

Cut your hair wear a chip on your shoulder
Get ahead, get laid, get it over
Cheap show, back seat martyr's pose, you're over and out
I'm checking out of my senses, buying best defenses
Putting on the trousers, hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls solo,
Go on girls take a chance,
Go on girls trust it,
Go on girls the truth is
So so single so low the truth is 

You want the day to fit to a soundtrack
Get a story get a life and get back
You've got nothing to shout about
You're over and out

I'm checking out of my senses, buying best defenses
Fired up on free-will, hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls solo,
Go on girls take a chance,
Go on girls trust it,
Go on girls the truth is 
So so single so low the truth is
So so single so low the truth is
