In your houses late at night
Sit down cousy kill that light
Watch a movie watch a fight
Feeling safe as well you might
When you dream in black and white

It can only happen
On TV
On TV
In the bathroom in your bed
Wall to wall we're in your head

Finger on remote control
We are wired to your soul
We got idols we got dreams
It can only happen

On TV
On TV
On TV

We got idols we got dreams
Keep your eyes fixed on the screen
Squeeze your life there in between

On TV
On TV
On TV TV TV

Ecstasy for you and me
Here at home on your TV
TV TV TV

Turning up the volume ''cause it's blowing up your head
Look at your eyes they're going red

Turn it on!
Turn it off!
Turn it on!
Turn it off!
