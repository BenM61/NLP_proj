A buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
But the monkey grabbed his neck and said, now, listen, Jack

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

Ain't no use in divin', what's the use of jivin'
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

The buzzard told the monkey, you're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Fly right
