Razor wire,
Give backs for things we've done.
After thoughts,
Of past storms weathered before.

Oh no! Oh no!
I watch the clouds roll in,
Oh no! Oh no!
It's happening again.

I'll be,
Watching, waiting,
Tremble, shaking.
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lightning strike our sins away?

Watching, waiting,
Fallen, shaking.
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is our future looking grey?

Aftermath,
Much worse than it was before.
Battle scars,
Some are seen and some are not.

Oh no! Oh no!
I watch the clouds roll in,
Oh no! Oh no!
It's happening again.

I'll be,
Watching, waiting,
Tremble, shaking.
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lightning strike our sins away?

Watching, waiting,
Fallen, shaking.
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is our future looking grey.

You can't hide from the dark.
Well I never thought it'd turn out this way, yeah.
You can't hide from the dark.

Watching, waiting,
Tremble, shaking.
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lightning strike our sins away?

Watching, waiting,
Fallen, shaking.
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is our future looking grey?

Hey, Hey!
