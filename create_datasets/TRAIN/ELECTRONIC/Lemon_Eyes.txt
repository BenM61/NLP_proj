Hush now baby, there's no need to cry
Let me wipe away those lemon eyes
All your worries, such a waste of time
You can't even see how much you're mine

You're so bitter, bitter, bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle, down okay
Listen, listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine

Hold on baby, careful what you say
You've been drinking someone else's pain
I can't keep on staring at the sun
Yellow, I will have to bite your tongue

You're so bitter, bitter, bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle down okay
Listen, listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine

All mine
And the doctor said you're fine (all fine)
Just a case of lemon eyes (all fine)
See I told you were mine (all mine)
(Lemon eyes)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine
