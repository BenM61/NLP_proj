Yes, yes YEP!
Welcome to the Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some

Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, unbreakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)

Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standing on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant (the giant)
So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see
Further than I am (than I am)
And I have been trying to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath (Goliath)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant (be a tyrant)
But being tyrant, coming through your environment
Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back
With "The Team," no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyeing that
Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone
"The Dynasty," no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame careens, nigga it's the gangsta team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at getting cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

Can't move the unmovable, stop the unstoppable..

Yeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice
Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get past my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap "The Gift & the Curse" in one session
Ain't no living person can test him
Only two resting in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flipping that raw
Flipping whores, flipping vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changing the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the making, Pistol Pete
Leave competition shaking without missing the beat
Chasing the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, boom!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holding it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and correct I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you fooling?
You all are fagots, you taking it backwards (taking it backwards)
I'm trying to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident
Who was gassing 'em? (F*ck outta here!)

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
