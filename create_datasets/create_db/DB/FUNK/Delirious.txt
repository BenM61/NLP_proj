I get delirious whenever you're near
Lose all self-control, baby just can't steer
Wheels get locked in place
Stupid look on my face

It comes to makin' a pass, pretty mama
I just can't win a race

'Cause I get delirious
Delirious
Delirious

I get delirious when you hold my hand
Body gets so weak I can hardly stand
My temperature's runnin' hot
Baby you got to stop

'Cause if you don't I'm gonna explode
And girl I got a lot

I get delirious, yeah
Delirious
Delirious

I get delirious whenever you're near
Girl, you gotta take control 'cause I just can't steer
You're just to much to take
I can't stop, I ain't got no brakes

Girl, you gotta take me for a little ride up and down
In and out and around your lake

I'm delirious
You, you, you get me delirious
Baby, lay me down
Delirious
The room, the room, the room is spinnin' around, oh yeah
I'm delirious, yeah, oh I'm, oh I'm
Yeah, delirious
Yeah, it's got me in repair, everybody you gotta
Everybody, oh Lord, oh yeah, I'm delirious
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
