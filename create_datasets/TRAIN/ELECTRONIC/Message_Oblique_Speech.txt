Hypothermic ice cubes are melting down
With prisoners from BSA and the Royal Crown
A fertilising agent for the parasitic fool

Spits out wooden stools
A European throwback is spasmodicular

They have balls with masks in France
Place your bets on ego
Won't someone fire me
Curl darling I'm on K hopeless inspire me
A million things to the individuals a million things
A million things to the million singular eyes has everything
