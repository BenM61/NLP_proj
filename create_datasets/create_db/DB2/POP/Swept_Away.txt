I never had anything happen so fast
Took one look and I shattered like glass
I guess I let it show 
'Cause your smile told me you knew

That you're everything I ever wanted at once
There's no holding this heart 
When it knows what it wants
And I never wanted anything more than to know you

I was swept away
No one in the world but you and I
Gotta find a way 
To make you feel the way that I do

I was swept away
Without a warning
Like night when the morning begins the day
I was swept away

And so it begins
This journey of love
The summer wind carries us to places all our own
The words of a look

The language of touch
The way that you want me means so much
And I never wanted anything more 
Than to love you

I am swept away
No one in the world but you and I
Gotta find a way 
To make you feel the way that I do

I am swept away
Without a warning
Like night when the morning begins the day
I was swept away

Away, seeing my tomorrow's in your eyes
I was swept away

Oo, I hope I wake up soon
Oo, I'm a victim of that crazy moon

The very first time you said my name
I knew it would never sound the same
Something about me has changed forever

Can't you see I am swept away
No one in the world but you and I
Gotta find a way 
To make you feel the way that I do

I am swept away 
Without a warning 
Like night when the morning begins the day
I was swept away

Away, seeing my tomorrow's in your eyes
Gotta find a way 
To make you feel the way that I do
I was swept away

Without a warning
Like night when the morning begins the day
I was swept away
We were swept away

Dreaming of you 
Swept away
