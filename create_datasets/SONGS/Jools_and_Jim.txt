Anyone can have an opinion
Anyone can join in and jump
Anyone can pay or just stay away
Anyone can crash and thump

But did you read the stuff that Julie said?
Or little Jimmy with his hair died red?
They don't give a shit Keith Moon is dead
Is that exactly what I though I read?

Typewriter tappers
You're all just crappers
You listen to love with your intellect
A4 pushers
You're all just cushions
Morality ain't measured in a room
He wrecked.

Anyone can buy some leather
Ain't no better than wearing sheep
Anyone can sell luck heather
You can see that words are cheap!

But did you read the stuff that Julie said?
Or little Jimmy with his hair died red?
They have a standard of perfection there
That you and me can never share

Typewriter bangers on
You're all just hangers on
Everyone's human except Jools and Jim
Late copy churners
Rock and Roll learners
Your hearts are melting in pools
Of gin

But I know for sure that if we met up eye to eye
A little wine would bring us closer, you and I
Cause you're right, hypocrisy will be the death of me
And there's an I before e when you're spelling ecstasy
And you, you two

Did you here the stuff that Krishna said?
Or know for you that Jesus' blood was shed?
Is it in your heart or in your head?
Or does the truth lay in the center spread?

Anyone can have an opinion
Anyone can join in and jump
Anyone can pay and just stay away
Anyone can crash and thump

Oklahoma,
Oklahoma,
Oklahoma? Okay?
