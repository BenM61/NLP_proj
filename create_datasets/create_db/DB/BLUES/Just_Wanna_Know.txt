I just wanna know
Say I gotta know what you feel for me baby
Listen
 
Too many nights I stay wondering about this love
I can't help thinking ??? I'm dreaming of
This feeling takes me over, just won't let me be
Ask myself a simple question, what's in store for me
 
[Chorus]
I just wanna know you feel for me still 
I say you trig for me baby  
Only wanna know you feel for me still oh yeah
  
Seems I'm sinking clutching at every dream   
Oh I'm praying things get better than the way they seem  
Though I convince myself that this love is on the run 
I question your devotion it used to be more than fun
What can I do to keep this love alive 
I'm doing my best to keep you satisfied
 
[Chorus x2] 
 
Seems I'm sinking clutching at every dream  
Oh I'm praying things get better than the way it seems 
Though I convince myself this love is on the run   
I needed more devotion cause it seems I'm getting none 
So what must I do to keep this love alive  
I'm doing my best to keep you satisfied
 
[Chorus]
