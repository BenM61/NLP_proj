Serious emergency
Someone come and rescue me
Help me make it through the night (uh) 
All my wanting's got to stop
I need some love to fill me up
Come in close and hold me tight (yeah)

[Chorus: x2]
Singing ooh, we (uh-huh) a chemical reaction
Oh, we (yeah) a fatal attraction
Oh, we (uh-huh) 
I've gotta get some action now (yeah)

(Hey) (yeah)

This has gone on far too long
I feel a change is coming on
That's gonna make me feel alright, oh, yeah
Please release me from this state
Don't delay, don't hesitate
I feel a rising up inside, uh-huh

[Chorus: x2]

(Say) physical equality
Is chemical reality
It's what I need to set me free, oh, yeah
When it comes to push and shove
I need some help from up above
I gotta find this thing called love, uh-huh

[Chorus: x2]

Ooh, we (uh-huh, uh-huh) 
Ooh, we (yeah, yeah) 
Ooh, we (uh-huh, you-huh) 
Come on (yeah, yeah) 

[Chorus: x3]
