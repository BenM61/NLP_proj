You use the love to quench my desire.
You play with me, you play with fire,
I'd give my heart to take you higher.
This is my only one desire.
We can't get along.
And you won't come home.
There's a day I caught you in his arms, 
Seducing him with all your charms.
You know you really hurt me so.
I need you and I won't let go.

Can't get away, babe.
Can't get along, mama.
Can't get away, babe.
Oh, you hurt me so.
Oh, babe, you got me crying in my sleep.
I close my eyes, it's you I see.

You're not with someone else, I know.
My heart says not to let you go.
Oh, babe, my heart is stronger than my soul.
You hurt my head down to me toes.
I won't let go; you make me wild.
You leave me, girl, you know I'll die.

Can't get away, babe
Can't you let you go, darlin'
I can't get away baby
Oh, you hurt me so.
Can't get away
Can't let you go
Can't get away baby
Oh, you hurt me so.
