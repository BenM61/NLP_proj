To TV screens and complex books
My inner world of reason looks
To try to feel or touch the things you see

With a face and voice so serious
Words so detached in spite of us
You over justify how you feel

And every line makes perfect sense
You've long rehearsed this circumstance
Words don't say enough
Silence is your best defense
Words don't say enough

So many years the time has flown
The ups and downs the world we've grown
Accustomed to
Has given us our share

But I never thought we'd come to this
When face to face we can't exist
There's no use trying to find what's not there

You think you've had the final say
But that was over yesterday
Words don't say enough
Words come cheap so don't explain
Words don't say enough

Speak the language of love
Tell it straight from your heart
Take a chance and open up
Let the message ring clear
You've got nothing to fear
Tell it like it is

Open up your heart and mind
Thoughts and feelings realign
You've got yours and I've got mine

Enough's enough, enough's enough
Enough's enough
So take a chance and open up

Speak the language of love
Tell it straight from your heart
Take a chance and open up
Let the message ring clear
You've got nothing to fear
Tell it like it is

Open up your heart and mind
Thoughts and feelings realign
You've got yours and I've got mine
Word's don't say enough

What is wrong with your life
Take a look down deep inside
Love is going back in time
Words don't say enough

To TV screens and complex books
My inner world of reason looks
With a face and voice o serious
You over justify how you feel
