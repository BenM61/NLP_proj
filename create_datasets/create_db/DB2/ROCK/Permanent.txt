One last time
I took a look at what I once lost
Another part of me that's gone
It's too late to turn back

I tried to look ahead
And couldn't turn away
After so much has gone wrong
I never thought I'd have to say

Can't see a difference
Through all the promises
And the lies
There were the moments that we had

To me that always last
I've tried to put it all behind
When I'd give so much to get back
Take me back

To a different place
Unbroken by yesterday
These words so far behind
I never thought I'd have to say

Can't see a difference
Through all the promises
And the lies
