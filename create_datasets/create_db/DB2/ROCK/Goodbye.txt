I told you once, I did
After you'd taught me how
It was never in my beliefs
I'd ever learn to say goodbye

How do you say goodbye?
How do you get free?
I tried to say goodbye
But you're still here with me

If you say you never were here
That you've never been seen
I wonder where wed stand
If you had stayed in my dreams?
You should have stayed in my dreams
You should have made me stop
'Cause you were just a dream
Since I had given up

How do you say goodbye?
How do you get free?
I tried to say goodbye
But you're still here with me

How do you say goodbye?
How do you get free?
I tried to say goodbye
But you're still here with me
