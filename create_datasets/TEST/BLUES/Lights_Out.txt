Lights out ah ha 
Blast, blast, blast 
Lights out ah ha
Blast, blast, blast 
Lights out 

Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 
Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 

I know that it's wrong 
To be dancing with no lights on 
And I know that it's wrong 
To be holding you for so long 
And for the rest of the night 
I'll be holding you tight 
So tight 

Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 
Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 

Oh, what can I do 
All I need is to dance with you 
And turn the lights down some more 
We're the only ones left on the floor 
Let the music play 
I want to hold you this way 
Girl, stay 

Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 
Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 

Sha la la la la 
Ooh, holding you girl 
Sha la la la la 
Oh, baby, please 

Lights out ah ha 
Blast, blast, blast 
Lights out ah ha
Blast, blast, blast 
Lights out 

(Ah ha) 
(Blast, blast, blast) 
(Lights out) 

Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 
Dancing in the dark 
To the radio of love 

Dance, dance, dance 
Radio of love 
(Ooh hoo, girl) 
(In the dark) 
Shine on, love 
(Ooh hoo, girl) 
(In the dark)
