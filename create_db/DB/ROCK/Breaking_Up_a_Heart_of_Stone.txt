Misery she loves you
You're her company
Silent nights you wonder
Why you cannot sleep

Well, I've seen you standing there
But you stand alone
I've seen your smiling eyes
But where will you go alone now?

Breaking up a heart of stone
That chilled to the bone
That left you alone
Yes I'm breaking up a heart of stone

Now I'm taking you home
Full of life, you're still crying
In your sleep
All you pain

All your anger's gone too deep
I've seen you dancing there
But you dance alone
I've seen your smiling eyes

But your blood runs so cold
Breaking up a heart of stone
That chilled to the bone
Breaking up a heart of stone

That's left you alone
Breaking up a heart of stone
Now I'm taking you home
Breaking up a heart of stone

That chilled to the bone
Breaking up a heart of stone
That crushed me so
Breaking up a heart of stone

Now I'm taking you home
You see...
You beg...
I wait...

What time?
