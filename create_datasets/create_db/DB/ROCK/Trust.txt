Do you feel like you're living with a curse and
Are you making it worse and
Can you take anymore?

People don't say what they're covering up and
Are you staring at a loaded gun?
Are you gonna give you what I'm asking for?

Don't go too slow, don't go too fast and break the mold
Don't make it last, don't make it great
Carry the weight, carry the wound
Is it everything you want and more?

If you can't see it, 
I can tell you that you're living in a weird world and
You're making it up as you go along
Baby, don't you get what I'm asking for?

What's the use in trusting more than we have to?
