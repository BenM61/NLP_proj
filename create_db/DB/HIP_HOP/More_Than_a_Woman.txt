Listen

Looking back, reminiscing on
Caught a brother doing bad, and you put me on 
You told me not to be ashamed of what I got
Never mind them hatin' niggas up and down the block, babe 
You held it down and the bills got paid 
She said, "Go ahead baby, do your singin' thing
And when God blesses us I want a Lexus
With a hide away mansion in the Hamptons"

Girl you must have lost your way from heaven 
Could it be for me you came so far
There is nothing like the honor of every woman
You're the very beat inside my heart
Girl your like a star I feel so high, 
Shining like a diamond in outer space
Girl your like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place

You're the blood in my veins, you're the air I breathe
On a hot summer day your like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
You're more then a woman to me

Girl if you take that back, there would be no cure
I would sail there forever, like a ship with no shore 
What makes me a man, any fool can see
You're more then a woman to me

Look at us, living luxury 
And I been thinking maybe we should start a family 
A girl for you, and a boy for me 
Matching stones separate guests, would you marry me
And if you'd have me I'd gladly give my life
Today I'd take this vow to make you my wife
Nothing temporary you know its quite contrary
Just you and me for an eternity

Girl you must have lost your way from heaven
Could it be for me you came so far
There is nothing like the honor of every woman
You're the very beat inside my heart
Girl your like a star I feel so high
Shining like a diamond in outer space
Girl your like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place

You're the blood in my veins, you're the air I breathe
On a hot summer day your like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
You're more then a woman to me
 
Girl if you take that back, there would be no cure
I would sail there forever, like a ship with no shore 
What makes me a man, any fool can see 
You're more then a woman to me
