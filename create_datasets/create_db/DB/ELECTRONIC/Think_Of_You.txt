When I think of you
When I think of you
When I think of you
I need your body tonight.

I got me feeling and now it is part of me
You got me reeling right into the heart of me;
Don't keep me waiting, coz I need your body tonight.

I got me thinking my life it woz ending,
And when I woz sinking I found me a friend
And now you've got me singing I need you inside me tonight.
Ohhh

When I think of you I feel like flying,
Like a dream come true;
Not coz I'm dying
When I think of you
I need your body tonight.
Ohh

With your affection my life ain't the same
Coz its like resurrection; I'm calling your name
And your close to perfection,
And I need your body tonight.

I got me thinking my life it woz ending,
And when I woz sinking I found me a friend
And now you've got me singing I need you inside me tonight.
Ohhh

I got me thinking my life it woz ending,
And when I woz sinking I found me a friend
And now you've got me singing I need you inside me tonight.
Oh

When I think of you I feel like flying,
Like a dream come true;
Not coz I'm dying
When I think of you
I need your body tonight.
Ohh
