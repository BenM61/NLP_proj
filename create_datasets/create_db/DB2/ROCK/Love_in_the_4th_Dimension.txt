Every second of every day of your life
Brought you to this
And I don't wanna let you down, no
But dark matter and your naked body
Fill in the space between all I can explain

Baby, suspend your disbelief
See the seas on the ceiling
And this earthly verse could never describe

The way that you
Let this dimension slide
You undermine the outlines
I think we slipped into higher planes

Oh boy, do you feel extra real?
I'm getting high
My terrestriality wrested from me
There's a summerland for everyone
Three miles up
And a glittering trail of bodies

I don't know why I
Strive to bring to life
A sculpture human hands could never describe

The way that you
Let this dimension slide
You undermine the outlines
I think we slipped into higher planes
Higher planes

Yeah, I keep trying to explain the finer points
But while I'm disembodied
I won't be looking for my voice

And I could go on and on and on
But my darling
These worldly words would never suffice
