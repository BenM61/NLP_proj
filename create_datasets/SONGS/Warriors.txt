I fall down
No control somehow
No help now
My favor slides

No one comes here
And now I'm feeding strangers
Thin air, like cold death, like cold death
Like cold death, here in my heart

I fell for so long for you all
I fell for so long for you
I fell for so long for you

Come in, I'm the ghost
Of the white faced clown
She's gone, gone
I won't look back, she's gone

I'm old, so old
This infection of time, my skin, age
Shows no kindness, no kindness
No kindness to me

I fell for so long for you all
I fell for so long for you
I fell for so long for you
