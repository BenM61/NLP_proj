Fade away, fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away, fade away

You left me with goodbye and open arms
A cut so deep I don't deserve
Well you were always invincible in my eyes
And the only thing against us now is time

Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you
Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true
If I only had one more day
Fade away, fade away, fade away

I lie down and blind myself with laughter
Well a quick fix of hope is what I'm needin'
And how I wish that I could turn back the hours
But I know I just don't have the power, yeah

Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you
Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true
If I only had one more day

Well I'd jump at the chance, we'd drink and we'd dance
And I'd listen close to your every word
As if it's your last, but I know it's your last
'Cause today, you're gone

Could it be any harder
Yeah fade away, fade away, fade away
Could it be any harder
Yeah fade away, fade away, fade away
Oh yeah yeah, could it be any harder to live my life without you?
Could it be any harder? I'm all alone, I'm all alone

Like sand on my feet
The smell of sweet perfume
You stick to me forever baby
I wish you didn't go, I wish you didn't go
I wish you didn't go away

To touch you again
With life in your hands
It couldn't be any harder, harder

Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
