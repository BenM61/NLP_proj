Drug Dealers 
(C Murder) 
Talkin' bout No Limit sellin' dope  they got ki's all over tha country 
CIA  Fedz  tap our phone  harrassin' us 
(Sillk) 
Fuckin' wit us 
(C Murder) 
Know what I'm sayin'  but guess what 
Chorus: 
(Mia X) 
If them fedz only knew  that you were tha one sellin' all tha dope 
What would they do  If them fedz only knew  that you were tha one 
Holdin' all them ki's, they would probably kick, in your door 
They would probably arrest you and steal all your dope, so you should 
Be glad, that they don't know, 'cause now you don't have to worry 

Verse I 
(C-Murder) 
I'm talkin' to them F-E-Dz, police harrassin' me, but let me tell you 
Patna, you'll neva catch me, see I'm under some business, and you to 
Tap my phone, but I'm not Mike, why don't you leave me alone, and stay 
Away from my residence, lookin' for evidence, you act like a brotha 
Tryin' to kill a fuckin' president, neva find shit my games tight like a 
Bull, tank of gas, my bank account's full, word on street, see-Murder 
Sellin' ki's from oversea's, what you want it, nigga please, 
You plottin' on a playa like a money hungry bitch, mad 'cause a nigga 
Went from rags to riches, slammin' cadillac door's, it used to be a 
Regal, stop lookin' for drug money 'cause now my shits legal, if them fedz, 
Only knew bout my deals under tha table, if them fedz could only see 
I got mo' clients than cable, they would probably kick, in my door 
And put me face down on tha muthafuckin' flo' and take me to jail, 
But I'm out tha next day, 'cause niggas wit lawyers and money, don't play 
P-A tryin' to tie to them underground casinos, want to connect me to tha 
Mafia and rino, every step I take, every move I make, you punk 
Muthafuckas Be watchin', f*ck ya'll 

Chorus: 
(Mia X) 
If them fedz only knew, about them thugs on tha grind for you 
What would they do 
If them fedz could only see, how you be gettin' ki's from overseas 
They would probably kick, in your door, they would probably arrest you 
And steal all your dope 
So you should be glad, that they don't know, 'cause now you don't have 
To worry 

Verse II 
(Master P) 
Unnnggghhhh, they call us drug dealers, what about tha police 
Just tha other day my little homie stole a quater ki, from tha task 
Task got my phone tapped, niggas went to Florida, homie got kidnapped 
Now tha game is crazy sometimes it's hectic, make me want to jump in tha 
Benz, and ride up to Texas, and ball with tha niggas in tha country, 
It's 1997, I'm tryin' to have hundreds, stacked higher than buildings, 
Flip it into millions, roll into zillions, off ghetto children, 
Plushed out Lexus, niggas playin' taxes, match it wit tha Ferrari, 
But tha game is still hectic, niggas bout to turn this money hungry 
Bitches, tha Dayton Family said FBI, we call em' robocop snitches, 
Got me stressin' to keep my nerves calm, and I'm livin' in this game 
Like Al Capone 

Chorus: 
(Mia X) 
If them fedz only knew, that you got politicians on your payroll to, 
What would they do 
If them fedz could only see, that you got CPAs watchin' all your cheese 
They would probably kick in your door, they would probably arrest you 
And steal all your dope, So you should be glad that they don't know 
'cause now you don't have to worry 

Verse III 
(Sillk) 
Now what if tha fedz only know, see that I was a southside soldier, 
Hold up, so I'm colder than coca-cola, now picture this, me in a drop 
Top Lexus, on tha block, wit your glock, then I rolls wit tha Tek, 
See I leave em' twisted like a Twizzler, my house have mo' steakout's 
Than Sizzler, but they don't understand man I keep em' puzzled like tha 
Riddler, and first thang first, and worst thang to worst, they'll neva 
Catch me in tha Lexus, I use mo' rental cars than hearse, they don't 
Understand how they had me, but I still got away, license plate out of 
State, in Jamaica tha next day, a tell tha camera, call tha scanner, 
Nigga what, now I'ma get away in Louisiana, that's why I stay more 
Untouchable than tha air ya'll, they had me tapped that's why mobile 
Phone, come on it's time to go airborne, to them ATFs and them FEDz 
Ya'll understand I stay one step ahead, if ya'll only knew 

Chorus: 
(Mia X) 
They would probably kick, in your door, they would probably arrest you 
And steal all your dope 
So you should be glad, that they don't know, 'cause now you don't have to 
Worry, or do you 
If them FEDz only knew, 
If them FEDz only knew
