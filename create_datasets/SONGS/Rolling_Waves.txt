Before we sleep can I hear you say?
For the last time, for the last time
Like rolling waves

Before we sleep to just escape
Take a piece, take a piece
Or just walk away

Given the time can we come alive?
We are swimming, we are swimming
No warning signs

Before we sleep can you just say
For the last time today
Take a piece or just walk away
Like rolling waves

Like rolling waves
These nine hours of delay
Like a lifetime, like a lifetime
It falls away

You swim from pulling tides
That swallow you at night
Let go, let go
Into these rolling waves

Like rolling waves
