Oh oh boy, oh oh boy 
Don't let him sway you away from me 
Don't let him say bad things about me 
Don't let him tell you that I'm no good for you, oh no boy 
He's only tryin' to break us up, tryin' to make you mad 
He's about to make you lose the best love you've ever had 
Oh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy 

Listen to your heart & not his words 
I knew from the start that he was against us 
Please don't think that I've been untrue to you, oh no boy 
Although he treats you nice & claims to be your friend 
He's always askin' me if he can call me now & then 
Oh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy 

(instrumental) 

I tell that you must have faith in me 
Give me your trust & I'll never betray you 
But don't let him say I'm not the girl for you, oh no boy 
He's only jealous, can't you read between the lines? 
Every time you turn your back he's tryin' to break your time 
Oh oh boy, use your head, oh oh boy, use your head 
Don't let him say bad things about me 
Tell him you're no good without me 
Come on, use your head
