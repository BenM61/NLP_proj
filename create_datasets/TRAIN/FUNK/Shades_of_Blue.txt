Baby, is there a world without you? 
What could there be without you? 
For every time it seems you're gone 
Somewhere you've been sighted 
The more you hold me tight 
The less I want to go to sleep 
There's a world of sorrow, want no tomorrow 
Oh what would I be whenever I'm left without you? 
Shades of blue, shades of blue 

Baby, is there a world without you? 
What could there be without you? 
You know, there's something about the things you do 
Oh something about the things you say 
'Cause I've been missing you 
Lonely boy, you know oh oh 
There's a world of sorrow, want no tomorrow 
Oh what would I be whenever I'm left without you? 
Shades of blue, shades of blue, shades of blue 

(repeat & fade):
(repeat & fade):
Baby, baby
