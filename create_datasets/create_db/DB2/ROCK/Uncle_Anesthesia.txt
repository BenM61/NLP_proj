Dusted preacher in the dark
By the river I hear you talking
Strike a match to the western sky
Blowin' fire in the sweet sweet summertime

Eyes betray what your words don't speak
Burn my gaze with sadness
(Turn your head away)
I'd rather be almost anywhere else
One step away from madness

No man's promised land tell me what you may
Saw the moonlight waiting
Wrong to turn to Jahannon
And I wonder if you'll stay
No man

And I wonder if you'll stay
No man

No man I wonder if you'll stay
