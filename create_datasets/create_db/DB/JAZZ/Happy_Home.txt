Last night I fell asleep all alone
Tossing and turning
Waiting for you to come home
As you walked through that door
I felt it even more
It showed all over your face

For the very first time
I know that I realized my world is not the same
Now that your gone   
You're gone
If I've done something wrong
I'd take it back
I just can't stand to see you go 
I don't understand just where we went wrong
What happened to our happy home

What am I doing here
Wearing your favorite dress
I've tried everything
But you just don't seem to care
How could it be
I prayed my feelings were wrong
I just can't believe it
You'd leave me here all alone

For the very first time
I know that I realized my world is not the same
Now that your gone   
You're gone
If I've done something wrong
I'd take it back
I just can't stand to see you go 
I don't understand just where we went wrong
What happenend to our happy home
