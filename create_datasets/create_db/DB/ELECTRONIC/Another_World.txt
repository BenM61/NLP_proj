And when you're hanging 'round 
Waiting on the other side of town 
Kick a stone on a painted wall 

And when the riot comes 
Keep your head and keep your loving charm 
Living life is a glamor show 

But it's another word 
It's another word 

All soldiers have a cause 
Giving life upon graffitied walls 
As a way to pass the time 

I saw a father's tear 
For a leader standing over here 
'Who's the King?' says a passer by 

But it's another word 
It's another word 
Word 

And when you're hanging 'round 
Waiting on the other side of town 
Kick a stone on a painted wall 

And when the riot comes 
Keep your head and keep your loving charm 
Living life is a glamor show 

But it's another word 
It's another word 
Word
