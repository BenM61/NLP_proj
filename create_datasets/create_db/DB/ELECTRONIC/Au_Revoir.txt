Everything you say
Is so predictable, your words don't mean a thing
(Blah blah blah)

Why the masquerade?
You think you're funny, but you'll never entertain
(Ha ha ha)

I'll never be your appetizer melting on your tongue
Here's the simple truth, boy, you just don't turn me on

So! You think you're something special
And you claim to be the next best movie star
So superficial, I don't buy your show
Au revoir

Au-au-au-au-au revoir, au revoir
Au-au-au-au-au revoir, au revoir

Always center stage
Not ashamed to say you're fishing for the fame
Boy, you're not a saint
Not irresistable in any kind of way

I'll never be your appetizer melting on your tongue
Here's the simple truth, boy, you just don't turn me on

So! You think you're something special
And you claim to be the next best movie star
So superficial, I don't buy your show
Au revoir

Let's keep it confidential
Boy, you want to show the world how cool you are
No, no potential
I don't buy your show

Boy, you're not breaking the ice
Babe, stop telling me lies
You're not one of a kind
Babe, stop telling me lies

Au revoir

Au-au-au-au-au revoir, au revoir
Au-au-au-au-au revoir, au revoir

You think you're something special
And you claim to be the next best movie star
So superficial, I don't buy your show
Au revoir

Let's keep it confidential
Boy, you want to show the world how cool you are
No, no potential
I don't buy your show - au revoir
