I wrote a song today
Not all the words are true
I thought you'd be the kind of girl who'd like a song written for you
Turns out it wasn't so
You said its not enough
I guess I'll start it from the start it wouldn't hurt to much

To let the air out of a balloon
And land us safely on the moon
Take pictures of of planets seen
From a weightless photographic scene

[Chorus]
It's a perfect world and a perfect life
'Cause I don't need another friend tonight
In a perfect world but it don't make sense and I can't help it any longer

So then you called me out on things I should have done 
I led myself through all these mazes just to get me some
You know I'm just a man with needs this is a typical disease
I thought you had all the experience beneath you was too much 

To let the air out a balloon
And land us safely on the moon take pictures of our planet seen from weightless photographic scenes

[Chorus]

I gave you your fair warning (x2)
You knew that this was coming all along all along all along

I've had an appetite for this since I was born since me first kiss

I wrote a song today all of the words are true 
I wrote it just to please myself I couldn't care less about you
Turns out I'm just a slob who cares too much about his emotions
Your all leaving me your all leaving me

[Chorus]

I gave you your fair warning (x2)
You knew that this was coming all along all along all along
Ooooh
