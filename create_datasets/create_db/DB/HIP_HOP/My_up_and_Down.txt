Turn the lights down baby
And come to be baby
Let me put something on your mind
Mmmmm-hmmm
See I gotta let you know
That I want-What I want-Whenever I need baby
So you better be ready tonight
'Cause it's on

[Chorus]
Haven't you heard 
About my up and down (and round and round)
You should've known by now (baby)
About the merry-go-round
Haven't you heard
About my up and down (and round and round)
You should've known by now
About the merry-go-round

You said you be happy
With a wife and happy home
What I don't understand is why you're here with me tonight
As if your girlfriend 
Could do the freaky things I do to you
You wouldn't have to time to hang around for my up and down

Deep in my heart
I know I can make you moan
C'mon lets get it on baby
All in my mind

Break down:
I want to hold on tight
'Cause tonight is the night
We won't stop 'till we get it all right
Hold on tight
Tonight is the night
Baby you're in for the time of your life yeaaah

Haven't you heard 
About my up and down (and round and round)
You should've known by now (baby)
About the merry-go-round
Haven't you heard
About my up and down (and round and round)
You should've known by now
About the merry-go-round

(Round and round and round we'll go, where we'll stop, nobody'll ever know)
