I don't know
I cannot see
Who we are now
How we used to be

Is it you?
Or is it me?
Look in the mirror
We are a fading memory

Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold

I will live again you'll see, tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday, just take this pain away

Fatal chaos
Hurtful lies
A broken dream
Is all we left behind

Is it you?
Or is it me?
Look in the mirror
Just a fading memory

Where are we?
We got lost in the cold

I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take this pain away

I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take this pain away

I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take this pain away

I will live again
You'll see, you'll see
