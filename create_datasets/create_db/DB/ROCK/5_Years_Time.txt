Oh well, in five years time we could be walking round a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
And I'll put my hand over your eyes but you'll peek through

And there'll be sun, sun, sun all over our bodies
And sun, sun, sun all down our necks
And there'll be sun, sun, sun all over our faces
And sun, sun, sun, so what the heck

'Cause well be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
'Cause its what we needed to have a good time

But it was fun, fun, fun when we were drinking
It was fun, fun, fun when we were drunk
And it was fun, fun, fun when we were laughing
It was fun, fun, fun, oh, it was fun

Oh well, I look at you and say it's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And shed say, yeah well, I feel pretty a happy too
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love, love, love all through our bodies
And love, love, love all through our minds
And it'll be love, love, love all over her face
And love, love, love all over mine

And admittedly all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking bout them as I'm lying in bed
And I know that admittedly it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

Oh, in five years time I might not know you
In five years time we might not speak
Oh, in five years time we might not get along
In five years time you might just prove me wrong

Oh, there'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go

There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love wherever you go
There'll be love
