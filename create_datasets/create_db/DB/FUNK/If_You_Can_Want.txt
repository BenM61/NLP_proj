Oh 
Oh, you may not love me now but I'm stayin' around 
'Cause you want my company 
Just like push can turn to shove, like can turn to love 
And it's my philosophy that 
If you can want, you can need 
And if you can need, you can care 
If you can care, you can love 
When you want me I'll be there 
Whenever you want me, I'll be there 
Oh, now this may take some time, but if time was money 
I would be a millionare 
So whenever you want me call, any time at all 
And for sure I'll be right there, 'cause 
If you can want, you can need 
And if you can need, baby, you can care 
If you can care, you can love 
So when you want me I'll be there 
(I'll be there) when ever you want me, oh yeah
I'll be standin' by, not far way 
Let your mind give me a sign 
'Cause I'm prepared to wait until that future date 
When you'll want me all the time, 'cause 
If you can want, you can need 
And if you can need, you can care 
If you can care, you can love 
So when you want me I'll be there 
(I'll be there) when ever you want me 
You can want, you can need
You can need, you can care
You can care, you can love
So when you want me I'll be there
I'll be there, whenever you want me (you can want)
