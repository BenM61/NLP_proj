I want you to feel like you do

We have to realize we're all the same family
Slaves no more

We're never gonna be slaves, ah

Some people thrive on fear and misery
Me, I wanna shape my destiny
Some people just survive from day to day
While others dream their lives away
I just wanna break free from the ties
All the things that eat me up inside
Until there's nothing that we have to hide
And will be slaves no more

We're never gonna be (I don't wanna be)
Slaves, ah
Hey

There's gotta be a better way for us
Reality keeps coming through my letterbox
All we fought for of this to be lost
Or is this always as it ever was
I want you to feel like I do
Fight together for the things we know are true
And bring some dignity to me and you
So will be slaves no more

(Slaves no more)
We're never gonna be
(I don't wanna be)
(We're never gonna be your slaves no more)
Slaves, ah
(I don't wanna be)

We're never gonna be (we're never gonna be your slaves no more)
Slaves, ah (I don't wanna be)
(We're never gonna be your slaves no more)
Never gonna be, never gonna be
Your slaves (I don't wanna be)
(We're never gonna be your, slaves)

Hey

(Slaves no more)
We're never gonna be
(I don't wanna be)
(We're never gonna be your slaves no more)
Slaves, ah
(I don't wanna be)
(We're never gonna be your slaves no more)

Your slaves
(We're never gonna be your slaves no more)
Ah
(I don't wanna be)
(We're never gonna be your slaves no more)
(I don't wanna be)
(We're never gonna be your slaves no more)
