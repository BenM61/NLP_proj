Hey girl! i want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And hey girl! i tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me's going to die
If you must say so long
If this is good-bye

Oh! hey girl! this can't be true
How am i supposed to exist without you
And hey girl! now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone
How will i live,
How can i go on
How can i go on
Hey girl!

Oh! hey girl! now sit yourself down,
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And then beg you to stay
Don't go away
Hey girl!
Don't go away
Hey girl!
Don't go away
