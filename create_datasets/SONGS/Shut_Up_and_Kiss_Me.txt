Don't mean to get a little forward with you
Don't mean to get ahead of where we are
Don't mean to act a little nervous around you
I'm just a little nervous about my heart 'cause

It's been awhile since I felt this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been so long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

Didn't expect to be in this position
Didn't expect to have to rise above
My reputation for cynicism
I've been a jaded lady when it comes to love, but

Oh, baby, just to feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

There's something about the silent type attracting me to you
All business, baby, none of the hype
That no talker can live up to

Come closer, baby, I can't hear you
Just another whisper, if you please
Don't worry 'bout the details, darlin'
You've got the kind of mind I love to read

Talk is cheap and, baby, time's expensive
So why waste another minute more?
Life's too short to be so apprehensive
Love's as much the symptom, darlin', as the cure

Oh, baby, when I feel this feeling
It's like genuine voodoo hits me
It's been too long since somebody whispered

Oh, baby, I can feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up and kiss me
