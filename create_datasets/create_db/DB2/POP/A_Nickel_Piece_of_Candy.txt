When you were a little girl
And lived across the street 
We would walk to the candy store
And I would always treat
Little big-hearted candy boy
The candy man would say
When I bought you candy bars
To steal your heart away

Just a nickel piece of candy
Used to make your dreams come true
You'd hold my hand and tell me
Someday I'll love you

Through the years of growing up
I thought your love grew too
'Til your heart longed for the things
I couldn't buy for you
Slowly I could feel your love
Begin to fade and die
Then you found another
Much wealthier than I

Just a nickel piece of candy
Used to make your dreams come true
You'd hold my hand and tell me
Someday I'll love you

Little girl with golden curls
And eyes for diamond rings
You grew up and soon forgot
So many simple things
But I wonder if you're happy now
'Cause when you pass me by
I think I see a teardrop
In the corner of your eye

Just a nickel piece of candy
Used to make your dreams come true
You'd hold my hand and tell me
Someday I'll love you
Someday I'll love you
