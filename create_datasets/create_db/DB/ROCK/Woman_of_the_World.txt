You had it all
And then you threw it all away
You had control
But now I'm taking it away
It's all a game
And I'm the winner with the prize
I've got my soul
I've got my love, I've got my life

And nothing feels the same
Tonight
But something had to change

I'm not just someone else's girl
I am a woman of the world
I'm soaring, flying, riding high and free
And nothing's gonna get to me
I am a woman of the world
I'm living life like it was meant to be
And nothing's gonna get to me

I've got it all
The only player in the game
I'm moving on
I hope that you can do the same
I know my friends got my back
And I love the way we rock and roll, ooh
I know my friends got my back
They pick me up when I fall, ooh

And nothing feels the same
Tonight
But something had to change

I'm not just someone else's girl
I am a woman of the world
I'm soaring, flying, riding high and free
And nothing's gonna get to me
I am a woman of the world
I'm living life like it was meant to be
And nothing's gonna get to me

Sometimes we have to break free
Love's not always what we need it to be

I'm not just someone else's girl
I am a woman of the world
I'm soaring, flying, riding high and free
And nothing's gonna get to me
I am a woman of the world
I'm living life like it was meant to be
And nothing's gonna get to me
