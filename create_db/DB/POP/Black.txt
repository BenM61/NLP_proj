As the walls are closing in 
And the colors fade to black 
And my eyes are falling fast and deep into me 
And I follow the tracks that lead me down 
And I never follow what's right 
And they wonder sometimes when they see all the 
Sadness and pain the truth brings to light 

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't see no reason 
What is blind cannot see 
'Cause I want what is pleasin' 
All I take should be free 
What I rob from the innocent ones 
What I'd steal from the womb 

If I cried me a river of all my confessions 
Would I drown in my shallow regret 
As the walls are closing in 
And the colors fade to black 
And the night is falling fast and deep into the sea 
And in darkness all that I can see 
The frightened and the weak 
Are forced to cling to mistakes they know nothing of 
At mercy are the meek 

[Chorus]
