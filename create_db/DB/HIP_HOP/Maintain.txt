I'm surrounded, by psychopathic, little fellas
Ghetto dwellas
With ammunition in their cellas
And no remorse in their hearts

When the shit starts it don't end
Until somebody's gone with the wind
And I'm tryin' to keep a level head so instead
Of goin' out to die, I write rhymes on my bed

And little kids at the playground
Better stay down
Keep duckin'
'Cause somebody else is buckin'

Don't seem to be no relief from the beef
Only nigga round my way without the gold teeth
And the gold chain, with the whole name on my neck
Jewelries your worse enemy without a tech

I'm tryin' to maintain, but it ain't workin'
Niggas keep lurkin'
Through the darkness I see the Grim Reaper smirkin'
Could it be that he's smilin' at me

Not tryin' to see fatal injury, injury
What must I do to avoid the pain
It seems insane, but I gotta maintain

I can feel the pressure on my brain
Feel the strain
But I gotta maintain

[Chorus]
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to maintain
Be able to maintain
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to, be able to
Be able to maintain
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to maintain
Be able to maintain
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to, be able to
Be able to maintain

Lord Digga
Back in the days I use to do a little dirt
Now that's comin' back around, and man it hurts
To see everbody gettin' on
But I got to wait cause of the things I done wrong
In my life, I regret it
But the man upstairs won't let me forget it
Everytime I think of doin' somethin' right
Here see
