Just sitting here
Alone and downhearted
I should be out somewhere tonight
Having a party

I don't know why
I sit and cry
My eyes out for you, boy

I should go out
And have some fun
Forget about you, boy

Are you never comin' home
??????? If you're ever comin' home

If you want me
You gotta come home and get me
But if you don't want me
Send a card, sayin' forget me

I don't know why I keep hanging on
Waiting for you, boy
But here I sit, a crazy fool
For waitin' for you, boy

Are you never comin' home
Won't you come on home
If you're ever comin' home

I never knew what made you tick
You make me so crazy for (?????)
So how ??????, never complain
Come home and explain, boy

Are you never comin' home
Bring it on home
If you're ever comin' home
