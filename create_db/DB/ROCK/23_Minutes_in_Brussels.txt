Left my hotel in the city
Everything was clear and set
You were on your way and sittin' pretty
That was just a bait and switch

Say a prayer
For you and me
Say a prayer
Tell me do you miss me

23 minutes in brussels
Why can't they just leave us alone
Are we gonna to get into a tussel
Cannot take an airplane home

Say a prayer
For you and me
Say a prayer
Tell me do you miss me
