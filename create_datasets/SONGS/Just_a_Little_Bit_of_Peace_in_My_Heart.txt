The rainbow hides no treasure
Oh believe me it's not true
And there ain't no mixture
That will give you back your youth
No mystic machine that makes the sand turn to gold
Like there ain't no magic word
That holds you back from getting old

I catch a branch
And I break it in my hands
Like you broke my heart
Oh I still can't understand
No mysterious mixture
Can heal the wound you've made
Only time will bring peace to me
And now I just hate

Oh I'll break up and I give it all up
No more lies, no more rainbow treasures
No more fairy tales, no more games for me
It's my life, my life, a pleasure

There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part

There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part

I catch a branch
And I break it in my hands
Like you broke my heart
Oh I still can't understand
No mysterious mixture
Can heal the wound you've made
Only time will bring peace to me
And now I just hate

Oh I'll break up and I give it all up
No more lies, no more rainbow treasures
No more fairy tales, no more games for me
It's my life, my life, a pleasure

There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part

There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part

The time rolls by, the days go by
When will I learn to stop wondering why
Despairing I'm going down on my knees
I'm begging, begging, begging, oh please

There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part

There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part
