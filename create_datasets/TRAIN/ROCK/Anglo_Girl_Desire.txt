When you're walking down the street
You never know I'm around
But I am there and I'm watching
Everywhere you go
I'm the eye from outer space
And my hand is on your life
Your eyes reflect reflections
Of fires burning in my heart

Hey Dog
At night you hear my screams
From my distant lonely world
You feel my eyes touch yours
So lightly now
You can't be there where I am
Cos I'm there al by myself
Location 999
End of the night

Hey girl I watched you dancing
To the rocking bands
I have seen you do the Pop
And the moving change
You will never be the same
When your eyes meet mine
I'll be ready to show you
What you need to live

You know my love is more
For the ice and snow
And the night times and the fire
Burning in your mind
I will be there in the dawn
When you come to the end
Cos I'm the living eye
And my hand is on your life
