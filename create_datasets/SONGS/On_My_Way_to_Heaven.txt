You always laugh
when I cry
I'm always looking to tomorrow
as you mourn the days gone by
You always stepped
on my toes
Took my guide in hand of love
is helping everywhere you go
I'm always wrong
you're always right
But I can see right through the lies
Till the never changing light

Rain on me
my arms are cold
I want to get home
but there's water on the road
And if I do
you will not change
I'm just a singing satellite

and another dirty strange.

I want to laugh
I want to smile

Get your arms inside my head
and stop me thinking for a while
I'm just a fool
I'm gonna sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am the king

The king
The king of everything and nothing
I'm on my way to heaven

I'm always here
I'm in denial
When there's nothing left between us
I will stay another while
You know you're free
You've got your wings
And I am just another angel
With a voice who wants to sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All mighty
I'm on my way to heaven
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on my way to heaven

I want to cry
I want to steal
A little ray of perfect sunshine
From the sun above your head
I want to laugh
I want to smile
Get your arms inside my head
Stop me thinking through our love
I'm just a fool
Oh I'm gonna sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am the king
The king
The king of everything and nothing
I'm on my way to heaven
