Mister Christopher Columbus
Sailed the sea without a compass
When his men began a rumpus
Up spoke, Christopher Columbus

There is land somewhere
Until we get there
We will not go wrong
If we sing, swing a song

Since the world is round
We'll be safe and sound
'Til our goal is found
We'll just keep rhythm bound

Soon the crew was makin merry 
Then came a yell, let's drink to Isabelle
Hum, bring the rum, ho hum

No more mutiny what a time at sea
With di plo ma cy
Christy made his to ry

Mister Christopher Columbus
He used rhythm as a compass
Music ended all the rumpus
Wise old Christopher Columbus
