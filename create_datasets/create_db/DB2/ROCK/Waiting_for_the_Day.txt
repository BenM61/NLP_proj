I guess I had no reason, talking to you that way 
It's just so unexpected, seeing you here today 
Why now? Has it been long enough, for all the hurt to fade 
Oh, how I'm waiting for the day 

I guess I have no business, asking who you're hanging around 
You like to keep your secrets, it's a lesson I've learnt now 
But don't act like I feel nothing for you, and everything's ok 
Oh, how I'm waiting for the day 

Seems that you've been kind enough, to spare my innocence 
And let me keep my illusions safe from harm 
To think when friends revealed the truth I'd leap to your defense 
Strange the way the cruelest cuts have come 

It's late I guess I'll be going, but don't expect me to wish you well 
There's too much gone between us, whatever's left now I can't tell 
But I know, there'll be a time when I won't crumble like today 
No I, won't feel like screaming out should I see you glance my way 
Yes I might find some bright new future that you can't steal away 
Oh, how I'm waiting for the day 
Oh, how I'm waiting for the day 

Oh, how I'm waiting for the day.
