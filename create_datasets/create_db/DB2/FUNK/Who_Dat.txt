Who dat I see laughing all alone
Who dat I see faraway from home
I guess that's me, it must be me
Who dat I see racing for the sun

Who dat said ain't never gonna own no-one
I guess that's me, it must be me
You know I paid my dues
Every time I got a little good news

Feeling I'm hot gonna take my shot
Now how does that sit with you
Who dat I see running by my side
Who dat coming along just for the ride

It must be you, it must be you
Who dat I see getting too much love
Who dat never know when he's got enough
I guess that's me and it must be you

You know I paid my dues
Every time I got a little good news
Feeling I'm hot gonna take my shot
Now how does that sit with you

Who dat, I say who dat
Who dat, I say who dat
Who dat, I say who dat
Who dat, I say who dat...
