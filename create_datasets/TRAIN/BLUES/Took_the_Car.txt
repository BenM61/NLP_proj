I took the car and drove off to the hills
Saw the flashing lights and saw them die
I left behind society that kills
Me and Nancy waved them all goodbye

I took the car, the sun was going down
Saw the changing colors of the sky
An old apache canyon our camp-ground
Me and Nancy running hand in hand

Took the car and drove off to the hills
Took it back and made of it a fire
To be a child again would be so good
Me and Nancy warm in our desire

Took the car and drove it everywhere
Through the land where all the west began
Desert wind was blowing in our hair
Me and Nancy running hand in hand
