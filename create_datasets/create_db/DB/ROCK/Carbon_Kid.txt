You're carbon kid with a sinister diagram

We're leaving the ground

We're leaving the ground
Image image
We're leaving the ground

Image image
We'll never be found
Image image
We'll never be found
Image image
We'll never be found

You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
With a sinister diagram
Sinister diagram

And when this half is over
And we crave our second skin
We could compliment each other
On the state that we are in
And when we leave this place forever
And we're floating out in space
Take an easy route to heaven
With a smile upon your face

You're a carbon kid
With a sinister diagram

You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram

Sinister diagram

You're a carbon kind with a sinister diagram
