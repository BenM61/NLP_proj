Well, I'm on my way
To the city lights,
To the pretty face 
That shines her light on the city nights
And I gotta catch a noon train,
I gotta be there on time.
Oh, it feels so good to know she waits at the end of the line.

Sweet, sweet city woman,
I can see your face, I can hear your voice,
I can almost touch you.
Sweet, sweet city woman,
And the banjo and me, we got a feel for singing, yeah, yeah.

Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, c'est bon, bon
Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, bon, bon.
Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, c'est bon, bon
Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, bon, bon.

So long, ma.
So long, pa.
So long, neighbors and friends.

Like a country morning,
All snuggled in dew,
Ah, she's got a way to make a man feel shiny and new
And she sing in the evening
Old, familiar tunes
And she feeds me love and tenderness and macaroons.

Sweet, sweet city woman,
I can see your face, I can hear your voice,
I can almost touch you.
Sweet, sweet city woman,
And the banjo and me, we got a feel for singing.

Sweet, sweet city woman
Oh she's my sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman.
Sweet, sweet city woman
oh my sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman.
Everybody.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman 
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman.
