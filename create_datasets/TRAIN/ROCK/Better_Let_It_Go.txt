Gotta pull me out
Of this rut I'm in
I've got to see the light
Before it gets too dim

To face it is the only way
To fight and stay ahead
Of the games that we play

I'm the one that's losin' losin' out
I'm the one that's choosin' and runnin' out

You better let it go
All those dreams you thought you could do
You better let it go
All those dreams you wanted to do

You better let it go
Let your dreams unfold
Do what you want
You better let it go
You can let go

Gotta pull away from the way I've been
To stay the same would be a big mistake
To see the truth for what it is
Instead of tellin' myself that's the way it is

I'm the one that's losin' losin' out
I'm the one that's choosin' and runnin' out

You better let it go
All those dreams you thought you could do
You better let it go
All those dreams you wanted to do

You better let it go
Let your dreams unfold
Do what you want
You better let it go
You can let go

Make no mistake
There's a life to be lived
Make no mistake
There's so much one can give
And all that it takes
Is someone to forgive

I'm the one that's losin' losin' out
I'm the one that's choosin' and runnin' out

You better let it go
All those dreams you thought you could do
You better let it go
All those dreams you wanted to do

You better let it go
Let your dreams unfold
Do what you want
You better let it go
You can let go

Gotta move me out
Of this rut I'm in
I've got to see the light
Before it gets too dim

Gotta move away from the way I've been
To stay the same would be a big mistake

You better let it go
You better let it go
You better let it go
