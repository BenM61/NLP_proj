And irony is okay, I suppose
Culture is to blame
You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
You lack substance when you say 
Something like, "Oh, what a shame"
It's just a self-referential way 
That stops you havin' to be human
I'm assumin' you'll balloon 
When you remove the dirty spoon 
And start consumin' like a human 
That's what I am assumin'

I'm sure that you're not just another girl
I'm sure that you're gonna say that that I was sexist
I feel like you're runnin' out 
Of all the things I liked you for

Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
'Cause it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

And why would you believe you could control how you're perceived
When at you're best you're intermediately versed in your own feelings?
Keep on putting off conceiving
It's only you that you're deceiving
Oh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it

Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
'Cause it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

I'm just pissed off because you pied me off
After your show when you let go of my hand
In front of some sket who wanted to bitch
