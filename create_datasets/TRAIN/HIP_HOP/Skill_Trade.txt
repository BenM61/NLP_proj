Together we're coolin', the mic we're rulin'
Suckers we're schoolin', you better stop booin'
Skill trade (we know what we doin')

My name is Greg Nice I like to swing
Went to Canal Street I bought the dookie rings
After that, I bought a fur
Then I went to see the lady for a manicure
Cut my nails down low and my rings was glowin'
Around my neck the dookie ropes was showin'
Went outside, to the BM ride
With the VVS rims on all fo' sides
I was, butter soft had on fresh gear
Kickin' it live to the girl in the air
Baby doll, when can we hang?
You got my number, give me a rang
Called me up yo, late one night
Let's get busy 'cause the time was right
You know what she wanted, she wanted to do (What? What?)
Yo she wanted to date (what?) she wanted to ooh!
Took her to the movies, I took her to dinner
Told her I'm a vet, I ain't no beginner
Grabbed her hand and said, "Let's catch a cab
Baby don't worry I'll pay the tab"
Dug in my pockets, for the gusto
Big bills, had nothin' low

The S to the M double-O T-H'er
B-E-E no time to waste
Ah right about now I'm gonna reminisce
Of how a fly MC became a rap-ologist
Around the time when Chubby Checker, invented "The Twist"
I used to play spin the bottle, run catch and kiss
Smooth Bee's my name, that's what I said
I got a blue Mercedes, a big brass bed
I live on a hill overlookin' a view
And I came here tonight just to rock for you
So let's a rock y'all, and get down
Let's take a trip on a funky merry-go-round
You see, round and around and around we go
And when the funky beat stops everybody will know
'Cause there's a time and a place where we'll all have fun
And Smooth Bee will be your number one
Master of Ceremonies and you must admit
That I was, born and raised to make top hits
So vicious, malicious, and very discrete
I have mystical powers I perform any fete
I'm gonna be ranked at the top of my field
I'm gonna see my name in the Rappers Guild
With all the other rappers, who want to be known
I'll be boastin' with a gold-tone microphone
'Cause I'm death-defyin, never caught lyin'
Not a female's love I'm ever caught buyin'
Get so much sex that I might explode
And on a sperm count scale I'm an overload

Together we're coolin', the mic we're rulin'
Suckers we're schoolin', you better stop booin'
Skill trade (we know what we doin')

Yo, I'm a trooper, and I do loopers
I do stunts and I smoke blunts
Forty ounce of private stizzinock
Standin' on the corner, holdin' my jizzinock
Watching all the girls, pass!
Boy she got a big! (Ooh ooh)
Hey, baby, whatcha eatin?
Looks to me, like you be beefin'
Sneakin' by I saw you peepin'
Did you think Greg Nice was sleepin'?
I'm not rich like Donald Trump
And I don't have no big fat lump
Slouch, only on the couch
And if you fight me girl I will say ouch
(Ah yeah!)

Together we're coolin', the mic we're rulin'
Suckers we're schoolin', you better stop booin'
Skill trade (we know what we doin')

Smooth Bee guaranteed to make a mic sing
I'm Smooth Bee I'm guaranteed, to give you what you need
Not a sip not a swallow but the whole damn bottle
Got a lot of juice but my girl cut me loose
For a sucker with cazals and plate named Bruce
Little did she know that I'm choice and not moist
Undisputed rapper with a golden voice
An entrepreneur, undercover love
Man of the world with my life to explore
Minks socks leather suits shirts made of velour
Smooth articulate entertainer MC
I'm rappin' to a funky beat, my dialogue's unique
Every time she sees me she offers me a skeeze
She says, "Please Smooth Bee, please, please!
Let me ride in your blue Mercedes"
I taunt and tease as she drops to her knees
And I let her wipe my nose every time that I sneeze
 we know what we doin'!

Together we're coolin', the mic we're rulin'
Suckers we're schoolin', you better stop booin'
Skill trade (we know what we doin')

A skill trade
We know what we doin'
A skill trade 
We know what we doin'

Teddy Ted down with the skill trade
Slice and dice, he must get paid
Sip iced tea, and lay in the shade
You gaze be dazed as he will amaze
