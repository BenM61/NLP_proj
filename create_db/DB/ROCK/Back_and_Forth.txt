You keep on sayin' it's my fault
But I've been runnin' back and forth
Hiding the keys to your vault
I'll have you running back and forth, back and forth

Give it up for all the times that I thought
I'm in luck from banging on this hollow door
Give it up for all the times that I've drawn short
I know, oh, I know but

You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk

We could go back to my world
So I'm not running back and forth
I could set off the sirens
You won't be running back and forth, back and forth

Give it up for all the times that I thought
I'm in luck from banging on this hollow door
Give it up for all the times that I've drawn short
I know, oh, I know but

You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk

I've been all around this corner
Reachin' forth but backin' over
I'm not done and I'm not over
I'm not done with you

You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk
You aren't allowed to talk
You aren't allowed to talk, oh no
You aren't allowed to talk, oh no

And maybe I'm not done with you
I said it but
Maybe I'm not done with you
I said it but

Maybe I'm not done with you
And maybe I'm not done with you
And maybe I'm not done with you
So please don't talk no more
