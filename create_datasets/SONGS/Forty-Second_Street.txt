Come and meet those dancing feet
On the avenue I'm taking you to
The Forty-Second Street

Hear the beat of dancing feet
It's the song I love the melody of
The Forty-Second Street

Little nifties from the Fifties, innocent and sweet
Sexy ladies from the Eighties, who are indiscreet

Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld can meet the elite
On Forty-Second Street

Little nifties from the Fifties, innocent and sweet
Sexy ladies from the Eighties, who are indiscreet

Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld can meet the elite
On Forty-Second Street
Forty-Second Street
Naughty, bawdy, gawdy, sporty
Forty, Forty-Second Street
