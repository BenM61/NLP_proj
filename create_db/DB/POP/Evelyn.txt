Pace around until I'm dizzy
So good at feeling guilty
Life can't be this easy baby
Stop it, nobody knows 
What you're thinking

Make your thoughts extra dirty
Nobody gonna hurt me
You've got beans for brains babe
Stop it, nobody cares 
Anyway

One day I'm gonna feel like
One day I'm gonna get there
One day I'm gonna feel like
One day I'm gonna know
One day I'm gonna feel like
One day I'm gonna get there
One day I'm gonna feel like

I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore

It's all about fresh stimulation
Make 'em feel so elated
They're gonna change their minds while you're waiting
Stop it, nobody cares, why you staying?

One day I'm gonna feel like
One day I'm gonna get there
One day I'm gonna feel like
One day I'm gonna know
One day I'm gonna feel like
One day I'm gonna get there
One day I'm gonna feel like

I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore

My dear nothing, nothing really matters
My dear nothing, nothing really matters
My dear nothing, nothing really matters
My dear nothing, nothing really matters

I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
