I could cry cause I fell in love with you I could cry cause you never could be true
I could cry my very heart out for someone just like you
I could cry but what good would it do
I'll go on caring I'll go on sharing every little dream I have with you
I'll go on giving I'll go on living every single day of my life for you
I could cry cause I'm still in love with you how I'll cry dear I wish you only knew
I could cry my very heart out just hoping you'll be true
Yes I'll cry for what else is there to do
[ steel - fiddle ]
I could cry cause I'm still in love with you...
