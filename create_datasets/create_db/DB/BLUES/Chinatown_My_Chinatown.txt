When the town is fast asleep, and it's mid-night in the sky, 
That's the time the festive chink starts to wink his other eye, 
Starts to wink his dreamy eye, lazily you'll hear him sigh. 

Strangers taking in the sights, pig-tails flying here and there. 
See that broken wall street sport, still thinks he's a millionaire. 
Still thinks he's a millionaire, pipe dreams banish every care. 

Chinatown, my Chinatown 
Where the lights are low, 
Hearts that know no other land, 
Drifting to and fro. 
Dreamy dreamy Chinatown, 
Almond eyes of brown, 
Hearts seems light and life seems bright, 
In dreamy Chinatown
