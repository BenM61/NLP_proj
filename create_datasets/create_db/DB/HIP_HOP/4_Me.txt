Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get it
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
Never thought 'bout me

I, clean up, no good shit, I did for you, I do that for me
I would try to do good by you, you would do bad for me
Wear my heart on a sleeve, would you do that for me?
You wouldn't do that for me, you wouldn't do that so when I

Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get it
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
Never thought 'bout me

I, go out, turn up, I do that for me
Say less, spend money, I do that for me
You know all this shit I do for you, I did for me
With all this shit I do with you, still, ain't this shit for me

So when I roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get it
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
Never thought 'bout me, I

Never thought 'bout me
Only there for you
Now it's all 'bout me
Ain't got shit for you

Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get it
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
Never thought 'bout me
I roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get it
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
Never thought 'bout me
Never thought 'bout me
Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get it
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
Never thought 'bout me
Never thought 'bout me

I hate to say I feel this way about you
Situations, you can't stay up out them
I guess there's nothing left to say about it

Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get in
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
Never thought 'bout me
Never thought 'bout me
Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get in
I do that for me
Thinking how you
Only there for you
And never thought 'bout me
Never thought 'bout me
