Grow out of your obsessions
You think you're bad, but I'm badder than you
'Cause mine has come through consideration,
While your reaction is nothing new
So go on genius, be who you are
You're so flat and one dimensional

If you go my way, you won't go wrong
You'll find out where you really belong
If you search it out, it will make you strong
Then you'll go on and on and on and on

You want what's mine, but you don't deserve it
One tenth is all you can have
Why care, why share?
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair
Why care, why share?
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair

If you go my way, you won't go wrong
You'll find out where you really belong
If you search it out, it will make you strong
Then you'll go on and on and on and on

You have to watch for the smallest details
Just to stop the alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
