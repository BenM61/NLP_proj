Choppity chop chop, chop chopsticks
Choppity chop chop, chop till six
Choppity chop chop, chops the thing
When Charlie Chingee make his sing song swing

Charlie Ching
Make his sing song swing
With a tingaling
On the ding dong ding

With a tingaling on the ding dong ding
Make plenty sing song swing

Choppity chop chop, chop chopsticks
Choppity chop chop, chop till six
Choppity chop chop, chops the thing
When Charlie Chingee make his sing song swing

Foo Yung Foo

With a toot or two
On the flute bamboo

And the doodle-doo and the tingaling
Make plenty sing song swing

Choppity chop chop, chop chopsticks
Choppity chop chop, chop till six
Choppity chop chop, chops the thing
When Charlie Chingee make his sing song swing

And a tingaling on the ding dong ding
Make plenty sing song swing

Chop chop choppity, chop chopsticks
Chop chop choppity, chop till six
Choppity chop chop, chops the thing
When Charlie Chingee make his sing song swing

Choppa choppa choppity, chop chopsticks
Choppity choppity, chop till six
Choppity chop chop, chops the thing
When Charlie Chingee make his swing
