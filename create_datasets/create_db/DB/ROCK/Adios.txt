It'd been too many times that I stuck out my neck
For you
It's been too many times that I spoke my mind
For you
It's been too many times that I caught all the flak
From you
Apathetic crap is all I can find
In you

I don't want no part in this
I don't feel the need to score
Burnt all bridges close to the heart
I don't want to be a part
No more

Dosvidanija ciao adieu
Hasta la vista I'm on my way
Goodbye sayonara
Auf nimmerweidersehen
Over and out 
And down the drain

It's been too many times that I raised my voice
At you
It's been too many times that I walked the line
With you
It's been too many times that I've had no choice
But you
Hypocritical swine I have had it this time
Thank you 

I don't want no part in this
I don't feel the need to score
Burnt all bridges close to the heart
I don't want to be a part
No more

Dosvidanija ciao adieu
Hasta la vista I'm on my way
Goodbye sayonara
Auf nimmerweidersehen
Over and out 
And down the drain
