I'm not out of danger
Where ever you may hide
There's still tears to be overcome
Wild dreams to ride

At night the sky is burning
And staring through the pains
I see all the past the future lies
Writing your name

On the roses
In the garden of love
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light

First thing in the morning I look through the sights
I aim to be there, be there
Out of sight but not out of vision
I know what I can see

Maybe
Shadows all are falling on me
Keep on running to me
On the roses

In the garden of love
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
First thing in the morning I look through the sights

I aim to be there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
First thing in the morning I look through the sights

I aim to be there, be there, be there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
What else can I do but to look through the sights

I aim to be there, to be there
I aim to be there, there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light

First thing in the morning I look through the sights
I aim to be there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
Last thing at night

First thing in the morning I look through the sights
First thing
