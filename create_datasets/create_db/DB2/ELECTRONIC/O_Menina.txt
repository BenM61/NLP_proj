O Menina

Torn out girl on beach black hair black
With black lipstick throwing daggers with her eyes
Tourist trapped in Ipenema quicksands
Sewage sludge washed up conquistador, le mort
Beaten down with two by fours
White washed walls of discontent won't repent
Candeleria favela massacres with color brochures
Death metal plates for carnival girls
Send her away when she's sick of the sun
Let the sleet and the snow teach her a lesson
