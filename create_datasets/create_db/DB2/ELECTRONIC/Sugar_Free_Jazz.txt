Normalize the signal and you're banging on freon
Paleolithic eon
Put the fake goatee on
And it booms as cool as
Sugar free jazz

Schools he bombs, he bombs

Stack wax lie like a placemat
Won't lap
Or help you at the automat
And it's clear and clean as
Sugar free jazz

Schools he bombs, he bombs

Fossilize apostle and I comb it with a rake
You can't escape
You pull out the brake
And it booms as cool as
Sugar free jazz
