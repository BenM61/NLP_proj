Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon
Oh, Mud Slide, I'm dependent on you
I don't know but I've been told
There's a time from time to time
I can't eat, I can't sleep 
But I just might move my feet
'Cause there's nothing like 
The sound of sweet soul music
To change a young lady's mind
And there's nothing like a 
Walk on down by the bayou
To leave the world behind
Mud Slide I'm depending upon you
Mister Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon

I've been letting the time go by
Letting the time go by
Yes, I'm letting the time go by
Letting the time go by

I'm gonna cash in my hand and 
Pick up on a piece of land
And build myself a cabin back in the woods
Lord, it's there I'm gonna stay 
Until there comes a day
When this old world starts to changing for the good
Now the reason I'm smiling is over on a island
On a hillside in the woods where I belong
I wanna thank Jimmy, Jimmy, John, Nick and Laurie
The No Jets Construction for setting
Me down a homestead on the farm

Mud Slide, I'm depending upon you
Mister Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon
