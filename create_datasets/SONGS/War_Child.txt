I need city lights
Defense and weaponry
No way of knowing
My life expectancy

I learn resistance
Like I learn to see
A living witness
A lonely refugee
I'm a war child

I'm a war baby
And that's the difference
Between you and me
I'm a war child

My occupation
Is being occupied
I stop at the corner
To be identified

Across the border
They pretend victory
I'm playing in the rubble
And dream a destiny

I'm a war child
I'm a war baby
And that's the difference
Between you and me
I'm a war child

You weren't discovered by Khmer Rouge
We hear of "the troubles" on the nightly news
PLO lovers courting after the curfew
Your father and brother have the West Bank blues
