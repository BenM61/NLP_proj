I'm kind of tired
'cause you wouldn't let me sleep last night
I'm a reasonable man
But I can't believe what's on your mind
And the past three weeks
Were the saddest weeks
And the words you said oh
Made me weep
I'm outta my mind
I'm about to crack, so

Let's call this the comeback
Let's call this the comeback

I've been pushed around 
And I'm not gonna get pushed this time
'cause the time is mine
But I can't believe what's on your mind
And the past three weeks
Were the saddest weeks
And the words you said oh
Made me weak
I'm outta my mind
I'm about to crack, so 

Let's call this the comeback
Let's call this the comeback

Let's call this the comeback
Let's call this the comeback

Let's call this the comeback
Let's call this the comeback
