By the way,
Wasn't that a dream last night? 
Seems I barely closed my eyes and you were there
By the way,
And to my complete surprise,
You and I were dancing on a cloud somewhere

I held you in my arms,
The joy of it was thrilling 
And then I pleaded for a kiss
And you were willing

And, so we kissed,
Then I heard you say you cared, 
By the way, do say it now as you did then,
Or must I wait until I dream again?
