Bringing in the New Year's eve alone
The glitter of the party life turns my face to home
Lovers and acquaintances all through the land
Celebrate a grain of time down miles and miles of sand
The wheel of fortune has stopped again
Though the winning number was lost in the wind
But I heard a gypsy swear it was stolen by someone
Who steers a lonesome chariot in circles around the sun

Maria, I love you
Maria, I miss you

The clock strikes twelve and canons are fired
The echo is heard 'till a year from tonight
The old man with his sickle just lay down and die
While I held the baby's hand who danced where he lie

Maria, I love you
Maria, I miss you
