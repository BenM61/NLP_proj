I bring you the tale of the broken seas
And I'm drowning in whiskey and beer.
My doctor reports, if I don't stop soon,
That I'll drown in an ocean of tears.

I looked to you and saw my desire
Went from the frying pan into the fire.
Surrendered to sorrow and was undone
Now I'm praying that it won't be long.

We fucked up the sun into kingdom come
You are under my blood and my skin.
Living life at eachother's throats
In the gilded sailboat of sin.

Ours was an ocean to swim around in,
Ours was an ocean I should have drowned in.

My doctor reports that we must be strong,
But I'm praying that it won't be long
