I have to ask you,
Do you want this to be true,
Is there method in all my madness,
Or as we flower do we die in full bloom.

You're the only thing that keeps me going,
With your pillow lips,
Pillow lips.

As we move through cruel waters,
Give me strength to be by your side,
It's so difficult sometimes to be human,
The years they leave us your side,

You're the only thing that keeps me going,
With your pillow lips,
Pillow lips.

You know I won't give in 
You know I won't give in 

Pillow lips 
Pillow lips 
Pillow lips 
Pillow lips
