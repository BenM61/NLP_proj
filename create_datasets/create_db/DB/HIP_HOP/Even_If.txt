In this moment I will have no fears
There ain't gonna be no doubt ain't gonna be no tears
As I'm walking on this road of my faith
I won't let anything stand in my way

Even if the sun refuses to shine 
Even if the moon was to run and hide 
Even if the shadows cover the ground 
Even if the pathways couldn't be found 
Even if my eyes failed to see the way 
This is the testimony I would say
That you have always brought me through the night
You are still the love, the love of my life

You will protect me through the rain

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Through the season you will never change oh yeah
You will lift me high above the storm
I know I will never be alone

Even if the sun refuses to shine 
Even if the moon was to run and hide
Even if the shadows covered the ground
Even if the pathways couldn't be found
Even if my eyes failed to see the way
This is the testimony I would say
That you have always brought me through the night
You are still the love, the love of my life

I will be humble
In your eyes
I'm just gonna do what you tell me to do
Every day of my life

When the sun doesn't shine
When the moon runs and hide
When the shadows cover the ground
You are still the love of my life

Even if the sun refuses to shine
Even if the moon was to run and hide
Even if the shadows covered the ground
Even if the pathways couldn't be found
Even if my eyes failed to see the way
This is the testimony I would say
That you have always brought me through the night
You are still the love of my life
