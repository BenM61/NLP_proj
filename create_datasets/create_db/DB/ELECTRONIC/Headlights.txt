Oh, I know why you chasing all the headlights
Oh, 'cause you always tryna get ahead of light
Baby when you go
You know I'll be waiting on the other side
And I'm always cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night

Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights

Oh, I could feel the beating of your heartache drum
Oh, don't know if I'm dreaming or if you have gone
Every time you go
Hits me like a bullet from a broken gun
Yeah I know it's cold
But if you stay then Then I could give you all my love

Oh, and don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
So don't go chasing all the headlights

ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh and don't be a fool for the city lights
I know it's cool but it's only light
Baby with you I can never lie
So don't go chasing all the headlights
