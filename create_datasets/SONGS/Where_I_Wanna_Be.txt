I wanna be the way You are
Don't wanna be the one to stay in the dark
I wanna live the way You live
I wanna do it in the way that You did

Each time I talk about it
Well I can feel the love in Your eyes
And when I think about it
I realize, this is where I wanna be

And will You take me high
So I can reach the sky
With a love that never dies
This is where I wanna be
And when You lift me up
And then You bring me down
If I know that You're around
This is where I wanna be

I wanna love the way You love
The love that I can give is never enough
I wanna see the way You see
So I can understand the way it should be

And now I can hear You
I will last the longest day
As long as You're with me
I will never lose my way
