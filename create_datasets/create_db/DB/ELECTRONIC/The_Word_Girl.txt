To do what I should do
To long for you to hear
I open up my heart
And watch her name appear
A word for you to use
A girl without a cause
A name for what you lose
When it was never yours

The first time baby that I came to you
Swore I'd do things that you want me to
The second time baby that I came to you
For oh you found my love for you
The third time baby that I came to you
Oh, oh, oh, I knew
The last time baby that I came to you
Oh how your flesh and blood became the word

A name the girl outgrew
The girl was never real
She stands for your abuse
The girl is no ideal
It's a word for what you do
In a world of broken rules
She found a place for you
Along her chain of fools

The first time baby that I came to you
Swore I'd do things that you want me to
The second time baby that I came to you
For oh you found my love for you
The third time baby that I came to you
Oh, oh, oh, I knew
The last time baby that I came to you
Oh how your flesh and blood became the word

Oh how
Your flesh and blood
Oh how
Your flesh and blood
Oh how
Your flesh and blood
Oh how
Your flesh and blood
Oh how
Your flesh and blood
Oh how
Your flesh and blood
Oh how
Your flesh and blood
