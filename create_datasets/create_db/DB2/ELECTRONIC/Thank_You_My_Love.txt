Remember the day
we first laid eyes on each other
YOu came my way
I walked you home and kissed ya

Thank you my love
For such a golder memory
you meant so much to me
My love

Whenever we dance
Uuh the ochestra played our theme song
filled with romance
Two lovers made for each other

Thank you my love
I'll never ever leave you
No one can ever see that
YOu are the one for me and
there'll never be another
like my love

Thank you my love
For such a golden memory
You meant so much to me my love
I'll never ever leave your love
No one can see that you
thank you my love
I'll never ever leave you
no one can ever see that you are my love
there'll never ever be one like my love
