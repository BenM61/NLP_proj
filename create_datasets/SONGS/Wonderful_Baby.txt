Wonderful baby livin' on love the
sandman says maybe he'll take you above,
up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows, where
babies float by, just counting their toes.

Wonderful baby nothin' but new, the
world has gone crazy, I'm glad I'm not you.
At the beginning or is it the end? It goes
in and comes out and starts over again.

Wonderful baby livin' on love the
sandman says maybe he'll take you above,
up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows, where
babies float by, just counting their toes.

Wonderful baby I'll watch while you grow. If
I knew the future you'd be first to know. But
I don't know nothin' of what life's about, Just as
long as you live, you'll never find out.

Wonderful baby, nothin' to fear.
Love whom you will, but doubt what you hear.
They'll whisper sweet things to make untrue. So be
good to yourself, that's all you can do. You're a

wonderful baby livin' on love the
sandman says maybe he'll take you above,
up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows, where
babies float by, just counting their toes, where
babies float by, just counting their toes, ooh
