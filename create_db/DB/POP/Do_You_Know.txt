Lying here beside you in the dark
I feel the steady rhythm of your heart
Feel your face against my shoulder
Breath upon my skin
Ambers barely smoldered
I make love to you again

Nothing in this world compares to this
The way our bodies fit
The way we kiss
Passion beneath your nails just answer my desire
Seems that I am more less consumed here in your fire

Do you know how much I love you
Do you know how much it means to me
The interest that you show
Do you know how beautiful you are here in the afterglow
Do you now I'd walk through hell for you
Barefoot in burning coal
1000 ways I love you and I need to know you know
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Oh, do you know

Do you know how much I love you
Do you know how much it means to me the way you make me feel
Like I could soar the heavens gathering shooting stars
Lace them in a bouquet in a rainbow
Everything that's happening to me is what you are
Do you know, do you know, do you know

Do you know how much I love you
Something deep inside me tells me that you almost know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know, oh
Do you know
Oh, do you know, do you know, do you know
Oh, oh
Do you know
Do you know
Oh, do you know,
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
