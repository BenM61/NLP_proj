One, two, three
He plays so sexy to me
Three, four, five, six
Kit's got some brand new licks
Six, seven, eight
Down by the snake at the lake
There's this joint that's ready to blow

Every hound in the band's gotta sound
Howling away it must be judgment day
They run it down like a cat in a hole
That's the way they do it
That's the way they roll

They call it jazz, man
The bass pocket is point
They call it jazz, man
The trumpet's jumpin' the joint
They shake it down, down, down
Like voodoo from a crow
That's the way they do it
That's the way they roll

Checkers and dice
Rule the back of the room
Cisco on ice
Always a reasonable price
Women in heels, heels, heels
In any every color she feels
This joint's gonna blow your mind

The drums be breaking a sweat
The man is as hot as a high roller's bet
The sticks click like time on a clock
When you think it's over
They're just beginning to rock!

They call it jazz, man
The bass pocket is tight
They call it jazz, man
The trumpet's blinding the light
They shake it down, down, down
Like fire in a hole
That's the way they do it
That's the way they roll
