Don't bother going through your motions.
Nothing that makes sense ever works out.
Don't kid yourself, you know they want money.
Nothing can be good on its own merit.
Spinning and spinning 
Down you believe in what you want?
Dancing in plastic, shake up snow
Do you believe in what you want?
Put your trust in simple acts.
Make the flyers get them up all over town.
Don't kid yourself, you know they want money.
Please keep in sight what makes you care.
You have it always.
Spinning and spinning.
Do you believe in what you want?
Dancing in plastic, shake-up snow.
Do you believe in what you want?
Your camera flash.
On us, meaningless.
You cannot waste a single night.
What you ignore is priceless to me.
