Cleanse my heart and cleanse my hands ay yeah
Help me be a good good man ay yeah
Forever I am yours forever you are mine

So I say return you to the heart return you here again

Without you I shall break
But with you I shall bend
As it is a burn it shall be below
Symbol of the heart and forgiving of the soul
