Hey , mister see the sister
Don't you let them feel you
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But now her looks could kill you
Hey , come away
Souca souca na na
Come on , come on , miss

With a souca souca mama
Oh , hey , come away
Souca souca na na
Come on , come on , miss

With a souca souca maman
On , hey , come away
Souca souca na na

With a souca souca mama
Come on , come on miss ,

With a souca souca mama.
