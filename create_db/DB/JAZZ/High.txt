Well here I am with so much to offer
Nothing to do but be here today
Giving myself it's the best I can do if I'm needed
Use my strength in anyway

[Chorus]
If we all work together
We would be stronger
If we all open our eyes
We could see further
If we all stand tall enough no one can beat us
If we all hold our hands up high we can carry the world

And all I ask is that we be honest
Do what we can if we're gonna stay
I want to make you a promise
Love and understanding
Is the game I want to play

[Chorus]

With my hands with my feet
When I dream when I sleep
From the start here inside I believe

If we all work together
We would be stronger
If we all hold our hands up high we can carry the world

[Chorus]
