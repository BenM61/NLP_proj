Lately when I look into your eyes, I fly
You're the only one I need in my life
Baby, I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside

You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

You seem like the likely thing
From the start you told me, yeah, yeah
I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
Joy is what you bring; I wanna give you ev'rything

You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control these butterflyz

You and I are destiny
I know that you were made for me
Oh, I can't control it, you're drivin' me
Taken over me, and I, oh

You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control, I can't control it
You give me butterflyz
Got me flyin' so high in the sky
I can't control it, ooh, oh no

You give me something that I can't deny
Something that's so free
I just can't control the way I feel
With your mind on me

You give me something that I can't deny
Something that's so free
I just can't control the way I feel
I never felt like this
