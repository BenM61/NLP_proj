I've been thinking about you, my love
And all the crazy things that you put me through
Now I'm coming around, throwing it back to you
Were you thinking of me when you kissed him?
Could you taste me when you licked his skin?
All the while I showered you with trust and promises

What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
To get back all that I lost then
I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you

Oh, Adrienne, I thought I knew you
Once again, you used me, used me
Adrienne, I should have left you
Long before you used me, used me up

Spent my money, drove my car, I treated you like a shining star
But in my sky all burnt out you are
And I'll have the last laugh, when I see you walking with some other guy
'Cause I know you're gonna end up all alone

So take these words, some good advice
All you've done gonna come back twice
You never cared how much it hurt, I really need to tell you

Oh, Adrienne, I thought I knew you
Once again, you used me, used me
Adrienne, I should have left you
Long before you used me, used me up
You used me up

What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
To get back all that I lost then
I gave you all that I had to give, and I could never reach you

Oh, Adrienne, I thought I knew you
Once again, you used me, used me
Adrienne, I should have left you
Long before you used me, used me

Adrienne, long before, Adrienne
Oh Adrienne, Adrienne, oh yeah
