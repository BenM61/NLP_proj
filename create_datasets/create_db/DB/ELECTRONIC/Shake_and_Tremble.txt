Warning signs foretold
Ignore the leaf then winds begin to blow
Changing directions, watching time unfolding
Melting and eroding
Burning through our fortunes, taking all that we own

Witness omens rising
As the skies begins to glow
Trace the fault lines forming
Watching gaps begin to grow
Walking back the ocean
Just enough to say a word
Feel a wave in motion
Shake and tremble

Smoldering eyes at night
Floating in darkness, offer sacrifice
In adoration, beating drums and laughter
Growing ever faster
Dancing over embers falling into the fire

Witness omens rising
As the skies begins to glow
Trace the fault lines forming
Watching gaps begin to grow
Walking back the ocean
Just enough to say a word
Feel a wave in motion
Shake and tremble

Smoke drifts far away
Taking all our thoughts
Words that once held weight
Lie in wanton state
Turn our feet around
And fall without a sound
Engulfing all we know

Witness omens rising
As the skies begins to glow
Trace the fault lines forming
Watching gaps begin to grow
Walking back the ocean
Just enough to say a word
Feel a wave in motion
Shake and tremble
