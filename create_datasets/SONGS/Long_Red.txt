The long red, flowing through my mind
Dream here, dreamin' there
Two pieces all the time

Sobered, wisdoms in my dreams
Bits and pieces in my arms
This is always what it seems

Long red, helpin' you to find a day
Bright red, how am I gonna find a way?

Bright red
You have changed me too
Stranger now it seems somehow
Bright red has turned to blue

Long red
Tears and shades of gray
I have (Incomprehensible) you
I've lost forever from today

Long red, helpin' you to find the day
Bright red, how am I gonna find a way?

Long red
Tears and shades of gray
I have changed you
I've lost forever from today
