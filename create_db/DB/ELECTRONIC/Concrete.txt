Strangle the while you pray
Demand that they're diseased
Safe passage follow me
Refusal to oversee
Denial to hear you say
Father, pray to me
Crawling for the grave
For nothing to concrete

Wait by the swings
Wait by the wreaths
Lay the concrete
Continue with amnesty
To pull them by the teeth
Solicit to pass the time
Extract them from the name
Denial to hear you say
Father, pray to me
Crawling for the grave
For nothing is concrete

Wait on the swing
Wait by the wreaths
Lay the concrete

Wait on the swings
Wait by the wreaths
Lay the concrete

Wait on the swings
Wait by the wreaths
