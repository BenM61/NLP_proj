Girl, I'm gonna make you come
Free your body with my gun
Girl, I'm gonna make you come
Free your body with my gun

May not make it out alive
Rack your psyche, rack you blind
Free your body with my gun
Girl, I'm gonna make you come

7th house along the road
At the 7th house along the road
7th house along the road
Free your body with my gun

Free your body, make you come
Free your body, make you come
Free your body, make you come
Free your body, make you come

Make your hunger suck you in
Make you feel so many things
World can show you many sights
Drape yourself in dead dark skin

7th house along the road
At the 7th house along the road
7th house along the road
7th house along the road

7th house along the road
At the 7th house along the road
Free your body with my gun
7th house along the road

Free your body, make you come
Free your body, make you come
Free your body, make you come
Free your body, make you come

Girl, I'm gonna eat your heart
Rip your little world apart
Girl, I'm gonna make you come
Free your body with my gun
