Pick me up, dust me off
Give me breath, and let me cough
Drag me back, collect my thoughts
I've come back to the land I'd lost

The palms are down, I'm welcomed back to town
Sometimes I feel like they don't understand me
I hear their mouths making foreign sounds
Sometimes I think they're all just speaking tongues

Tell me all the things I've missed
Who's been killed and who's been kissed
(Drag me back, collect my thoughts)
I'll be gone when the drugs wear off

The palms are down, I'm welcomed into town
Sometimes I feel like they don't understand me
I hear their mouths making foreign sounds
Sometimes you'd think they spoke another language

The palms are down, I'm welcomed into town
Sometimes I feel like they don't understand me
I hear their mouths making foreign sounds
Sometimes I think they're all just speaking tongues

They say I'm the only one, who can be brave
That I am the chosen one
But there's no way, that I am the only one
And there's no one to save
If there's nowhere for them to run

The palms are down, I'm welcomed into town
Sometimes I feel like they don't understand me
I hear their mouths making foreign sounds
Sometimes you'd think they spoke another language

The palms are down, I'm welcomed into town
Sometimes I feel like they don't understand me
I hear their mouths making foreign sounds
Sometimes I think

They're all just speaking tongues
They're all just speaking tongues
They're all just speaking tongues
They're all just speaking tongues
They're all just speaking tongues
