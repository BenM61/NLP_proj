I've had so many loves in my lifetime
So many special memories.
But never have I been so enchanted by someone
Never has love been so for real you give me love
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme.
I have faith in the word God's given us
Now there's a light that shines tor me.
I'm thankful for all the love you've given me
Never has love been so for real, you give me
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme

My life's been filled with contentment
You brought me joy I never knew
Feels like a new beginning.
My life is complete now that I've found you.
A love supreme
A love supreme.
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
