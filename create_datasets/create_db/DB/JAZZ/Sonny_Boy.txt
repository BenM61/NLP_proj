Climb up on my knee Sonny Boy
Though you're only three Sonny Boy
You've no way of knowing
There's no way of showing
What you mean to me Sonny Boy.

[Chorus]
When there are gray skies,
I don't mind the gray skies.
You make them blue Sonny Boy.
Friends may forsake me.
Let them all forsake me.
I still have you Sonny Boy.

You're sent from heaven
And I know your worth.
You made a heaven 
For me here on earth.

When I'm old and gray dear
Promise you won't stray dear
For I love you so Sonny Boy.

[Chorus]

You're sent from heaven
And I know your worth.
You've made a heaven
For me here on earth.

And the angels grew lonely
Took you because they were lonely
I'm lonely too Sonny Boy.
