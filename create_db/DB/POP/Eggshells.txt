She sleeps with the windows open 
Yet she's still locked safe inside 
And to block out the sounds of the city's commotion 
She turns her fan up on high 
Yea she lives just far enough away from home 
To see the whole scene 
And down the street the kids throw sticks and stones 
And end up on the the TV screen 
Yea they throw their sticks and stones 
And end up on the TV screen 
And she used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath her feet 
I guess she must be changin' 
There's just no way to keep it neat 
And her father still barks like a soldier 
Returning from victory 
But now he's much older 
And that bark isn't as scary as it used to be 
Yea she watches his self torture 
No one left to abuse but himself 
But still her memory scorches her 
And she struggles to love herself 
Her memory scorches her 
And she struggles to love herself 
And she used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath her feet 
And I guess she must be changin' 
She never was to good at stayin' in her seat 
And this town grows hungry and restless 
Hungry for what I ain't sure 
But they're sweepin' the streets of the trash and the homeless 
And raisin' the rent 
And breakin' the poor 
And I used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath my feet 
And I guess I must be changin' 
There's just no way to keep it neat 
I used to walk on these gracefully 
I guess I must be changin'
