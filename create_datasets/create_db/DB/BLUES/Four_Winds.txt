I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
To tell my troubles to
Don't you be afraid 
You heard what I said
Have you heard the news
You, I'd hate to lose
Come to my side
Don't say goodbye

Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From east to west
I love you the best

Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, blow, blow
From east to west
I love you the best

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand

I want a girl like you
To tell my troubles to
Don't be afraid
You heard what I said

Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From east to west
I love you the best

Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, blow, blow
From east to west
I love you the best
