Just a couple kids on a summer street
Chasing around to a flicker beat
Making mistakes that were made for us
We brushed them off like paper cuts

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye

Underneath the lights of a motorway
That's where I go to keep your ghost away
We used to be such a burning flame
Now we're just smoke in the summer rain

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye
I want to know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you, how could I let you go?

You were the best thing that ever happened to me
And I'll keep on fighting just to make you believe

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye
I want to know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you, how could I let you
Don't want to let you, I'll never let you go
