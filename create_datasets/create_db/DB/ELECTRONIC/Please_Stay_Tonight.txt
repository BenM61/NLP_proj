You and I've known each other for some time
I've always wondering for so long
If my feelings for you are too song
I've waited for this moment to tell you
No other one can love like you do
Just hold my hand and say that you'll be mine
Till the end of time

Please stay tonight, I neeed you and I love you so
Please stay tonight, I'll never ever let you go
Please stay tonight, I can't live without your love
Please stay tonight, You're the only one I'm thinking of

Tell me why must it be so difficult for me
To be with someone who you've cared for so long
And to give it more than your all and all
I wanted you, believe me that's true
No one can say I'm not crazy for you
Spend time with me I'll guarantee you'll see
What love can be

Please stay tonight, I neeed you and I love you so
Please stay tonight, I'll never ever let you go
Please stay tonight, I can't live without your love
Please stay tonight, You're the only one I'm thinking of

I've waited for this moment to tell you
No other one can love like you do
Just hold my hand and say that you'll be mine
Till the end of time

Please stay tonight, I can't live without your love
Please stay tonight, You're the only one I'm thinking of

Give me the time to prove that I love you
Give me the chance I'm thinking of you
Give me tonight and I'll give you forever
To love you forever can't get any better

Give me the time to prove that I love you
Give me the chance I'm thinking of you
Please stay tonight, please stay tonight
You're the only one I'm thinking of

Please stay tonight
