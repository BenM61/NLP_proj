Victimized
But you're in bed
Stumble out
And run dead
If it ever paid
To sell (a?) (start?) (star? *sigh*)
Environment 
Make you smart

 Just another victim
 Just another victim
 Just another victim, kid

I heard it once
But not before
(taking? or begging?) off
And livin bored
My hands are tied
Webbed feet again
Fell in behind
And claim us dead(?) 

 Just another victim
 Just another victim
 Just another victim

Cast this
(?)
Give it up
I'll lie to you
(Blamin? Flamin? Played in?) Flame this
(?)
Pointed finger
You fall apart

 Just another victim
 Just another victim
 Just another victim

(fade to HOP)
You played yourself now you point the finger
How I've robbed and raped ya, bruised and scraped ya
But those are just lies, cause in your eyes you've been victimized
It's how you size it up, you disguise it up, and try to make it look
Real
To cover up the low self esteem you feel
Introspection an afterthought, swimmin in guilt your favorite sport
But now you're caught up in the undertow, 
You never knew a man could sink so low
But now you know, cause you're John Doe
In a black bag a tag on your toe
I built the House
I felt the Pain
You're victimized but got no one to blame

 Just another victim
 You're just another victim, kid
 Just another victim
 You're just another victim kid

Holy Godiva, I'm a survivor
Feeling like DeNiro in Taxi Driver
With Jodi Foster, and Harvy Kietel
Looks like I'm walkin through a livin Hell
So spark that L, and I'll get lifted
Feelin the effects of what my spliff did
Cause I'm gifted, I read Sun Tzu
I bought a Gun too so you'll never come too
The weight of the world ridin on my shoulders
Cause I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya

 You're just another Victim
 You're just another Victim, kid
 You're just another Victim
 You're just another Victim, kid
