Under the moon, under the stars of the weekend
And I see you soon,
So the summer won't end

So the summer won't end
So the summer won't end
So the summer won't end
So the summer won't end
So the summer won't end

I'm the man with a different view
I'm the man that will wait for you
I'm the man that in a different year
I'm the man that will still be here

Oh man, so lovely Earth
Oh man, light the view in this
Oh man, that in a different year
Oh man, I'll be waiting here

Under the moon, under the stars of the weekend
And I see you soon
So the summer won't end

Under the moon, under the stars of the weekend

So the summer won't end
So the summer won't end
