She was black as the night
Louie was whiter than white
Danger, danger when you taste brown suga'

Louie fell in love overnight
Nothing bad, it was good
Louie had the best girl he could
When he took 'er home
To meet her mama and papa
Louie knew just where he stood

Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry

There he stood in the night
Knowing what's wrong from what's right
He took her home to meet his mama and papa
Man, he had a terrible fight
Louie nearly caused a scene
Wishin' it was a dream
Ain't no diff'rence between black and white
Brothers, you know what I mean

Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry

Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry

Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry

Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie
