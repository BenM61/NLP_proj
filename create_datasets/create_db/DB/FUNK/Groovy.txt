Now I can tell you how I feel
A broken heart is this for real
There's still so much for me to do
And to know
And to be and to feel

If you think you're groovy
You don't even move me
There's no denying
If you dare to be true

In my dreams I dreamt for two
My dreams were real but where were you
And now my dreams have all been changed
Rearranged there's room for two
But not for you

If you think you're groovy
You don't even move me
There's no denying
If you dare to be true

Oh you made me feel so real
Baby how I used to feel
Now I know what it's all about
Honey I found out (I found out) I found out
(I found out) I found out and i
Wanted to tell you

If you think you're groovy
You don't even move me
There's no denying
If you dare to be true
