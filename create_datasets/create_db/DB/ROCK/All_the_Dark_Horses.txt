On the sunset, horses silhouette 
All is calm tonight 
New horizon, keep your eyes on those stars 
Lighting a way 

Take me somewhere out there 
Through the fields, in the night 
All the dark horses ride 
No more reining in 
Now my aim is in sight 
To the wild and the light 

Out of harm's way, where the traps all lay 
Tying you down, selling you out 
Beating you down - they're all over town 
Know your true self, or your truth might bend 
They will turf you out in the end 
Don't heed a word they say 
Keep heading away 

Faraway, slow in motion 
Through the fields, in the night 
All the dark horses ride 
No more reining in 
Now my aim is in sight 
To the wild and the light 

Long-lost summer days 
Are shining around again, 
Sky ablaze, ride away...
