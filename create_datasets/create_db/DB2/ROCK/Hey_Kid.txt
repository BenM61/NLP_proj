Lyin' here, arm around my girl
I turn on the radio 
A shame we had to bail
You know we put on quite a show
What am I gonna do? 
I left on my answer phone 
Till then, what I told you 
Right now, I just don't know 
And I said

Hey! Kid! 
Don't think you gotta try and be somebody, yeah! 
It happens on its own
I said it's all right
Hey! (Hey!) Kid! (Kid!) 
You don't get along trying to be nobody else
It's god-damned right, you know! 

Every day will break
But another comes along
Won't have long to wait
And you've always got that song
It's funny when you're drunk (funny when you're drunk!) 
How everything is clear
"Come check out my bum!" 
Can get the rock right out of here
And I said

Hey! Kid! 
Don't think you gotta try and be somebody, yeah! 
It happens on its own
I said it's all right
Hey! (Hey!) Kid! (Kid!) 
You don't get along tryin' to be nobody else
It's god-damned right, you know! 

Feelin' so much better in this frame of mind, 
'Cause I've been sick of taking over all the good guitars 
And I know (and you know) I'm a capable guy
I got so many things I wanted to do 
And I got the chance to prove it to you! 
Hey - I'm lyin' (I'm lyin'!) 'cause I waited my life 
And I am ready to blow
But when I do something about the wind and rain
They start all over again
And I need some pieces from you! 

Hey! (Hey!) Kid! (Kid!) 
Don't think you gotta try and be somebody, yeah! 
It happens on its own
I said it's all right
Hey! (Hey!) Kid! (Kid!) 
You don't get along tryin' to be nobody else
It's god-damned right, you know! 

Hey! (Hey!) Kid! (Kid!) 
Don't think you gotta try and be somebody, yeah! 
It happens on its own
I said it's all right
Hey! (Hey!) Kid! (Kid!) 
You don't get along tryin' to be nobody else
It's god-damned right, you know!
