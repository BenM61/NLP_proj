Well she's got to be a 20 on a scale of 10
Walking on an edge that's razor thin
One in a million from her head to her toes
A hole in her heart as the next man's money goes

She's a cruel little number
Wild little weed
Momma's little princess
Daddy's bad seed

Mind of a maniac
She's breakin' all the rules
Cruel little number
Why do you have to be so cruel?

She ain't tight with the ladies
She don't kiss and tell
She want a black Mercedes
500 S E L

She knows the scent of a dollar
Don't want a check in the mail
She blew the price of love
Right off the end of the scale

She's a cruel little number
Wild little weed
Momma's little princess
Daddy's bad seed

Mind of a maniac
She's breakin' all the rules
Cruel little number
Why do you have to be so cruel?

Her heart can't be broken
'Cause it's stainless steel
You can beg, you can bargain
But she's never gonna cut you a deal

She's a cruel little number
Wild little weed
Momma's little princess
Daddy's bad seed

Mind of a maniac
She's breakin' all the rules
Cruel little number
Why do you have to be so cruel?

She's a cruel little number
Cruel little number
