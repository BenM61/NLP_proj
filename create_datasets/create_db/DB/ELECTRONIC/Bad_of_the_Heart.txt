Because your bad of the heart 

How could you be so cruel 
You treat me like a fool 
After all I did for you 
You cut me like a blade 
My trust is slowly fading 
Now I don't know what to do 
I thought that when you gave me love 
My life would start to change 
Instead I saw that I was wrong 
My life was rearanged 
How I wonder why 
You just put my love aside 
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie 

You never wanted to start 
Cause your just bad of the heart 
You never played the game to smart 
Cause you know your bad 

When I was by your side 
You kissed and told me lies 
You hurt me each and everyday 
I made it through the night 
Lying to myself, why did it have to be this way 
I thought that when you gave me love 
My life would start to change 
Instead I saw that I was wrong 
My life was rearanged 
How I wonder why 
You just put my love aside 
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie 

Bad of the heart 
You never wanted to start 
Cause your just bad of the heart 
Now your tearing me apart 

Bad of the heart 
You never wanted to start 
Cause your just bad of the heart 
You really didn't want me baby, oh girl 

Bad of the heart 
You didn't really want me baby 
You never really needed me 
Cause your just bad of the heart
