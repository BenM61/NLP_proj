Broken people get recycled 
And I hope that I will. 
Sometimes we're thrown off our pathways 
What I thought was my way home 
Wasn't the place I know 
I'm certain nothing's certain 
What we own becomes our prison 
My possessions will be gone 
Back to where they came from 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls 
Here comes the Flood again 

See the rock that you hold onto 
Is it gonna save you 
When the earth begins to crumble? 
Why do you feel you have to hold on? 
Imagine if you let go 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls 
Here comes the Flood again 

Wash away the weight that pulls you down 
Ride the waves that free you from the dusk? 

Don't trust your eyes 
It's easy to believe them 
Know in your heart 
That you can leave your prison 

Don't trust your mind 
It's not always listening 
Turn on the lights 
And feel the ancient rhythm 

Don't trust your eyes 
It's easy to believe them 
Know in your heart 
That you can leave your prison 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls 
Here comes the Flood again
