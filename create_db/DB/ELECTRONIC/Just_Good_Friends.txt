Manchester morning, Picadilly calling
I ask myself what is it to be free
Free from sorrow, love's tomorrow
Oh if I had a key how different it could be

We didn't have much money then
But we were brave, we'd take each day
And danger with a smile
Well we couldn't see finality in our golden mile

And now we're just good friends
Ooh and friends are things that ought to last forever
Yeah we're just good friends
But I don't see you no more
You don't even call
What kind of strange friendship is this

One evening when you'd were leaving
Fly fly away my bird, fly off to find your son
Soon come tomorrow, soon come the sorrow
If you'd just stay for once, how different it would go

I thought I saw you at the station today
So you panicked and run, oh run you silly boy
Run away, like the bird that got stuck in the skylight
He can see it but he'll never reach the sky

And now we're just good friends
Ooh and friends are things that ought to last forever
Yeah we're just good friends
But I don't see you no more
You don't even call
What kind of strange friendship is this

We used to be so different you and me
We were lovers, and that's a fact
And now I see, there's distance between you and me
And I can't seem to face the fact

Now that we're just good friends
Ooh and friends are things that
Ought to last forever
Yeah we're just good friends
But I don't see you no more
You don't even call
What kind of strange friendship is this
