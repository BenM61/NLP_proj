Let me tell you 'bout a boy I know
He is my baby and he lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
He brings my coffee in my favorite cup

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know he'll go with me until the end
Everybody ask me how I know
I smile at them and say he told me so

That's why I know, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

Now if I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him knock, knock, knock, knock
On my door

In the evening when the sun does down
When there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
And tells me, "Baby, everything's alright"

That's why I know, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

Now if I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him knock, knock, knock, knock
Knock on my door

In the evening when the sun does down
When there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
And tells me, "Baby, everything's alright"

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, I just love him so, Hallelujah
