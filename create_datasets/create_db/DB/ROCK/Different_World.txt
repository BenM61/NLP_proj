Stand up straight they won't notice
Don't fall apart now
Chin up keep both eyes focused
On your sacred vow
Deep down you've got to remember
What you came here for
You're face to face with the golden door

Ayyyah
You're living in a different world
Ayyyah
You're living in a different world

You don't want to believe it matters
But don't run away now
Think of Alice and the old mad hatter
You just got to figure out how
Who was it that wrote all the rules
You don't need to know a name
You're face to face in the pouring rain

Ayyyah
You're living in a different world
Ayyyah
You're living in a different world

Stand up straight they won't notice
Don't turn away now
Chin up keep both eyes focused
Only love will out
Beyond the blue horizon
Lies a silent roar
You're face to face at the golden door

Ayyyah
You're living in a different world
Ayyyah
You're living in a different world
Ayyyah
You're living in a different world
Ayyyah
You're living in a different world
