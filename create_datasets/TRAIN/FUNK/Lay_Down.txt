Let's just, let's just lay down
(Lay down)
If there's some time you know, laugh, joke
(Lay down)
Just be silly
(Lets just lay down)
Yeah

How are you? Well I'm just fine
I missed your call around five
(I missed you)
I'm getting back to you
?Cause you were on my mind
(My mind)

I wanna know
(I wanna)
Can I see you tonight?
(Tonight)
If you can't
(Yeah)
I?ll understand
(I know)

Ain't gonna front
(No)
I wanna take your hand
(I wanna just)
And show you baby
(Yeah)
That I'm sincere
(Oh yeah)
I want you to be here
(Incomprehensible)

let's just spend a little time, do a little more
Share what's in our hearts, give each other all
Nothing more to do, I'm right here with you
Let's just lay down
(I?m so happy that we're here together)
Let's just lay down
(This kinda reminds me of forever)
Let's just lay down
(Baby)

How am I? I can't complain
(No)
I'm really happy that you're here with me
(Higher)
Again it?s been a while
(A while)
I?ll tell you what if you have got a minuet
(Listen)
We can lay until the sun comes up

I?ll understand
(I know)
If it?s much to early to determine
(Too much)
If we can stay together
(Yeah)
This way together
(Together)
Let's lay together
(Together)

let's just spend a little time, do a little more
Share what's in our hearts, give each other all
Nothing more to do, I'm right here with you
Let's just lay down
(Let?s just, let's stay in today)
Let's just lay down
(I wanna just love you in a special way)
Let's just lay down

This is all, this is all we need
A little time to just chill back and be together
There's so much going on outside of these walls
But I just wanted to share with you the truth
All I do is think about you, my love
Maybe we could stay at home today

Saying, I just wanna, yeah
(Share)
I just wanna
(Care)
We should take the time
(Time)
To, to be, love
(To be in love)

We just have to choose
(Choose)
What we wanna do
(Do)
I miss you
(Yeah)
Can I kiss you?
(Yeah)
Let's spend some time

let's just spend a little time, do a little more
Share what's in our hearts, give each other all
Nothing more to do, I'm right here with you
Let's just lay down
(Yeah, can we just focus on us?)
Let's just lay down
(My heart to your heart is never too much)
Let's just lay down

Where ever you want
The bathroom, the living room quick
(Lay, lay, lay down)
Yeah, the kitchen, the bedroom
(Lay, lay, lay down)
We can just, yeah, lay down baby
Please just, let me, let you, lay down
