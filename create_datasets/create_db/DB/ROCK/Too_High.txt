Every day ain't my day
Easy street don't run my way
Cross my heart and hope to spit
The gettin's good, tell me what do I get

Fool me once, fooled you twice
Buy myself a paradise
Ring my bell, time will tell
Someday soon I'm gonna give em hell, yeah

But that mountain is too high for me to climb
The river is too deep and it's too wide, wide
Out of sight, out of mind, I get this way from time to time
But right now it's too high for me to climb,
Oh it's a little too high

Fill my cup, wish me luck
Turn my frown right side up
Pills and bills, kiss of death
Pawn shop slip is all I've got left, yeah

But that mountain is too high for me to climb
The river is too deep and it's too wide, wide
You get yours, I'll get mine
I ain't in no hurry, got plenty of time
Right now it's too high for me to climb, oh it's a little too high

That mountain is too high for me to climb
The river is too deep and it's too wide, wide
Out of sight, out of mind, I get this way from time to time
But right now it's too high for me to climb
Looks like it's too high for me to climb
Right now it's too high for me to climb
Oh it's a little too high
