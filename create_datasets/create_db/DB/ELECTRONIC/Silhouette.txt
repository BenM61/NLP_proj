I go out to find
The one with whom I've seen
All hour's moons
Once the curtains lifted
And he said "I will swim to you"

Language is such a play 
He called his exit, but his eyes are irresolute
What pasts still sit today?
I feel I'm walking around in blue

He can hear me sing
He can hear me sing
Though he is far
I'll never lose sight of him

He turned to me then looked away
A silhouette
A silhouette
Still returns to me

I'll hand him his coat
It's exactly where he left it long ago
We'll fall all over floorboards
I lose my breath just envisioning the scene
Mysteries that wake up late, the table's set
And the painting of his face
No time to hesitate
I cede all my love and play your abandoned fool

Though he is far
I'll never lose 

He turned to me 
He turned to me and looked away

A silhouette
A silhouette returns to me
A silhouette

A silhouette
A silhouette returns to me
A silhouette

A silhouette returns to me
