Count every rain drop in a thunderstorm
Count every wave upon the shore
I love you just as much as that
And so much more
Take all the clouds that glide across the sky
And all the light within a moonbeam
And every bird that ever spread its wings to soar
How I love you
As much as that
And so much more
Count all the days that there are yet to be
And all the ones that came before
You have as much of me as that
And so much more
 Take every leaf that grows on every tree
And all the wishes in a daydream
And every note of every song we all adore
I'm there for you
As much as that
And so much more
Now add the stars and planets out in space
And all the miles that keep them far apart
Find how many- if there are any more ways
Of counting things
Let's start
How many seconds does forever have?
How many creatures watch the sun rise
How many ways to say the words
I can't ignore
How I love you
As much as that
And so much more
As much as that
And so much more
