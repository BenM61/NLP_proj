Don't fight it, girl
Just give it time, and some kind of chance to grow
We're onto something beautiful, oh oh
Don't fight it, girl
Just give it time, and some kind of chance to grow
'Cause we're onto something beautiful, oh oh

Don't fight it, boy
You don't understand how the world breaks
You like me now, but later you've moved
Don't fight it, boy
Don't let the time relax you, I'ma let my guard down
Boy I'm onto something genius
Look me to my eyes
Don't (?) your cry out
(?) that you see
Can't tell you, boy
Don't let this pale skin fool you, I'm a dark soul
And I think I got it figured all out

You can buy my love
You can buy my love
You can buy my love
You can buy my love
You can buy my love
You can buy my love
You can buy my love
You can buy my love

Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it
Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it
Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it
Don't fight it, don't hide it, don't kill it, don't deny it

You can buy my love
Don't fight it, girl
You can buy my love
Just give it time and some kind of chance to grow
