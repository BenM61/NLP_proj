Two weeks away
From reality
And I was beginning 
To feel
I couldn't be myself

Feel like a fly
Caught in honey
Going to sue... Somebody

He's gonna see me
Knowing that I'm probably going to die
Hi... Hi!

Oh here we go again
And I'm so scared
My head is spinning
Oh can you bail me out of this run
I've got myself in once again

From my nightmares
And my dreams
I was being to feel
I couldn't be myself

She was a little girl
She knew all about my world
She was the making of my dreams
She could set me free
Yeah hey yeah

Oh here we go again
And I'm so scared
My head is spinning
Oh can you bail me out of this run
I've got myself in once again
