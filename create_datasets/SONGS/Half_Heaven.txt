My arms reach out for you I kiss you tenderly
But you touch my lips you're kissing him not me, why must it be
Half heaven, half heartache, my lovin' you, darlin'
Can't you forget that other love you knew, hmm

Within your angel eyes a world of dreams are there
Yet I'll keep wondering if they are mine to share, oh it's just not fair
Half heaven, half heartache, my loving you, darlin'
Oh let my love be strong enough to take away the heartache
And make my life a heaven on earth with you-ou-oo-ou

Half heaven, half heartache, my loving you, darlin'
Oh let my love be strong enough to take away the heartache
And make my life a heaven on earth with you-ou-oo-oo-ou
