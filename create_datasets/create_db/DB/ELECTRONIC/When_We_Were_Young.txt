Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I?m sorry
What you gonna do when you cross that line, cross that line, cross that line?
And what you gonna do when you run out of time, run out of time, run out of time?
What you gonna do when you cross that line, cross that line, cross that line?
?Sticky fingers?
And what you gonna do when you run out of time, run out of time, run out of time?
?Facts and figure ends?
Oh oh oh OH

All we had was good, just like it should
When we were young
We were just nineteen, oh such a scene
When we were young

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I?m sorry
What you gonna do when you cross that line, cross that line, cross that line?
?I told you to eat your dinner?
And what you gonna do when you run out of time, run out of time, run out of time?
?I?m in trouble with you?

All we had was good, just like it should
When we were young
And all you would be kings, you fearless things
Where are you now?

Don?t you throw it away, don?t you throw it away
Don?t you throw it away, away

All we had was good, just like it should
When we were young
We were just nineteen, oh such a scene
When we were young
And all you would be kings, you fearless things
Where are you now?
