A big surprise you fucked with us and now we'll have to kill you
You realize your facin' your last hours on this planet, our planet
No compromise there's nothin' worse than thinkin we don't kick ass
Pulverize cause we don't even care if you know where you went wrong

This time we're not takin' any shit
We're fuckin' through with it
You'll be the one to pay and pay good, you never thought that you would

Blown away by the shear brutality we dished you
You're free to say you'll never turn your back on another, no other
Just throw away the years of trust in people that you've saved up
And who will pay the price for every hardship that you've went through, been done to?

This time you're not takin' any shit
You're fuckin' through with it
They'll be the ones to pay and pay good never thought that they would

This time you'll find blood on your hands
Next time you'll find blood on your lines
They're creepin' up around you
They're comin' out to find you
And your business is their business
Make room on your shoulders

This time you're not takin' any shit
You're fuckin' through with it
They'll be the ones to pay and pay good never thought
This time you're not takin' any shit
You're fuckin' through with it
They'll be the ones to pay and pay good never thought that they would

This time the last clear chance
