Oh, I went up straight
Oh, I went upstate
Where I heard about a boy
A boy

Calm and tranquil now
And we engineer
Something open wide
Some place people hide
I stare

Makes me dream sometimes
Makes me dream sometimes
I dream
I stare
I stare

And when your summer ends
When you're on your last legs
That time can't mend
Will you still bring or fake a smile?
Will we grant you the mercy and the love you require?
These are the things that I must abide

And when your summer ends
When you're on your last legs
That time can't mend
Will you still bring or fake a smile?
Will we grant you the mercy and the love you require?
These are the things that I must abide
