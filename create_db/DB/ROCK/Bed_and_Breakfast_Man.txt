Well, there's a man I know
At least I used to years ago
I didn't really mind
He used to come round all the time

Of course he had to be fed
I had to give him a bed
He used to kip on my sofa
They used to call him a loafer

I've heard he's changed a lot since then
But some of his ways he just can't mend

Till the other day
When he'd offer to pay
He didn't like his bed
He earned all he'd ever had

He didn't have no shame
He was a master at his game
He never showed his hand
He was the bed and breakfast man

Oh, he was, he was the bed and breakfast man
He was, he was the bed and breakfast man
He was, he was the bed and breakfast man
He was, he was the bed and breakfast man
He was, he was the bed and breakfast man
He was, he was the bed and breakfast man
He was, he was the bed and breakfast man
