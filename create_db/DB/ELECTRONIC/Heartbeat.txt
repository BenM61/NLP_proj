Heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart heartbeat

I saw you talking on the phone
I know that you are not alone
But you steal my heart away
Yeah you steal my heart away

You're acting like you're on your own
But I saw you standing with a girl
Stop tryn' to steal my heart away,
Stop tryn' to steal my heart away

I don't know where we're going
I don't know who we are

I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
Running through me
Feel your heartbeat
She said
I can feel your heartbeat
She said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
She said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
Running through me
Heartbeat
Feel your heartbeat

Maybe it's the way you move
You got me dreaming like a fool
That I could steal your heart away
I could steal your heart away

No matter what it is you think
I'm not the kind of girl to blink
And give my heart away
Stop tryin' steal my heart away

I don't know where we're going
I don't know who we are

I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
Running through me
Heartbeat
Feel your heartbeat
She said
I can feel your heartbeat
She said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
She said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
Running through me

Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
You're stealing my heart away

I don't know where we're going
I don't know who we are
Feels like we are floating
High above the stars, the stars, the stars, the stars

Heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart heartbeat
But I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it, I can

I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
Running through me
Your heartbeat, feel your heartbeat
She said
I can feel your heartbeat
She said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
She said to me
I can feel your heartbeat
Running through me
Heartbeat
Feel your heartbeat

Stop stealing my heart away
Tell it to me girl
Stop stealing my heart away
Give it to me boy
Stop stealing my heart away
Say it to me girl
You're stealing my heart away

Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
Your heartbeat.
