I'm going to places we used to go
I still see people we used to know
Friends they ask me where is she now
I have to tell them we're over now

When I question love I thought I'd surely die
I couldn't see a future without you by my side
We're not together but I'm still alive
I'd rather not see you for a really long time

Funny how love is
Funny how love is
Funny how love is

I don't want your magazines I don't want your cloths
Take them from my house let me be alone
If you'll ever tryin' to catch me again I'll go behind the wall
Don't send me letters I don't want to know

When I question love I thought I'd surely die
I couldn't see a future without you by my side
We're not together but I'm still alive
I'd rather not see you for a really long time

Funny how love is
Funny how love is
Funny how love is

Love is so funny, the joke is on me 
Funny how love is...
