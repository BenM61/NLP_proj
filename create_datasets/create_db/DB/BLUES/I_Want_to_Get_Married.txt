I want to get married
But no woman will hear my plea
I want to get married
But no woman will hear my plea

Yes, it seems somehow
I can't get one to walk downthe aisle with me
Well, I've only been in love
But three times in my life

Yes, the first, I couldn't satisfy her
But I've only been in love three times in my life
Yes, the second one was a juice-head
And the third was another man's wife

Yeah, they say "join the navy
If you really want to see the world"
Well, but I say "join b.b. king
Baby if you really want to be loved"

Aw, my time is gone
Babe and I really must say goodbye
Aw, my time is gone
Babe and I really must say goodbye

So you women better watch out
I must have that wife before I die
