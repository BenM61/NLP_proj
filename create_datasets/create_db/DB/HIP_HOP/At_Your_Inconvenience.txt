(Ah mate)

I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience
I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience

(So Steve, where did you grow up?
Upper Clapton, Hackney
How old were you when you first started rapping?
I was 18
Who are your major influences?
Are you serious? Your Mum)

I ain't answering anymore of your questions, 
You know what? I have a question
Who's idea was it to get in the charts, 
By rhyming over Hungarian dance music
Why would I make dance music, when I can't dance to it?
I'm the anecdote to that shit, bringing back strap shit, 
Soon as I'm done calling this bulimic a fat bitch
I'll be saving the day on renegade with the dog, 
Playing fetch watching him chase a grenade
Maybe I should play the same game with Bruno, 
If I ever again get mistaken for a cluedo, 
Character I'm gonna have to unleash my Mitch a judo, 
I just took a shit and now I can't find any loo roll.
Two flows, for everyone that you got too hot, 
I do squat diddily and do more than you do when you do lots, do lots.
Do women do for me what they did not do, 
Maybe it's got something to do with my new watch.

I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience
I'm back, like I never left, I'm here at your inconvenience

I have a question, 
Why would I beat around the bush or take the scenic route, 
When I'm a meanie, born to instigate fumes, I'm the morning, 
Midday and evening news, and I started a trend Mike got his teeth fixed to.
If you're wondering where I've been out, 
Kicked back with a six-pack, of becks on a bench,
Sunbathing in a hijab, give me a tic-tac, I just had a pack of Nik Naks, 
Thanks now I'll turn you into a kebab with my pick-axe.
Mish, mash, mosh-pit, whenever I drop shit, it's hot shit, 
I just won a race with an ostrich.
Obnoxious, preposterous, looney a damn nutter, 
If I ever see Rooney anywhere near my Grandmother ah!
I live life without an ounce of logic, 
I like my wrist so much I spent a house deposit on it. 
Vomit and then I drink more wine, 
Then I broke a bowl and hope the Hospital gives me morphine.
How do you spend your time?

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I don't have a question, nope
When it come to competition, I'm burying them. 
Better to bury them then have them getting lairy again. 
They want it with me like they want it with malaria, 
Like Wayne Bridge wants to be John Terry'd again.
I developed an obsession with Caroline Flack, 
I wouldn't mind having a go on Caroline's, 
Actually I promise to never be so vulgar, 
To never mention putting my cobra inside of Anna Kournikova, I swear

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I'm back, (I'm back)
Like I never left, (like I never left)
I'm here at your, (I'm here at your)
Inconvenience (inconvenience)

I think I've got it out of my system now, you sure?
I am once again ready to answer questions
Good, 'cause there's so much I've been wanting to ask you, about 8 inches, what?
