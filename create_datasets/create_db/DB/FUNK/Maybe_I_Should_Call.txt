Long distance in the way of what could be
Even when you're here, you're not with me
She's having the child I should've carried
I'll be damned if y'all get married
How's the baby? How you adjusting?
Ain't gon work, you got problems trusting
Let me stop, I'm supposed to be focused
But these nights are the coldest

Will you ever let her go? I don't know
Will I ever be first? I hope
But I ain't just sitting around, can't wait for someone to sing my worth
Damn I can't compete with a baby
Is there any room left in your heart for me

I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call,
Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw

Maybe that's why I ain't got a man
'Cause I be doing too much thinking
Tryna compensate for your absence
But no drug can take me where you can
No I just want you where I am
1,000 of them, just want one him
Drowning in all of my excuses
Heart is feeling useless
Probably should've used it less

Will you ever let her go? I don't know
Will I ever be first? I hope
But I ain't just sitting around, can't wait for someone to sing my worth
Damn I can't compete with a baby
Is there any room left in your heart for me

I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call,
Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw

After the last time we talked
Oh, I was a mess
You had me stressed
Oh no no no no no
I wrote the text, I didn't send it
Dialed your number, but said forget it
Oh, what would it change
She's still in the way
But I

I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call,
Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw
