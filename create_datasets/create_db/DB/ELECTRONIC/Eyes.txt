You and I
Could paint the sky together
As the world goes by
We'll go on forever

Look into my eyes
Eyes are the windows to the soul
Look into my eyes
Eyes, oh you will know
There is no surprise
Eyes, because love is plain to see
Look into my eyes
Eyes

Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes

Look into my eyes

Truth is truth
And time can never leap it
This I know
We will always keep it

Look into my eyes
Eyes are the windows to the soul
Look into my eyes
Eyes, oh you will know
There is no surprise
Eyes, because love is plain to see
Look into my eyes
Eyes

Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
