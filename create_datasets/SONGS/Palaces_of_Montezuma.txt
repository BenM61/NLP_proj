Psychedelic invocations
Of Mata Hari at the station
I give to you
A Java princess of Hindu Birth
A woman of flesh, a child of the earth
I give to you
The hanging gardens of Babylon
Miles Davis, the black unicorn
I give to you
The palaces of Montezuma
And the gardens of Akbar's tomb
I give to you
The Spider Goddess and the Needle Boy
The slave-dwarves they employ
I give to you
A custard-coloured super-dream
Of Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen
I give to you

C'mon baby, let's get out of the cold
And gimme, gimmme, gimme your precious love for me to hold

The epic of Gilgamesh
A pretty little black A-line dress
I give to you
The spinal cord of JFK
Wrapped in Marilyn Monroe's negligee
I give to you
I want nothing in return
Just the softest little breathless word
I ask of you
A word contained in a grain of sand
That can barely walk, can't even stand
I ask of you

C'mon baby, let's get out of the cold
And gimme, gimme, gimme your precious love for me to hold
C'mon baby, come out of the cold
And gimme, gimme, gimme your precious love for me to hold

C'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Yeah c'mon
Give it to me
Give it to me
Yeah give it to me
