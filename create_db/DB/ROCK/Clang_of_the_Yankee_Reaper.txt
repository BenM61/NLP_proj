The sun never set on the empire
Prince Albert came in a can

And end up an also-ran

Seen with the Queen he was all smiles
He just bailed out the British Isles
It's time to drink tea from fine china
Just think of him when your light
Starts to dim

Sun in the moonlight, in the moonlight
Gone, just like I said
The good old days are dead
Better get it through your head
As you harken to
The clang of The Yankee Reaper
It's like I said
The good old days are dead
As you harken to
The clang of the Yankee Reaper

Harken to the clang of the Yankee Reaper
The good old days are dead
As you harken to the clang
