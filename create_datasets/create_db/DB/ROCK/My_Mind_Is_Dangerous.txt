I look in the mirror and guess what I see 
A baby blue eyed spirit who seeks your everything 
My mind is chaotic, unless I choose to be free 
Sometimes I just can't help myself, sometimes I just can't help myself 

My mind dangerous, that's who I'll always be 
My mind dangerous, that's who I'll always be 

Hideous devastations, lifeless serenity 
My abstract emotions, somehow, get the best of me 
Lord take away my sorrow, Lord take away my pain 
Erasing life tomorrow, ain't the motive to the game 

My mind dangerous, that's who I'll always be 
My mind dangerous, that's who I'll always be 

Erasing life tomorrow ain't the motive to the game 
Erasing life tomorrow ain't the motive to the game
