The sky was as black as the water
And you could choke on the breeze
And the coal miner's daughters
They were shouting from the trees

Come on come on
And stop staring like a dead man
Come on come on
Baby take my hand

No goodbyes, no sympathy
One by one they were gone
Lord I ain't never felt so weak
Since the day the damn broke
Down at buffalo creek

"Hey don't you know, we ain't got no place
We ain't got no place to go
Hey yeah, don't you know, we ain't go no place to go"

I feel as naked as the day I was born
I was marked by a bad sign
My daddy kicked the bucket in the second world war
My momma drowned in the tears sent down by the lord

They said "come on come on,
You gotta find some higher ground
Come on come on
You ain't got time to be standing around"

No goodbyes, no sympathy
One by one they were gone
Lord I ain't never felt so weak
Since the day the damn broke
Down at buffalo creek

"Hey don't you know, we ain't got no place
We ain't got no place to go
Hey yeah, don't you know, we ain't go no place to go"

I lost my momma
I lost my kin
In the black black river
Makes a man shiver
Again and again and again
