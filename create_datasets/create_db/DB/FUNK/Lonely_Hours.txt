When you must do without him
But your dreams are still about him
You'll begin the lonely hours

When your romance is ending
And your heart has stopped pretending
You are in the lonely hours

Oh, how slow the moments go
When your love disappears
Oh, how slow the moments go
Every minute is a thousand years

You'll say he doesn't want you
But his lips will stay to haunt you
When you know the lonely hours

You'll swear that you cannot hear him
Even though you're nowhere near him
When you know the lonely hours

And yet you know that love
Can make your broken heart mend
'Cause love began it all
And only love can end the lonely hours

And yet you know that love
Can make your broken heart mend
'Cause love began it all
And only love can end the lonely hours

'Cause love began it all
And only love can end the lonely hours
