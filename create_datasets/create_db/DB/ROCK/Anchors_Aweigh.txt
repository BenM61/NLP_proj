Anchors Aweigh my friends, I'll see you another day
I'm going away, expierences have to come
And the past has got to go
Back into our dreams, back into our dreams

Anchors Aweigh my friends
Everybody understands that good times,
That good times they come and they go
And together we will always flow
Back into our dreams, back into our dreams

And our troubles, we can't leave them behind
But the wind blows, and blows them all away
And the road goes...and takes them all away
...back into our dreams
