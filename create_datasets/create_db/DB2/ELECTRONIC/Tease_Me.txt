Head first caught in a whirl, got sex appeal like she got it for real
She likes slow jam jams, and giving out the spunk
Living up first class, go Babylon
Marked men she loves them yeah.
Sweet, hot and naughty togot to like the sound of that
Upside down its a merry go round, she's like a nymphomaniac
My hands never hold her back; she's got a one track God forsaken mind
My God what have I got, My God what have I got
She knows how to turn me on, she knows how to turn you on

I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease
I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease
I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease
I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease

Flashback, its a modern romance, got a Bacharach track for the slow dance
She digs kings, rings and flings, yeah baby that's her thing
Giving up love for love, she's getting good at that
Bad girl, you betcha boy
Fresh, hot and naughty to, gotta like the sound of that
Can't slow down for a second man, she's like an aphrodisiac
My minds got a mind of its own, she's got me spellbound,
Trapped in her little web 
My God what have I got, My God what have I got
She knows how to turn me on, she knows how to turn you on

I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease
I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease
I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease
I like the way that you touch me and you tease me, and you tease
