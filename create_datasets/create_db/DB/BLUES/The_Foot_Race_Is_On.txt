What you look at me for? Look out man
What's the matter with you, I fixin' to, whoa

That man gonna jump on me
And I just got to move on out of his way
That's all there is to it but I'm goin'

Tell me, baby, what you tryin' to do?
Tryin' to mistreat me and I ain't done nothin' to you
Mama told me now understand
Just keep-a truckin' like a man

I'm gone, sure gone
I ain't jokin', no time waitin' on
Just keep on goin'

Look it here, baby, what you tryin' to do?
Tryin' to love me and my brother too
Mama told me now understand
Sit and listen with a plate in her hand

I know, gotta go
Gotta go, pretty baby
God knows I ain't lyin'

See, that's when it's gettin' soft
See, I was gettin' a little tired now
And I just slowed down a little bit
Foot race is on though

Look-a yonder what I do see
Whole lotta somethin' comin' after me but, I'm gone
They'll have a hard time catchin' ol' lightnin'
Now that I got a little air
Feel a little better now

Keep on runnin'
You know they run me, edge of town
They got tired and they turned around
I sure felt good, I didn't have to run no more
I ain't jokin', I ain't jivin'
God knows I ain't carryin' on
