Right in the middle of the cotton belt
Down in the Mississippi Delta
Wearin' last years possum belt
Smack dab in the Mississippi Delta

Have me a little that Johnny cake
A little bit of that apple pan dowdy
Pickin them scuppernon's off that vine
Chigger bite, it's goin' to beat howdy

Ate me a bucket of Muscadine
Sit on the riverbank after dark
Drop my line down a crawdad hole
Do him in with a scaly bark

Right in the middle of the cotton belt
Down in the Mississippi Delta
Wearin last years possum belt
Smack dab in the Mississippi Delta

Sittin and scratchin' mosquito bites
Old fox done give him the slip
Watchin' the mornin' glories grow
In Biloxi on an overnight trip

I bet five dollars to win two bits
Eat a peppermint stick on Sunday
Ain't no use in'a hurrying up
Can't leave till a week from Monday
