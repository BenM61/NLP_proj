Hangin' around with you
Wonderful thing to do
Having a time the moment that I'm with you
Finding a love so true
Something I never knew
Something I found just hangin' around with you

Taking a flier around the blue
Floating through space
Traveling higher than heaven's door
Locked in your sweet embrace
Nothing but loving you
Beautiful thing for two
Paradise found just hangin' around with you

Hangin' around with you
Wonderful thing to do
Having a time the moment that I'm with you
Finding a love so true
Something I never knew
Something I found just hangin' around with you

Taking a flier around the blue
Floating through space
Traveling higher than heaven's door
Locked in your sweet embrace
Nothing but loving you
Beautiful thing for two
Paradise found just hangin' around with you

Paradise found just hangin' around with you
