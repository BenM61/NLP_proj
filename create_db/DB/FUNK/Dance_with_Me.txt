I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
And I really want you to get close to me
So won't you dance with me, dance with me
My drop tops at the parking lot
An I wanna take you back to my spot
But we still got a little more time to rock 
So won't you dance with me, dance with me

I can see you over there 
Just chilling with your girlfriends
Can't believe your by yourself
You should be here with me, chillin with me
Drinking with me, freaking with me oh yeah

I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
And I really want you to get close to me
So won't you dance with me, dance with me
My drop tops at the parking lot
An I wanna take you back to my spot
But we still got a little more time to rock 
So won't you dance with me, dance with me

I can see it in your eyes that
Your looking at the time
You wanna leave this party
And I know you wanna leave this with me
To chill with me, to drink with me,
To freak with me

And I really want you to get close to me
