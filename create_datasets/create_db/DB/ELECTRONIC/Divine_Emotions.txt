Oh, little baby, sweet darling (He's calling, he's calling)
I wanna tell you
Oh, I seem to be falling (He's calling and falling)
Yes, I do

(He's more than curious
He really needs the stuff)
I look at you and I go boing, boing, boing

(He hasn't lost his touch
A word can mean so much)
It's more than just a passing fancy

[Chorus]
(Divine emotions come over me when you smile)
Oh, when you smile, baby
(A higher notion of ecstasy drives me wild)
Come on now, just drive me wild

Oh, I'm drowning this time (He's sinking, he's sinking)
Since I got the taste of
Oh, your lips on my mind (He's sinking and thinking)

(She thinks the boy is nuts
Somebody she can trust)
I try to speak and I go ding-dong-ding

(He makes it sound so nice
The girl's not made of ice)
Toto, look I think she's melting

[Chorus]

(Divine emotions come over me when you smile)
I love the way you love me, girl
(A higher notion of ecstasy drives me wild)
Come on, dear baby, dear baby!

Ow!

(Divine emotions)
(Divine emotions)

(Divine emotions come over me when you smile)
Oh, oh, the way you smile at me, baby
(A higher notion of ecstasy drives me wild)
Oh, oh, baby love, yeah

Oh!
Yeah, yeah
(Divine emotions)

Come on, baby, hold me close
Ha
(Divine emotions)

We could be a serious love-thing, you understand what I'm saying?
(Divine emotions)

Hey, oh!
Come on, baby, come on, baby!
(Divine emotions)
