Sittin at home all alone. I hear a voice
On the telephone.
Telling me that you're dead.
You wrecked your car, you lost your head
Said you had a car crash,
Now you're dead on the road with your head smashed.
I heard the news, it can't be true
Oh it might happed to you.
Whoa whoa whoa no no no
Whoa whoa whoa no no no
Why did you leave me? Why did you go?
Knew this would happen and I told you so.
But you didn't listen to what I said
Forget it baby, you lost your head.
I dreamed you had a car crash
And dead on the road with your head smashed.
Heard the news. Can't be.
How could you have done this to me?
Whoa whoa whoa no no no
Whoa whoa whoa no no no
Sittin at home all alone. I hear a voice
On the telephone.
Telling me that you're dead, man you lost your head.
Whoa whoa whoa no no no
Whoa whoa whoa no no no
