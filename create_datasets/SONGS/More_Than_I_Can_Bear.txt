I thought that I was over you 
How I was mistaken
Why did I bump into you
And start this chain reaction, mm

I felt it building up inside
When suddenly
Oh, it was more than I can bear
Mm, more than I can bear

When I saw you
Walking down the road with someone new
I couldn't believe it was true
It was true, yeah

I find it hard to sleep at night
This jealousy is burning bright
Visions of somebody else
Torments me to distraction, oh yeah

I think of him
Making, making love to you
It's more than I can
Oh, it was more than I can bear
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, girl

(It's more than I can bear)
Walking down the road with someone new
(It's more than I can bear)
I couldn't believe that it was true
(It's more than I can bear)
It was true

When I saw you
(It's more than I can bear)
Walking down the road with someone new
(It's more than I can bear)
I closed my eyes
I know I'm not over you
(It's more than I can bear)
Over you

When I saw you
Walking down the road with someone new
I closed my eyes
I know I'm not over you
Mm, I still love you, baby

(It's more than I can bear)
Yeah, I still love you baby
(It's more than I can bear)
Hey, I still love you baby
(It's more than I can bear)
Yeah, yeah

It's more than I can bear
