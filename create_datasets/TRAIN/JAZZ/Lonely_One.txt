There is a very quiet boy
They call the lonely one
There is sorrow in his face
And sadness in his eyes
And if you look into the heart
Within the lonely one
You'll find it's been deceived
That broken was in lies.

Is it good to have cried?
With the longing to hide
All your heartaches and fears.
Is it wise to be cold, and to
Struggle, to hold back with tears.
If you could only see the boy
They call the lonely one,
You'd know that since you're gone
The lonely one is me.
