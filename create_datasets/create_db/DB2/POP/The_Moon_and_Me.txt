Sometimes when I wake at night,
I lose myself a while... 
And I pray to the moon despairingly, 
Comfort me, please comfort me
For sometimes, my smile won't smile, 
And my laugh won't laugh
And my heart grows cold and lonely, 

Open like a book, my heart, it reads broken sentences, 
And for pages you turn and the chapters you read, 
It's though my story will never seem to end,
For sometimes my gears won't change and my clutch gets stuck 
And my wheels won't turn on empty 

So if at night you hear a voice, it may be the moon and me, 
Or if at times you lose your light then ask the moon to shine on you!
Join the moon and me
The moon and me... 

And though the world is a cruel cruel place at times
They say a mans not meant to shed a single tear ... 
Oh well if you like me, simply disagree 
Then when the day lays down to sleep, creep beneath the moon with me
For sometimes, my smile won't smile
And my laugh won't laugh
And my heart grows cold and lonely 

So if at night you hear a voice, well it may be the moon and me, 
Or if at times you lose your light then ask the moon to shine on you!
To shine on you... to shine on you...
Join the moon and me!
