Who knows how to make love stay
Help before it gets away
That's the quest of the day
Who knows how to make love stay

We had a love, it was something to see
Everybody's talkin' about you and me
Now it's gone but the question remains
How can someone so god cause me so much pain
Now talk to me baby

Who knows how to make love stay
Help before it gets away

I been down all day, I been up all night
Thinking about this
I been to school, ain't no fool
But all I know now is I don't know how

We had a love, Thought that it would never end
But now it's over and we're not even friends
Sometimes I'm lonely lonely baby
Thinkin' about you and me
I wonder how much it costs oh to be so free
Talk to me baby
