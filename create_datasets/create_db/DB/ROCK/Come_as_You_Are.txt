They hung a sign out,
Sign out at the seven,
Down at the hive of such a busy bee,
So sorry honey sign up for heaven, 
The guilt tonight is you and me.

Come as you are now come on woop woop,
Come as you are and we'll have a ball,
Ain't gonna be no masteray woop, woop,
Come as you are or don't come at all.

He'll be a hot time hot time at the lake side,
Barry and the boys are filling in for free,
We'll jump and move and take it for a joyride,
I still get up there for you and me.

Come as you are now come on woop, woop,
Come as you are and we'll have a ball,
Ain't gonna be no masteray woop, woop,
Come as you are, or don't come at all.

I'm just a bluebird bluebird at your window,
And its for sure you're a pretty sight to see,
But lives are short I know what you're into,
Come on it's you and me.

Come as you are now, come on woop, woop,
Come as you are and we'll have a ball, 
Ain't gonna be no masteray, woop, woop,
Come as you are,or don't come at all.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Come as you are now, come on woop, woop,
Come as you are and we'll have a ball, 
Ain't gunna be no masteray, woop, woop,
Come as you are,or don't come at all.

Come as you are!
