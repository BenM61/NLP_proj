Blues with a feeling, that's what I have today 
Blues with a feeling, that's what I have today 
I'm gonna find my woman if it takes all night and day 

What a lonesome feeling when you're by yourself 
What a lonesome feeling when you're by yourself 
When the one that you're loving has run off with someone else 

You know I love you baby 
Tell you the reason why 
Gone and left me, baby 
Left me here to cry 

Blues with a feeling, that's what I have today 
I will find my woman if it takes all night and day 

What a lonesome feeling ... repeat as before 

You know I love you baby 
... repeat as before 

Blues with a feeling, that's what I have today 
I will find my woman if it takes all night and day
