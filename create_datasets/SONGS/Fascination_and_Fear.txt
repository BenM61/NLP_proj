In stillness so much motion inside
In silence within I hold a deafening cry
My needs can never be satisfied
For my love will never be realized

I can almost feel your heart beating
See confusion in eyes so clear
The line between fascination and fear

I battle a thought every second
For I don't feel as I was taught
I want to swim the river forbidden
I want to climb the mountain denied

I can almost feel your heart beating
See confusion in eyes so clear
The line between fascination dnd fear

My needs can never be satisfied
For my love will never be realized

I can almost feel your heart beating
See confusion in eyes so clear
The line between fascination and fear
