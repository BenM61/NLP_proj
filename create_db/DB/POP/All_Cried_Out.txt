Around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around

You took your time to come back this time
The grass has grown under your feet
In your absence I changed my mind
And someone else is sitting in your seat

I know that I said that there'd be no one else
I know that I said I'd be true
But baby, I burned Cupid's arrow
And here's the short and narrow
I've nothing left to offer you

I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around

So don't look surprised there was no disguise
You knew where I stood from the start
So stop, look around you
You're right back where I found you
Take back your cold and empty heart

I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around

I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of love
I'm all cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around

Around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around

You go your way
I'll go mine
I won't stay around here
Don't you waste my time

All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving 

I'm all cried out
You took a whole lot of love
I'm all cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving me around

Around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around

You go your way
I'll go mine
I won't stay around here
Don't you waste my time

All cried out (all cried out)
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
You took a whole lot of love
All cried out
You took a whole lot of loving for
A handful of nothing
All cried out
It's hard to give you something when
You're pushing and shoving 
All cried out (all cried out)
You took a whole lot of love
All cried out
