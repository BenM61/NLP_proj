You've left me with nothing left but questions
You left me here not knowing who I am
You've left me so much fucking time to hate you
You left me with no choice but to die

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings

Your voice whispers nearly all the time now
Reminding me just how worthless I am
Sometimes I just hear your laugh forever
I want you the f*ck out of my head

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings

You're inside my pain inside my sorrow
I die for one last moment inside you
I miss you so fucking bad I am you
Whose god will fucking save me now

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings

Violent    Mood    Swings
Violent    Mood    Swings
