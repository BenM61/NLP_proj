Jump so high

Tie me down, try to hold me up
But the wall ain't high enough
And they play so hard
In a game so rough
But I still can't
Give it up

I'm out there on my own
Work but I got to get some
Run it right into the sun
Oh (jump so high)
(So high)
I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right (so high, high, high)
I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right

Find your life
In the darkest sky
And the stars burn
Inside our eyes
Cutting through the days
To our glory days
We won't give up
Never too late

I'm out there on my own
Work but I got to get some
Run it right into the sun
Oh (jump so high)
(So high)
I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right (so high, high, high)
I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right

Yeah, we finally made it
You know they hate it
I swear to God
Knowing just what you are
Made you into a star
Made you into the man
No one else like this
Before the house was a house
It was on my wrist
It's the island life, yeah mahalo bitch
Went from ashy to classy
I'm aloe rich, I stay Aloe Blacc
Man, Bino back
Man he never left
I smoke loud I'm deaf
Your smoke plead the fifth
I know the glory
They hate on your shine
'Cause they know the story
Thrown to the wolves but your drive so Mowgli
I could drive through the hood
And them, boys, they know me
Is he one of the greatest
Time will tell
But time is relative
They assume the melanin
And they kill the culture
This might insult ya
White man can't jump, and I
(Jump so high)

I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right (so high, high, high)
I jump so high (so high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right
