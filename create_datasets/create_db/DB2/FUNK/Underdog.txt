Hey, dig

I know how it feels to be expect to get a fair shake
But they won't let you forget
That you're the underdog and you've got to be twice as good
(Yeah, yeah)

Even if you're never right
They get uptight when you get too bright
'Cause you might start thinking too much, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

I know how it feels when you know you're real
But every other time
You get up, you get a raw deal, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

Say, I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog
Say, I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog

I know how it feels to get demoted
When it comes time you got promoted
But you might be movin' up too fast, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

If you ever loved somebody of a different set
I bet the set didn't let you forget
That it just don't go like that
(Yeah, yeah)

I know how it feels
For people to stop, turn around and stare
Signify a lil' bit of low life, don't rate me, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
I don't mind

I'm the underdog
No, I can handle it
I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog, yeah
Underdog

Said, I know how it feels to be played upon
(Incomprehensible)
But you're really, you're really all alone
They just underestimate me
(Yeah, yeah)

I know how it feels when you're feelin' down
And you wanna come up but you realize
You're in the wrong part of town, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

I know how it feels to have to go along
With people you don't even know
Simply because there happens to be
A whole lot more of them, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

Say, I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog
I don't mind, 'cause I can handle it
Underdog, it's gonna be alright
I'm the underdog
