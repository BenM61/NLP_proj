Switchback!
Switchback!
Switchback!
Switchback!

I made a choice that I regret,
now what I see is what I get.
It's too late to look back.
I've got no way to switchback.
it's too late to look back.
Ain't OK, I've got no way to switchback.

Switchback!
Switchback!

Wait, how can it be too late?
'Cause I don't want to play
with such a price to pay.
It's too late to look back.
(Too late to)
Ain't ok, I've got no way to switchback.

A painful picture that I can't forget.
Now what I see is what I get.
It's too late to look back.
I've got no way to switchback.
It's too late to look back.
Ain't OK, I've got no way to switchback.

Switchback!
Switchback!

Wait, how can it be too late?
'Cause I don't want to play
with such a price to pay.
Chained to what I can't reclaim.
I'll never be the same.

It's too late to look back.
(Too late to)
Ain't ok, I've got no way to switchback.
(Have a way to)
It's too late to look back.
(Too late to)
Ain't ok, I've got no way to switchback.

It's too late to look back,
I've got no way to switchback.
It's too late to look back,
I've got no way to switchback.

It's too late to look back,
I've got no way to switchback.
It's too late to look back.
Ain't OK, i've got no way to switchback.

Switchback!

Wait, how can it be too late?
'Cause I don't want to play
with such a price to pay.
Chained to what I can't reclaim.
I'll never be the same.
Will be the same again.

Ain't OK, I've got no way to switchback.

It's too late to look back.

Ain't OK, I've got no way to switchback.

I've got no way to switchback,
it's too late to look back.
Too late to look back.
Ain't OK, I've got no way to switchback.
