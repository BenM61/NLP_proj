Forever Yahweh, Yahweh

So our hope is God Almighty
And His love is greater than all
So lift high the God of Heaven
And give all the honor

So we look to Yahweh, Yahweh
Our hope is Yahweh, Yahweh

And He shall reign forever
He shall reign forever, He shall reign
Forever and ever
And He shall reign forever
He shall reign forever, He shall reign
Forever and ever, our God

We look to Yahweh, Yahweh
Forever Yahweh, Yahweh
And we look (to Yahweh, Yahweh)
Sing our hope

And we look to Yahweh, Yahweh
Forever (forever Yahweh, Yahweh)
