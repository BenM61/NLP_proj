I want to made man don't care bout what you heard
I don't care what you think
I don't care what they say

We fly threw friendly skies touchdown
Blow smoke out the roof blue bentley crew
Roll up sho' nuff all sold up
Know us hit the spot and get tore up
Show up wit a gang of cars
Valet to parley straight to the bar
Woo skinned suits Timberland boots
Spend enough loot when Made Men come through
We ball wit the ballas all bout dollers
Floss 10 G's in gems round they collars
Luxury life bring a buggin device
but I'm straight up so I'm lovin my life
On a average night might bag ya wife
And make off like a thief with a bag of ice
Box in my goochie watch blow tight
For the whole night I shine like a strobe light

I want to made man don't care bout what you heard
I don't care what you think
I don't care what they say

I see you watchin gettin mad 'cause I'm gettin this done
Made Men yo 5 double 0 benzito
My neck and my wrist wear ice no doubt
I'ma still be shinin when the lights blown out
Get it right I'ma big dog recognize
When you see us comin threw best step aside
Take heat to tha game dog watch and learn
I'ma ball till I'm 80 wit cheese to burn
Gotta keep my eyes open when I bounce in the range
Since I'm stackin change you be lookin strange
but that's alright that's all good
still the flossiest nigga in the whole neighborhood
Should I hit em wit a penny or cop a drop
We be blazin hot made men won't stop
and when the club let out I'll be sittin in my ride
waitin for the shorty that I bagged aside

I want to made man don't care bout what you heard
I don't care what you think
I don't care what they say

Round up the crew and head to the strip place
Luke's chosen booze and expensive drinks
The game out my mouth that I spit at shorties
Go 0 to 60 like a 740
I'm droppin things coppin things
95 diamonds in my pinky ring
I stay O T still cash pile
You know the new style blue reptile
When we show up in the club don't hate
Cause we straight and to blow up we won't wait
Love from the bar free Dom P
Sightsee after G get tipsey
I'm gonna need a spot wit a dime and some change
Move from tha 1500 to the range
Got made men and the system buggin
Compared to my crew your crew say nothin

I want to made man don't care bout what you heard
I don't care what you think
I don't care what they say

I want to made man don't care bout what you heard
I don't care what you think
I don't care what they say

I want to made man don't care bout what you heard
I don't care what you think
I don't care what they say

I want to made man don't care bout what you heard
I don't care what you think
I don't care what they say
