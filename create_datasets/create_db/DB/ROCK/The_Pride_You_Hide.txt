I'm not the kind of guy to let jealousy
Break me up inside
I've got no time for sympathy
That girl she's just a memory
Over which I'll glide 

Some say that I shouldn't care
That I should celebrate now she's out of my hair
But Lord knows, the pride you hide
Hanging around the same old parts
And driving in the same old cars
With the same old friends
Those weekends I spent on my own
At first I found it hard alone
Now I'm on the mend
A voice tells me that I was such a fool
to throw away everything I had with you
but Lord knows, the pride you hide 
When you're breaking up inside
Lord knows, the pride you hide 


The pride you hide, when you're breaking up inside
Every single day sees this man break down and cry
Try and find the strength to make it through the day
Try and find the strength to say come back and stay
And all my emotions lying in the snow
We're walking down the streets where the two of used to go
Somewhere over there from the door of a street cafe
I hear that old blues guitar play 

I found some things of yours today
An old guitar you used to play
Threw 'em all away
They took me to another place
I smelt your perfume saw your face
With your hair that way
All that happened was a stupid mistake
I acted like a fool now it's too late
I'm another lonely guy with no heart for forgiving
Without you around, I find it so hard living. 


Lord knows 
The pride you hide, when you're breaking up inside
Lord knows 
The pride you hide, when you're breaking up inside
The pride you hide, when you're breaking up inside
The pride you hide.
