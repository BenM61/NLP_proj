Dale dale eh parampapampam

Parampapampam
"Quema"!
Parampapampam
C'mon c'mon

Let's play forget conversation
Let's break for my situation
Let go from sun down to sun day
I see "a-a-trvete"

When the beat drops we go parampapampam
All the girls show off their parampapampam
All the boys play on your parampapampam
Everybody here wanna get them some?

Drummer boy come play us a song
Everyone where-ever you from
Lovers hit us all and along
Marching to the same parampapampam
Drummer boy wher-ever you are
Hear the sound and beat of my heart
Let the rhythm play till we're done
Marching to the same drum, c'mon

Dale dale eh
Parampapampam
Dale dale eh
Quema!

Your groove is gettin' me tipsy
Swing all around you like a gypsy
Can't help to move to your rhythm shot
I see "no digas que no"

When the beat drops we go parampapampam
All the girls show off their parampapampam
All the boys play on your parampapampam
Everybody here wanna get them some?

Drummer boy come play us a song
Everyone where-ever you from
Lovers hit us all and along
Marching to the same parampapampam
Drummer boy wher-ever you are
Hear the sound and beat of my heart
Let the rhythm play till we're done
Marching to the same drum, c'mon

Parampapampam
Quema!
C'mon c'mon
Dale dale eh parampapampam
Dale dale eh parampapampam
Dale dale eh parampapampam

Drummer boy play on, play on
Drummer boy play on, play on

Drummer boy come play us a song
Everyone where-ever you from
Lovers hit us all and along
Marching to the same parampapampam
Drummer boy wher-ever you are
Hear the sound and beat of my heart
Let the rhythm play till we're done
Marching to the same drum, c'mon
Drummer boy come play us a song
Everyone where-ever you from
Lovers hit us all and along
Marching to the same parampapampam
Drummer boy wher-ever you are
Hear the sound and beat of my heart (oh dale dale)
Let the rhythm play till we're done
Marching to the same drum, c'mon
