Back down memory lane
I began as my fathers bright idea
A short time later 
They all watched in awe 
And all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark
But it was only because I was a believer
I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around 
And thought don't worry mama this city's gonna have you
Georgia
You'll always be home to me
Georgia
I belong to you
And yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on
Using mostly dirt roads
Until I find my way
Campbelton road
Cant forget cascade
There is somethin' about Atlanta that doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me.
And my old man is very stealth cant be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather
