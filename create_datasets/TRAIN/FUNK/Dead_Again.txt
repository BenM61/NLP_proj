No more your freaking bullshit
No more you talking of lies
No more you put me down
Deceptive blue eyes
Wake up and smell the coffee
Wake up and take a pill
You think I won't go on without you
You really think I'll fail
You really are a fool
You sentimental fool 
And I kinda feel sorry for you

What's going around
You talking me down
But I found out that
So it was you
So it was you
You picked up the knife
And then you cut me in two
You stabbed me in the back
And then you twisted it in
Oh, oh, oh
You left me for dead again

No more you blame Jesus
Why don't you pick a name
I thought that you were normal
But you are devil insane
I tried to keep it grounded
'Cause it's no good for my health
But you really can't save a man from himself
This so much I can say
Before I turn to pray
All times with you

'Cause what's going around
You talking me down
But I found out that
So it was you
So it was you
You picked up the knife
And then you cut me in two
You stabbed me in the back
And then you twisted it in
Oh, oh, oh
You left me for dead again
So it was you
You picked up the knife
And then you cut me in two
You stabbed me in the back
And then you twisted it in
Oh, oh
You left me for dead again

Soldiers foremost
You are no proof

So it was you
It was really you
You picked up the knife
And then you cut me in two
You stabbed me in the back
Then you twisted it in
Oh, oh
You left me for dead again
You, so it was you
You picked up the knife
And then you cut me in two
You stabbed me in the back
And then you twisted it in
Oh, oh
You left me for dead again
You left me for dead again
