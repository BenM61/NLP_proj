If I lose my head, beg your pardon,
For things I have said, beg your pardon.
Why should I worry and feel like I do?
You're in no hurry to let me love you.

I'll try for a kiss in the garden.
And then if I miss, beg your pardon.
But if some sunny day,
you'll let me have my way,
I won't have to say, beg your pardon.
