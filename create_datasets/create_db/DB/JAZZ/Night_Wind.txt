Love was blown away by the night wind
And the dream we shared fell apart
Now I'm all alone in the night wind
Wind that brought the blues to my heart

Yesterday my arms were around you
And your lips revealed you were mine
Then the angry wind came and found you
Came to end the moment divine

Oh the night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't want me
Why is lover's lane filled with shadows
Stars no longer shine up above

I'll be waiting there in the shadows
'Til the night wind brings back our love
Oh the night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't, you don't want me

Why is lover's lane filled with shadows
Stars no longer shine up above
I'll be waiting there in the shadows
'Til the night wind brings back our love

I'll be waiting there, let you know I care
'Til that night wind brings back our love
