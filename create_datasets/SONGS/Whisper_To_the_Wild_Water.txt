Change the words
Don't change the meaning
Change the hands
But don't change the healing
Change the tune
Don't change the feeling
Change the heart
But don't change the needing

I heard Your voice
Whisper to the wild water
Step By Step
Slowly I turn

Change the words
Don't change the meaning
Change the hands
But don't change the healing
Change the tune
Don't change the feeling
Change the heart
But don't change the needing

I felt the wind
Wounding my soul with love
Keep me safe
In Your heart

Change the words
Don't change the meaning
Change the hands
But don't change the healing
Change the tune
Don't change the feeling
Change the heart
But don't change the needing

Around, around
Around I turn
Around I turn
In time

I heard Your name
Whisper to the wild water
I'll be strong
I will survive

Change the words
Don't change the meaning
Change the hands
But don't change the healing
Change the tune
Don't change the feeling
Change the heart
But don't change the needing
