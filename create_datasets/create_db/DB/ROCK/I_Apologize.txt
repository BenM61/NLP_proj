It's taking over
It feels like familiar regret
It get's me started
There's many things I should have said
I find it hard but I'll try, I'll try

For all the times
For all the cries
For all the pain I've caused
I apologize
Lay down my pride
Give me one more chance
Before you walk away

Time goes by now
What you can't seem to forget
I took for granted
All of the things that I had
I know I hurt you
Hear me out, hear me out

For all the times
For all the cries
For all the pain I've caused
I apologize
Lay down my pride
Give me one more chance
Before you walk away

I understand the way you're feeling (just don't walk away)
I know there are a million reasons (you've got to walk away)
I let you down
But please just hear me out (before you walk away)
Before you walk away

For all the times
For all the cries
For all the pain I've caused
I apologize
Lay down my pride
Give me one more chance
Before you walk away
Before you walk away
