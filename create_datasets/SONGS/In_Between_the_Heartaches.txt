In between the heartaches
You hold me here in your arms
And say you love me
In between the heartaches
The way you kiss I can tell
You're thinking of me

I know you love me
And I that makes up for all of the heartaches
And the sadness
And the tears

Everyone keeps asking me
Why I stay with you
The way you hurt me
They can see
How many times
I'm alone and blue
When you desert me

You and come and go
Without a letter
And they all say
That I should get up and go
They don't know

They don't know that In between the heartaches
You hold me here in your arms
And say you love me
In between the heartaches
The way you kiss I can tell
You thinking of me
 
I know you love me and that makes up for all the heartaches
And the sadness
And the tears

They don't ever see us
In between the heartaches 
You hold me here in your arms and say you love me
I know you love me and I that makes up for all of the heartaches
