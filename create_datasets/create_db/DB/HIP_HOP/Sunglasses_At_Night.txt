I wear my sunglasses at night,
Roses are red, Skepta violets are blue
I wear my sunglasses at night
And girl better know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you

I wear my own glasses
Man see me outside I want passes
But if your name ain't down,
You ain't coming in,
There's no two way about it
Roses are red, violets are blue
Can you see me? Cause I can see you
I don't want a table, look at the view
It's my party look at the queue
Put your sunglasses on
Dance with me to my glasses song
I'm too extra, girls say skepta
Tell me where you get your glasses from, please?
Garry knows Ned, Garry knows me,
Pull up outside with JME
And TI please for the VIP
'Cause we ain't leavin till half past three

I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you

I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
