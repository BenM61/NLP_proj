Make me feel like a beggar 
Make me feel like a thief 
Make me feel like a battle, that cannot end in peace 
Make me feel like running, as if I've lost my nerve 
Make me feel like crying, tears I don't deserve 

Please bleed 
So I know that you are real 
So I know that you can feel 
The damage that you've done 
Who have I become 
To myself I am numb, I am numb, I am numb 

Is this really living 
Sometimes it's hard to tell 
Or is this a kind of gentler hell 
Turn out the lights 
And let me stare into your soul 
I was born and bled for you old 

Please bleed 
So I know that you are real 
So I know that you can feel 
The damage that you've done 
Who have I become 
To myself I am numb, I am numb, I am numb 

Never said thank you 
Never said please 
Never gave reason to believe 
So as it stands I remain on my knees 
Good lovers make great enemies 

Please bleed 
So I know that you are real 
So I know that you can feel 
The damage that you've done 
Who have I become 
To myself I am numb, I am numb, I am numb
