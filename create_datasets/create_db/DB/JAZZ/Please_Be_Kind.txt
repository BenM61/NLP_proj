Well, this is my first affair, please be kind
Handle my heart with care, please be kind
This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade
If you'll just understand, they'll never, never fade

So tell me your love's sincere, please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, please be kind
'Cause if you leave me, dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please be kind

This is my first affair, so  a-please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh  a-please be kind

So tell me your love's sincere, yes, please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, please be kind
'Cause if you leave me, dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, baby, please be kind
