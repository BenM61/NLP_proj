On a bright day she passed away, in the morning
It's a cruel way, to take her away with no warning
He took her hands through every midnight hour
And then he saw her fading away like a spring shower

I can see a complete life's time
Pictures and posters of times and fashion
Nineteen years with no reason or rhyme
Taken away in a crime of passion

He stood to see if he could catch her breathing
But it was no good, he understood she was leaving
He looked outside the frosty windowpane
And then he saw her moving away, Elizabeth Jane

I can see a complete life's time
Pictures and posters of times and fashion
Nineteen years with no reason or rhyme
Taken away in a crime of passion

I see freedom in sight, it's a long climb
But she would not give up the fight for a long time
And I see a light come shining in tonight
Baby, it's all right, we couldn't have changed it with second sight

I can see a complete life's time
Pictures and posters of times and fashion
Nineteen years with no reason or rhyme
Taken away in a crime of passion

I see freedom light shining in the night
I see freedom but she wouldn't give up the fight

I see a light go shining in tonight
Baby, it's all right, we couldn't have changed it with second sight

I see a light go shining in tonight
Baby, it's all right, we couldn't have changed it with second sight

I see a light go shining in tonight
Baby, it's all right, we couldn't have changed it with second sight

I see a light go shining in tonight
Baby, it's all right, we couldn't have changed it with second sight
