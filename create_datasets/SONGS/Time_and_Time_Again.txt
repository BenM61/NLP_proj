OW-OW!

Yes I did it and I'll do it again
It doesn't matter if I am your best friend
I don't think so
You're not that smart
Over and over it breaks my heart

The cycle continues, time for your crime
The pain comes back in an ugly design
Her makeup smears
The tears that she cries
Over and over every night

Emotional swords slash my soul
And now the pain, it takes control
I think about you
I think about me
I think about the way that it used to be

I need a bottle
I need some pills
I need a friend
And I need some thrills

A shoulder to cry on
A friend to depend on
When life gets rough

Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me

It's like a fight every single day
It's always easy when you have it your way
Deep in my heart
In the depths of my soul
My selfish ways are out of control

I'm sorry that it comes down to this
I punch through the wall as I break my fist
Her makeup smears
The tears that we cry
Over and over every night

Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me

You're so selfish
You're making me want to end this
Relationship
You're making me want to end this

Loving ties unwind
Loving ties unwind

Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me

Time and time again (you're so selfish)
You think about yourself before you think about me
Time and time again (you're so selfish)
You think about yourself before you think about me

Loving ties unwind
Lost time behind
Loving ties unwind
Lost time behind
