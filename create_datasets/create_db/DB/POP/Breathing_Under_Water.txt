There's a light in the dark where the sky splits apart 
Where the stars find a way to shine through all the spaces in between 
Here we are, face to face, all alone in this place 
And the night is finally coming down to you and me 

Tell me where you been hiding 
Oh, I want to know, oh
You're my silver lining covered in gold 
Tell me what am I feeling 
Well, it's hard to explain 
Like underwater breathing, swimming in rain 

Oh oh, all I really wanna do, do 
Is fall a little deeper with you, you 
Never come up 
Breathing, breathing underwater 
Weightless with every little kiss you steal, boy 
You are making me feel, feel 
Like I'm breathing 
Breathing, breathing underwater 

Wanna fly through the blue bay on the bottom with you 
Getting lost in the waves, let the world slip away 
Where nobody can find us, I don't wanna be safe 
Leave it all behind us, make an escape 

Oh, tell me what am I feeling 
Oh, it's hard to explain 
Like underwater breathing, swimming in rain 

Oh oh, all I really wanna do, do 
Is fall a little deeper with you, you 
Never come up 
Breathing, breathing underwater 
Weightless with every little kiss you steal, boy 
You are making me feel, feel 
Like I'm breathing 
Breathing, breathing underwater 

Wanna go to the edge 
Wanna dive in again 
Here we are, face to face 
All alone in this place 
And it's finally coming down to you and me 
Breathing under

Oh oh, all I really wanna do, do 
Is fall a little deeper with you, you 
Never come up 
Breathing, breathing underwater (breathing under)
Weightless with every little kiss you steal, boy 
You are m-making me feel, feel (breathing under)
Like I'm breathing 
Breathing, breathing underwater (breathing under)

Oh oh, all I really wanna do, do 
Is fall a little deeper with you, you (breathing under)
Never come up 
Breathing, breathing underwater (breathing under)
Weightless with every little kiss you steal, boy 
You are m-making me feel, feel (breathing under)
Like I'm breathing 
Breathing, breathing underwater 

Breathing under 
Breathing underwater 
Breathing underwater, oh
