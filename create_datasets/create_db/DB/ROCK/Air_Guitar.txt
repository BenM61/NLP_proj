I never was a cool kid
No one ever really gave a damn what I did
I loved to party, but I never got invited
Alone again so, me, myself and I

Tried karaoke
But they told me I was only ok
I guess I never should have sang Beyonce or MJ
So I dropped the mic

Oh, yeah
All the people in the bar turned 'round and stared
I was on my knees and whipping round my hair
And I knew that I was winning

Close my eyes and see the crowd
But my fingers don't make any sound
My air guitar

I keep it with me night and day
You won't believe the way that I can play
My air guitar
Air guitar
Like this

(Bom chicka wah wah)

In my head I am a rock star
And I probably date a popstar
A popstar and a model on the side

I know I'll never make it
But tonight I'm good enough to fake it
Bend an imaginary string and break it, replace it
In the backstage of my mind

But I know my friends all think I'm living such a lie
But the lie they think I'm living gets me high
It's the gift that keeps on giving

Close my eyes and see the crowd
But my fingers don't make any sound
My air guitar

Jimmy Page and Brian May
Won't believe the way that I can play
My air guitar
Air guitar
Like this

And you think there's nothing there
It's simply made of air
You laugh but you're just scared
Try it if you dare

Air guitar
Air guitar
I take it with me everywhere
Yeah, but you don't even know it's there
My air guitar
Air guitar

Close my eyes and see the crowd
But my fingers don't make any sound
My air guitar

I keep it with me night and day
You won't believe the way that I can play
My air guitar
Air guitar
