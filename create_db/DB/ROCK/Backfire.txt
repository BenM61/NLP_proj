Please tell me
Why are we
Trying so hard

Why worry
It's over
We always fall right back
To where we start

There goes another one of our
Sure-fire plans
It backfired again
We try to think it through
The best that we can
I bet it's gonna backfire again

Take what its
Given you
How does that sound
Everything is
All thought through
And fool-proof
Now watch it all
Crumble down
And down again

There goes another one of our
Sure-fire plan
It backfired again
We try to think it through
The best that we can
I bet it's gonna backfire again!
Backfire again
It's gonna backfire again!

Knives dont carry
Laws that vary
They're just what we fought on
Save me coffin
Scars are talking
Tell us where we are
(Where we are now)
Where we are now
(Where we are now)
Where we are now
They ah! A ah! A ah! talking
They ah! They ah
Were telling them a story!

There goes another one of our
Sure-fire plans
It backfired again
(Sure-fire plans)
We try to think it through
(Yeah yeah Oh!)
The best that we can
I bet it's gonna backfire again!
(A ah! Backfired again)

There goes another one of our
Sure-fire plans
(Sure-fire plans)
It backfired again
We try to think it through
The best the we can
(Backfired again!)
I bet it's gonna backfire again
