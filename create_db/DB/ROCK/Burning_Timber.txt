Where is everybody going
Always learning never knowing
Try to stop the world from turning
But it won't slow down

I was the one you gave your heart to
But after all, what did it get you
It was enough to put an end to
The rising flames

We stand like burning timber
Helpless among the cinders
I prayed for rain when the sky was blue
What else could I do

We need to work our way around it
And let it be the way we found it
The more that everything keeps changing
The less we are gaining

We stand like burning timber
Helpless among the cinders
I prayed for rain when the sky was blue
What else could I do

You build me up to cut me down
You fight me tooth and nail
Now hand in hand we walk alone
Along this blazing trail
