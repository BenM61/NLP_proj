Is it all make believe?
Is it all make believe?
Don't abuse the trust I place in you

If I should bend and break
You force me to walk and wait
No one will wait for you
'Cause you never asked them to

If a moment you got caught
You'd stop and see it's enough
Even you are not complete

Is it all make believe?
Tell me now make believe
I'm a tent of paying you other pegs

If I should stop to breathe
Just to get over it
I wouldn't wait for you
'Cause you never asked me to

If a moment you got caught (passed you by)
Deny and reveal your lies
Even you are not complete (not complete)

For a moment just retreat
Tonight you lie down defeat
Even you are not complete
