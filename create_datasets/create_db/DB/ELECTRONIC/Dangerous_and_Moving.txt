You take it all away
But never give it back
And this is what you say
Their lies are yelling back

And this is how they move
And this is how they sway
That danger is the truth
They die and come again

Obstacles and signs
Perilous and looming

Dangerous and moving
Dangerous and moving

Obstacles and signs
Perilous and looming

Dangerous and moving
Dangerous and moving

No mercy for the lost
No soothing for the sad
The line is never crossed
They are the living dead

And this is how they move
And this is how they sway
That danger is the truth
They die and live again

Obstacles and signs
Perilous and looming

Dangerous and moving
Dangerous and moving

Obstacles and signs
Perilous and looming

Dangerous and moving
Dangerous and moving
