Even though the weight was heavy
I was happy under levy
Wanna take my ride for place
In the Mississippi Basin back home
Where I did at home

Everybody was for me there
All the folks work on and free there
Used to love to wash my face
In that Mississippi Basin back home

There goes summer land
That's the song I'm singing all day
Even something, baby
Why did I leave you, why did I go away

Soon I'm gonna make a bee line
But an old place for me and
Way across the basin, dig line
That Mississippi Basin back home
