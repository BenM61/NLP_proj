How would you feel if I was to kneel right down
At your feet? Right now
Is the way it's going to be from now until forever
Let's have less of getting clever with me

Who would you blame for blowing the flame right out
Is it me? There is no doubt
I can do what I want to do from now until forever
Let's have less of getting clever with me

You're wasting your time and my time as well
L-l-living a lie, I guess that time will tell
You're making excuses for the things you've never done
Walking in circles, blinded by the sun
Blinded by the sun

Who would you blame for blowing the flame right out
Is it me? There is no doubt
I can do what I want to do from now until forever
Let's have less of getting clever with me

You're wasting your time and my time as well
L-l-living a lie I guess that time will tell
You're making excuses for the things you've never done
You're walking in circles, blinded by the sun
Blinded by the sun

I don't mean to sound unkind to you
You'll just have to go and find something else to do
And don't ask me what went wrong
The list goes on and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on
The list goes on and on
