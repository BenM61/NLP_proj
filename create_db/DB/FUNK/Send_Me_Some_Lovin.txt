(Send me some loving)
Mmm, send it, I pray
How can I love you
When you're so far away

Whoa, honey
Send me your picture
Oh, send it, my dear
So I can hold it and
Pretend you are near

Can you send me your kisses
I still feel your touch
And, oh, I need you so badly
I want you so much

My days are so lonely
Oh, my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm longing
And I'm waiting for you

Now, I want you to
(Send me some loving)
Send me some of that loving, baby
(Send it, I pray)

Send it, I, I, I pray
(How can I love you)
How in the world can I love you
(When you're so far away)
When you're so, so, so far away

(Send me your picture)
Send me your picture, baby
(Send it, my dear)
Oh, send it, my dear

(So I can hold it)
I want so badly to hold it
(And pretend you are near)
And I, I wanna pretend
That you're near

(Send me some loving)
Send your loving, baby
(Send it, I pray)
Oh, send it, I, I, I
