Cut off your nose
To spite your face
Slowly send your palms away

Draw fire crawl out
And seek the shade
Slowly send your palms away

A fine line will set you apart
Swallow my name, swallow it down
Sing me a song

Shoot the breeze
Shake my hand
Across the fire, I caught your stare

Sing me a song
You today
You today
You today
You today
A beacon will send you home
A beacon will send you home

A fine line will set you apart
Swallow my name, swallow it down
Sing me a song.
Shoot the breeze
Shake my hand
Across the fire, I caught your stare
Sing me a song

You today
You today
You today
You today

A fine line will set you apart
Swallow my name, swallow it down
Sing me a song.
Shoot the breeze
Shake my hand
Across the fire, I caught your stare
Sing me a song

You today
You today
You today
You today

Cut off your nose
To spite your face
Slowly send your palms away
I heard you say
I will not shame
You today
You today
You today
You today
You today
You today
You today
