Whatever I do for you, girl, it's just not enough
Wherever I take your ass, seems like you started somethin'
Should've known what we got into before we started fuckin'
Try to play by your rules, but it's still not enough

Girl you got me buggin', I can't front
Everythin' I do is not enough for you
Know that I've been tryna keep it cool (ooh yeah)
But I ain't got no patience to put up with you

I find it difficult to try and say
Sometimes you make me feel some type away
Sometimes I need a little time and space
I try, but I still feel like I can't please you

Du-du-du, not enough
Du-du-du-du, not enough
Du-du-du-du, not enough
Not enough for you
Du-du-du, not enough
Du-du-du-du, not enough
Du-du-du-du, not enough
Not enough for you

Know that one chick, that thinks she's so bad
That she don't listen, just run her mouth
She keep on thinkin' you owe her somethin'
You think you might have to cut her out
Shit got you like
Huh, I don't need her anyway
She probably cheatin' on me anyway
Still let a nigga hit it any day
Shawty I don't games, I ain't tryna play

I find it difficult to try and say
Sometimes you make me feel some type away
Sometimes I need a little time and space
I try, but I still feel like I can't please you

All that noise that you're makin' over there
Just take it over there, take it over there
Shawty got problems, she take it over there
Take it over there, just take it over there

All that noise that you're makin' over there
Just take it over there, take it over there
Shawty got problems, she take it over there
Take it over there, just take it over there

All that noise that you're makin' over there
(I ain't buying no flowers)
Just take it over there, take it over there
(She too used to be devil)
Shawty got problems, she take it over there
(I need me or Mariah)
Take it over there, just take it over there

All that noise that you're makin' over there
(Like the type that I'd die for)
Just take it over there, take it over there
(What the f*ck do I try for?)
Shawty got problems, she take it over there
(What, forgot that I lie for)
Take it over there
