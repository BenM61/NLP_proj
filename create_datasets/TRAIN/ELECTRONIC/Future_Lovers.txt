Spoken:
I'm gonna tell you about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills, and loans
Come with me
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

Spoken:
In the demonstration of this evidence
Some call it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide love inside their eyes
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free
Put away your past
That will never last
If you're holding on to a dream that's gone
I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
There's no love like the future love
Come with me

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride, Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride, Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
(In the evidence of its brilliance) (repeat)
(In the evidence of its brilliance) (repeat)
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride, Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Brilliance?
Brilliance?
Brilliance?
Brilliance?
In the evidence of its brilliance
