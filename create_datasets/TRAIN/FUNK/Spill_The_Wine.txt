I was once out strolling,
One hot summer day.
When I thought I'd lay,
Myself down to rest.

In a big field,
Of tall grass,
I lay there in the sun and I,
Felt it caressin' my face.

As I fell asleep,
I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star,
Of the movie.

This really blew my mind,
But there I was,
Oh yeah I was.
I was taken to the place,
The hall of the mountain king.

I stood high upon the mountaintop,
Naked to the world.
In front of me,
Was every kind of girl.

There was long ones, tall ones,
Short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones,
Big crazy ones.

Out of the middle,
Came a lady.
She whispered in my ear,
Somethin' crazy...

Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

I thought to myself,
What could this mean?
Am I going crazy,
Or is it just a dream?

Now wait a minute...

I know I'm lying,
In a field of grass somewhere.
It was all in my head.
But then I heard,
Somebody say...

Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

I could feel hot flames,
Of fire roaring at my back,
As she disappeared.
But soon she returned.

In her hand was a bottle of wine,
And in the other, a glass,
Good god.

She poured some of that wine,
From the bottle into the glass.
And she raised it to her lip,
And before she drank it, she said...

Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on and take that pearl.

Spill that wine!

Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

Spill, spill, spill...
Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.

Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

Come on and spill that wine.
Take that pearl.
Come on spill that wine.
Take that pearl.

Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

Come on and spill it...
Come on and spill it...
