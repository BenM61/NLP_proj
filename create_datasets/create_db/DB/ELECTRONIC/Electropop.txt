Why don't we just take a drive?

Using up this bar we play
Then we make our getaway

Like Juliet I'm femme fatal
Take your pick I'll play them all
Each one to satisfy depending on the type of guy

I'm just a nervous type
Put me in your spotlight

Only if we take it home

Men without backing out
That is how I strategize
So hold your breath for this surprise
