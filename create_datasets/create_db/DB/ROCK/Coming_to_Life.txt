I always listened to the same sad song in the wintertime when I drive home 
Then her and Id sit on her couch where we used to dream of falling in love 
And all this time I thought that she had killed me 
And all these years I spent in the graveyard weeping 

But I feel blood pouring through these veins after all 
And I feel blood washing through these stains after all 
And I am coming to life 

I spent a thousand lone cold nights thinking I would gladly hurt if I could feel 
I spent a thousand empty days just looking for a girl to make me real 
And all this time your face was all around me 
And all those loving arms that held me so close 

And I feel blood pouring through these veins after all 
And I feel blood washing through these stains after all 
And I am coming to life 
All I taste and all I feel all I found is you is real and right and I am coming to life 

You are the breath I breathe You hold me to belief 
You died so I could be alive and free from me and I am coming to life
I used to listen to the same sad song in the wintertime when I drive home 
Then her and Id sit on her couch where we used to dream of falling in love
