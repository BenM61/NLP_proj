Another love has ended (another love has ended)
Like so many in the past (a million loves in the past)
And people now are saying ( everybody's saying)
I just knew it couldn't last (it just couldn't last)

Another fool is suffering (another fool, another fool)
In a world of despair ( and it's so lonely there)
Trying not to show (don't let people know)
How much he really cared (he really, really cares)
Another promise spoken (an empty promise spoken)
To love forever more (I'll love you forevermore)
And then my heart was broken (another heart was broken)
Like so many hearts before (a million hearts before)
The hand of fate descended
Another love has ended
When a new love started for you

Another promise spoken (an empty promise spoken)
To love forever more (I'll love you forever)
And then my heart was broken (another heart was broken)
Like so many hearts before (a million hearts before)
The hand of fate descended
Another love has ended
When a new love started for you
When a new love started for you (another love is ended)
