Always in a rush
Never stay on the phone 
Long enough
Why am I so self important?

Said I'd see you soon
But that was, oh, 
Maybe a year ago
Didn't know time
Was of the essence

So many questions
But I'm talking to myself
I know that you can't hear me
Anymore, not anymore

So much to tell you
And most of all goodbye
But I know that you can't hear me
Anymore

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I
Should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back
The words I never said

Always talkin shit
Took your advice
And did the opposite
Just being young and stupid

Oh
I haven't been all that you
Could have hoped for
But I you held on 
A little longer
You'd have had more reasons
To be proud

Oh
So many questions 
But I'm talking to myself
I know that you can't hear me 
Anymore, not anymore
So much to tell you
And most of all goodbye
But I know that you can't hear me
Anymore

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I
Should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back
The words I never said

The longer I stand here
The louder the silence
I know that your gone
But sometimes I swear 
That I hear
Your voice when the wind blows
So I talk to the shadows
Hoping you might be listening 
'Cause I want you to know 

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I
Should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back
The words I never said
