I never used to cry 'cause I was all alone 
For me, myself and I is all I've ever known 
I never felt the need to have a hand to hold 
In everything I do I take complete control 
That's where I'm coming from 
My lucky number's one 

I've everthing I need to keep me satisfied 
There's nothing you can do to make me change my mind 
I'm having so much fun 
My lucky number's one 
Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh! 

I now detect an alien vibration here 
There's something in the air besides the atmosphere 
The object of the action is becoming clear 
An imminent attack upon my heart I fear 
The evidence is strong 
My lucky number's wrong
Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh! 

Something tells me my lucky number's gonna be changing soon 
Something tells me lucky number's gonna be oweoweoweoweoweowe

You certainly do have a strange effect on me 
I never thought that I could feel the way I feel 
There's something in your eyes gives me a wild idea 
I never want to be apart from you my dear 
I guess it must be true 
My lucky number's two 

This rearrangement suits me now I must confess 
The number one was dull and number two is best 
I wanna stay with you 
My lucky number's two 
Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh! 

Number two, number two
