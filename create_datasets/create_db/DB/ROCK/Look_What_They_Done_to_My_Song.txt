Look what they done to my song ma 
Look what they done to my song ma
It was the only thing that I could do half right 
And it's turning out all wrong ma 
Look what they done to my song 

Look what they done to my brain ma 
Look at what they done to my brain 
Well they picked it like a chicken bone 
And I think I'm half insane ma 
Look what they done to my song 

Oh I wish I could find a good book
To live in 
Oh I wish I could find a good book 
Well if I could find a real good book 
I'd never have to come out and look at 
What they done to my song 

Ils ont change ma chanson, ma 
Ils ont change ma chanson, ma
C'est la seule chose que je peux faire 
Et ce n'est pas bon, ma. 
Ils ont change ma chanson. 

Maybe it'll all be all right ma 
Maybe it'll all be OK
Well if the people are buying tears 
Then I'm gonna be rich someday ma 
Look what they done to my song 

Look what they done to my song, ma 
Ma Ma look look what they done to my song 
You know they tied it up in a plastic bag 
And they turned it upside down ma 
Ma Ma look at what they done
Won't you look at what they done
Look what they done to my song.
