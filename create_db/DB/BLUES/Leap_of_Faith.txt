Had enough of the bad times
Won't be nobody's fool for free
Coming up on the good times
This is how things are supposed to be

I tried so hard to please everyone else
Always putting myself last
I tried so hard to feel what they're feeling
I tried so hard to make it last

A leap of faith That's what they call it
A leap of faith I feel so free now
A leap of faith No one will hold me down again
A leap of faith

Looking back at what I've done
Can't find anything worth learning there
Only know it's time to have fun
It's time to live without having a care

I do believe there's a happy ending
To this little fairy tale plan
Now I know I won't break if I'm bending
I'm gonna give it all I can

A leap of faith That's what they call it
A leap of faith I feel so free now
A leap of faith No one will hold me down again
A leap of faith

Knock down the doors and throw out the books
Nobody's coming before me now
I'll hold my head higher and higher
I'm gonna take my stand now

A leap of faith That's what they call it
A leap of faith I feel so free now
A leap of faith No one will hold me down again
A leap of faith
