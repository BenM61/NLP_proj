A women in your soul
Creates the man you hold
And when the night comes
When you relax with me

I'll make you dream
So just remember this

A smile is just a smile, with you

Come to me, say you will
And like a storm I can help you feel
You must believe you hold the key
Come to me, say you will

You are divine, your body holds me tight
You can't imagine, kiss so we'll know
(Kiss... know, who knows?)
(Just you) I want you always [Repeat x 2]
I want you always [Repeat x 2]

A woman needs to feel alive
A woman needs her sex
A woman needs her sex
A woman needs...
