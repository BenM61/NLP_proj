Who's the boy I like the most
Is it is teasing you he's underage
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset
Static silhouette somehow
Single in his bed someday
Quiet til he fall fall falls

Rome Rome Rome Rome
Focus looking forward the coliseum
Oh no what did I say
What can I say
Rome Rome many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving you look the other way

I am easy to ignore
Shutters open all the way
When the scandal that I see I'll go insane
Distant silhouettes somehow
We shared a cigarette somewhere
I looked to the fall fall falls

Rome Rome Rome Rome
Focus looking forward the coliseum
Oh no what did I say
What can I say
Rome Rome many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving you look the other way

Always and forever more
I called to say I'm on the way
1,000 years remain in the trashcan
I burned the cigarette somewhere
Ashes still it fall fall falls

I stand outside under broken leaves
I know I can't do without
The future's drowned away

Ah I never loved you
And if I loved you
I wouldn't say I'm sorry oh no
I stand outside under broken leaves

Always and forever more
And together getting lonely
I thought I couldn't do this without you
Single in his bed somewhere
Ashes still it fall fall falls
