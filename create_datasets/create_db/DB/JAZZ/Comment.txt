Watch out for your friends
Well, they may lose in the end
Sometimes their child can make you sin
What is a man without a friend?

We all live within a game
The word, 'Excuse' has many names
Where true friends really come
You can't afford to lose one

If all men were truly brothers
Why then we hurt one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion

All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? And what about me?
This world is filled with hate, there's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll never rescue yourself

Well, jealousy, as I recall
Has always been man's hardest fall
To conquer fear, that's quite a quest
Until we do never rest

A child was born yesterday
Oh, nothing but an innocent babe
Someone sowed a bitter seed
How could it grow but a bitter weed?

Society, how can you teach, I wanna know
If you don't practice what you preach?
That's right

If all men were truly brothers
Why then, can't we love one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please second my emotion

All men were born to be free, yeah
What about you? What about me?
This world is filled with hate, there's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll only hurt yourself

Hey you, over there, I wanna know why you left
With all your riches and your fancy things
Can you tell me how many friends
Can you truly say you have?
