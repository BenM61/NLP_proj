crazy, crazy i'm the boy
who defies all
lift me higher than anyone
and hold me arms
woman, woman she outta mind
and simply out of soul
she gets me higher than anyone
i miss her so

stargazer you call the shots
and i take um
stargazer won't ya kick with me
(again)

dancer dancer i'm all wrong
she thinks she's young and wise
she dance around my cable car
and fix me up with a guy - why?

stargazer you cry in blue
anything i've ever seen
ain't as good as you
i'm not trying to push your feelings (inside)
but i know you hold me like a putty in yo' hands
cry for me and rub it in
cry for the saviors and the prophets son
dream of me and julie ann
...oh xana come back again
