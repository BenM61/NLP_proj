Woman, don't you know what I'm suffering from?
Ease my pain, make it wash on with the rain
Relieve me and put it up on your shelf
Take it away, and give it to somebody else

'Cause I know we're connected by love
Yes, I know we're connected, connected, connected by love
Yeah, I wanna be directed by your love
Connected by love

Friend of mine, you seem to know me best
You chose me out of all of the rest
Take me home with you, and help me forget
Let's take the worst and somehow turn it into the best

'Cause I know (We're connected, we're connected)
We're connected by love
Yes, I know (We're connected, we're connected)
We're connected
Connected, connected by love (We're connected, we're connected)
Yeah, I can't be rejected by your love (We're connected, we're connected)
Yes, woah!

What have I done?
I have pushed away everyone
Help me forget
Let's put it all to bed
Forgive me, and save me
From myself
Don't forsake me, woman
And go and choose somebody else

'Cause I know (We're connected, we're connected)
We're connected by love (We're connected)
Yes, I know (We're connected, we're connected)
We're connected, connected, connected by love (Oh)
Yes, I'm infected, I need to be protected by your love
We're connected, we're connected
(We're connected) Connected, connected by love
