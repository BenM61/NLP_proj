Been another blue day without you girl 
Been another sad summer song 
I''ve been thinking about you girl 
All night long 

Been another sad tear on my pillow 
Been another memory to tell me you''re the one, girl 
I kept thinking about you girl 
All night long

Been another story from those endless magazines 
Can''t help thinking about you girl 
All night long

Was so happy when I found you 
But how was I to know 
That you would leave me walking down that road 

Been another hard luck story 
Been another man who thought that he was oh so strong 
Been thinking about you girl 
All night long
