It's your voice in my ear
It's your perfume in the air
It's your smile and your laugh
It's the greatest feelin' that I've ever had

I'm into you, girl
I get more confident each time you call my name
I'm into you, you, girl
I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
I'm into you, you, girl

From your hair to your toes
You're like sunshine to my soul
Every move that you make
Tastes like candy to my brain

And I'm so in love with you
And I'm hopin' you love me too
And I'm havin' such a lovely time
I get so excited girl, you blow my mind

I'm into you, girl
I get more confident each time you call my name
I'm into you, you, girl
I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
I'm into you

I got something for you
And I hope you think it's good
I gotta a plan on pickin' you up
And givin' you all my love

I wanna give you everything
Whatever you want I'll do, yeah
'Cause I'm shakin'
Girl, I'm makin', I just can't take it

I'm so into you, you, girl
I get more confident each time you call my name
I'm into you, you, girl

I'm into you, you, girl

I got no self defense, I'm helpless
You can have your way
I'm into you, you, girl

Into your heart, girl, your soul, baby

I like your vibe, girl, the way you move
I wanna spend more time
Into you, you, girl
You make me laugh, baby, I'm so glad, girl
For what we have
I'm into you, girl, yeah

I got no self defense, I'm helpless, baby
I guess I must admit I, I wanna spend my time, girl
