I ain't talkin' just to tease
People like you, you don't grow on dreams
Look at you, that's what it's gonna be
Have everything I need
Around my soul book Christmas tree

Merry Christmas, happy New Year
I love you, have good cheer
I love you, good God

Got my baby, my precious love
Happiness, good God, I got plenty of
Would you believe I got peace of mind
And I'll be groovin' at Christmas time

Merry Christmas, happy New Year
May you have a good cheer
I love you, James Brown love you
Your luck is so and so, missin' you
Brother love

Soulful Christmas like a sweet melody
I'm a lucky you so and so
The bells gonna ring for me

Merry Christmas and a happy New Year
To all of my fans, have a good cheer
I love you, I love you, won't take nobody else
I can't stand myself, huh, good God

I got a heart full of love for the whole wide world
And a little special love, my little soulful girl
I got this feelin' every, every night and then
Gotta get ready, bring the New Year in

Merry Christmas and a happy New Year
All good cheer, there's one more thing
You've been so nice to me down through the years
And I'll always remember you, well, I'll never forget

You bought my records, come to see my show
That's why James Brown love you so
You come to see my show
That's a debt that I'll always owe

Come to see my show, see you at Christmas
Come to see my show, see my show
