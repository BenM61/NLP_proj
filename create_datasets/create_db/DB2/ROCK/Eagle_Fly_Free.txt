People are in big confusion
They don't like their constitutions
Everyday they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well your life seems quite bizarre

In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
Let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind
Follow the sign
Together we'll fly someday

Hey, we think so supersonic
And we make our bombs atomic
Or the better quite neutronic
But the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays the air's polluted
Ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed
To create a better time

In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
Let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind
Follow the sign
Together we'll fly someday

In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
Let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind
Follow the sign
Together we'll fly someday

Together we'll fly someday
Forever we'll fly
Together we'll fly 

Forever we'll fly someday oh oh oh
