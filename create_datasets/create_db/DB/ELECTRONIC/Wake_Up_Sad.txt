Don't tell me you can't help it
You're old enough to know the score
Why'd you need the love so much
If they fall, you hate the touch
What's the problem in your soul
Leaves a gaping deep black hole
Why'd you need so much attention?
You hate it when I try to mention
How it's something not to play with
Don't pretend there's just a little

Don't tell me you can't help it
You're old enough to know the score

You know one day you'll wake up sad
You know one day you'll wake up sad
You know one day you'll wake up sad

Don't tell me you can't help it
You're old enough to know the score
When you can't destroy their will
Keep on fighting 'til you kill
Call me so good call me weak
Do anything to hear you speak
Why'd you pick the easy way?
Never believe a thing you say
Have to wonder deep inside
What it is you try to hide

Don't tell me you can't help it
You're old enough to know the score
You know one day you'll wake up sad
You know one day you'll wake up sad

So don't tell me that you love me
