Oh no, there you go again 
You're so trying to pretend 
I don't exactly what you 
Are thinking about me but you 
Don't know that I feel the same 
I'm so tired of playing games 
Are you just afraid I won't be 
Feeling you, but baby, you'll see 

I've got what you need and more 
But you've got to make it yours 
I've got what you want for sure 
So what are you baby waiting for? 

Baby, I already know that you want me 
So what will it take for you to tell me 
I'm down for you; to be with you 
All you've got to say is 
Bring it to me 
Why are you procrastinating
Leaving me anticipating 
To be with you, be down for you 
All you've got to say is 
Bring it to me 

So now we're all alone 
Got your chance to let me know 
No reason to let time go by 
Ain't getting no where so if I 
Make a move then would you care 
Could you handle it from there 
If you're ready get your, together 
Cause I ain't ever gonna wait forever 

I've got what you need and more 
But you've got to make it yours 
I've got what you want for sure 
So what are you baby waitin' for?

Baby, I already know that you want me 
So what will it take for you to tell me 
I'm down for you; to be with you 
All you've got to say is 
Bring it to me 
Why are you procrastinating
Leaving me anticipating 
To be with you, be down for you 
All you've got to say is 
Bring it to me 

Boy, you got me fantasizing 
About the things that we could do 
And now my temperature is rising 
What's it gonna take to be with you? 

Baby, I already know that you want me 
So what will it take for you to tell me 
I'm down for you; to be with you 
All you've got to say is 
Bring it to me 
Why are you procrastinating
Leaving me anticipating 
To be with you, be down for you 
All you've got to say is 
Bring it to me 

I already know that you want me
