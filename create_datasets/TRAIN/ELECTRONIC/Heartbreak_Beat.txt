I'm a hearbreak beat
Yeah, all night long
And nobody don't dance
On the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on 
And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got
There's a heartbreak beat
Playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love
Got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
And the beat don't stop
And we talk so tough
And there's a perfect kiss
Somewhere out in the dark
But a kiss ain't enough
And the world don't stop
Everytime that you call
And the world don't stop
Everytime that you fall
There's a heartbreak beat
Playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love
Got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
I'm a hearbreak beat
Yeah, all night long
And nobody don't dance
On the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on 
And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got
There's a heartbreak beat
Playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love
Got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
I'm a heartbreak beat
I'm a heartbreak beat
I'm a heartbreak beat
