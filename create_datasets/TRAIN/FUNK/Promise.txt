One more glass
A million more days
One more smoke
Release me from my ways
Break the mold
Break you're back
Break the promise you made
Seek the world now
Don't look back
Make you're promise today
Leave the safety
Leave this life
Leave before it's too late
It's your only chance
Don't pretend romance
Keep the new promise you made
What if I wasn't so scared?
Why can't I be brave?
I've forgotten all that we shared
You can't give me what I crave
One more glass
Take another pill
One more day
I feel like I could kill
What if you let me walk away?
You think it's me who needs to be saved
Your life a tragic, self-centered play
You never gave me what I craved
What I want
You can never give
What you want
My dead life to live
Break the mold
Break you're back
Break the promise you made
Seek the world now
Don't look back
Make you're promise today
Leave the safety
Leave this life
Leave before it's too late
It's your only chance
Don't pretend romance
Keep the new promise you made
Break the mold
Break you're back
Break the promise you made
Seek the world now
Don't look back
Make you're promise today
Leave the safety
Leave this life
Leave before it's too late
Seek the world now
Don't look back
Make your promise today
Keep the new promise you made
Keep the new promise you made
