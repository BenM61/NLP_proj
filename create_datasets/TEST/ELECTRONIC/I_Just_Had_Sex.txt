Sometimes
Something beautiful happens
In this world

Oh
Akon
And Lonely Island

You don't know how to express yourself so
You just gotta sing

I just had sex
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside her (her)
I just had sex (Hey!)
And I'll never go back (never go back)
To the not having sex
Ways of the past

Have you ever had sex?
I have, it felt great
It felt so good when I did it with my penis

A girl let me do it
It literally just happened
Having sex could make a nice man out' the meanest

You'll never guess where I just came from
I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling it was the best

When I had the sex
Man my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done

Oh hey, didn't see you there
Guess what I just did
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest

Well sure
Nice of her to let you do that thing
Nice of any girl ever
Now sing

I just had sex
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside her (her)
I Wanna tell the world

To be honest
I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense
But man, screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing
She could be my wife
That good?
The best 30 seconds of my life
My life!

I'm so humbled by a girls ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly I'd have sex with a pile of manure
With that in mind the soft, nice smellin' girl's better
She let me wear my chain and my turtle neck sweater

So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them
If you're near or far, whether short or tall
We wanna thank you all for lettin' us f*ck you

She kept looking at her watch
Doesn't matter, had sex
But I cried the whole time
Doesn't matter, had sex
I think she might have been a racist
Doesn't matter, had sex
She put a bag on my head

Still counts
I just had sex
And my dreams came true (dreams came true)
So if you had sex in the last 30 minutes
Then you're qualified to sing with me
I just had sex (everybody sing!)
And it felt so good (we all had sex!)
A woman let me put my penis inside her
(I wanna tell the whole world!)
I just had sex (I just had sex!)
And I'll never go back (no, no, no!)
To the not having sex
Ways of the past
(And it felt so great)
