Out of the west, hands I have pressed beckon to me
Over the sea waiting for me lonely and blue
Somebody sighs, somebody cries, I love you, I love you

Drifting in dreams, drifting it seems back to the shore
Where hand in hand over the sand we'll stroll once more
Heart of my heart, we'll never part, I hear her say
But with the dawn my dreams have gone astray

I hear the voice of my land
A-callin' me it seems
Those fair Hawaiian islands
My isle of golden dreams

I hear the voice of my land
A-callin' me it seems
Those fair Hawaiian islands
My isle of golden dreams
