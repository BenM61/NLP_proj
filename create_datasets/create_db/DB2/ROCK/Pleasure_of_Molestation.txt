Conquest is my art!
Some say, in God's ear.
I'm yours 'til you find my noose.
Your name, brought us here.
To molest, this evil boy.

Leprosy.
God's own destiny.
Their gathering.
Brought you to me!
At the altar they recently found you.
Running loose with hellish volition.
In here your soul will be dead.
All livings beings will rot in Hell!

Call my name, I will be.
An admission that ceased to exist.
I curse, thee whom I save.
Darkening, will son be here.

Wait, sacrifice my live.
With this evil unholy knife.
With the opening hand to a god.
F*ck Jesus Christ!

Slaves of the Lie, they needed eyes.
Users, beggars, believe yours.
I won't deny!

Dying, for God, I'm not with him.
Crime, is in our... hearts.
You not reveal!

Leprosy.
God's own destiny.
Their gathering.
Brought you to me!
At the altar they recently found you.
Running loose with hellish volition.
In here your soul will be dead.
All livings beings will rot in Hell!

Sacrifice a virgin on your knife.
Would you be a servant, for Satan or mankind?
Sacrificing pieces of your life.
I carry no grief, for Jesus Christ!
