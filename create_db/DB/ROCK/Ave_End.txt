Let us to your heart now
Let us to your soul
Deeper deeper deeper
But it's over and out
Oh let me finish it
And when it all ends
I touch you
And when it all ends
I give you all
Be mine and be higher
And swallow all you need
And we will die for us
For that time it is gone
I hate you my dear
Faster faster faster
Shall I beg for you not
But what else can I do
I have you in my heart now
Let a tear for our end
Sooner sooner sooner
Let us beg for us
End
