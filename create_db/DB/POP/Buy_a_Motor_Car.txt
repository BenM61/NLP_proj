Buy a motor car
And drive
Somewhere you believe
Far away from me

I am not sure
If I am alive
If everything I see
Live inside of me

I want to think
You've got it made
The birthday candles
The serenade
But all this time
You're half-afraid
Yeah, I know

Buy a motor car
And drive
Halfway to the sea
Don't know when I breathe

No one's listening You
No one really talks
The way you want
Talked to

I love to think
You've got it made
The birthday girl
The big parade
But all this time
You were afraid
And I know
