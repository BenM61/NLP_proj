23

23 seconds, all things we love will die
23 magic, if you can change your life

Your tainted heart, my tainted love, repent now
How many times ?
As long as you live, how many times ?
The world will go around

He was a friend of mine, he was a son of god ... he was a son of a gun

23 seconds, in you I see a chance
23 magic, if you change the name of love

Your crazy heart, my crazy love, repent now
How many times ? As long as you wish
How many times ? The world will go around
How many times ? As long as you want
How many times ? The world will go around

He was a friend of mine, he was a son of a gun ... he was a son of god
