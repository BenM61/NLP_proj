On a Monday, I am waiting
Tuesday, I am fading
And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
Then the phone rings, I hear you
In the darkness is a clear view
'Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody, messy
I get restless, and it's senseless
And you never seem to care
When I'm angry, you listen
And me happy is a mission
And you won't stop 'til I'm there

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom, crash, you're all I have

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know everything I'm about to say?
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face I hope it never goes away, yeah

On a Monday I am waiting
And by Tuesday I am fading into your arms, so I can breathe

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
Oh, I love how you can tell
Oh, I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
