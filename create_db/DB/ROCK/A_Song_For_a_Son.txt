This is a song for a son
This is a song for a sailor
The best I ever had
This is a song for a kid
This is a song for a tailor
Who stitched up my old hearts
Who stitched up my old hearts

And I
I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come
I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come

This is a song for a dove
This is a song for a blown out bird
The kind that don't return to the nest
This is a song for a star
This is a song for a space invader
Who flew into the sun
Never to return
Never to return

I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come
I am one of many more, many more to come
Many more to come

This is a song for a son
This is a song for a sailor
The son I never had
He sailed without a map
This is a song for that kid
This is a song for that tailor
Who stitched up my old hearts
Before I broke it all
All apart

I am one of many, many more to come
Many more to come
I am one of many more, many more to come
Many more to come

Ye daughters of the revolution
Carry back your sons
Carry them back home

Ye daughters of the revolution
Carry back your sons home 

This is a song for a son
This is a song for a sailor
The best I ever had
He sailed without a map
