Counterfeit, counterfeit
That's what you're, shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this
And I make her bleed
Liquid blood stain from your finger
Say what do you see?
Remind you that whatever you get is
What you want it to be (You want it to be)

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends 'get out the way' of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 

Coming back coming back
To a place where, I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders,
But I, don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror, reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view (fall out of view)

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends 'get out the way' of all the lightning hitting the trees today?
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend

Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend 
Oh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
