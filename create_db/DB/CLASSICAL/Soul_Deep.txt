Something happens when you kiss me
Don't know where you end and I begin
Closer than skin

Time stops
And I'm suspended
Far out on the edge where true love is
want to' go there again

You get into the heart of love
The secrets inside me
I can't help but fall each time you touch me
It's soul deep
Oh, there are places only you can reach
Baby, you know you get to me 
Soul deep

All night
And all day long you're
With me at every single breath I take
I feel so away

You get into the heart of love
The secrets inside me
I can't help but fall each time you touch me
It's soul deep
Oh, there are places only you can reach
Baby, you know you get to me
Soul deep

Deep as the rain
Deep as the sun
Deep as the sea
Deep as a rose
Deeper than deep is what we begun
This emotion

You get into the heart of love
The secrets inside me
I can't help but fall each time you touch me
It's soul deep
Oh, there are places only you can reach
Baby, you know you get to me

Soul deep
