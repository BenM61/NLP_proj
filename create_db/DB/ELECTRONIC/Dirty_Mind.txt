Don't you feel it tonight, said you wanna be free?
No you don't mind
'Cause what's mine is yours and yours is mine
My mind we on this to keep
Turn down for what? I'm not taking a breather
Can't help myself, I'm surrounded by divas
I can just tell how you look at me, stare at me, watching me watching you think like a freak
Hotel, motel, I don't kiss and tell
She sent me, she can't hide that tongue in mascara
You like it, I love it
That kinky, that yell
I know I'm in trouble, but I clean up well

Road rage, gold cage
Drink up, this gon' be a long day

Mmm, my skin diamond loosey
T-tie me up, shine me up, give me that bubblegum flavor
Caramel lolli-pop it for papi and drop it for papi, but papi won't save her
You're hot as a, hot as a
Hot as a sunburn in Africa
Me on Stephanie, you on Erica
Two on two, baby, we need the camera

Road rage, gold cage
Drink up, this gon' be a long day
I done got up in your mind
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya now
