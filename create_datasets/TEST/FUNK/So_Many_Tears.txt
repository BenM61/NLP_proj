Dee da da dee da da

Sat down to write you a letter
Promised I'd write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That I don't even know what to say

I don't know where to start
Don't know how to begin

When our love was beginning
It was so right and so true
Now here I am and it's ending
Trying to find as it was to you

I don't know where to start it
Don't know how to begin
And I don't even cry anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, are my tears
So many tears
So many tears

Someone is being so loveless
There's jealousy played its part
Brand new begin, but I don't understand
Trying purposely to break my heart

I don't know where it started
Don't know why it began
Was it my or something
Why did you make life so tough
Swore that I'd love you only
But it never seems to be enough

I don't even know where it started
Don't know why it began
And I don't even cry anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, so many tears
So many tears
So many tears

It's hard, so hard to watch you
Destroy what took so long to find
You say that you care about mine
Tell me when did you stop caring for mine

I hold on faithfully
Each night was always the same
My request must have gone on deaf ears
'Cause the answer never came and that's why

I don't even cry anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, are my tears
So many tears
So many tears (so many tears)

No
Sat down to write you a letter
Promised I'd write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That there's only one thing left to say

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

I don't even know where it started
Or know how it began
So many tears

When our love was beginning
It was so right and so true
Now our love is ending
And I have so many tears
So many tears

And I don't even cry anymore at night
And I don't think that anyone hears
So many tears
I have so many tears
