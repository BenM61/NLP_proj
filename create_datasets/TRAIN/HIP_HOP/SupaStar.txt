It's a pretty day let's go outside and enjoy it
If you got something else in mind then I'm all for it
I will take the chance I will take your hand
Then we'll go there, go there

Love isn't something that you earn, it's deserved
Love is something I can give 'cause I'm worth it
You amaze me I am taken in

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar
I can see you tell me what you wanna do

My man said heaven is a day away
If in the present you loving in a braver way
I wear the aura of a king and dream of a love supreme
As a child I was told that my love is king

Seeing what it can bring to the lives of those
That ain't afraid to give with their souls exposed, golden rose
You color my reality with balladry allowing me to
Me to love like a child that's free, I'm proud to be your superstar

My love is honest and true and I can prove it babe
My love is everything to you if you choose it babe
You're amazing I'm so taken in
You're so lovely, I can

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar
I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar

You know I liked him so much that it turned into loving
Then the love back to like now I feel like I'm bursting
More nurse than my name 'em so full of potential
He stands tall I feel it's internal

Fine like the earth and the sea and the sky
Together we make stars we are truly fly
I wanna paint him take a picture of his soul
His story should be told

See he's like everything I dreamed of
But better than the preview
Now everything he working on
Has got me saying me too

Like he food that I need, blood 'cause he bleed
He real 'cause I see, it's all meant to be
Remember how to make believe
Yo these brothers are your enemy

You're in a state of disbelief
Without your heart you'll never be
So sister's sing along with me
Because your love is true

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar
I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar

My love is honest is true and I can prove it babe
Prove it babe I can prove my love to you
My love is honest and true and I can prove it babe
Woo hoo, I can prove my love, yeah hey
