I'm on my own where I found you alone
You were caught up in somebody else's mess.
And yes, I drank all those drinks on my own,
My life's become some blurry little quest.

And the cloud came deep and slowly
At the end of all, you'd ask me
If I even had a clue where I was.
Well, I don't know your truth flows
And I'm bringing by the tooth calls
In the night and in they stole, they never was.

It'd all begin if you sing,
I wanna know to keep the rain.

Silvia, right back where you came from,
You're a pendulum, heartbroken in number.
Silvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough is enough.

Sick to the bone on my steps to my home,
The moon shines through the drapery and leaves.
To her to ignore everyone on my own,
My true love just to feel so made of bricks.

But as my body crumble, you walked as I just stumble
We spoke only of things made in my head.
You never once controlled me, what all the others told me
But if I kept on going I'd be dead.

It's not just you that they blame
Now tell me where they keep the rain.

Silvia, right back where you came from,
You're a pendulum, heartbroken in number.
Silvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough's always too tough.

See what I've done now, I don't understand
She says I'm screaming and I raise my hand.
But I never meant to, wasn't even there,
I never meant to, I would never dare.

Silvia, right back where you came from,
You're a pendulum, heartbroken in number.
Silvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough's always too tough.

Silvia, right back where you came from,
You're a pendulum, heartbroken in number.
Silvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough is enough.
