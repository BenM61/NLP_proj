There we go, running before we can walk again
Can you imagine the hours I keep
Learning to sleep again, see her face again
Blast the world, fruits of the morning
Carry the weight of the heart in a storm
Suffer the dawn today, today

Your beautiful daughter made me younger today
Beautiful daughter, now the darkness hides the tears that soak
The pillow where she lay
Wide awake, lying in wait for the moon to break
Drinking the lake of the dreams that we share
Wanting you there today, today

Your beautiful daughter made me younger today
Beautiful daughter, now the darkness hides the tears that soak
The pillow where she lay
Wide awake, lying in wait for the moon to break
Drinking the lake of the dreams that we share
Wanting you there today, today

Can you believe she just dropped in to say goodbye, say goodbye
I'm crying, beautiful daughter give me more, open the door
Pools in her eyes that are bright and deep
Can you imagine the hours I keep
Learning to sleep again, again

Your beautiful daughter made me younger today
Beautiful daughter, now the darkness hides the tears that soak
The pillow where she lay
Wide awake, lying in wait for the moon to break
Drinking the lake of the dreams that we share
Wanting you there today, today

Your beautiful daughter made me younger today
Beautiful daughter, now the darkness hides the tears that soak
The pillow where she lay
Wide awake, lying in wait for the moon to break
Drinking the lake of the dreams that we share
Wanting you there today, today

Beautiful daughter give me more, open the door
Your beautiful daughter made me younger today
Beautiful daughter, now the darkness hides the tears that soak
The pillow where she lay
Wide awake, lying in wait for the moon to break
Drinking the lake of the dreams that we share
Wanting you there today, today
