When hearts are buried deep, too deep read
When life starts falling down, just look up
Comfort can be found, just look to me
I'll shelter you, on that you can depend
We will always win

And when the night is dark, too dark to see
You'll never lose you way, just stay
Stay right here beside me
(I've got your love to guide me)
I won't be afraid anymore, my heart will lead the way

You are the light that's shining through
You're all the warmth I never knew

If we just do what's right, the truth will not fail
I won't give up the fight
Not until you are out of  harm's way
(Come, hold me in your arms today)
I'll do anything for you, my heart will tell me to

You are the light that's shining through
You're all the warmth I never knew
Don't know how far I would go or what I'd do to
Touch the light that's shining through
Shine your light on the darkness, love will follow you

You are the light that's shining through
You're all the warmth I never knew
You are the light that's shining through
You're all the warmth I never knew
Don't know how far I would go or what I'd do to
Touch the light

The light of love is shining through
