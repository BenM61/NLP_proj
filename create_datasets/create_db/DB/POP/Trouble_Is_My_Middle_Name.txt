Hello, little girl, goodbye, little girl
I'm not your kind of guy, little girl
I'll only make you cry, little girl
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name

Each kiss, little girl, is sweet, little girl
They sweep me off my feet, little girl
But no more must our lips meet, little girl
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name

	I'm just a born wanderer driftin' by one day
	Each place that I've been, heartbreak moved in
	So I'll move on my way

In time, little girl, you'll find, little girl
I've been really kind, little girl
Not changing your name to mine, little girl
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name


Not changing your name to mine, little girl
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name

Oh, trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name
FADE 
Yes, trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name
