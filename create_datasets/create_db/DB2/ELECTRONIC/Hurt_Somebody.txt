Taking it slowly
I'm afraid to be lonely
Nobody told me
It's harder than I thought to tell the truth
It's gonna leave you in pieces
All alone with your demons
And I know that we need this
But I've been too afraid to follow through

Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

Don't know where the time went
Stuck in the wrong mindset
And I let the rules bend
When I know that all along they're made to break
Hey, you got me searching for reasons
To keep me from leaving
And that I have trouble breathing
I give myself another chance to stay

Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

One day before you know it, you will see
All of the pain and all the irony
You'll feel the stinging and you think of me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt

Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
