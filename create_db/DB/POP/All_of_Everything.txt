I need your arms
Both of your arms
Believe me
Because it's true

For I need all of everything
That's any part of you

You have one heart
Only one heart
But, darling
I'll need that too

I must have all of everything
That's any part of you

Give me your lips forever
To be the master of
And, darling, my dreams
Could never come true
Til you give me your love

If good things come
To those who wait
And you're what I've waited for

For you are all of everything
I'll be forever more
For you are all of everything
I'll need forever more
