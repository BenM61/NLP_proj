Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now I don't mean to bother you but I'm in a mess
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

So

Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid with your arrow make a love storm for me
I promise I will lover her until eternity
I know between the two of us her heart we can steal
Help me if you will

Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid, don't you hear me
Calling you
I need you
Cupid
Help me
