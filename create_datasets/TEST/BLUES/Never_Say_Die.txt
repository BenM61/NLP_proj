Well, there's snow on the mountain, a fire down below
No place to hide, but there's no place to go
Seems like I'm surrounded by the trouble in the air
If there's any way out I can't find it anywhere

But I'll never say die
Never say die
I ain't givin' in or givin' up without a try
No I'll never say die

I'd gladly give up all my baubles, my watch and golden chain
Blue shiny roadster, and my sexy walkin' cane
All of my prized possessions, that I love, you know I do
Any time, any where, just to find my place with you

But I'll never say die
Never say die
I ain't givin' in or givin' up without a try
No I'll never say die

I don't want your greenback dollar
It could never be enough
Just your sweet love and your body
So you might as well just as well give it up

But I'll never say die
Never say die
I ain't givin' in or givin' up without a try
No I'll never say die
