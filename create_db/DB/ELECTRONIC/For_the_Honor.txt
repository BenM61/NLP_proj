For the honor of the Father
Who reaches out to us
That we might live inside His love
He gave His only Son

For the honor of The Savior
Let the cross be lifted high
The great exchange of love and grace
Came down to give us life

For the honor of The Spirit
Whose power lives in us
That we might see much greater things
As we embrace Your love

For the honor of Your kingdom
Whose reign will never end
We'll give our lives in sacrifice
Until You come again

Forever, forever
We'll honor You forever
