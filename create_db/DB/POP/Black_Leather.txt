(Joan Jett/Reggie Griffin/Eddie Morris/William Adler)

I will not take off my clothes
I will not be rude
For what I have done
Is come to rock you

Late at night while the normals rest
I feel wicked when I start to dress
My clothes, they stare at me like they
Wanna make love to my body
I'm not a dream but I'm supreme and if ya
Listen to the sky you see what I mean
When it rains outside, people run and hide
I walk the streets and start to pry
And wonder was I here before?
In another life? Yes! I'm sure but what
As I suppose why do I get power from these clothes

Black leather, I wear it on stage
Black leather, I'm gonna wear it to my grave
Black leather, I will wear it anywhere
Because my name is JOAN JETT and I don't care
Just the feel of it on my flesh makes me
Feel wild feel possessed
But I'm not don't get me wrong
I'm the baddest slick chick just singin'
This song

Lilly white dresses sure they're cute
They also attract a lot of men to you
But they make you feel real vulnerable
From anything that got muscle
But ya cannot take what I would not give
'cause that's the truth that's how I live

Listen don't slick talk me to make me indulge
'cause I am JOAN and I am luv!
I have this friend in a waterbed
He's real wild when he's soak'n'wet
Yo JOAN let's hang till the early dawn
SCORP chill till I put my leather on

Black leather, I wear it on stage
Black leather, I'm gonna wear it to my grave
Black leather, I will wear it anywhere
Because my name is JOAN JETT and I don't care
Just the feel of it on my flesh make me
Feel wild feel possessed
But I'm not don't get me wrong
I'm the baddest slick chick and I'm singin'
This song

This is true I gotta show no shame
I was born to freak and I'm to blame?
I coulda been a mailman in any weather
Instead I'm rockin' away in my leather
When I was young I wore skirts and lace
My father told me to slow down my pace
His friends would come over and get in my face
And ask the same question mine or your place?
It's alright to be treated like a lady
I couldn't wait till that notion ceased
My friends thought that I was a little angel
I couldn't help it if I felt like a beast
So when I die don't worry about a coffin
There won't be no ashes to stuff in the urn
Jus' lay me out toss on the charcoal lighter
An' fire me up smell the leather burn

Black leather, I wear it on stage
Black leather, I'm gonna wear it to my grave
Black leather, I will wear it anywhere
Because my name is JOAN JETT and I don't care
Just the feel of it on my flesh make me
Feel wild feel possessed
But I'm not don't get me wrong
I'm the baddest slick chick and I'm singin'
This song

Black leather, I wear it on stage
Black leather, I'm gonna wear it to my grave
Black leather, I will wear it anywhere
Because my name is JOAN JETT and I don't care
Just the feel of it on my flesh make me
Feel wild feel possessed
But I'm not don't get me wrong
I'm the baddest slick chick and I'm singin'
This song
