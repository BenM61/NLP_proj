Hey Lady, listen to me
'Cause you ain't never heard of me
Hey woman, open your eyes
'Cause I wanna be seen by you
Oh no, don't go, baby I'm so
Oh no, I know that I'm goin' anyway

Do you mind tonight I hold you tight the way it's like
It's a heartbreak today, don't leave me this way
Do you mind tonight I hold you tight but what it's like
It's a heartbreak today, don't leave me this way
Heartbreak today

Hey mister, what do you hear
Oh yeah, believe what you wanna hear
Hey sister, what do you see
You're blind, but I know that you can see
I know your way could be my way
You say you stay I'm goin' anyway

Do you mind tonight I hold you tight the way it's like
It's a heartbreak today, don't leave me this way
Do you mind tonight I hold you tight but what it's like
It's a heartbreak today, don't leave me this way
Heartbreak today

Do you mind tonight I hold you tight the way it's like
It's a heartbreak today, don't leave me this way
Do you mind tonight I hold you tight but what it's like
It's a heartbreak today, don't leave me this way
Heartbreak today, heartbreak today
Heartbreak today
Don't leave me this way
Heartbreak today
I'm goin' anyway
Heartbreak today
