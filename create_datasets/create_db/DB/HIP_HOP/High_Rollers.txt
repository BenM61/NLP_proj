Speed of life, fast, it's like walkin' barefoot over broken glass
It's like, jumpin' rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick decisions are made
Lifestyle plush, females rush
This high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar, schoolboys admire
Young girls desire, very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene
Definition-street player, you know who I mean
  
High rollers

Yeah the high rollers, street hustlers
Fast money, fast life
But you don't care, 'til you end up with a bullet in your head, boy
  
People of the city, stop foolin' yourself
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Look at the cars as they roll by
Benz, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're livin' proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game, that's why you boast
Because you're high priced, high speed high post
  
High roller
  
That's right, you're high rollin'
You think you got it goin' on right?
You got money, cars, jewelry 
You think you got everything
Lemme tell you, you ain't got nothin'
You ain't got nothin' but a one way ticket to death row
You gotta get out of the game man
Or the game is gonna get you

Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood, Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits, hair always fresh
Eelskin boots, large hearts, though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruisin' in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' "Pusher Man"
Yes, their fashion's high but hard to beat
They buy their GUCCI at GUCCI'S, not the swap-meet
Eat very well, much clientele
Whatever you need, they probably sell
  
High rollers

Yeah and let me break it down for the ladies
All you girls out there that think you gon' get that quick money and ain't goin' to jail
You better think again
  
Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as a igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max, all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferrari's not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded, most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun, love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame, no shame to the game
And they all seek power, f*ck the fame
  
The high rollers
Yeah, the high rollers
Street hustlers, the players
Out there getting that long money, you know what I'm sayin'
But that fast money leads to a fast life and a quick death
This is my word, this is Ice-T
And I ain't got no reason to lie to you
  
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
  
Yes, the game has flash but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem, though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from a M-16
But to each his own, choose you mobile phone
Choose a tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught, 'cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right
You wanna be a high roller
