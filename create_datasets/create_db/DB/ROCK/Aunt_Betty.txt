Aunt Betty's in the basement, looking for a way out
There ain't nothing else death,
No, no need to come out
Gotta shit brown future, nothing but time
So let me live your life, you can live mine

Aunt Betty's on the warpath you got to run
She don't eat, don't sleep, don't f*ck no one
So say whatcha wanna say, say whatcha wanna say
Just let me take yours and you can take my way

Dust off the gears that move this machine
'Cause they feel so old, they don't work no more
Show me a day that brings me better things
'Cause these days don't lie you're running out of time

Yeah Betty's in the count, yeah lock out the door
Don't tell me that a key don't work no more
Tell her that you don't tell her that you don't know why
She's got a Harley soul we all seem to live by

So dust off the gears that move this machine
'Cause they feel so old, they don't work no more
Show me a day that brings me better things
'Cause these days don't lie you're running out of time

Why don't you believe in me?
Why don't you believe in me?
Why don't you believe in me?
Why don't you ?

Dust off the gears that move this machine
'Cause they feel so old, they don't work no more
Show me a day that brings me better things
'Cause these days don't lie you're running out of time
