One night
You came on over to me
Late night
We shared a drink or three
Night night
I read a proverb to you
That night
She left a room with a view

Take all the time
Time that you want to
Make up your mind
Mind how you go
Take me in time
Time to the music
Take me away to the twilight zone

Last night
We stayed up late in a dream
My oh my
We read a play with no theme
Lifetime
In which our love pursues
My time
In which I spend with you

Now I know the lonely days are gone
Dont you know that I can see
Like a summer day thats always long
We repel the wet of tears
As the shadows lighten up the day
Through the cons we laugh away
Like a windy day thats always wrong
We take shelter where we can

Last night
I came on over to you
My oh my
We played a song or two
Lifetime
I read a poem aloud
My time
I wrote a song for thee

Now I know the lonely days are gone
Dont you know that I can see
Like a summer day thats always long
We repel the wet of tears
As the shadows lighten up the day
Through the cons we laugh away
Like a windy day thats always wrong
We take shelter where we can
