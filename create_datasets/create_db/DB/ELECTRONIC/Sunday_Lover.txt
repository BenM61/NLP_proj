I always take it easy
And I'm gonna make you feel good
So tell me all the secrets
Let's celebrate the night
Soon or later
We'll become the love of our life

You are the Sunday lover
Rive me before I lose the countenance
You are my Sunday lover
Rive me before I lose the countenance

Baby
We have nothing to lose
Baby
I'm not singing to the blues
Still feels like we're children
We'll never learn to give it up
So c'mon take it easy
Tomorrow you'll be mine
Oh, I cannot wait
I gotta have you by my side

You are the Sunday lover
Rive me before I lose the countenance
You are my Sunday lover
Rive me before I lose the countenance

Baby
If you have nothing to do
Baby
I got away of the shoes
Baby
Wave these negative blues
Baby you're afraid
You can do what you want

I'll never let you go
