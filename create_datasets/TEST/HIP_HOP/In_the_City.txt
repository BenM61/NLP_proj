Every day I'm a star in the city
Walk the streets like a wanted man
All the time got my shine looking pretty
Motherfuckers all know who I am
Every day feel the heat in the city
Like the barrel of a smoking gun
Read the signs see the lights there so pretty
Your the one now turn me on

(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me

Every day I'm alive in the city
Shes a fire that lives by the sun
On the street looking fine looking pretty
She sucks the heat off my, gun
I will eat you alive in the city
While they pull up in fancy cars
Drinking whine wasting time you are pretty
Politiations movie stars

(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me

City boy life

(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me

City boy life

Every day I'm a star in the city
Walk the streets like a loaded gun
All the time got my shine looking pretty
Everybody now turn me on

(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me
