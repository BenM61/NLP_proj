You want me too much
You want much too much for me
You need me too much
You need such a lot for me
Can't you let me be
Let me be just as good as I am
Can't you let me be
Can't you see who I really am
I don't want
You to go
But you can't stay
This way
But I want you to stay
I want you to stay just as you are
Maybe not the way you want to be
Maybe not the way you want me to see you
Can't you let us be
Let us be just as good as we are
Can't you let us be
Can't you see who we really are
Bonjour tristesse
