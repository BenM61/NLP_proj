You have the right not to be killed
Murder is a crime
Unless it is done by a policeman

[Chorus] 
Know your rights, know your rights
Know your rights, know your rights
Know your rights, know your rights
You have the right to party
Provided you don't mind some
Investigation, humiliation

[Chorus]

You have the right to free speech
As long as you ain't dumb enough to try it

[Chorus]

These are your rights
Know your rights (repeat to end)
