Ev'ry sixty second, of ev'ry minute
Ev'ry sixty minute, of the hour
Ev'ry twenty-four hours of the day
I just sit a-round an'pray

Wonder where, oh where can you be?
I wonder, where, well babe
Won't you come on home to me?

Ev'ry seven days, of the week
Ev'ry four week, of the month
Ev'ry twelve month, of the year
I just sit an' wish, you was here

I wonder where, well where can you be?
I wonder where, well baby
Please come on home to me
