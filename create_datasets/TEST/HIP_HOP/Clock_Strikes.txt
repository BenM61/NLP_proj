See, them other crews could not figure me
It's the Mag and double ooh, got that fat CD
Buck a crystal, hit a nigga with my club Willy
Fake MC's getting assed like they eatin' chili

Only way they seem to rap is if they got a Philly
Maybe I'm Nicole Brown 'cause you really kill me
Got away with hittin' me but you ain't O.J.
I'm 'bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay

When I bumble, watch your back 'cause I sting like bee
This ain't the Wild Wild West and you ain't cool Moe Dee
Watch a movie, now, you think that you really Joe Pesci
You don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy

I'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland
I drive a 850, sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van
You can catch me standin' in my be-boy stance
Or catch me at home watchin' 'Who's the Man?'

They call robber 'cause I pack much heat
Don't call me now, because they dig the way I speak
I'm like a genie because I've been trapped in a bottle
I've got more stunts, than that nigga Desperado

Come, follow a mad brother where'll there be no sun
Tomorrow you be sayin', when can we meet?
My office hours are nine to five
Ain't that right Maganoo, Maganoo? Right

When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night
When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night

Now gimme that and run with the
Party people, are you ready for Tim and Maganoo?
As we come, rum and Coke, won't you kick a verse two

Yo I'm 'bout to get it started like I'm Hammer then I farted
You retarded if you thinkin' Brandy really broken hearted
I departed doin' dirt, lookin' up your girl's skirt
Keep it Steve Martin style, bustin' loose like jerk

I get up like town, gimme, don't say no more
Got them scars on my face 'cause my health be poor
You Milli Vanilli, I'm Kurtis Blow like eighty-fo'
No, I don't want your girl, she be suckin' my big toe

You get death like row, I take a beanie then I jet
Peace to Tupac 'cause he was dope as it get
Twisted but you ain't Keith Sweat and shit got hot
Make a block then make a circle then I rock that spot

The rappin' Don, I make a dyke go straight
If you think I'm cute then you up too late
Make no mistake, I'm a question with no answer
Riddle me like the Joker get burnt like JoJo dancer

When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night
When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night

When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night
When the clock strikes, half past two, yeah
They'll be dancin', through the night
