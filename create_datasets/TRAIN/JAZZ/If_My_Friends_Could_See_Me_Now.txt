Super, if they could see me now
That little gang of mine
I'm eatin' fancy chow and drinkin' fancy wine
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer, first-rate chums I attract
All I can say is "Wow-ee, look-a where I am"
Tonight I landed, pow!
Right in a pot of jam
What a setup, holy cow!
They'd never believe me
If my friends could see me now!

If they could see me now
My little dusty group
Traipsin' round this million dollar chicken coop
I'd hear those thrift shop cats say, "Brother get him!
Draped on a bedspread made from three kinds of skin!"
All I can say is "Wow!"
Wait till the riff and raff
See just exactly how she signed her autograph
What a build up, holy cow!
They'd never believe me
If my friends could see me now!

If they could see me now alone with Mrs. V
Who's waitin' on me like she was a maitre'd
I hear my buddies sayin', "Wow, what gives?
Tonight he's living just like the other half lives!"
To think the highest brow which I must say is she
Should pick the lowest brow which there's no doubt is me
What a step up, wow, holy cow!
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me, if my friends could see me
If my friends could see me now!
Take a look at me now, take a look at me now
