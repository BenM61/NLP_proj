She's fresh to death,
She'll be the death of you,
Seduction leads to destruction.
She's fresh to death,
She'll be the death of me,
She's fresh but not so clean.

Cute face slim waist,
She's got em' in a craze,
Yeah I think he's going crazy.
When she speaks it makes me grind my teeth,
Yet he still thinks she's amazing.
And she's been playing games,
Ever since 98',
Shallow is as shallow does,
Some people never change.

She's so fine,
She's thinks she's so damn fine.
She might be fine,
But she ain't worth a second of your time.

You're as fake as the moans you make,
And you're as weak as the hearts you break.
You're as fake as the moans you make,
So just give us a little break.

Sex sells,
And your sex cells make all the lost boys drool.
Cause you're a dime, 
But they'll have to wait in line,
Until one of them makes it two of you.
Cute face slim waist,
You still got em' in a craze,
Yeah I think I'm going crazy.
I have a long list of things to say,
But I'll leave it at,
You amaze me.

You're as fake as the moans you make,
And you're as weak as the hearts you break.
You're as fake as the moans you make,
So just give us a little break
