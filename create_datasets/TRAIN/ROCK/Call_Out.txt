Searching for the things that we can't see
The unknown 
I'm just telling you I'm just saying that things aren't quite the same 
This time around 

You can't take that away, 
You can't take that away, no 
You can't take that away 

If you wanna hear this song (if you wanna hear it) 
If you wanna hear this song 
You just, call out, our name 
If you wanna hear this song (if you wanna hear it) 
You won't have to wait too long 
You just, call out, our name 

Shapes are twisting time with melody, 
Seems so alone, 
I'm just telling you, 
I'm just saying that things aren't quite so clear 
This time around 

You can't take that away, 
You can't take that away, no 
You can't take that away 

If you wanna hear this song (if you wanna hear it) 
If you wanna hear this song 
You just, call out, our name 
If you wanna hear this song (if you wanna hear it) 
You won't have to wait too long, 
You just, call out, call out 

You can't take that away, 
You can't take that 
You can't take that away 

You can't take that away 
You can't take that away, no 
You can't take that away 

If you wanna hear this song (if you wanna hear it) 
If you wanna hear this song 
You just, call out, our name 
If you wanna hear this song (if you wanna hear it) 
You won't have to wait too long, 
You just, call out 

If you wanna hear this song, 
If you wanna hear this song, 
You just call out, our name 
If you wanna hear this song, 
You won't have to wait too long, 
You just, call out, our name
