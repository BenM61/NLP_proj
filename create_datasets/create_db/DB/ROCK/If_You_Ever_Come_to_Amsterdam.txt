I love to be with you but now I'm leaving
I really did enjoy this single evening
Moments here with you I will remember
O Rainy day that come
Summer love has left my heart and saint it
Its hard to go away before it ended
Those Kisses on a mountain 
A tree,car and a fountain

The time has come that we must say goodbye
If you ever come to Amsterdam,I'll be waiting there for you
And I 'll show you were young lovers go on a sunny afternoon
Where the summer nights in Amsterdam covered flowers at your side
I'll be yours the day we'll meet again in Amsterdam

I call you every day cause when I hear you
I am dreaming every moment I'll be near you
I found the morning clover and like to send it over 
Maybe there's a time we meet one day
If you ever come to Amsterdam,I'll be waiting there for you
And I 'll show you were young lovers go on a sunny afternoon
Where the summer nights in Amsterdam covered flowers at your side
I'll be yours the day we'll meet again in Amsterdam
