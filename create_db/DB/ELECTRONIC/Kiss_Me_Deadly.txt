I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid, I got in a fight uh-huh
It ain't no big thing
Late for my job and the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man uh-huh
It ain't no big thing
I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story, it'll be alright uh-huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me

Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

Had a few beers, gettin' high
Sittin' watching the time go by uh-huh
It ain't no big thing
Nothing to eat and no TV
Looking in the mirror, don't get it from me
It ain't no big thing

Well I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me, oh yeah

Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly

Do do do do do do do do, do do
You know I like dancing with you
Dancing with you
Come on!

Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Come on pretty baby kiss me
Come on pretty baby kiss me deadly
Kiss me deadly
