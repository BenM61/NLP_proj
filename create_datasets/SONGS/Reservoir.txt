I heard you made the hull of a boat downtown
I heard you got a job at the builders yard
But we should never say that we drifted far
Yeah we should never say that we drifted far

And I could never take good care of you
Because we had so much to lose
But we should never say that we drifted far
Yeah we should take a trip to the reservoir
Yeah we should take a trip to the reservoir

Heartbeats drifting together
Heartbeats aaaaah
Walk in the wood
Wet under foot
Up to no good
Ah-ah-ah-ah

I heard you cast off and she sailed real fine
I heard you met her bow with a bottle of wine
Well you should let me know when you're home and dry
Well you should let me know when you're home and dry

I heard you took an old school friend with you
The one you always said you would
Well we can never say that we drifted far

Yeah we should take a trip to the reservoir
Yeah we should take a trip to the reservoir

Heartbeats drifting together
Heartbeats aaaaah
Walk in the wood
Wet under foot
Up to no good
Ah-ah-ah-ah
