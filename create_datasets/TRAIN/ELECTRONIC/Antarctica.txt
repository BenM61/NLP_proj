Antarctica -- Antarctica
Antarctica -- Antarctica
Ice age is here, right in your town
Antarctica, look what you've done
And I, I feel like I've cheated your scheme
And I, I feel like you really know what I mean
Nightfall's heartbeat, the street's in a mess
On reflection, the beach is endless
And I, I feel like I've cheated your scheme
And I, I feel like I really know what I mean
It's my turn -- it's my turn
Antarctica -- Antarctica
No day, no night, and always the sound
Ice protector ?? (Antarctica)
It's me that's found
And I, I feel like I'm really part of your scene
And I, I feel like you know what I mean
Pictures moving, and always the whirls
Antarctica, where are you now (Antarctica)
And I, I feel like I'm really part of your scheme
And I, I feel like you're losing your dream
Antarctica -- Antarctica -- Antarctica 
It's my turn 
Antarctica -- Antarctica
Water's bending all out of shape
Antarctica
I say jump boy before it's too late
And I, I feel like you know what I mean
And I, I feel like I'm lost in your scheme
Antarctica -- Antarctica
Antarctica -- Antarctica
And I, I feel like you know what I mean
And I, I feel like I'm really lost in your scene
It's my turn -- it's my turn
It's my turn -- it's my turn
It's my turn -- it's my turn
