Out of reach of my two empty arms

Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams, I see your face
Memories, time cannot erase
And I awake and find you gone
And I'm so blue and all alone

So far away from you, so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing that you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep

So far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms
