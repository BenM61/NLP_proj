When I'm all alone on a distant path
And my ticket home has been torn in half
Oh, I can hear your voice, girl I can feel your touch
Across the miles tonight
On the road again, will it always be
That the dream gets changed on its way to reality
Oh, but the thought of you, strange how it pulls me through
Across the miles tonight
And I am sending you this message through the wires tonight
Just close your eyes and hold on tight
And here I am, concentrating girl with all my might
Now the sound of your laughter trails off through the midnight sky
As the miles go by, cities come and go
When you close your eyes and listen to the radio
Girl, can you hear my song, the signal is clear and strong
Across the miles tonight
And I am sending you this message through the wires tonight
Just close your eyes and hold on tight
And here I am, concentrating girl with all my might
Now the sound of your laughter trails off
Across the miles
