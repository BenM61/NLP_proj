I can't find, I can't find the words to rescue me
But this time, this time I've got to make you see

You, you were the one the only one who understands
Do you hear me?
Do you know what I need?
You've got to take me as I am

Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me
Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me

I can't lie, I can't lie, my heart will tell me true
You know me, you know me better than I think I want you to

Now, I go it alone
A solitary man
This is something I must do for myself
You got to take me as I am

Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me
Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me

Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more

Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me
Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me
Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me
Saying it once, I'll say it again
No chain of love on me

Let's take a walk
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
Take a walk down Lonely Street once more
