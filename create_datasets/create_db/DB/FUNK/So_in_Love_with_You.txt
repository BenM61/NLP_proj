You are to me,
What poetry tries to say with the word,
You are the song,
All the music mah heart,
Eva heard....
I can't escape,
The air that I breathe even speaks of you,
And I'm not ashamed to say,
That I feel this way....

[Chorus]
I will stand before god,
Give you all that I've got,
I can promise you,
I'll be true,
I will feel here and now,
As we both take this vow,
I am so in love (so in love),
With you... ooh

Words can't express,
I confess with each beat of my heart,
I'm overwhelmed,
With a passion I,
I felt from the start,
Our love will grow,
As the years come and go,
I'll remain by your side,
Oh yes I will,
There isn't anything that i will demand..

[Chorus]

I promise to honor and cherish,
For better or for worst,
I'll be there for you,
For richer or for poorer,
In sickness and in health,
Till death do us part, (I will go with you)
From this day on and forever, ( I will.....) Ahhhhhh.......

[Chorus]
