If I could look beyond your face 
And photograph your hidden place 
Would I find you smiling in the picture 

I don't know what you want 
Because you don't know, 
So what's the point of asking 

You're almost happy 
Almost content 
But your head hurts 

Far too many ways to go 
We learn so much but never know 
Where to look 
Or when we should stop looking 

I can love the whole of you. 
The poetry I stole from you 
And hide inside my stomach 

You're almost happy 
Almost content 
But your head hurts 

It's easy to get lost in you 
And fall asleep inside of you 
I want to return to you 
A reason to be here 
A reason to be here 

No I don't know what you want 
And you don't know 
So what's the point of asking 

You're almost happy 
Almost content 
But your head hurts
