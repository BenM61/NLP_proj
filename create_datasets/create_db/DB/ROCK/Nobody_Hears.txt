I talk through my eyes, the words pouring down 
Nobody hears 
You ask me what's wrong, but what can I say 
Nobody hears 
I try to tell you, I try to show you 
How else can I tell you, how else can I show you? 

I'm screaming inside, why can't you hear? 
Nobody hears 
You're looking right through me like I'm not here 
Nobody hears 

When the last tear falls down 
Nothing gets waqshed away 
Another plea put to rest 
As nobody hears, nobody hears 

So what did I do to you 
That makes you run from me 
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Don't understand why nobody hears 

You figured it, you shaped it to your perfection 
Nobody hears 
Subtracted my feelings from this equation 
Nobody hears 

Is it all in my mind 
Then it would be easy to find 

So what did I do to you 
That makes you run from me 
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Don't understand why nobody hears 

So if it's all, if it's all in my mind 
Then wouldn't it, wouldn't it 
Wouldn't it be so easy to find 

So what do I have to do 
To make you comfort me 
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Don't understand why nobody hears 

So I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Well I'm sitting here crying inside myself 
So I'm sittin here screaming to nobody else 
Don't understand why nobody hears 
And nobody hears, nobody hears, nobody hears
