Lie with me, lie to me
Come on, dismantle me, do it slowly
My hands, my feet, my voice, take everything
Reduce it all to crystal blackness
Cause blind discipline it's useless
What's the good in being good?

So go ahead, feed me diamonds
Feed me diamonds
Feed me diamonds, diamonds
Feed me diamonds

A look, a glance, a gesture
Can mean everything and nothing
A sediment adrift in crystal blackness
I won't pursue, I want you, but I can't stop
I'll let the world make it's decision
No matter the consequences
What's the good in being good?

So go ahead, feed me diamonds, 
Do what you want to, 
Feed me diamonds, 
Bleed me slowly, 
Feed me diamonds, 
Feel my heart beating
In love completely, 
Feed me diamonds, diamonds
Feed me, feed me diamonds
Why won't you save me?
Feed me diamonds

Oh oh oh oh

Blind discipline it's useless
What's the good in being good?

So go ahead, feed me diamonds, 
Do what you want to, 
Feed me diamonds, 
Bleed me slowly, 
Feed me diamonds, diamonds
Feed me diamonds
Feed me diamonds
