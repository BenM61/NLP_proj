Strangers
Talkin' bout my life
Changes
They're gonna take my side

Revelation
In a station
Is followin' a man
An' right in this moment
I'm in torment
Hear your voice again

I say man
You're my midnight man
Can't escape your voice on the radio
I try it but i can't
For i need you badly
Man
You're my midnight man
Hold me in your spider web

Midnight man

Rages
Tearin' up my mind
Pages
I'm skimmin' to kill time

Far 'till morning
Hear a warning
From the borderline
An' right in this moment
I'm in torment
Hear your voice again

I say man
You're my midnight man
Can't escape your voice on the radio
I try it but i can't
For i need you badly
Man
You're my midnight man
Hold me in your spider web
Midnight man
