Now there is no turning back
Once gone the traces impact
War child there?s no changing
Arrive
Alive
Ride
Cry
Hide out
Watch out, there's some covered track

Native born
We see the shores come
Nowhere, but it's a better life
Heroes in an empty station

We could be safe
And we're free and home
Offer me asylum
Free
So safe and we'll see
It's all for me and
I was outside
And i've still got a place to go

Native born
Wee see the shores come
Nowhere, but it's a better life
Heroes in an empty station

Again
We get the past back
Refugee won't always want to come back

And we're free and home
Offer me asylum
Free
At home
So safe and we'll be home
What's outside?
Have we still got a place to go?

Native born
We see the shores, come
Nowhere, but it's a better life
Heroes in an empty station

We can be safe and
We're free and home
Offer me asylum 
Free and home
Europa will be
A home all for me and
I was outside
Have we still got a place t go
