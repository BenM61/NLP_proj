By the time you get this message I'll be down
You may recognize my elementary sound
We can freeze time
We can freeze time
But sometimes I just get trapped in neon signs
It helps me when I read between the lines
We can freeze time
We can freeze time
But when the daylight tightens around me
I'll pack up all my problems and run
When the daylight taints surround me
I don't know what I'm doing 
But I've got to get things done

Don't you ever let your problems get you down
If you do just pick up the phone I'll come around
And we can freeze time
And we can freeze time

All over the world I slip and slide
I run and hide exactly like the last time
All over the world the come and go
Not you this could be the last time

But what hurts me is I never get the time
To say or do
Even half of what I'm feeling
When my feeling is for you
But we can freeze time
But we can freeze time
So don't you ever let your problems get you down
If you Just pick up the phone I'll come around
And we can freeze time
And we can freeze time
