Every night at eight you'll find me
Waitin' for a bus to take me crosstown
Someone I adore is waitin' for me 
By the door way over crosstown

I used to go uptown but that romance fell through
I used to go downtown but she found someone new
Never realized they advertised 
So many things to fill a blue room
I can even see the day that we will
Have a little tea-for-two room

I found a real sweetheart 
Who'll never let me down
Haven't time to fuss, I'll miss the bus,
And maybe baby will be cross, crosstown
