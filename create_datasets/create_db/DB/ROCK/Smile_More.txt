Everybody's tryina tell me what to do
Everybody's tryina tell me what to do
Makes me wanna break some shit and sniff some glue
Everybody's tryina tell me what to do
Stranger in the bar tells me to smile more
I look at him and I ask, what for?
I am happily un-happy man
And no, I don't wanna shake your hand

I don't wanna be a reflection
I'm so bored with this rejection
I don't wanna be a reflection
I don't need your direction

And I am not ashamed of my mental state
And I am not ashamed of my body weight
And I am not ashamed of my rage
And I am not ashamed of my age
And I am not ashamed of my sex life
Although I wish it were better
I am not ashamed I am no one's wife
Although the idea does sound kind of nice

I don't wanna be a reflection
I'm so bored with this rejection
I don't wanna be a reflection
I don't need your direction

All this reflecting is bad for my complexion,
Come on now, let's take this to the next section

People think they know what kind of girl I am
They take one look, they think they understand
And they're always surprised when they meet me
Apparently I'm terribly misleading
And yes, I am a feminist
But that isn't why I started doing this
And sometimes I am full of bitterness
But I am trying to work through this

I don't wanna be a reflection
I'm so bored with this rejection
I don't wanna be a reflection
I don't need your direction

I don't wanna be a reflection
I'm so bored with this rejection
I don't wanna be a reflection
I don't need your direction
