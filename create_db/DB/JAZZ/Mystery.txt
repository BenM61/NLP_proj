Turnin' back the hands of time
Holdin' on to misty memories
Chasin' shadows thru the night
Tryin' to find that happy ending
Reaching out for another chance at heaven
We can still find the way if we try

You gotta believe in the mystery
How it used to be
We were more than lonely drifters in the dark
Oh I can remember the sun inside
When love held us tight
Can't you see I need that magic in my heart
Instead of it tearing apart

Diamonds shinin' in the night
Lyin' soft and warm together
Only images survive
Can't this dream go on forever?
There is still time to lock away the sadness
Let the secrets of love start to smile

It's only believin' the mystery
Like it used to be
Baby bring back all the passion to my life
Oh don't you remember the tender days
All the love we made
Can't we feel that warm sensation here tonight, oh....

Lonely spirits seem to whisper in the wind
It's a silent song that's never meant to be
Since the dawn of time the mystery never ends
We can find forever
If we let love rise again

Won't you reach for another
chance at heaven
We can still find the way if we try

It's only believin' in the mystery
How it used to be
Baby bring back all the passion to my life
Oh cause I can remember the tender days
All the love we made
I need to feel that warm sensation - oh baby

Mystery
How it used to be
We were oh so much more
Oh baby, don't you remember (sun inside)
(held us tight)
Love held us tight
Turn around and look at me baby
Oh we gotta get back, gotta get back, gotta get back, gotta get back
Please take me there -
Oh I remember all the passion
Tender days - all the love we made
And I need to feel you baby....
