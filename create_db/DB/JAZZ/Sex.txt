What's the ting that they's talkin' about everywhere?
Sex
When they wanna be suave 'n' debonair
Sex

What's poppin' up the most from coast to coast
Sex
At yer bongo party an' yer weenie roast
Sex

Even them christians who are born again
Sex
Go out 'n' get pooched every now 'n' then
Sex

Do ya do or don't ya don't
Sex
Bet yer lyin' if ya say ya won't
Sex

Some girls try it 'n' go on a diet
Then they worry 'cause they's too fat
Who wants t'ride on a ironin' board?
That ain't no fun...i tried me one

Grow that meat all over yer bones
Work the wall with the local jones
'n' while you do it, remember this line
The sniffer says it all the time

"the bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion..."

Makes no difference if you're young or old
Sex
Don't you act like it's made of gold
Sex

Ladies they need it just like the guys
Sex
Maybe you could use a protein surprise
Sex

Any time, anywhere
Sex
Why d'ya think it's growin' there
Sex

Some girls try it 'n' they don't like it
They complain 'cause it don't last
Who wants to ride on a debutante?
They talks too much...they moves too fast

Watch the scenery while you ride
You can be very warm inside
'n' when the train goes 'round the bend
Check the shrub'ry on the other end

"the bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'
The bigger the cushion..."
