Happy in love, ho-ho, what a feeling 
You're never, never, never happy 
'Til you're really, really, really happy in love 
Nothing on Earth can give you that feeling 

You may be silly, silly sappy, but oh, baby, baby, 
You're so happy in love... 
You want everybody to know it 
You'd like to get up on the highest steeple, 
Shout to people... 

Happy in love, the sky is your ceiling 
You lucky, lucky, lucky chappy, 
It's great to be living when you're happy in love! 

Happy in love, the sky is your ceiling 
You lucky, lucky chappy, 
It's great to be living when you're happy in love, 
It's great, 
To be,
Livin' when you're happy in love!
