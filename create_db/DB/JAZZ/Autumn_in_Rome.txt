Autumn in Rome
My heart remembers fountains where children played 
Gardens where dreams were made

Autumn in Rome
Memories like embers glow 
When I seem to hear walks beneath the pines that grace the golden sky
Stopping now and then to share a lover's sigh, you and I

Let winter come
All my Decembers I'll spend just dreaming of the way we fell in love 
One lovely Autumn in Rome

Walks beneath the pines that grace the golden sky 
Stopping now and then to share a lover's sigh, you and I
Let winter come
All my Decembers I spend just dreaming of the way we fell in love 
One lovely Autumn in Rome
