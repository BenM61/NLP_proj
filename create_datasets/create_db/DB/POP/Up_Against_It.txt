Can you hear it?
Ear against the ground and you'll hear it
I can tell a change when I hear it

We are tigers
Kings of jungles
Trapped in cages
We forget we once were free!

And the average swain
Would be contented in his chains
Were it not for complainers like me

Throw the book
I'm up against it
Up against the rules
Bring the experts
Up against them
Up against the fools
Bring on city hall
I'm against them all

Lamp of freedom

No, you can't change
Human nature
Wheels of power
Keep revolving endlessly
With a fanatical faction
A charismatic attraction
There's a piece of that action for me

Call the press
I'm up against it
Up against the flacks
Bring the shrink
I'm up against it
Up against the quacks
Revenuers
Up against it
Up against the tax
Name some names
And I'm up against them
Bullies, big and small
I'm against them all

All we need is some vitality
Like an, individuality
But I guess they
Make it all alone

Bring the girls
I'm up against them
I'm up against their lips
Bring the boys
I'm up against them
Up against their hips
Bring the priest
I'm up against him
Up against that cross
Bring the mob
I'm up against it
Up against the boss
Bring the cops
I'm up against it
Up against the jaw
Throw the book
I'm up against it
Up against the law

Politicians, all, I'm against them
Fascist lackeys all against the wall

Fist of freedom
Guns of freedom

Bring the lackeys
Up against it
Up against the wall
Bring the bishop
Up against it
Up against the wall
Bring the chairman
Up against it
Up against the wall
Put the general
Up against it
Up against the wall!
