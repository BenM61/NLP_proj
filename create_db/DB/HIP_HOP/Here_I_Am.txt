Ricky Ross, with something special right here
Excuse the marijuana, just trying to drug myself
We got some gangstas in the house too
Come on

I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man, here I am

Sight seeing, we might be in
The Codra port or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester she transfer to Florida state

Cooking like home-etch for financial aid
I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid
Remember mean time, my finance is straight
I even open up the doors to the penitential states

'Cause she used to fight with her moms
Till I sat 'em both down, now she's tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm, now she know she getting sliced
Spending nights in Milan

We still blow weed together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
With the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She's from the north and still can't believe the weather, boss

I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man, here I am

Hear I am and here I go
Why you looking for that other, when you got the best?
The previous was a test for ya, now you in the big league
A black Sine brother, who wouldn't wanna play for me?

Ya last man was a chump and you can tell him I said it
He was talking a lot at first but you can see that dead it
You can see I ain't sweat it
Hell I'll even call him up myself and tell him I even get it

Naw please, don't confuse me, miss
I'm tryna see, I could put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think your ass fine as shit

And that's straight up real talk
All bullshit aside, she replied, ?I like to do the wild thing?
Action took place at my place
Now my place is her place, yeah

I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man, here I am

Mo' better, mo' cheddar, not the man off your clothes, last sweater
Hoe getter, gorilla, f*ck chuffers I went and got mo' killas, boss
I rock with niggas like Fabolous
'Cause he tell the truth baby like fabulous
But you make it look glamorous
Here's spaghetti strapped heels not for amateurs

Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like Roxy, spark that broccoli
Walk quite aky, let me sexy, I will save you if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me I love the alphabet, girl I'm a G
Time will tell, Rolex watches, we show stoppas, hoes just watchin'

I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man, here I am
