Mmm...hmm...hmm...hmm...hmm...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes
Whoa...oh...whoa...oh...yeah, yeah

I hear you tellin' me that it's okay
If I want to be with him you'll walk away
Say you knew that I was there last night
And if I'm gettin' back with him it's alright

You tell me even though your heart is broke
You love somebody then you let them go
I know you think you got it all worked out
But you haven't heard my side of the story

I was sayin' goodbye (Oh) to him
So I can be here with you
Before you give up on us
You gotta hear my side of the story

I told him that it was over (Over, hey)
I just needed the closure
To give you all of my lovin'
Now you've heard my side of the story

Just to know that when you hurt so deep
All you could think about is what makes me happy
If I cry it's 'cause I never knew
Somebody, anybody like you

You didn't know what the deal, but you thought it wasn't real
Still you tried to understand, if it all had to end
You were willin' to walk away
But you hadn't heard my side of the story

I was sayin' goodbye to him (Goodbye to him)
So (So) I can be here with you (Here with you, baby)
Before you give up on us
You gotta hear my side of the story (Hear my side of the story)

I told him that it was over (Over, oh, yeah)
I just needed the closure
To (To) give (You) you all of my lovin'
Now you've heard my side of the story

We can talk 'bout this all night
Baby, if you want to, yeah, yeah
But I got somethin' else in my mind
So baby, let me show you, oh...oh...oh...

Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah...
All I was sayin' was goodbye, baby

I was sayin' goodbye to him (Baby)
So I can be here with you (So I could be with you, baby)
Before you give up on us (Oh)
You gotta (My) hear my side (My) of the story (Side)

I told him that it was over (I told him it was over)
I just needed the closure (I just needed some closure)
To give you all of my lovin'
Now you've heard my side of the story

I was sayin' goodbye to him (Before you leave, before you go)
So I can be here with you (There?s just one thing you need to know, I loved you)
Before you give up on us (I need you, I want you so, baby)
You gotta hear my side of the story

I told him that it was over
I just needed the closure
To give you all of my lovin'
Now you've heard my side of the story

I was sayin' goodbye to him
So I can be here with you
