And let me get my gloves
And walk the dogs for miles
Slower every day

I dream of growing big
Taken over by a slob
But the pay day stayed away

And I want you to know
That my brain is getting slow
But I'll stay making hay at

The supermarket never sleeps, yeah
The supermarket never sleeps
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Relief from muscular pain
And my faint heart beats away
Are my hands on the controls

And the lines up on my head
Make the railroads seem so small
But the pay day stayed away

And I want you to know
That my drains are overflowed
But I'll stay making hay at

The supermarket never sleeps, yeah
The supermarket never sleeps
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

But I'll, stay, making hay
Hearts and minds stay tonight
Today tonight always

And I won't let you know
That my drugs are getting low
