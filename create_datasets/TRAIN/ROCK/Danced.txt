I love you, strange man
You had come from so far away
Talking
We were talking, well we tried

Then we danced
Laughing
We were laughing
But then we touched
I just broke
Down crying
I felt your planet so far away
Touching the love
From your distant star
The pains the troubles past
From your distant star
We've been waiting 2000 years for you to come again
Such a long, long time
Just to learn the truth
And then we 
Danced

(solo)

Dance!
Dance!
Dance your life away!

Dance!
Dance!
Dance your life away!

(solo)

Dance!
Dance!
Dance your life away!

Dance!
Dance!
Dance your life away!

So far away...

I know I love you...

(solo)

We danced
