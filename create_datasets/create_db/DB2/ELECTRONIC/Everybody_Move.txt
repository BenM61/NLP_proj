Gold chains and shiny rings
An eye opening sight in the fading night
She knows they're watching
As her hips breathe in for their second skin

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room
Deep in the night I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine
Everybody move, there's no one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Just back from Bombay
There are no frontiers now I know you're here
A telegram from a party man
We can dance all night 'cause it feels so right

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room
Deep in the night I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine
Everybody move, there's no one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Got a feeling that he's looking at me
The people's idol and someone to envy
I've gotta tell him the way I'm feeling
The way I'm feeling, so good, so good

Somebody better get out a warning
Somebody better start making room
Deep in the night when I hear you calling
Tigers eyes can see you running

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine
Everybody move, there's no one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine
Everybody move, there's no one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Everybody move, let my love come through
Through your body to mine
Everybody move, there's no one but you
And you're gonna be mine

Everybody, everybody move
Everybody
Everybody, everybody move
Everybody

Everybody, everybody move
Everybody
Everybody, everybody move
Everybody

Everybody, everybody move
Everybody
Everybody, everybody move
Everybody

Everybody, everybody move
Everybody
