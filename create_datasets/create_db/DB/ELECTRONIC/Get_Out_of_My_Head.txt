Forget what you've been told
Conceal the truth you know
The phoenix fights desire
And you know just what I mean

In my cells; you're in my soul
What you can't touch you'll never hold

You ask
Beg
You plead

Get out of my head
Get out of my...
Get out of my...
Get out of my head

Just a little to late
Been so long
Gotta do a double take
I don't remember your face
It's all in the words
And the way we relate
Don't be long, don't be late
Mind and motion makes me wait
Twisting till I trans mutate
Reinstate deactivate

Colossal information
Short circuit detonation

Get out of my head
Get out of my...
Get out of my...
Get out of my head

Sink deep
Trip scriptures on the blink
Divide conquer
Whatcha win is whatcha bring on
Emotions light
Red comet glare at night
Free fall
Against yourself you fight

Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Get out of my head
