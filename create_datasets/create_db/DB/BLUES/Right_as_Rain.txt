Right as rain
Right as rain
Baby our love
Is right as rain
 
You can't run
You can't hide
From the way that you feel baby
Deep down inside
You need me
Like I need you
And nobody else, no no
Could ever do
 
Right as rain
Right as rain
Baby our love, you know our love
Is right as rain
 
Sometimes when the rain
Comes fallin' down
You know its gonna wipe out
The whole damn town
But one thing baby
Everybody knows
You got to have a little rain, yea yea 
To make the flowers grow
 
Right as rain
Right as rain
Baby our love, you know our love
Is right as rain
The stronger the love
The stronger the pain
Baby our love, our love, our love
Is right as rain
 
Just like a storm
Out on the sea
So it is baby
With you and me
'Cause you know the sun, baby
Is gonna shine again
Baby our love, our love, our love
Is right as rain
