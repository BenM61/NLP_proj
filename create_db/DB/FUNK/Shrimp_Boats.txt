Oh...
(CHORUS):
Shrimp boats is a-comin' 
Their sails are in sight
Shrimp boats is a-comin'
There's dancin' tonight 
Why don't 'cha hurry hurry hurry home
Why don't 'cha hurry hurry hurry home
Look here! The shrimp boats is a-comin'
There's dancin' tonight
(Shrimp boats is a-comin', there's dancin' tonight)

(REPEAT CHORUS)

(SLOWLY): 
They go to sea with the evenin' tide
And the women folk wave their good-bye
(There they go... There they go)
While the Louisiana moon floats on high
And they wait for the day when they can cry...

(CHORUS)

(SLOWLY):
Happy the days while they're mending the nets
'Til once more they ride out to sea
(There they go... There they go)
Then how lonely the nights will be
'Til that wonderful day when they sing...

(CHORUS)

(Shrimp boats is a-comin' - there's dancin'
There's dancin' There's dancin' There's dancin' ...)

Shrimp boats is a-comin' - there's dancin' tonight!
