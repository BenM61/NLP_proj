Hatred, another way to shine
Feel it, rushing through your veins
You saw me falling out from a bar
You called me hippie and bum
You wanted to nail my face so hard
Another Pilgrim gone so wrong
Bimbo, another way to shine
Lolita, you pathetic bitch
You saw me at the end of the bar
She asked me if I had a need to play dad
I said get out off my fucking face
Another pilgrim gone so wrong
Another child-girl in search of love
Another pilgrim without a clue
Cocain, another way to shine
Feel it, dancing in your brain
Hey Cristobal, Macho-oldman-child Spanish dealer
Well have yo you found another blond child
Another pilgrim gone so wrong
Another old man parasite
Another spanish macho-child
