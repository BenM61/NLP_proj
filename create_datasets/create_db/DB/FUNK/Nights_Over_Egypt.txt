There's a star in the east
Over pyramids at Kingstown
There had once lived a girl, she ruled the world
Then down the Nile he came with a smile

He was a king, she was the queen
Under the moonlight
Your eyes won't believe what your mind can't conceive
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt

In ??? girls that swirl to the music
Nights over Egypt

Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

Women fan the heat
Where fans to receive by no one
Take a caravan across the Sudan
Sahara facade, it's just no mirage

Oasis in the sand where life once began
Under the moonlight
Your eyes won't believe what your mind can't conceive
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt

Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt

Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
