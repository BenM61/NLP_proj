If you feel the hurt is but a kiss away
Close your eyes and take it
And if you feel that pain can tear you in two
Go ahead and bear it

You know the words he's gonna say
Still you sit and listen
And those tender words can melt this strong man's heart
Yours will learn a lesson

And when you hear him say
"I don't want your love"
Try not to turn away

A broken man almost died of a broken heart
A broken man, that's what I am
And when you think you've had enough
Just say stop, I understand

You'll stop your tears from building up inside
Baby, stop your trembling hands

And when you hear him say
"I don't want your love"
Try not to turn away

A broken man almost died of a broken heart
A broken man, that's what I am
I'm a broken man
