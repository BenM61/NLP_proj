Tic tac toc that's he not stop
Tip-toe don't make you rock
What they say long long what you know I got
Bla bla against the wall
So pee-wee cyber tall
Ring ring ring when duty the calls
Na na na don't word it all

Big mouth, big mouth, my, my, my, you've said enough
Got a big mouth, big mouth, my, my, my, you've said enough

See what watching the
See what watching the

Deep down don't know what you want
This might throw me upfront
Be ready I got no guts
Ga, ga, ga, all slightly off
Not me, I'll take the loss
See see see does it be off

Big mouth, big mouth, my, my, my, you've said enough

Got a big mouth, big mouth, my, my, my, you've said enough
See what watching the
See what watching the
See what watching the
See what watching the

Was that you said
See what watching the
See what watching the
Was that you said
See what watching the

Ring ring ring
Ring ring ring

You're everywhere I go thinking that you know
You're everywhere I go thinking that you know
Oh gonna need it if you know

Was that you said
See what watching the
See what watching the
Was that you said
See what watching the
