(Featuring KRS One) 
Intro: KRS One 
Music please 
Yes  welcome to Jealous One's Envy 
We'd like to thank you in advance for purchasing this product 
It is a Relativity Records product  artist Fat Joe 
My name is KRS One 
And of course we're gonna bring THE noise 
Cause we can never be toys 
Verse One: KRS One  Fat Joe 
Yes I am the ultimate  uttering ultimatum's for the fun of it 
It appears to me you don't know who you fuckin with 
You can't see this with bifocals cause you're local 
Can't hang with my vocals, better you f*ck with Sonny Bono 
Or Yoko Ono, but KRS oh NO NO 
You might think you a ROTC but I don't give a f*ck though 
I'm rolling hard like God for the squad black 
Packin them poppers bitch, where that money be at? 
Aiyyo I be the show stopper, as I shine like gold 
Other rappers dull like copper, the certified fake nigga dropper 
Which borough, is the thorough 
I know, do you know, let me know I'm sayin though 
The coke connector, sweating leather with reflectors 
Don't get caught up in my sector, or I'ma haveta inject ya 
with a slab of this lyrical dope shit 
Fake MC's and wannabe's best to quote this 
Fat Joe the true and living will prevail 
Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale 
Will I fail? I doubt it 
I'm the nigga catchin bodies, while other niggaz fantasize about it 
True indeed, behind my back MC's claim they can serve me 
In my face they screaming "We're not worthy!" 
Youse a has been, actually you ain't been 
I be touring, while you be home taping 
So what punk, you could battle in a second 
Frankly the bottom line, is where's your hit record 
You claim I'm jocking, claim I'm on your dick, where's your witnesses? 
If I'm on your dick my name has got to be syphillis 
"If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck" - Jeru 
"Up up up and away 'cause I don't play clown" - cool G Rap 
"If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck" - Jeru 
"Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down" - cool G Rap 
Verse Two: Fat Joe 
As we proceed to lock it down, don't get it fucked up 
We be the kings of the Boogie Down 
All we do is spark izm and get cash 
Tortuing MC's like that warden up in Alcatraz (bo! bo! bo! bo!) 
It's Fat Joe, yo you know my steelo 
Get so much love, I'm payin sixteen on a kilo 
Sendin niggaz outta town, still got control of the Boogie Down 
Now how the f*ck you sound? (Yeahhh) 
Ain't no army that could harm me or bomb me 
c'mon G you clowns ain't got a fucking thing on me 
I'm flashy like white linen (tell em) 
Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the ninth 
inning 
I'm down with Kris and ain't no stopping me 
I'm out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me 
It's My Philosophy, but for now it's in the corridor 
Slappin caps like a ball hittin hard to my laborator 
These motherfuckers don't want it 
(Word to mother Joe, these niggaz don't want it!)

Verse Three: KRS-One 
Merrrcy, you want to serve me but you ain't worthy 
My style is too curvy, what you tellin me 
But your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and find I'm your 
boss 
With KRS-One up in your memory 
I know your kind, you rap write 
You're Mr. John Gotti the Don, but you're just another bwotty mon 
Telecro bwotty mon, how you collect 
Rap magazine dating back to, Tougher than Leather 
The only reason you got, such an extensive rap collection 
'cause most of your rap mags are all stuck together 
Watch what you sayin, watch what you say 
When your skull gets cracked, whatcha gonna say crackhead? 
Your file is dead, kneel to the rap God in bed 
Fore I slap you way Back in the Dayz like Ahmad 
Don't get me fed up, or vexed up, 'cause you'll get set up 
My crew don't let up, I be dead up in this piece (tell em) 
Recognize it's BlastMaster KRS-One 
For ten years, Fat Joe, chillin on the East
