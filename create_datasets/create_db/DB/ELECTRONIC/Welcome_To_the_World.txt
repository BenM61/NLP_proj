(Welcome to the world, welcome to the world)
You got your pop star, I'll be your rock star
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions wont stop
You get your fifteen, and then they take the spot

Let's go, let's go, and then you're ready to go
Let's go, let's go, 'cause it's the end of the show
Let's go, let's go, so just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone,
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world

She saw the bright lights, she caught the fever
She got contagious, she never leave it
So no more time spent and no more free shit
In fact this free ride has reached its destination

Let's go, let's go, and then you're ready to go
Let's go, let's go, 'cause it's the end of the show
Let's go, let's go, and when it's over you'll know
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone,
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world

Let's go, let's go, and then you're ready to go
Let's go, let's go, 'cause it's the end of the show
Let's go, let's go, so just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone,
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world (to the world, to the world)

Welcome to the world (to the world, to the world)
Welcome to the world (to the world, to the world)
Welcome to the world (to the world, to the world)
Welcome to the world (to the world, to the world)
