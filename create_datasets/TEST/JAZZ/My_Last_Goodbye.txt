I smiled, so did you
But somehow we knew 
It was my last goodbye to you 
Your eyes met with mine 
Your lips so divine 
It was my last goodbye to you 

Oh darling, though you are gone 
My dreams linger on 
Of days when you said "I love you" 
I smile through a tear 
Today makes the year 
That I said goodbye to you
