Straight, no chaser.
We don't waste our time on fakeness.
One glass one shot is all it takes us.
Better this than fade away

So, our story goes this empty city
Crowded skies are clearing but I'm lonesome.
No! Bring on the night.
There's work a plenty.
Fluorescent lamps are passing in slow motion,

Only I will wander
Only I can leave

So we set the scene, a sea of faces.
Laser eyes are watching as we close in.
Don't play innocent. 
I know your thinking.
You're chasing conversation out of focus.
