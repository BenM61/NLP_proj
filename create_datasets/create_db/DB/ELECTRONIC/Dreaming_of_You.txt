Stone angel
You're a born heartbreaker
And I'm a soft-hearted lover
Does it mean we'll never get along?
I could write it on the paper
I could be your fire starter
Or just another number
Does it mean the game is already over?

Stone angel
You're a cold-hearted person
And I'm a sweet sweet lover
Does it mean we'll never get along?
I could heat you with a touch now
I could be your fire starter
Or just another number
Does that mean the game is already over?

Cold angel
You were born with a heart of stone
And I'm a soft-hearted lover
Does that mean we'll never get along?

There's no one who moves me like you do, baby

I'm still dreaming of you

Dedicated to your love
I'm still dreaming of you
Such a special kind of love
