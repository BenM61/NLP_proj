I just want you back

She party all the time, hey yeah
She just wanna pull all nighters
She'll do anything I like
Anything to make me like her more
Body got me like good lord
Everything I'm asking for
Don't know what's wrong with me, dammit

Should've known it all along
You're the only girl I want

She don't feel like you do
She don't look like you do, oh
When you're stuck in my head
And I just can't pretend
That she taste like you do
Give me love like you do, oh
Now I'm missing you bad
And I just want you back
I just want you back

Don't know why I let you go
Baby, that was stupid of me
Never said I had a halo
Didn't mean to make you insecure
I was acting immature
All I wanna be is yours
Don't know what's wrong with me, dammit

Should have known it all along
You're the only girl I want

She don't feel like you do
She don't look like you do, oh
When you're stuck in my head
And I just can't pretend
That she tastes like you do
Give me love like you do, oh
Now I'm missing you bad
And I just want you back
I just want you back

Just let me make it up, yeah yeah yeah
'Cause girl, you're the one I love
I'll wait here by the door 'til you ain't back no more
Can we make it like it was before?

She don't feel like you do
She don't look like you do, oh
When you're stuck in my head
And I just can't pretend
That she tastes like you do
Give me love like you do, oh
Now I'm missing you bad
And I just, I just, I just, I just
I just want you back
I just want you back
