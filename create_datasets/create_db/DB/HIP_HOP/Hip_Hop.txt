I ain't tryin' to bring New York back
I'm just a breath of fresh air
That good ole' New York rap
Slick talk to the track
C'mon who brought that
To the game
Graffiti all on the train
Get up your name
I don't feel how I used to feel
I'm in my 20's
So a new Nas joint used to give me the chills
In the barbershop tryin to cop a new hot tape
The Rob Lowe's is crazy
The duhops greatest Hip Hop (hip hop)
And yes I'm a fan first
If you from the south and you snap til' your hands hurt
If you from the west W's in the air
If you from the east coast act like you from here
The good ole' 2 step
The classic head nod
The thirsty ice grills
Who wants to get robbed? (robbed)
That was the energy in the club
On the real that was the energy that I loved

Aww man this is (hip hop)
Hands up if you forever a fan of (hip hop)
I wake up (hip hop)
Go to sleep (hip hop)
Dream bout (hip hop)
'Cause I am (hip hop)
Aw man this is (hip hop)
Hands up if you forever a fan of (hip hop)
I wake up (hip hop)
Go to sleep (hip hop)
Dream bout (hip hop)
'Cause I am (hip hop)

I ain't tryin make you dance I just rip beats
But the soul in my voice give you quick feet
I don't know what it's like to not dig deep
When I'm holdin' this mic
I don't just beat pip squeeks
The tides come in and the earth shakes
200 mph wind I'm your worst fate
Birthdate
July 6 1980
How can your age even matter when you rhyme this crazy
Aw man I gotta thank the lord
'Cause with this pen in my hand
I don't think that hard
It just happens
Wrist action classic in the making
I kick back and just laugh I'm happy that I'm amazing
Look at me gaze into my eyes see the poverty
Now understand why me and this music gotta be
It's something that's inside of me
And I can't shake it
So I embrace it
And let ya'll taste it
