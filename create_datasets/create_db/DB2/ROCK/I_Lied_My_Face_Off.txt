Well it's not fair, it's not even close
You tied me down where I'm forced to watch
As you poke holes in every part of me
Containing something secretly
Something sacred to me
I lied my face off when I said that I would be okay
It's never fine when you go away
These cuts run deep, these scars are permanent
And always on display
This makes things difficult for me

It's not fair, it's not even close
You fed me the sun, burned me up inside
And watched me choke on everything we did
On everything we lived
Let's see if I can live again
I lied my face off when I said that I would be okay
It's never fine when you go away
These cuts run deep, these scars are permanent
And always on display
This makes things difficult for me

Head like an empty, sterile room
Somehow I made a mess
Like watching newborn babies crack 
from work related stress
Head like an empty, sterile room
Somehow I made a mess
Like watching newborn babies crack 
from work related stress
I'm bad luck, can't f*ck, got no reflection today
Maybe I'll stay down next time I get hit by a train
By a train
I lied my face off when I said that I would be okay
It's never fine when you go away
