What would be the first thing
You'd say to the Lord?
And the last thing you would dream
If you couldn't dream no more?
Won't you please help me to understand
Is there no mercy in this land?
No mercy in this land?

Followed the river 'til the river ran dry
Followed my lover 'til we said goodbye
Followed you through soldiers
Who fire on command
Is there no mercy in this land?

These days I speak in whispers
Travel only to and from
Come close you'll see the red
Of a well bitten tongue
The righteous and the wretched
The holy and the damned
Is there no mercy in this land?
No mercy in this land?

Father left us down here all alone
My poor mother is under a stone
With an aching heart and trembling hands
Is there no mercy in this land?
