You said you wanna ride with me
You wanna feel alive with me
But you love so casually
I heard it once, I don't wanna hear it twice
You said you could provide for me
You know you can confide in me
You never have to lie to me
I said it once, and I ain't gonna say it twice

I don't know what you want me to be, but I want you to be happy
I can see but don't wanna believe my own reality
I don't know what you want me to be, but I want you to be happy
I can see but don't wanna believe my own reality

So come on preach
All your misery that ain't what I need
So come on preach
If that's what you gotta do to keep my company
So come on preach
Say you're gonna leave then maybe you should go
Or you can preach
And hope that I believe it

I don't feel your touch, don't feel your love, your love
I don't feel your touch, don't feel your love, your love

A beautiful catastrophy
Drama to a tragedy
Happened so casually
(I told you once I ain't gonna tell you twice)
You say you wanna rock for me,
But you don't know geology
You're drying up the treasury
(I said it once and I ain't gonna say it twice)

I don't know what you want me to be, but I want you to be happy
I can see but don't wanna believe my own reality
I don't know what you want me to be, but I want you to be happy
I can see but don't wanna believe my own reality

So come on preach
All your misery that ain't what I need
So come on preach
If that's what you gotta do to keep my company
So come on preach
Say you're gonna leave then maybe you should go
Or you can preach
And hope that I believe it

I don't feel your touch, don't feel your love, your love
I don't feel your touch, don't feel your love, your love

Being satisfied isn't good enough
Good luck to you
It's a shame about that

So come on preach
All your misery that ain't what I need
So come on preach
If that's what you gotta do to keep my company
So come on preach
Say you're gonna leave then maybe you should go
Or you can preach
And hope that I believe it
