It was just like takin' candy from a baby
'Cause I couldn't resist you from the very start
You had me around your little finger
No trouble at all for you to tip toe in my heart
It's the first time that I lost my head completely
Oh, you swept me off my feet just one, two, three
It was just like takin' candy from a baby
The way you stole my heart away from me
