Tell me, what in the world can be wrong
Tell me, what in the world can be wrong
Woke up this morning
Trouble knocking on my door
I wonder what the trouble
Big trouble at my door
I wonder what the trouble
Real troubles at my door
Thursday morning my baby's making
Don't want me anymore
I'll have to forget it, and let this trouble pass
I'll have to forget it, and let this trouble pass
Well, I wonder sometimes, how long my troubles gonna last
All night long, somebody knocking on my door
All night long, somebody knocking on my door
There ain't nothing but my troubles
Can't be worried here anymore
Ooh, good bye, good bye baby, got to go
Ooh, good bye, good bye baby, got to go
I can't lay around here, be worried with this trouble no more
Trouble is knocking
Trouble is knocking
Trouble is knocking
Trouble is knocking
