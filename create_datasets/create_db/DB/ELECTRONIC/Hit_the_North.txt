Hit the North
Hit the North
(Hit the North) my Cat says eeeee-ack
Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North

Ninety-five percent of hayseeds
(Hit the North) are corn-pones, guaranteed
Hit the North
Computers and fashion hotels
Cops can't catch criminals
But what the heck, they're not too bad, they talk to God 
Religious

Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North

Manacled to the city
Manacled to the city (hit the North)

All estate, all es, all estate agents alive
Yell down nights in hysterical breath
Those Northern Lights, so pretty
Those big big big wide streets
Those useless MPs
Savages

Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North
(Manacled to the system) Hit the North

From the back third eye psyche
The reflected mirror of delirium
Eastender and Victoria's lager
The induced call, mysterious
Comes forth

Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North

Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North

Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North
Hit the North
