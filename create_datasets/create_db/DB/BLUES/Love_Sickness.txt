Went to my doctor, my doctor said
It's a wonder you ain't dead
The sickness you got I can't cure
Getting over, it is up to you

You've been living in the twilight zone
Since your woman left you all alone

You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood

Listen, son, everybody knows
Since she left you ain't the same no more
Pull yourself together before it's too late
'Cause you headed for the judgment day

Walking around, it's a crying shame
You don't even know your mother's name

You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood

Let me give you some good advice
From a man who had eleven wives
When a woman don't want you no more
Best thing to do is let her go

Go and find yourself someone new
'Fore this thing gets a hold of you

You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood

You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood
You've got the love sickness in your blood

You've got the love sickness in your blood
