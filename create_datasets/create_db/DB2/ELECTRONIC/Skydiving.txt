It all starts here, with a rush of blood to the head
And I feel no fear
And nothing's happening yet
You pull me in
I'm doing things I never would do
My pulse, racing
I'm coming alive with you

Free fall with me
Get a little unruly
No guts, no glory
You said to me, "Get a little unruly
No guts, no glory"

You got me skydiving
You got me high flying
Oh, I'm jumping off of the world now, uh
Never stop, never slow down
Skydiving

I take the leap without a parachute
'Cause I can't keep my hands away from you
And I'm all in
It's too late to turn around
Adrenaline is taking my body now

Free fall with me
Get a little unruly
No guts, no glory

You got me skydiving
You got me high flying
Oh, I'm jumping off of the world now, uh
Never stop, never slow down
Skydiving

I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going skydiving

Boy, you're leaving a mark on me
Diving into me so slowly
Always making it so easy to convince me
Boy, you're leaving a mark on me
Diving into me so slowly
Always making it so easy to convince me

You got me skydiving
You got me high flying
Oh, I'm jumping off of the world now, uh
Never stop, never slow down
Skydiving

(Skydiving)
I'm going down, down, down, down
(You got me skydiving)
I'm going down, down, down, down
(You got me highflying)
I'm going down, down, down, down
(You got me)
I'm going skydiving
I'm going down
