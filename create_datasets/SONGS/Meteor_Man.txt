And he came and he went 
And he just disappeared 
Like a flash in the night 
When the dead are the feared 
What a man, what a mind 
He was all he could be 
And he never see nothing 
That's quite like me 

Oh my meteor man... 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
I had the fire in my eyes 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
He was my meteor man 
Meteor man, meteor man 
There's no love in your soul 
I have to let go 

There was fire in his eyes 
I was burnt by the flame 
Like a tiger let loose 
Satisfied to lay lame 
He was power, he was strength 
And he came down on me 
And had never felt nothing 
Quite so free 

Oh my meteor man... 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
I had the fire in my eyes 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
He was my meteor man 
Meteor man, meteor man 
There's no love in your soul 
I have to let go 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
When he disappeared 
I had the tears in my eyes 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
Oh my meteor man... 

Meteor man, meteor man... 
I had the fire in my eyes 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
He was my meteor man 
Meteor man, meteor man 
There's no love in your soul 
I have to let go 
Meteor man, meteor man... 
Oh when he came 
And he said had never felt 
Nothing like me 
Nothing like me 
Meteor man, meteor man 
I had the tears in my eyes 
When he flew from the sky 
Meteor man, meteor man... 

Oh my meteor man...
