We're words upon a window
Written there in steam
In the heat of the moment
At the birth of a dream
Vapors passing really

So I'm touched by the thoughts
In the fleeting minutes after 
The time that we've come
Come and go, you know, where the wind blows

An' though I couldn't define
I can only tell you that I
Got a heavy soul
Tuesdays dressed in shearling

Anchored on belief
In the sunlight on the water
Or rain upon a leaf
And I'm touched by its' beauty
And I hope to touch you too
'Cause I still seek the same things
That I once sought to be true 
And you know, that where the wind blows
Tho' I wouldn't be lying, when I tell you that I

Got a heavy soul
It's a joy to know
I've got a heavy soul
We're words upon a window
Written there in steam
In the heat of the moment
Everything is what it seems
Vapors passing nearly
So I'm touched by the thought
That I can't be beaten and I can't be bought
And you'll know

That where the wind blows
I don't think I'd be lyin'
When I tell you that I
I've got a heavy soul
