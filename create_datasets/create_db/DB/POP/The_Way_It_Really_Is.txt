I kept talking to myself
I had to get the words out of my head
So I did
You barely said a thing
You kind of heard me out and then you said

You said:
"You're crazy, why do you keep doing this?
Everything is fine."
Then I think, I'm crazy
I do this all the time
Until I start to think that nothing's even wrong

Maybe I am
Hiding in my own confusion
Maybe we're just
A picture in my head
Maybe what if it could be
The way I wish it really was
Maybe I don't want to see it
The way it really is

Sometimes your intentions
Are totally impossible to read
What does that mean?
Sometimes even I
Have no idea what I need
I wish I did.

I'm crazy
Why do I keep doing this?
Everything is fine.
Then you think I'm crazy
I do this all the time
Until I start to think
That something's really wrong

Maybe I am
Hiding in my own confusion
Maybe we're just
A picture in my head
Maybe what if it could be
The way I wish it really was
Maybe I don't want to see it
The way it really is

Looking out my window
At the big blue sky
Lazy sun shining and so I run outside
To look for you
I look for you
And then it starts to rain

Maybe I am
Is that the way it really is?
Maybe we're just
A picture in my head
Maybe what if it could be
The way I wish it really was
Maybe I don't want to see it
The way it really is

Maybe I am
Hiding in my own confusion
Maybe we're just
A picture in my head
Maybe what if it could be
The way I wish it really was
Maybe I don't want to see it
The way it really is

Maybe I don't want to see it
Maybe I don't want to see it
The way it really is
The way it really is
The way it really is
The way it really is
