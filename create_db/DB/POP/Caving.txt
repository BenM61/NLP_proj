I've been rolling through the wreckage
I've been dusting off the mess you made
I've been feeling kinda restless
I've been trying not to walk away
Then my knees start to buckle
I've been standing here for far too long
Shiver running up my spine
Tell me what's right, what's wrong

I waited for you to be strong enough
So I wasn't the only one holding us up

Ooh, I'm caving
Ooh, I'm caving
We bend till we're broken
I'm a sucker for hopeless
Ooh, I'm caving

I'm caving
I'm caving

I thought I'd learned my lesson
I thought the dust settled in
But I'm digging through your shambles
Hoping that you'll let me in

I waited for you to be strong enough
So I wasn't the only one holding us up

Ooh, I'm caving
Ooh, I'm caving
We bend till we're broken
I'm a sucker for hopeless
Ooh, I'm caving

I'm caving
I'm caving
I'm caving
I'm caving

I waited for you to be strong enough (strong enough)
So I wasn't the only one holding us up

Ooh, I'm caving
Ooh, I'm caving
