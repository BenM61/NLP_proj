Plan to motor west
Take my way, the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

It winds from Chicago to la
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

Now you go through St. Louie
Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City looks mighty pretty
You'll see Amarillo
Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff Arizona
Don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernadino

Won't you get hip to this timely tip
When you make that California trip
Get your kicks on Route six six
