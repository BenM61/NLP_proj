I got a beauty in the backyard 
She doesn't look like much I know 
But man you should have seen her drive 
A couple years ago 

We had one foot in the cradle 
And the other on the gas 
And we would run all night 
Tryin' to make each moment last 

And we'd ride through the darkness 
And sometimes we'd go to far 
But the good times rolled away too soon 
In my Great Big American Car 

Now she's on broken down condition 
And she's in need of some repair 
You know I sure do miss 
The shine she used to wear 

Well she was all I ever wanted 
And I was all she ever had 
And we would carry each other 
Through times both good and bad 

And we'd ride through the darkness 
And sometimes we'd go to far 
But the good times rolled away too soon 
In my great big American car... 
In my great big American car... 

I got a beauty in the backyard 
Well you can call her a dinosaur 
But there's a heart still a-beatin' there 
And baby that's what dreams are for... That's for sure... 

And we'd ride through the darkness 
And sometimes we'd go to far 

But the good times rolled away too soon 
In my great big American car... 
In my great big American car... Hey, hey, hey...
