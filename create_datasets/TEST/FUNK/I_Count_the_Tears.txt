Na, na, na, na, na, na late at night
Na, na, na, na, na, na late at night

I have counted everyday that she's been away
It seemed like a thousand years
And at na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night
Na, na, na, na, na, na late at night
I'll sit and count the tears (na, na, na, na late at night)

I have counted all your lies all your alibis
I'm a guy believes just what he hears
And at na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night
Na, na, na, na, na, na,late at night
I'll sit and count the tears

She's gone and found somebody new
She may be happy now but soon
He'll be counting everyday that she's been away
It will seem like a thousand years

And at na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night
Na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night
He'll sit and count his tears (na, na, na, na late at night)
He'll sit and count his tears (na, na, na, na late at night)
He'll sit and count his tears (na, na, na, na late at night)
He'll sit, and count his tears
