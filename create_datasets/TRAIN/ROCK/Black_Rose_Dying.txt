Gouge out, your eyes, pull your, heart to the floor,
With my heart my skin my kiss, stand back drop to your knees,
I'll stand back as you bleed, my heart my skin my kiss
This blade it feels so cold, baby hold me while, I'm shaken,
This knife has pierced my soul, I sit alone while, I'm shaken
And yes I'll laugh out loud, with blind eyes, I'm shaken

Gouge out, your eyes, pull your heart to the floor,
Sweetness love me, tastes me, hears me,
Stand back drop to your knees,
I'll stand back as you bleed,
Sweetness love me, tastes me, hears me

This blade it feels so cold, baby hold me while, I'm shaken,
This knife has pierced my soul, I sit alone while, I'm shaken,
And yes I'll laugh out loud, with blind eyes I'm shaken

Now take me out of this place
Now take me out of this place
Out, take me out, take me out, take me, out,
Out, take me out, take me out, take me, out
Take me, take me, take me out

Gouge out, your eyes, pull your, heart to the floor,
With my heart my skin my kiss
Stand back drop to your knees,
I'll stand back as you bleed with my heart my skin my kiss
Yes I am,yes I am,yes I am, yes I am
My heart my skin my kiss

Gouge out, your eyes, pull your, heart to the floor,
With my heart my skin my kiss. stand back, drop to your knees.
I'll stand back as you bleed,
Sweetness love me, tastes me, hears me

Wait for them to come again, and take you away from me
I can't wait for you to come again and take you, black rose dying
