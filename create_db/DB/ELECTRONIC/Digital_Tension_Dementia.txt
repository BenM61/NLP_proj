You can't say yes, you can't say no 
You're living in a fascist world 
Violence is your point of view, 
It always makes the best of you 

Freedom is a luxury 
Of self induced hostility, 
My back is up against the wall, 
And everywhere dead men fall 

Efficiency - redundant fear but don't you see? 
The power games that they play, 
The methods which they put in your way 
"The charges aren't justified" 

Violence is your point of view 
It always gets the best of you 
Redundant fear but don't you see? - Efficiency 

You don't get time to look around 
You keep your face to the ground 
You can't say yes, you can't say no 
You're living in a fascist world
