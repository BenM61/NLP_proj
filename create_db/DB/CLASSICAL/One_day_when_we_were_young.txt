One day when we were young
That wonderful morning in May
You told me you loved me
When we were young one day

Sweet songs of spring were sung
And music was never so gay
You told me you loved me
When we were young one day

You told me you loved me
And held me close to your heart
We laughed then, we cried then
Then came the ti-ime to part

When songs of spring are sung
Remember that morning in May
Remember you loved me
When we were young one day

We laughed then, we cried then
Then came the ti-ime to par-art

When songs of spring are sung
Remember that morning in May
Remember you loved me
When we were young one day...
