Sexy Quiet
Shy, but down for a good time
Taurus sign
Like rain, but love the sunshine
Makin' headlines
Feel I'm too deep define
Simple inside
But I'm livin' the diva life

Damita Jo
Do you like me
Do you want me
Just for what you see
Damita Jo
Do you think that I'm that person
You watch on TV
Damita Jo
There's another side
That I don't hide
But might never show
Damita Jo
If you want to get close
Baby, you can't
'Til you get to know
Damita Jo

A friend and a lover
A sista
A freak undercover
Do movies
I do dance
Do music
I love doin' my man
I want to nasty boy to put it on me good
Ms. Jackson don't
But Damita Joe do
A little lady
A whole lotta class
But you do me wrong I'll get in that ass

Damita Jo
Do you like me
Do you want me
Just for what you see
Damita Jo
Do you think that I'm that person

Damita Jo

Oh I'm gonna tell your daddy
I'm gonna tell your momma
Sometimes you just want to fit in
Sometimes you just want to play
