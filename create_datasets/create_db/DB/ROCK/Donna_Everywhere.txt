I met her at the movies, she was there on her own
A bargain matinee
Theater deserted, she sat right next to me
Can't remember what played that day
She leans real near, she whispers in my ear
I blink, she grins, choke on my M&M's

The lights went down, the lion roared
Donna got down on the floor

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care
I see Donna everywhere
Down by the lakeside, in a lawn chair
Donna, Donna everywhere

She agreed to move in, but my dog made her sneeze
So I gave the dog away
Should've kept the dog, given her to my friend
Cause he took her anyway

Those lips, those eyes, that tattoo on her thigh
White teeth, red hair, she hated underwear

Is this real or in my fucking head?
Donna's dancing on my bed

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care
I see Donna everywhere
Down by the lakeside, in a lawn chair
Donna, Donna everywhere

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care
I see Donna everywhere
Down by the lakeside, in a lawn chair
Donna, Donna everywhere

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care
I see Donna everywhere
Down by the lakeside, in a lawn chair
Donna, Donna everywhere

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care
Oh I see Donna everywhere
Down by the lakeside, in a lawn chair
Donna, Donna everywhere
Donna, Donna everywhere
Donna, Donna everywhere
Donna, Donna everywhere
Donna, Donna everywhere (I'm losing my mind, but I don't care)
I see Donna everywhere
