Rose print underwear
Curly curly blonde blonde hair
Shine like a dandy lion,
So I hear my own self sighin'
Shooby-dooby, hey, hey, hee
I hope you don't scare easily
Wash my brain, wash my brain
Cleanse me of this shame
And wash my brain
Your skirts are so clean
And rest just above the knee
These needs are so intense,
They drain my intelligence
Heede, heede, hail, hail, hail
I swear I won't kiss and tell
My mind is so dirty I got mud runnin' out of my ears
They clog up so I can't hear
The tears of fear
You better get out of here
Your smiles are so bright,
So let's turn out the lights
If you can't see what we do,
Than you might not feel as used
Shooby-dooby,
Oh whop, whop, whop
So would you please leave
On your socks
