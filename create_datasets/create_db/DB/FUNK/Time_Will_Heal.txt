I know you want to get into my mind
But I'm not gonna let you in
Until I've had the time to begin to know you better
I know you want to get into my heart
But I'm not gonna let you in
Til you've given me the time to heal a wound still bleeding

If you want a love that'll last
You're moving much to fast
You gotta take your time, take it day by day

Time will heal me
Time will heal me
And babe take your time
Time will heal

I know you want to get into my mind
To wash away the hurt and sorrow
To let me know thaht you are the answer to my question
The problem is that love is often blind
It fools you into thinking you're happy
Then suddenly the mask falls away and leaves you weeping

If you are the promised land
I've yet to understand
And while there's room for doubt we take it
Day by day

Time will heal me
Time will heal me
Babe heal me
And babe take your time
With you near me
Time will heal me
Time will heal me
I can't say the words you want to hear
But maybe given time

Time will heal
The pain I feel inside
Time will heal
The hurting and the pride
Time will heal
I'll open up my heart to you
Time will heal
I'll find the words to say to you
Time will heal
The world will see the change in me
Time will heal
