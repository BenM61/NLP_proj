It's all up to you now
Find yourself in the moment
Go directly to the voodoo
Now the channel is open
Lose your head
Lose control
You come on delicate and fine
Like a diamond in the mine

Oh whoa, yeah

When you move into the light
You're the greatest thing alive

Oh whoa

And you sway in the moon
The way you did
When you were younger
When we told everybody
All you need is now

Stay with the music let it
Play a little longer longer
You don't need anybody
All you need is now

Everybody's gunning
For the VIP section
But your better up and running
In another direction
With your bones in the thrall
Throw a shadow on the vine
Bat your lashes let it shine

Oh whoa, yeah

Every moment that arrives
You're the greatest thing alive

Oh whoa

And you sway in the moon
The way you did
When you were younger
And we told everybody
All you need is now

Stay with the music let it
Play a little longer longer
You don't need anybody
All you need is now

All you need, all you need is now
All you need, all you need is now
All you need, all you need is now

And we will sway in the moon
The way we did
When we were younger
(When we were younger)
When we told everybody
All you need is now

Stay with the music let it
Play a little longer
(A little longer)
We don't need anybody
All you need is now

Oh whoa
All you need, all you need is now
Oh whoa
All you need, all you need is now
Oh whoa
All you need, all you need is now
Oh whoa
All you need, all you need is now
