Surrender with me
We're walking in our sleep
And won't come around for you

Leave the story at the shore
In case you thought it done
Yesterdays will start fluttering

Now surrender with me
'Cause we're walking in our sleep
And won't come 'round

Hey, put our pistols down
Crawl along the ground
Where we won't

Won't be found

Surrender with me
And bring your violin
Photographs and some black strings
For when you're breaking stones
The only things we know
Are tiger's eyes and lost things?

Now, surrender with me
'Cause we're walking in our sleep
And won't come 'round

Hey, put our pencils down
And go back underground
Where we won't
Won't be found

Now, surrender with me
'Cause we're walking in our sleep
And won't come round

Hey, put our pistols down
And crawl along the ground
Where we won't
Where we won't

Won't be found
