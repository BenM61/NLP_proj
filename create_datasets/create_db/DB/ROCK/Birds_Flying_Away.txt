I left my country when I was nineteen 1925
And drifted to a town on the Cuban coast
Met a woman who became my life
And oh when I saw her darkness fled from me

And flew like a blackbird into the sun
On the day she married me dear God, dear God

I remember climbing up those shoulders
Coming up under you like a lion
Coming down like we were dying dear God
But now the drum birds come for me

Oh now the drum birds come for me
Lord give me forgiveness for all that I've done
Forgive me now of the weight I bear
Don't keep me on the run dear God, dear god

I remember climbing up those shoulders
Coming up under you like a lion
Coming down like we were dying dear God
