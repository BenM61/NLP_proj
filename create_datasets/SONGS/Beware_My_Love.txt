I'll leave my message in my song, that's right

Beware, my love, he'll bowl you over
Beware, my love before you're much older, hey
He'll sweep you up under his carpet
You'd be in luck if you could stop it, c'mon now

You'll hear a shout and then you'll be in it
So, so beware my love, yeah, 'cause he'll take you under
