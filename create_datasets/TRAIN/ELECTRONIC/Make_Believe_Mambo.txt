It was a pretty picture
It almost made me cry
He's got Big imagination
It's better than real life

He can be a macho man
Now he's a game show host
One minute hilarious comedian
Now he's an undercover cop

Oh ? let the poor boy dream
Oh ? livin' make believe

So how can we be strangers
He's got no personality
It's just a clever imitation
Of the people on TV

A line for ev'ry situation
He's learnin' trivia and tricks
Havin' sex and eatin' cereal
Wearin' jeans and smokin' cigarettes now

Oh ? let the poor boy dream
Oh ? livin' make believe
Oh ? let the poor boy dream
Oh ? livin' make believe

I can be you and you can be me
In my mundo, todo el mundo
Ev'ryone's happy and ev'ryone's free
Todo mundo, mundo mambo
Here in my mundo where nothing is wrong
Todo mundo, in my mundo
I'll be a lady and you'll be a man
Mundo mambo, todo el mundo

Oh ? let the poor boy dream
Oh ? livin' make believe
In my mundo ? todo mundo
Mundo mambo ? in my mundo
Todo el mundo ? mundo mambo
Mundo mambo ? Todo mundo

Oh ? let the poor boy dream
Oh ? livin' make believe
Mundo mambo ? todo el mundo
In my mundo ? todo mundo
Todo el mundo ? mundo mambo
In my mundo ? mundo mambo
