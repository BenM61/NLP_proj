Say! Have you ever met the girl
who's the toast of the town?
A work of art without a question,
you'd better write her number down.

Oh! the lady in red, the fellows are crazy 
For the lady in red.
she's a bit gaudy, but laudy,
What a personality.
Oh! the lady in red,is fresh as a daisy
When the town is in bed.
Dancing and dining and shining
With originally.
She is very proper.
she's nothing more than a pal,
But oh me! and oh my! you'd never stop ?er,
She?d be a dangerous gal,
If she should ever meet the right guy.
Oh! the lady in red, the fellows are crazy 
For the lady in red.
Is she a study, oh! buddy 
What a personality,
she's got vitality.
