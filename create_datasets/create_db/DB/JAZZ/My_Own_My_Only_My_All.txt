See it in your smile I hear it in your sigh
That we have found a feeling higher than high
My own, my only, my all

Kindled by your kiss, the warmth of your embrace
The luster of a love-light, lighting your face
My own, my only, my all

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me
But you do, you do

And when I look up at the stars
And ask them all what's new
They join me in the answer,darling, it's you
My own, my only, my all

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me
But you do, you do

And when I look up at the stars
And ask them all what's new
They join me in the answer, darling it's you
My own, my only, my own one and only
My own, my only, my all
