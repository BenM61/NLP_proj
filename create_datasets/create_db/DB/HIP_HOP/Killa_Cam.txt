With the goons I spy
Stay in tune with ma
She like damn
This the realest since kumbaya

Bumbayay killa Cam my lord
Still the man with the pants
Scrilla fam, more on board
Now bitches They wanna neuter me

Niggas They wanna tutor me
The hooligan in Hoolahands
Maneuvering is nothing new to me
Doggy I'm from the land of grind

Pan pan gram or dime
Not toes or MC
When I say hammer time
Beef I hammer mine

When I get my hands on nines
If I had on Bammerline
Corduroys Cam a shine
Canary burgundy

I call it lemon red
Yellow diamonds in my ear
Call em lemon heads
Lemon head end up dead

Ice like Winnipeg
Gemstones, Flintstones
You could say I'm friends with Fred
You unhappy scrappy

I got Pataki at me
Bitches say I'm tacky daddy
Range look like Laffy Taffy

I'm from where Nicky Barns got rich as f*ck
Rich and Nay hit the kitchen then were pitchin' up
Rob base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both who am I to f*ck tradition up

So I parked in a tow-away zone, chrome 
I don't care that car a throwaway homes
Welcome to Harlem
Where you welcome to problems

Off a furlo fella felons get parkings
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sang

That's when the toolie sang
Bang bang came from that movie rang
Snap crack jewelry bling
Flat jack who he bring

Clack clack cooley ring
Bad rap cuties claim
Ascap put 'em in the river
I'm the sushi king

And I'm keep it fresh
Let the fish eat ya flesh
Yes sir please confess
Just say he's the best

How dope is this
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want, Coke or piff
I got it all smoke or sniff

And you know my drift
Used to figures, doe and shit
You a rooster nigga
This a roaster bitch

And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually end
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get they Gucci cleanse

We the moody Gucci Louie and Pucci men
Or Skada Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's eye view

The birds I knew
Flip birds
Bird gang
It was birds I flew

And word I blew
Or herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now I swerve in coupes
