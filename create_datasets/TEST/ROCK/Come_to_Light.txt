Ooh for a second there
I felt peace and calm
The underpass
Would keep us from harm
And the wipers moved
Like some waving arms
We were flashing headlights
At coming cars

But up in the distance
Even in the dead of night
If we can make it to the morning
We can get things right
It's been a tough go lately
I hate choosing sides
What we do in the darkness
Will come to light, alright

Ooh and in times of fear
You shelter me
And you hold me close
So tenderly
And with my headphones on
As I fall asleep
You're my barricade
From intruding dreams

But up in the distance
Even in the dead of night
If we can make it to the mornin'
We can get things right
It's been a tough go lately
I hate choosing sides
What we do in the darkness
Will come to light, alright

Will come to light, alright
Will come to light, alright

Ooh and then silence fell
When I picked up
Those words hit me hard
Like a one two punch
So I went home
To face the storm
And the thought of you
Keeps me warm

But up in the distance
Even in the dead of night
If we can make it to the morning
We can get things right
It's been a tough go lately
I hate choosing sides
What we do in the darkness (yeah)
What we do in the darkness
Comes to light

When every thing went wrong
You're keeping my head on
And in time
The things that hurt today
Will begin to fade away
