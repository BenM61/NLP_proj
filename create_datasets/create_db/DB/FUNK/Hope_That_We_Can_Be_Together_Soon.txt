I don't like it on the outside
I gotta get on the inside

Won't you let me into your world? Oh lady

You walk around with your head up high
On the street and stop but you won't come back
Oh, sophisticated lady, you know I love you
So why do you put me through the changes that you do?

Won't you let me into your world? Oh lady
Please let me into your world, oh lady

The expert say on the milky way
There's a pot of gold there everyday
In my world, that pot of gold is in your eyes
I love you, I love you, I love you, baby

Let me into your world, oh lady
Please let me into your world
Oh lady, lady, lady, lady, lady

Life is too short to live it alone
So let me into your world
Let me build my happy home

Won't you let me into your world? Oh lady
Please let me into your world, oh lady, oh

I don't like it on the outside
I gotta get on the inside
I don't like it on the outside
I gotta get on the inside

I don't like it on the outside
I gotta get on the inside
I don't like it
