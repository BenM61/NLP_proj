Wave after wave is breaking on the shore
Keeping the secrets of destiny
The sun goes down
I'm trembling with wrath and awe
Am I worthy such a sight
Who I worthy such a sight
Who am I to feel joy

In lack of insight
In greed for more
Conclusions slipped my mind
The distant light is slowly fading away

Time after time
The signs have been so clear
Now there's no time for recovery
I feel a chill
I'm clutching at a clue
But the failure is a fact
Who'll save me from the night

You'll remain
You'll turn on
A solitary life
Left behind on my bare rock-face I'll watch
The Last Sunset

You will remain
Always be there
I have passed the point of no return
Long time ago

If there is a god above
Powers who have always known
Give me a reason
Am I all alone to blame
Was I meant to strive in vain
Answer my cry

You will remain
Always be there
I have passed the point of no return
Long time ago

Lights fade away
The Last Sunset
