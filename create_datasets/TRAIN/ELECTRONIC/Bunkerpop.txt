Private haunting
Welcome you and
Me goes to war
I hear voices talk talk (talk talk talk)
Pull the shutter down
Needle swept a sound
Hear but not quite
You're touching fragile
Can't say I'm loosing my mind
Cause of you you're near

Put a record on make a connection
When I walk our fingers touch
Feel you here out in the hallows
Calling light give her too much
You can't stop this from falling apart
You can't stop this from falling apart
You can't stop this
You can't stop this

Serve us
Breaking us
Seance 
Waking
You can't stop this
Will you need me here
I need you here
Boil now through the war
It's not enough
?? 
Touch but not quit
I'm behind
Don't say this is all in my mind
'Cause I see you here

Put a record on make a connection
When I walk our fingers touch
Feel you here out in the hallows
Calling light give her too much
You can't stop this from falling apart
You can't stop this from falling apart
You can't stop this
You can't stop this
You can't stop this

I'm not alone I'm not afraid
That's not one way to communicate
Put a record on
Put a record on

You can't stop this 
You can't stop this 
Don't say this is all in my mind
Cause I see you here

Put a record on it's our visitation
When I'm alone our fingers touch
With you I hear right in the hallow
Coming light have it or not
You can't stop this no no no

You can't stop this
I'm not alone I'm not afraid
That's not one way to communicate

You need me here
I need you here
