Well, if you're looking for a winner, then you know you've got to go with me.
I've got more ashes than Wednesday and you know I can brew my tea.
I'm fixing to teach you everything I know,
I'll take you with me baby everywhere I go.
If I can catch you for a minute I know you'll take a chance with me.

[Chorus]
So slow down, slow down Linda.
Don't you think that you could save a little time with me?
So slow down, slow down Linda.
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company?

I've seen you speeding down the highway when you ought to dig the scenery.
And you can wolf down your dinner in the time it takes to drink my tea.
You're always rushing 'round everywhere you go,
You leave me eating dirt on the side of the road.
I can't keep running much longer you always go too fast for me.

[Chorus]

I think that you're getting too old to be running around,
I think that it's time you thought about settling down,
So slow down, slow down Linda,
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company.

You're always rushing 'round everywhere you go,
You leave me eating dirt on the side of the road.
I can't keep running much longer, you always go too fast for me.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
