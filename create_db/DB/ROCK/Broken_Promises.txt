The day you left me
There was a feeling I have never shown
The day you told me
There were the words that I have never known
And now it's over
So what's left that I should ever feel
Cause since the day you left me I have been so alone

And now we're left with broken promises
My heart can't take no more
And now we're left with broken promises
My mind has had enough

Deep inside me
There are things that I have never told
They burn inside me
And now I need to know
Why are you trying to take everything away from me
Well I'm begging you
I'm here with nothing left to show
'Cause since the day you left me I have been so alone

And now we're left with broken promises
My heart can't take no more
And now we're left with broken promises
My mind has had enough

Look at how you turned on me
You ran away and left me here with nothing to see
I'm a man so turn around and say it to me
Don't you think I've got something to say

Look at how you turned on me
You ran away and left me here with nothing to see
I'm a man so turn around and say it to me
Don't you think I've got something to say

Now look at how you turned on me
You ran away and left me here with nothing to see
I'm a man so turn around and say it to me
Don't you think I've got something to say

And now we're left with broken promises
My heart can't take no more
And now we're left with broken promises
My mind has had enough

And now we're left with broken promises
My heart can't take no more
And now we're left with broken promises
My mind has had enough
