Well here is my story that I tell to you 
You may not believe me but I swear it's true 
I escaped to Havana for a getaway 
In a tiny club with a cuban band on a Saturday 

And that's when I saw her from across the room 
Like something from a movie or a storybook 
She had a short dress with curly hair and chocolate skin 
That's how it all began 

I remember when she came into my life 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
Love was in the air 
Just like an ocean breeze 
And we were dancing to the sweetest melodies 
I held her in my arms until she danced into the night 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time 

Hifuela mijo tell me what happened next 

The next day I was walking to the marketplace 
I passed by the cathedral so I stopped to pray 
I imagined this journey without my friend 
And just like an angel she appeared again 
But before I could ask her why she had gone 
The Padre started yelling that "She's the one" 
And suddenly the Policia were everywhere with chaos in the air 

I remember when she had to say goodbye 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
I could not believe they said she was a thief 
And I stood there as they drove her away from me 
And what was I to do, now they've accused her of a crime 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 

I remember when I couldn't sleep that night 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
I had to find a way to bring her back to me 
So I made a plan of how to set her free 
And so tomorrow night, mi amore I will find 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time 

So tell me, how did you get outta there? 

He disguised himself in sheets 
Waited for the guards to fall asleep 
Snuck into the tower, took the keys 
And then I told the girl, stick close to me 
He was in a sword fight 'till the death 
Everyone that watched just held their breath 
And then he ran 
I ran 
Jumped 
I jumped 
Climbed 
Faster and faster and faster 

Guards, stop him! Don't let him get away, Guards! 

I remember when she came back in my life 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
We made our getaway to another time and place 
We were riding while the tears rolled down her face 
She knows I can not stay so we'll say our goodbyes tonight 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 

I remember when he came into my life 
Love was in the air like an ocean breeze 
Sweetest melodies 
Until she danced into the night 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time
