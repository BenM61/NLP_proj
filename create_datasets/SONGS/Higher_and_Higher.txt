Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forever more
Now once, I was downhearted disappointment was my closest friend
But you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again

I'm so glad I finally found you
You're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again

Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before (higher)
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forever more (higher)
