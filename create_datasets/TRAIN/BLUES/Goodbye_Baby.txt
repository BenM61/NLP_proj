Now, goodbye, baby, gotta leave you now
Oh, you told me darlin', you love me no how
Oh, yeah, I gotta leave you, baby goodbye

Aw baby, here's my right hand
I love you, baby, I can't get you to understand
Oh, bye, goodbye, baby, baby goodbye

Aw yes, here's all of me
I'll take you, baby, to some place you ought to be
Oh, bye now, goodbye, baby goodbye
