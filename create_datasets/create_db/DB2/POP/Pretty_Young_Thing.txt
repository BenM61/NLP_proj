I wanna bruise your lips
With a tender kiss
I wanna crush your heart
I wanna be your star

And when you're touchin' me
I hear a symphony
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on my baby

Someone get a priest
Maybe the police
I think that we should call
The Justice of the Peace

You're a pretty young thing
Ah, it's a damn cool thing
Oh, I gotta tell the world
In case they haven't heard

There never was a doubt
Oh, baby hush your mouth
You're a pretty young thing
Ah, it's a damn cool thing

Let me hear my name
Baby say it again
I wanna take you on
I wanna be the one

And when you're closing in
I hear violins
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on my baby

Someone get a priest
Maybe the police
I think that we should call
The Justice of the Peace

You're a pretty young thing
Ah, it's a damn cool thing
I gotta tell the world
In case they haven't heard

There never was a doubt
Oh baby, hush your mouth
You're a pretty young thing
Ah, it's a damn cool thing

Oh pretty young thing
Don't need no diamond ring
I'll give you everything
I'll show you anything
Oh hush, oh just hush
Don't say a word

Someone get a priest
Maybe the police
I think that we should call
The Justice of the Peace

You're a pretty young thing
Ah, it's a damn cool thing
I gotta tell the world
In case they haven't heard

There never was a doubt
Oh baby, hush your mouth
You're a pretty young thing
Ah, it's a damn cool thing

I think we should call
Oh, such a pretty young thing
