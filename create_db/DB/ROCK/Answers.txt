I searched for a cause
I climbed the highest mountain
I walked to the top
I stopped and then looked down

But when I stop the search
The answers always come
And when I help someone
I always help myself by helping

[Chorus]
You tell me where your skeleton's hiding
Tell me all and I'll tell you
You think you have a real good fucking answer
A fucking answer I'll give you

I look toward the girls
And there I found no truth
I looked outside myself
It seemed I lost the good

But when I turn my eyes
Out from my own head
That's when I realize
That I see what I'm really selling

[Chorus]
