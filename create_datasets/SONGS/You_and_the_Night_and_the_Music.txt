You and the night and the music
Fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire
You and the night and the music
Thrill me, but will we be one
After the night and the music are done?

Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight
Hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning will come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you?

Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight
Hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning will come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you?
