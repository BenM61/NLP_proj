I want to break free with my heart
With my soul with my hands
I'll do it all with my hands
With my will there's a way

Oh there's a way
Oh there's a way

Life is hard and beautiful
That's why I wanna break free
When it's hard I break the ice
When it's nice it turns fire

Oh burning fire
Oh burning fire

I was gone and I was dreaming
That nobody liked me anymore
All alone under the water and I knew
My heart was still there

I was gone and I was dreaming
That nobody liked me anymore
All alone under the water and I knew
My heart was still there

I want to dance free till I fly
With my soul with my hands
I won't stop smiling for my treasure
Family and me

Oh burning fire
Oh burning fire
Oh burning fire
Oh burning fire
All right
