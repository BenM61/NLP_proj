I'm not knocking your want
To carry that home

Took it with you
When you moved and got it broke

Found the pieces
We counted them all alone

Didn't add up
Forgot to carry a zero

I can't be your
Apologist very long

I'm surprised that
You'd want to carry that on

Count your blemishes
You can't
They're all gone

I can't see your response
Putting them back on

Like they're waiting for your guard to fall
So they can see it all and you're so
Occupied with what other persons are
Occupied with
And vice versa

And you've become
What you thought was dumb
A fraction of the sum

Yeah, you've become
Yeah, you have become

A fraction of the sum
The middle and the front

And now it's coming back
Hasn't it come too far?

I was trying to help but I guess
I pushed too hard

Now we can't even touch it
Afraid it'll fall apart
