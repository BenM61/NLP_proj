Got my upsides and my downsides, you got your earthquake and your landslides
You just have to thirst my button, 'cause I can take it like no other

'Cause I'm your automatic lover
'Cause I'm your automatic lover

From the outside to the inside, from the outside undercover
I pull myself into your mother, 'cause I can take it like no other

'Cause I'm your automatic lover
'Cause I'm your automatic lover

I'm you automatic lover, I can take it like your mother

'Cause I'm your automatic lover
'Cause I'm your automatic lover

I got my good sides and my bad sides, is it to take all dynamic
I got no problem with my punk-shot, 'cause I can take it like no other
I'm your automatic lover, I'm your automatic lover

'Cause I'm your automatic lover
'Cause I'm your automatic lover
'Cause I'm your automatic lover (your automatic lover)
'Cause I'm your automatic lover (your automatic lover)
