I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one, with nothing to give you but, oh

I love you
She, she buys you diamonds
Bright, bright, sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear, when I say
That she can give you the world
But she'll never love you the way
I love you
No, no, no (She can't do it)
She can't do it, baby
But she can take you any place she wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
Where I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

I, I love you, baby
I, I need you, oh, it hurts when I watch you 
Go dancing by, oh
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
But darling it's I, it's me, oh
I love you, love you, love you, love you, baby

(I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who loves you)
Do you need me? I think you do (I'm the one, I'm the one who needs you)
Watching you
She takes you any place you want
To fancy clubs and restaurants
I can do nothing but watch you with
My nose pressed against the window pane
I love you, it hurts
I need you, I want you
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who loves you, baby
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who needs you, baby
Yes, I do
Can you see me
