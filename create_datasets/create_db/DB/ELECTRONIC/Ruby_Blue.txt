You better stop
And try to think
Look what you're doing
Oh, Ruby

You never get to give it all you got
'Cause you forgot to 
Take it to the top
Oh Ruby Blue
Alright

Why do you make a start
With no means to go on
It's on the tip of your
Ruby, we used to love you truly
You used to make us laugh
It really was a gas
But now you're a bore

One
Two
Three
But now you're a bore

It's you
And them
And me
Look what you do oh, Ruby Blue

Check yourself
Do you get me
Do you get me
Do you get me
Do you get me
Do you get me

You'd better stop
And try to think
Look what you're doing
Oh, Ruby

You never get to give it all you've got
'Cause you forgot to take it to the top
Oh, Ruby Blue
Alright

Nobody cares anyway
If you play the painted lady
Four and more
Five 
And six
Who would have believed
It would come 
To this
Look what you do oh, Ruby Blue

Check yourself

You'd better stop
And try to think
Look what you're doing
Oh, Ruby

You never get to give it all you've got 
'Cause you forgot to
Take it to the top
Oh Ruby Blue
Alright

One
Two
Three
Look what you're doing
Oh Ruby
Nobody's there anyway (it's you)
And them
And me

Look what you do oh, Ruby Blue
