Well, my baby and me went out late Saturday night
I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so right
Well, pick you up and ten, gonna get you home at two
Your mama don't know what I got in store for you
But baby that's all right we're looking as cool as can be

We found a little place that really didn't look half bad
I had a whiskey on the rocks and change of a dollar for the jukebox
Well, I put a quarter right into that can
But all it played was disco, man
Come on pretty baby, let's get out of here right away

We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out

We're gonna rock this town
Make 'em scream and shout

Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
We're gonna rock 'till we pop
Gonna roll 'till we drop
Rock this town
Rock it inside out

Well, we're having a ball just tearing up the big dance floor
Well, there's a real square cat, he looks 1974
Well, he looked at me once, he looked at me twice
Look at me again and there's gonna be a fight
We're gonna rock this town
Rip this place apart

We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out

We're gonna rock this town
Make 'em scream and shout
Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
We're gonna rock 'till we pop
Gonna roll 'till we drop
Rock this town
Rock it inside out

We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Make 'em scream and shout
Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
We're gonna rock 'till we pop
Gonna roll 'till we drop
Rock this town
Rock it inside out

We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside
Yeah, we're gonna rock this town
Tear it up
We're gonna rip it down
Rock this town
Rock it inside out
