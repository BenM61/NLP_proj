Malice saying we to hot
New verses please
C'mon!

Hot Damn, its a new day
Hot Damn, but them boys want the (money man)
Hooooo, hooooo
Hooooo, Hot Damn

My how the boys grow?
From roaming low into homes
To homes of his own
No catching up he's in a whole 'nother zone 
Still true to his roots 
Stay close to the chrome
Haters stay clear of him
Y'all stay in cheer for him
Got up out the game and over came
Lets hear it for him
Keep a new toy so I wonder how good
I'm not enjoying life I'm reliving my childhood
Big chain monster, whip game bonkers
Monster truck remind him of tonka
Diamond M colour plush gold still gutter
My deal is in the meals, 
Motherfucker and I ain't stutter
Bitter sweet, my life's a musical
From holding nose to roles gold
The lords beautiful
Before him I'm to shame to show my face
But she's so mean can't help but to fall off the race
Motherfucker 

Hot Damn, its a new day
Hot Damn, but them boys want the (money man)

Hot Damn, when the white hit the pen it
Twist and it tumbles, it
Flips and it fumbles, I
Mix it like gumbo, I
Pitch it so subtle, I
Keep hustle so pother feds I got 'em wondering (wondering)
What happened to that boy?
Six maneuver, how to slip into that toy
Is it the pimp the crook a hustler thing?
The man the music the making the king
Constantly built by me
A million men marching like Calling them the King Kong
The verse making the world sing
My hearts on the sleeve-a
Y'all basically just like my opinion
The bars hoping the sun shines on them
But you
