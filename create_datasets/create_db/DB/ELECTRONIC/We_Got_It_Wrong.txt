(Don't go, don't go away)

Under the stairs, simple enough 
We got it wrong
This heart's broken, apart

We shaped an illusion of trust
We got it wrong
Your heart, open

Under the stairs, simple enough 
We got it wrong
This heart's broken, apart

We shaped an illusion of trust
We got it wrong

Wait, wait, wait
Morning sun
But you can't remember now
(Who are you to tell me why)

You don't want to know the answers
You're better off by self

(Don't go, don't go away)
