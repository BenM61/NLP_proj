How are you going to top yourself
When there is nobody else
How are you gonna do it by yourself
Cause I'm not gonna be here to help you
Yeah

(Alright)
How you gonna top yourself
When there is nobody else
How are you gonna do it by yourself
Cause I'm not gonna be here to help you

How you gonna do it alone?
When I don't pick up my phone
I'd love to give a dog a bone
But I'm not gonna stick around to help you!

Yeah, How you gonna stop yourself when,
your man stops ringing your bell (your bell)
You're right between heaven and hell
And you gonna need the good lord to help you
How I'm gonna make you see?
That this ain't no way to be
See you been getting it all for free
Guess you better get yourself a sugar daddy to help you!

Such a little girl, like a spinning time mama
But she's, spinning out of control
Take sleeping with a snake like you to
Rip apart my soul!
Yeah!
Rip apart my soul
Rip apart my soul
Yeah

How're you gonna rock yourself to sleep
When I give up my midnight creep girl
How're gonna get that deep
When your daddy ain't around here to do it to you
Yeah, how you're gonna do it alone?
When I don't pick up my phone
I'd love to give a dog a bone
But I'm not gonna stick around to help you!

Top yourself
Top yourself
Top yourself
