Well done my friend. Thanks fort he offer
We'll catch him at night to end this game
Take these thirty dimes in a coffer
Meet us at midnight. Please hold the flame

Believe my days are counted
I feel the evil breath
The liar sits right by my side
His eyes are full of fear and pride

It's my last supper
After this I will die
It's my last supper
My own sacrifice

Welcome my friends
Come celebrate with me
You are invited to take a place
Feast and drink as much as you will
Before they start the race of death

Believe my days are counted
I feel the evil breath
The liar sits right by my side
His eyes are full of fear and pride

It's my last supper
After this I will die
It's my last supper
My own sacrifice

My end is near
Come pray with me
My fortune is over
But love can be

Whenever I die
Please let me fly
Remember me
And love can be

Believe my days are counted
I feel the evil breath
The liar sits right by my side
His eyes are full of fear and pride

It's my last supper
After this I will die
It's my last supper
My own sacrifice
