Boy, I got my eyes on you
Guess you can say that I've been watching you
I see the things that she put you through
Wouldn't take it if I were you, no

Baby, I cannot pretend
So where do I begin?
I'm trying to be that friend
So let me ask you something

Do you think that she'll love you better than me
Kiss you better than me
Touch you better than me
Hold you better than me

Flex you better than me
Sex you better than me
Boy, you better believe
I'll be everything that you need

Baby, can't you see that she
Don't appreciate a thing?
I'm trying to get you to see
That you need to be with me

So what's the move?
Do you want me like I want you?
I just wanna be that friend
So let me ask you again

Do you think that she'll love you better than me
Kiss you better than me
Touch you better than me
Hold you better than me

Flex you better than me
Sex you better than me
Boy, you better believe
I'll be everything that you need

Do you think that she'll love you better than me
Kiss you better than me
Touch you better than me
Hold you better than me

Flex you better than me
Sex you better than me
Boy, you better believe
I'll be everything that you need

She is not right so I can't see why
Why you continue to waste your time
She is not tight, when will you realize
Baby, that I do you right?

Do you think that she'll love you better than me
Kiss you better than me
Touch you better than me
Hold you better than me

Flex you better than me
Sex you better than me
Boy, you better believe
I'll be everything that you need

Do you think that she'll love you better than me
Kiss you better than me
Touch you better than me
Hold you better than me

Flex you better than me
Sex you better than me
Boy, you better believe
I'll be everything that you need

Everything, everything you need

Do you think that she'll love you better than me
Kiss you better than me
Touch you better than me
Hold you better than me

Flex you better than me
Sex you better than me
Boy, you better believe
I'll be everything that you need

Love you better than me
No, than me, than me
Flex you better than me
Oh yeah
