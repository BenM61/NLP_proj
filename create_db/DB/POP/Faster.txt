You're so delicious
You're so soft
Sweet on the tip of my tongue
You taste like sunlight
And strawberry bubble gum

You bite my lip
You spike my blood
You make my heart beat faster

Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Til I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster

It's the way you swell, slow
Pushing right out of your seams
It's the way you smile, baby
When you've got me on my knees

You're all night noise
You're sirens howl
You make my heart beat faster

Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Til I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
'Cause you make my heart beat faster

'Cause I jump back, crash, I crawl
I beg I steal, I fall
Yeah you own me
And you make my heart beat faster, faster
Yeah faster, faster

I can't get enough
Because it's on like
I guess this world is over to me

You own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Til I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
'Cause you make my heart beat

You own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Til I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
'Cause you make my heart beat faster
You make my heart beat faster
