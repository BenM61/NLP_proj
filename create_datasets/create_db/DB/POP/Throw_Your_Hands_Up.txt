Are you ready to get that feeling?
Do you know when the time has come?
There's a second of realizing
Then we're singing it all as one
Everybody come on get on up
Altogether we move in time
This is how you can know where you're at
See you doing it with jump5

Can you hear it getting louder
The sound of noise increasing
A little piece of heaven now
This is the sound we're gonna raise the ceiling
Can you hear it getting louder?
The sound of noise increasing
A little piece of heaven now
This is the sound!

Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump 4 joy
When I say reach, you touch the sky
From the front to the back from side to side
Do you wanna be with me dancing?

Are you gonna be by my side?
Never stop, we'll keep on moving
Are you ready to take this ride?
Doesn't matter where you come from
Doesn't matter what place you're in
Yeah, its the time to get on
Hear the rhythm and you begin

Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump 4 joy
When I say reach, you touch the sky
From the front to the back from side to side
Do you wanna be with me dancing?

Get on up, put your hands in the air 
Jump5 is getting down so you better beware 
Gotta do it like this, see you do it like that 
Do it side to side from the front to the back 
See you kick it...see you ride the groove 
Do it any way you want but I gotta see you move 
If you got it going on then you'll never get enough 
If you wanna get down...throw you're hands up! 

Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump 4 joy
When I say reach, you touch the sky
From the front to the back from side to side
Do you wanna be with me dancing?
