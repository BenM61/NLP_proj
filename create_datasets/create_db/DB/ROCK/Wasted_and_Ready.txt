Force field super shield AA
Junior high love affair is OK
Jump on the big wagon cause I'm so Cal
I'm big in every way
I'm running as fast as I can

She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but ex thinks it's sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready

If you want to move it so
Why don't you make it go
Prove to everybody who doesn't understand
All the nights, all the fights
You are out of sight
Some say more with their hand
I'm running as fast as I can

She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but ex thinks it's sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready

I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
Running as fast as I can
Running as fast as I can

Why am I dealing with this feeling?
I'm maxed out like a credit card
I'll continue to be my worst enemy
It's easy but it seems so hard
You're near but you seem so far

She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but ex thinks it's sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready

She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but ex thinks it's sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready

I am wasted but I'm ready
Running as fast as I can.
