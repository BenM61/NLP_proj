I worry, I weigh three times my body
I worry, I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain, oh

By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending
That it somehow lingered on, well I got is oh

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't (It's not supposed to)

Was there a second of time I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now, oh

So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you?

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever (yeah)
And I will wait to find
That it wont, and it won't and it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather (yeah)
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together
