Listen carefully
As I introduce You to a world like no other
A world far beyond your wildest imagination
A place where your dreams come to life
Far away from the place where evolution is the key to your survival
Relax
As you drift deep into your own thoughts
Contemplate the reason you exist
Will the value of your triumph's today be worth the same tomorrow
Or
Will it self destruct and destroy the human race as you know it,
Will you control your life ?
Or
Will your life control you ?
Now follow me freely, as I lead you to
My own reality
