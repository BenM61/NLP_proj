Her eyes were butterflies
Her smile was a rainbow
Her hair was sunbeam waves
Shining 'round like a halo
Her face was a fairy tale
That has a poison apple
Her skull was a mighty moat
Her brain was the castle

And the castle gets mistaken for a ship that's floating in the clouds
And the castle is brighter than a thousand Christmas trees
And the castle can never be rebuilt again
No way

One day a strange storm rolled in
While she was riding on her dragon
The mushrooms and the bumblebees
Told the flowers how it happened
She was lost in the invisible war
Fighting in the battle
Her love is still buried there
In the ruins of the castle

And the castle oscillates to the beating heart of her mind
And the castle is taller than the Northern Lights
And the castle can never rebuilt again
No way

And the castle can never rebuilt again
No way
And the castle can never rebuilt again
No way, no way
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way, no way
