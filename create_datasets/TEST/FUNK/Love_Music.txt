I like love music, that's my kind of music
It's the sweetest music, and the only music for me
Talking about tender lovin', and a whole lot of huggin'
Let me tell you something
That's the only music for me

Let's get into the mood
Let's get together and groove
Turn down the light, let's make it right
Don't play no more songs about who did who wrong
Just play the music, my kind of music

Talkin' bout tender lovin', and a whole lot of huggin'
Let me tell you something
That's the only music for me

Let's get our souls in the mood
Let's get together and groove
Just play the music, my kind of music

As we sing love music for your heart
Come on now sing now with us, shall we start?
