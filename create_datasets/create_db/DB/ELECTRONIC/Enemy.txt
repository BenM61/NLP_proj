We were lovers on the run
Heading for adventure
Ruinous and young

We fled across the broken land
Wild, deserted places
And it went out of hand

Watch your back
Stay with me
Someone here could be an enemy
Watch your back
Don't you see
One of us could be the enemy

We seized a house upon a hill
Damp and tainted ceilings
And broken windowsills

Seagulls hanging from the trees
Black and static water
Red and sticky leaves

Watch your back
Stay with me
Someone here could be an enemy
Stay with me
Don't you see
One of us could be the enemy
