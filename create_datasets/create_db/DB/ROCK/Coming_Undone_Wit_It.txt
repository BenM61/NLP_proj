Posted in the cut and I'm lookin' for a blockhead
Yup, in my white tee, I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank, oh, I think they like that
(Wait)

Before I leave the house, I'm slizzard on a goose
And I'm higher then a plane, so a nigga really loose
And I can lean wit it and I can rock wit it
And if you gotta friend, she gotta suck a cock wit it

Bobbin' to da beat, check my feet, he ain't got these
I rock then bend my knees every time the beat drop
Lean wit it, rock wit it, freeze before yo fingers pop

Pimpin' in the club, see them hoes tryin' a act up
'Cause they see my chain and a nigga throwin' them stacks up
I keep a full clip and my pistol in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo', they screamin', "Nigga, do ya dance?"

That's right, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it
Trigger between my eyes
(Lean wit it)
Please strike middle of the flo'
Rhey screamin', "Nigga, make it quick now"
