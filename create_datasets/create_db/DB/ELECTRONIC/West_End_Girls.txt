West end girls

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand 
It's pointing at your head 
You think you're mad too unstable 
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables 
In a restaurant in a West end town 
Call the police there's a mad man around 
Running down underground 
To a dive bar in a West end town 
 
In a West end town a dead end world 
The East end boys and West end girls 
In a West end town in a dead end world 
The East end boys and West end girls 
West end girls
 
Too many shadows whispering voices
Faces on posters too many choices
If when why what how much have you got
Have you got it do you get it
If so how often
Which do you choose
A hard or soft option
 
In a West end town a dead end world 
Meet East end boys and West end girls 
In a West end town in a dead end world 
The East end boys and West end girls 
West end girls
 
In a West end town a dead end world 
Meet East end boys and West end girls 
Ooh a West end town in a dead end world 
East end boys and West end girls 
West end girls

I've said it all before, I'll say it all again
We're all modern men
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station

And a West end town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End Girls
West End girls
 
You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait till I get you home
All your stopping, stalling and starning
Who do you think you are, Joe Stalin
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's gun in your hand 
And it's pointing at your head

In a West end town a dead end world 
The East end boys and West end girls 
In a West end town in a dead end world 
East end boys and West end girls 
West end girls

West end girls
