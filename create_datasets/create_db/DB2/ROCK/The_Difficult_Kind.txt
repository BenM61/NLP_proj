I think I was wrong, I think you were right 
And all my angry words, will keep me up at night 
Through the old screen door I still hear you say  
"Oh, honey won't you stop treatin' me that way" 

If you could only see 
What love has made of me 
Then I'd no longer be in your mind the difficult kind 
'Cause babe I've changed 

Tell it to me slow, tell me with your eyes 
If anyone should know how to let it slide 
I swear I can see you, coming up the drive 
And there ain't nothing like regret, to remind you you're alive 

If you could only see 
What love has made of me 
Then I'd no longer be in your mind the difficult kind 
'Cause babe I've changed 

I crossed the canyon a thousand times 
And never noticed what was mine 
What you'll remember of me tonight 
Well, it almost makes me cry 

Yeah, it almost makes me cry 
Oh,

Oh, ball-breaking moon and ridiculing stars 
Oh, the older I get, the closer you are 
Don't you got somewhere, that you need me 
Instead of hanging here making a fool of me 

If you could only see 
What love has made of me 
Then I'd no longer be in your mind the difficult kind 
But you won't see the change in me, oh

If you could only see 
What love has made of me 
But I'll forever be in your mind the difficult kind 
But you won't see 
No, you won't see the good in me 
But babe, I've changed 
Yes babe, I've changed
