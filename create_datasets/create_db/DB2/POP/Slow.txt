You make me want to sing about love
Every time I raise my head
You make me want to tell the whole world
What I've found is good

Then they say
Slow
Slow this right down
Don't burn it out
Don't let it show
Slow
Oh but my heart is racing
To hold your gaze and
Let it go

My love, my love my love
Killin' time is easy when you're here
From dreams I've seen you before
You're so familiar
And everywhere I go
Hear me calling for your love
'Cause if it's you
I will disarm you
And if it's you
Do you know how to calm me down
Oh let me sleep in your arms
Then I won't hear them singing

Slow
Slow this right down
Don't burn it out
Don't let it show
Slow
Oh but my heart is racing
To hold your gaze then
Let it go

You make me want to sing about love
Even though you don't wanna know
You make me want to tell the whole world
But I know
You don't like it
You don't like it
You don't like it

Slow
Slow this right down
Slow
Slow this right down
Slow
Slow this right down
