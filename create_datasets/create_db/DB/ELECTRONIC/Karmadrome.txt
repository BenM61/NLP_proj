1999 come knocking,
Time to get sensations rocking!
Peace, love and I know why
No hippy shit can try
To give you this tip,
Give you this sign,
DREAD ALERT!
I got mine.
Barriers crumble, empires fall,
The Karmadrome's inside us all,
For all...
CHORUS:
This is the time,
Don't be blind,
Blind to the signs,
Adapt to survive.
Never been in love with no one,
Sign up! Join the programme,
Within me, within you,
Feels like Karma.
Get your tiny mind round this:
Global warning, this is it!
Total wipe out, crack and fall,
When it all comes down who you gonna call?
Life is on the countdown
Time to get it slowed down
Before we get to meltdown-
The final touchdown!
Neighbor says he loves me,
Can't understand me,
Can't live with me,
Now he's gonna get me...
CHORUS
