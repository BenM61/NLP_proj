Hello hello
I like your smile,
Hello hello
Shall we talk awhile?
Would you like some of my tangerine?
I know I'll never treat you mean.

Never knew how I'd meet you,
Didn't know how to greet you.

When I saw you look that way,
I knew I had to say
Hello hello hello hello
You've got pretty hair,
Hello hello,
Can'tcha tell I care?
Would you like some of my tangerine?
I know I'll never treat you mean.

Always longed to say I love you,
Always been too high above you.

Now I'm not so far away,
Now at last I can say,
Hello hello Hello Hello
