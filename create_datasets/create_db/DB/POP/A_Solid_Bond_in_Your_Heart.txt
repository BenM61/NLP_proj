Feel is a word I can't explain,
At least not in words that are plain,
That makes it easy to express,
But I'll try to do my best
To hit you were it counts
Please let me try to build
A solid bond in your heart
A solid bond in your heart

I an fueled by the idea
That the world was made to share
But it never seems to work out
All we seem to share is doubt and misery
Please let me try to build
A solid bond in your heart
A solid bond in your heart

I just want to build
A solid bond in your heart.
Here's whats missing from this life
And the trust you need to ignite
And a dream worth holding dear
When that dreams is so near
But try and try to get it back
Push it to the limit and build 
A solid bond in your heart
A solid bond in your heart
