Now that I can see another part of me
Hittin' back, slap in the face, yeah, you were the key
Yeah, I knew I'd see this other part of me
Beat in my chest, pain in my breast, yeah, you were the key
And you know, you know that you were right
You know, you know I hate to fight
You know, you know I can't believe

You're right there
And I'm right here thinking 'bout
Here thinking about you
About you
See, you're right there
And I'm right here thinking 'bout
Here thinking about you
About you
(There thinking about you)

Yeah, we got crazy, yeah, it did faze me
When you just went and took off
Yeah, I know I pushed you
Didn't think you'd follow through and leave me on the rocks
Yeah, I still got no honey, I still got no honey
And we still acting funny, we still acting funny
Yeah, I could chase you, we'd be up all night
Like the old days, yeah, we'd never had a fight
Still, I don't know, maybe that just goes to show
I don't know if you're just gonna go, you're just gonna leave
We're just living off pages, this book's for the ages
A rollercoaster like we said, hon

You're right there
And I'm right here thinking 'bout
Here thinking about you
About you
See, you're right there
And I'm right here thinking 'bout
Here thinking about you
About you
(There thinking about you)

Let me go (one more chance, one more chance, one more chance, baby)
Or give me one more chance, baby
Just let me go
Or give me one more chance, baby
Just let me go
Or give me one more chance, baby
Just let me go
Or give me one more chance, baby
Just let me go
Or give me one more chance, baby
Just let me go
Or give me one more chance, baby
Just let me go
Or give me one more chance, baby
Just let me go
Or give me one more chance

You're right there
And I'm right here thinking 'bout
Here thinking about you
About you
See you're right there
And I'm right here thinking 'bout
Here thinking about you
About you
