I see you kissing yourself in the mirror now
And I can tell that you like what you see
I heard you talking all night to the pyramids
I caught you sucking the life out of me, hey

I think you ought to check all your messages
You better pray to your Gods in the sky
I hope you reach in your pocket for a miracle
Because you're going somewhere when you die

Now keep in touch with the soul of disaster
Because it's gonna come down so hard

I was smoking on a cigarette
I was waiting on a plane
When I saw reality just go down the drain
Climbing up the minarets
Hiding in the den
That 4-Way Diablo is coming back again
Oh, you've met me, now what have you done
You've killed all the flowers
You've killed off the sun
I was smoking on a cigarette
I was waiting on a plane
That 4-Way Diablo is coming back again

I can't hear myself, I'm so far away
I can't hear myself, I'm so far away

You're smoking on a cigarette
You're waiting on a plane
When I saw reality just go down the drain
Climbing up the minarets
Hiding in the den
That 4-Way Diablo is coming back again
Oh, you've met me, now what have you done
You've killed all the flowers
You've killed off the sun
Smoking on a cigarette
Waiting on a plane
That 4-Way Diablo is coming out again
