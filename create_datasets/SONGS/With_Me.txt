The leaves are falling as I'm walking to your home
The tree we plant, the seed is now sowed
Sometimes we are high and sometimes we are low
The time can heal everything, you know

Oh, are you with me?
I know the end will come someday
Oh, are you with me?
I know you'll start again someday
Oh, are you with me?
I know the end will come someday
Oh, are you with me?
Are you with me now?
Oh

The house we built is cheap and has been sold
And now we'll start again with different souls

Oh, are you with me?
I know the end will come someday
Oh, are you with me?
I know you'll start again someday
Oh, are you with me?
I know the end will come someday
Oh, are you with me?
Are you with me now?

I said I need ya
You took me over
I feel the heartbeat
I'm getting closer
I said I need ya
You took me over
I feel the heartbeat
I said I need you right
I said I need ya
You took me over
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer
I said I need ya
You took me over
I said I got you
Are you with me now?
Oh, are you with me now?
Are you with me now?
