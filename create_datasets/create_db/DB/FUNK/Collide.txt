I bow my head as I hold you close
Coz we tune in to the radio
The saddest storm is coming our way
And the world could end tomorrow
It's now another moment close to way
And if we don't see the light of day
I love you more than words can say
But I think by now you know

And if this is all world is fading away
Tonight is the last night that we'll be safe
Let's your head down to your side
Tonight is the greatest goodbye
Lord knows, I'll keep you right by me
Jesus tell us was this all part of your plan

Crushing burning to the earth
Hold you tight even if it's hurts
Our mind raise back and forth baby when I
Our souls collide, our souls collide,
Our souls collide, our souls collide,

I spat low down towards the fluent of hell
You rise above far from where I found
You were always such a angel
And I always played with fire
If I don't get the chance to see your pretty face
I hope you remember everyone word I say
I love you more than words can say
But I think by now you know

And if this is all world is fading away
Tonight is the last night that we'll be safe
Let's your head down to your side
Tonight is the greatest goodbye
Lord knows, I'll keep you right by me
Jesus tell us was this all part of your plan

Crushing burning to the earth
Hold you tight even if it's hurts
I might raise his back and forth baby when I
Our souls collide, our souls collide,
Our souls collide, our souls collide,
If this is all world is fading away
Tonight is the last night that we'll be safe
Let's your head down to your side
Tonight is the greatest goodbye

Crushing burning to the earth
Hold you tight even if it's hurts
Our mind raise back and forth baby when I
Our souls collide, our souls collide,
Our souls collide, our souls collide
