I guess this is what you get
Throwing pebbles in the ocean, yeah
Watching ripples as they spread
Turning to waves and come back again
Over your head

Oh, darling, darling, darling
I had so much love to give, you took it all
I ain't falling, falling for it
Do you hear these words, the way they're meant at all?

Oh, you probably think this is your love song, baby
This ain't nothing like a love song, baby
Just because I let you drive me crazy
You probably thinking it's your love song, baby

Promises you never meant
Sick of going through the motions (yeah)
But you're messing with my head
Messing with my head
You made me question the devotion, yeah

Oh, darling, darling, darling
I had so much love to give, you took it all
I ain't falling, falling, falling
I ain't never falling for your tricks no more, oh-oh

You probably think this is your love song, baby (love song) 
This ain't nothing like a love song, baby (this ain't nothing like a love song)
Just because I let you drive me crazy (drive me)
You probably thinking it's your love song, baby

You probably think this is your love song, baby (this ain't your love song)
This ain't nothing like a love song, baby (good bye)
Just because I let you drive me crazy (this ain't your love song)
You probably thinking it's your love song, baby

Badu-du-du-du-du-du
Badu-du-du-du-du-du
Badu-du-du-du-du-du, du-du-du
(So I'm letting go)
Badu-du-du-du-du-du
Badu-du-du-du-du-du (you don't even try)
Badu-du-du-du-du-du, du-du-du

I guess this is what you get
Throwing pebbles in the ocean

You probably think this is your love song, baby (got me think this is)
This ain't nothing like a love song, baby (nothing like a love song)
Just because I let you drive me crazy (drive me crazy)
You probably thinking it's your love song, baby

You probably think this is your love song, baby (ooh, hun)
This ain't nothing like a love song, baby (this ain't)
Just because I let you drive me crazy (Oooh)
You probably thinking it's your love song, baby

Ooh, this ain't your love song
