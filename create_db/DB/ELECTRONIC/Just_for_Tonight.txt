Thought I told you
To memorize all the traces
This only comes once in a life
I could never be so true
And be here with you
I'm gon' give it a try

Just for tonight
Feels good
Just for tonight

Wanna help you
To leave behind all the faces
It's just you and me tonight
We could only be the fruit
I'll stay here with you
I'm gon' give it a try

Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Feels good, hey yeah
Just for tonight
