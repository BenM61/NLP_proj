Well I know she's a tracker, 
Any scarlet would back her
And they say she's a chooser, 
But I just can't refuse her
She was just there, but then 
She can't be there no more
And as my mind unweaves, 
I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives.

She's been down in the dunes 
And she's dealt with the goons
Now she drinks from the bitter cup, 
I'm trying to get her to give it up
She was just here, 
I fear she can't be there no more
And as my mind unweaves, 
I feel the freeze down in my knees 
But just before she leaves, she receives 
It's long, long when she's gone, 
I get weary holding on
Now I'm coldly fading fast, 
I don't think I'm gonna last
Very much longer.

"Well she's stoned" said the Swede, 
And the moon calf agreed
I'm like a viper in shock 
With my eyes in the clock
She was just there somewhere 
And here I am again
And as my mind unweaves, 
I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives
