If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's real
But it's only false emotion that you feel

If your heart aches seem to hang around too long
And your blues oh they keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can't be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry

If your heart aches seem, oh seems to hang around too long
Yeah and your blues, your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Oh baby just remember sunshine can be found
Yes it can found behind each cloudy sky
So let your hair down baby and go on and cry
