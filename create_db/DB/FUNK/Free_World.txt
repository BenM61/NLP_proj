Nobody likes the way I hold my mic
They say it's too much like my friend
The clothes that I wear, the way I comb my hair
Makes them come out to offend

Didn't you know I knew yourself you're not too cool?
What makes you want to mess with my life?
I think I'll buy a gun, go out and have some fun
Maybe even come and take your wife
Somebody tell 'em

Have you heard? It's a free world and it's mine
Have you heard? It's a free world and it's mine

Heard you like to rock, but I'm not at the top
What makes you point your finger at me?
You don't think I'm hot, then why and try to stop
Your girlfriend from dancing to my beat?

How would it make you feel to know you're so for real
And have someone to call you a lie?
I think you'd buy a gun, go out and have some fun
But then again, maybe kiss suicide
Good god, tell 'em

Have you heard? It's a free world and it's mine
Have you heard? It's a free world and it's mine
Vandell b-b-band
Turn it up, good god
Somebody, somebody, somebody hit me
Good god, turn it up

Heard you like to rock, but I'm not at the top
What makes you point your finger at me?
You don't think I'm hot, then why and try to stop
Your girlfriend from dancing to my beat?
Ya know why? Because

Have you heard? It's a free world and it's mine
Somebody help me out
Have you heard? It's a free world and it's mine
Kiss this, uh, Gerry oh lawd
Turn on my guitar
