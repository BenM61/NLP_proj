I think I'm happy now
And I think I'm in love

And now the sun is shining down
The way that I foresaw
And if I have to face the clouds
I'll beat them like before

[Chorus]

I'm going to walk out your door
And now the sun is shining down
The way that I foresaw
And if I have to face the clouds
I'll beat them like before

[Chorus]

I'm going to walk out your door

[Chorus]

I'm going to walk
