When the lights go down, and the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
When the lights go down, and the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

I'll be here for you
Under stars girl, underwater, when you can't breathe
I'll be here for you
When it's past three in the morning and you can't sleep
I'll be here for you
When your heart breaks, when you lose faith
Yeah I promise, I'll be right here
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

Go on, it's over
Go on, it's over
Go on, it's over
Go on, it's over

I'll be here for you
Under stars girl, underwater, when you can't breathe
I'll be here for you
When it's past three in the morning and you can't sleep
I'll be here for you
When your heart breaks, when you lose faith
Yeah I promise, I'll be right here
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

Oh!
Go on, it's over
Go on, it's over
Go on, it's over
Go on, it's over

When the lights go down, and the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
When the lights go down, and the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

I'll be right here
