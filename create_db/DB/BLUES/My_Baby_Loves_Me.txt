My baby loves me, oh yeah 
My baby needs me, oh yeah 
No other guy can whisper sweet things in my ear 
My sweetie pie has the only sweet voice I sweet hear 
So clear, so yeah 

He needs me (he really really needs me) oh yeah (oh yeah) 
My baby loves me (he really really loves me) oh yeah (oh yeah) 
I'm tellin' you he needs me (he really really needs me) yes he does (oh yeah) 
Can't seem to see no other handsome face 
There's just no cute substitute can take my baby's place 

'Cause I know he needs me (he really really needs me) oh yeah (oh yeah) 
I'll never ever give my baby no trouble 
Whenever he calls me, I come runnin' on the double 

'Cause I know he loves me (he really really loves me) 
Oh yeah (oh yeah) 
And he needs me (he really really needs me) 
Yes he does (oh yeah) 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
Now nobody can tell me a place where I'm goin' wrong, oh no 
Nobody could ever embrace a lover so strong 

'Cause I know he loves me, he tells me that he needs me 
I know he loves me, can't be without me, oh no
