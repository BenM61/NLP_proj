Would you take a bullet?
Would you bite the gun?
I fall onto my knees and yes, the war's already won

So please don't take me for no fool
Spend a lifetime in your shoes
Now I'm walking
Yes, I'm walking

Through the fire I'll keep burning on
Will I hold myself together
When it all goes wrong?
The fires, they keep burning on
Will I hold myself together?

When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong, I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong, I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on

Gloves off, we're finished
You bite the hand that feeds
And nurse your battle scars
But you leave my heart to bleed

So please don't take me for no fool
I spent a lifetime in your shoes
Now I'm walking, now I'm walking
Through the fire I'll keep burning on
Will I hold myself together

When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong, I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong?
When it all goes wrong, I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on

Just like I take my feints
You keep playing the same old games
But remember
But remember, oh no

Through dark nights
We burn bright, till the sunset, till the sunset
Through dark nights
We burn bright, till the sunset, till the sunset
Through dark nights
We burn bright, till the sunset, till the sunset
When it all goes wrong? (through dark night, we burn bright)
When it all goes wrong? (till the sunset, till the sunset)
When it all goes wrong, I'll take my time, I'll keep on holding on
When it all goes wrong? (through dark nights, we burn bright)
When it all goes wrong? (till the sunset, till the sunset)
When it all goes wrong, I'll pull myself together, keep on holding on
