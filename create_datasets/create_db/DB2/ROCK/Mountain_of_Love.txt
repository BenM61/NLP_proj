Standing on a mountain looking down on a city

         The way I feel is a dog-gone pity
         D9
         Teardrops are fallin' down the mountainside
         A
         Many times I've been here and many times I cried
            E7                   D
         We used to be so happy, when we were in love
         A         E7          A
         High on a mountain of love

         A
         Night after night I been standing here alone

         Weeping my heart out till cold grey dawn
         D9
         Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
         A
         Hopin' just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
         E7                       D
         Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere I love
         A         E7          A
         High on a mountain of love

         Bridge:
         D                   Dbm
         Mountain of Love, a Mountain of Love
         D              E
         You should be ashamed
         Bm               Dbm
         You used to be a mountain of love
             D                    E
         But you just changed you name

         A
         Way down below there's a half a million people

         Somewhere there's a church and a big tall steeple
         D9
         Inside the church there's an alter filled with flowers
         A
         Wedding bells are ringing and it should have been ours
         E7                        D
         That's why I so lonely, I dream from above
         A         E7          A
         High on a mountain of love
