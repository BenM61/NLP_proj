1, 2, 3 'o' clock 4 'o' clock rock!
5, 6, 7 'o' clock 8 'o' clock rock!
9, 10, 11 'o' clock 12 'o' clock rock!
Gonna rock (What?) rock, rock, around the clock
Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens 
I was rocking at a park called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot 
Didn't know that years later I'll be standing on top 
Living near Farmers Boulevard I was born and base-shaw
Stopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor 
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader no watch him go

[Chorus]
Go, go cut creator go
Go cut creator go 
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go, go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go

When back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hoping and praying one day I'll get on the road
So I had a feeler and a summer and I meet when I'm stoned
Not fearing a thought, got stung like a horse 
Don't make fun of my posse, cause each man is a boss
When his only damn way to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind
Check out the guitar break 

[Chorus]

This jam just wasn't enough for Jimmy Hendrix to see
He could do lessons of mixing take you under his wing
Straight from the heart cause it ain't the money that we came here for
Ain't no thoughts in the room ain't breaking no roles
And in the Rock 'n' Roll land, a big striving plan 
Just my posse learn the vocals what little they had
It's all about us three: Eve, Phil & Jay
He heard Cut Creator cut now check it out to play

[Chorus]

Rock, rock y'all check out the funky cut
It's like traveling through time to the straight cats strut 
Cuts are slicker than Grease needle as sharp as a knife
We'll be do doing the doo for the rest of the lines 
Want to piece of the action, it's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer putting change in a cup 
Want to see you boogie, oogie jumping up and down
Biting your living hold your breath until we come to your town
L-L-see-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-are-D-A-S
Cut Creator cut the record for me 

[Chorus]

(Cut it)

L-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-are-D-A-S

(Cut it)

Go, go, go, go, go

[Chorus]

(Cut it)

L-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S-H-E-L-L
