Uninvited feelings
They come without warning and they stay too long
I don't want to feel, and if I run they'll be twice as strong.
I wait for a warning, I'm waiting for some kind of sign,
I try to separate , Try to separate my body from my mind.
I watch the clock as the second hand slowly goes strolling by.
I don't want to feel
When a loved one's time comes to die
I wait for a warning,
I'm waiting for some kind of sign
I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind.

Cold feelings in the night
You know, this feeling just ain't right.

And though I try I just can't hide
Cold feelings in the night
Yeah I got faith,
But sometimes fear it just weighs too much I don't want to feel,
Cold winds blowin' through me with an icy touch.
I wait for a warning, I'm waiting for some kind of sign.

I try to separate,
Try to separate my body from my mind.

Cold feelings in the night
You know, this feeling just ain't right.
And though I try I just can't hide
Cold feelings in the night

Cold feelings in the night
You know, this feeling just ain't right.
And though I try I just can't hide
Cold feelings in the night
