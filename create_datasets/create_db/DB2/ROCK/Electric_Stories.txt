I can tell electric stories
Electric stories that will
Surely blow your mind
People find that I can tell
Electric stories very well

Stories of love
Stories of love

I knew a man
He had a girl who loved him
More than he could stand
I don't know why it is
A man prefers to love a
Girl who isn't his

You know it's true
But listen to me, girls
I'll tell you what to do

Honest and all
To keep your man
You drive hm up the wall


Stories of love
Stories of love

Now this here girl
The one whose man left her
To look around the world
She heard my story
Took my advice and and
Her love affairs were fine

Then came the day
The man she loved returned
To take her breath away
She made him cry
She made him beg her
Then she said goodbye

I can tell electric stories
Electric stories that will
Surely blow your mind
I can tell electric stories
Electric stories that will
Surely blow your mind
I can tell electric stories
Electric stories that will
Surely blow your mind
