Try to build the world and I'm standin' tall
But if I ever, ever have to take a fall
Will you accept my collect call?
Will you accept my collect call?

'Cause everybody loves you when you ballin'
But don't nobody want you when you bawlin'
But I know will you accept my collect call
But I know will you accept my collect call

I was told way back in the day when I was trappin'
Never mind what niggas say judge 'em all on they actions
It's hard to imagine when you travelin'
Havin' fun, gettin' paper catch a case and see how niggas act then

Out a cell partner been fired he rattin' on me
Got a little benja pension now they turn they back on me
Shit 'cause out of sight is out of mind, better put your trust in God
Homie man will let you down every time

And I'm speakin' experience, serious
Imagine my surprise hearin' from the inside
Everybody talkin' bout me like the nigga just died
Tip gone 20 years at the least get 5

Man niggas just lie for suspicion of they snitchin'
Not to mention the rumors of me committin' suicide
God will open your eyes and show you who really wit ya
But keep it in the back of your mind when it's over how niggas did ya

Try to build the world and I'm standin' tall
But if I ever, ever have to take a fall
Will you accept my collect call?
Will you accept my collect call?

'Cause everybody loves you when you ballin'
But don't nobody want you when you bawlin'
But I know will you accept my collect call
But I know will you accept my collect call

I ain't never asked a nigga to do shit for me
I wouldn't do in return but guess you live and your learn
Don't expect my well bein' to be a nigga concern
'Cause I know that ain't the way the world turn
'Cause everybody love to see a nigga assed out

Rather see ya lose it all than to see ya cash out
They gossip like bitches I don't even ask how
'Cause niggas ain't shit, I believe that now
And it even matter how much you do for people they'll love to

See you beat down livin' in the gutta, what a
Shame at the least in the game when you see
They want you locked up more than the police
The same can't wait to get a nigga off the street

They hate to see me sittin' on buckets off see
Dog beat bet to you don't even make sense
But that mentality exactly why you'll never be grieved hata

Try to build the world and I'm standin' tall
But if I ever, ever have to take a fall
Will you accept my collect call?
Will you accept my collect call?

'Cause everybody loves you when you ballin'
But don't nobody want you when you bawlin'
But I know will you accept my collect call
But I know will you accept my collect call

I remain a stand up guy no matter what I
Stood tall chest out head up high
Wit my back against the wall layin' it all on the line
Wit God on my side I perform every time, must I remind you

Similar to a miracle just short of amazin'
Survived shit that would've drove most niggas crazy
Rose to the occasion whatever situation
Surprised haters and came out gun a blazin'
Theoretically speakin' but you rather be thinkin'

I'll fold 'cause you want a view of me I know
All I got is the family friends come and go
And with that understandin' I put none before
My folk you know enough to do the same I hope

If not, shit ya ass will find out
When ya on top everybody wanna ball wit ya
But when ya not you wouldn't even know who to call, would ya?
