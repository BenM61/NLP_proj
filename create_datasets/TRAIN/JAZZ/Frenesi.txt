Kiss me
Kiss me the way my mouth kissed you
Give me the frenzy
That my madness gave you

Who if not I
Could teach you the road to love
My pride died
When it tumbled
At your feet

I want you to live just for me
And go where I go
So that my soul belongs only to you
Kiss me with a frenzy

Give me the light of your gaze
And the trembling of your lips
That madness of living and loving
That is more a frenzy than love

In the kiss that I gave you there is
Soul, piety, heart
Tell me that you know how to feel
The same way I feel.

I want you to live just for me
And go where I go
So that my soul belongs only to you
Kiss me with a frenzy
