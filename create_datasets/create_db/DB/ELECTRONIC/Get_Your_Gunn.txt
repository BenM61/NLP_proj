Goddamn your righteous hand 
I eat innocent meat 
The housewife I will beat 
The prolife I will kill 
What you won't do I will 
I bash myself to sleep 
What you sow I will reap 
I scar myself you see 
I wish I wasn't me 
I am the little stick 
You stir me into shit 
I hate therefore I am 
Goddamn your righteous hand 
Goddamn Goddamn 
Goddamn Goddamn 
Pseudo morals work real well on the talk shows for the week 
But your selective judgments and good guy badges don't mean to f*ck to me 
I am the VHS 
Record me with your fist 
Want me to save the world 
I'm just a little girl 
Get your gunn, get your gunn 
Get your gunn, get your gunn
