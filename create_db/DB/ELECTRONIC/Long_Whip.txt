Saw the news today, some D.C. suit trying to break away,
Said he lost another million
Just another old man trying to pass the buck with a dirty hand
Good thing he knows his bible

Stick his ass in hell ever better in in this tiny cell
Make him understand the meaning
Of these words they try to preach just to keep them out of the nations reach
I guess it's all for the better

Take it all away
Take me
Won't you take me far away
Hey hey hey what's that game you play
Will it make me richer?
Cause I do not have a dime and I hate to waste your time
Maybe I'm wrong but I think this whip is too long

Now I was barely 21 lying in a ditch with a loaded gun
So I gave my heart away
But I got it back today in a velvet box stamped USA
Now all the neighbors call me hero.

I was about to lose my mind so I buckled down and did some crime
But it wasn't what they taught me
Hit the road in high pursuit now I'm on the run just like a suit
Didn't know it was this easy

Take it all away
Take me
Won't you take me far away
Hey hey hey what's that game you play
Will it make me a poor man?
Cause I got an extra dime and I lose it every time
Maybe I'm wrong but I think this whip is too long

Hey hey hey what's that game you play
Will it make me richer?
Cause I do not have a dime and I hate to waste your time
Maybe I'm wrong but I think this whip is too long

No more, no more
See I can't find the time to crawl across the line
But I can't stay here

No more, no more
See I can't find the time to crawl across the line
But I can't stay here till I die
