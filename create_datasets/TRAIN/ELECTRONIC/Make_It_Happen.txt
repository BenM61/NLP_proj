Sometimes we find ourselves
Looking for something new
We stand outside ourselves 
Not knowing quite what we should do 

I am in debt to you 
I owe respect to you
But you've got to learn it's gonna turn, 
Into neglect for you 

And though 
You caught me naked 
I didn't enjoy it 
In fact I regret it 

Let's make it happen 
Why can't you understand 
I am a fraction 
A part of a broken man 

I hope you understand 
It's part of my action plan 
To bury you in the sand 
The tide's gonna turn 

When will you learn 
To stop hiding inside yourself 
I bet you wish you were someone else 
Tell me when will you learn 

The day's getting longer 
And you're getting common sense 
So get right down off that fence 
Ain't it time that you turned 

And though 
You got me thinking 
You could be faking 
Your ego's inflated and I'm sick of waiting 

Let's make it happen 
Why can't you understand 
I am a fraction 
A part of a broken man 

My soul is in rapture 
If only we could both hold on 
Let's cause a reaction 
Just like you know we should.
