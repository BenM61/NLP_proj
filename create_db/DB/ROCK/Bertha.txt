I had a hard run, runnin' from your window
I was all night running, running, Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run in, run around and run down
Run around the corner, Lord, run smack in to a tree

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Dressed myself in green, I went down unto the sea
Try to see what's goin' down, try to read between the lines
I had a feelin' I was fallin', fallin', fallin', I turned around to see
Heard a voice callin', you were running back to me

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Ran into a rainstorm, I ducked back into a bar door
It's all night pourin', but not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me? Throw me in to the jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down, 'til it goes down

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees,
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees,
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees,
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
