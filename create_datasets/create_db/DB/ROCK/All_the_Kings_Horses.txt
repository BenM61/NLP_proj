Swift and true straight to my heart
Love has come calling and I'm back there again
I pour myself a brand new start
Glad to be falling for the beauty within

All the King's horses, all the King's men
I'm on the outside looking in
Over and over and over again
There's no telling where I've been
How I returned here, how much I have seen

All the King's horses, all the King's men
I'll weave a circle round the sun
Throw down my arms and give my all
I'll be your soldier of love
I'll weave a circle round the sun
Throw down my arms and give my all
I'll be your soldier of love
I am your soldier of love
