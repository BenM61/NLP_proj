Drinking in the morning sun
Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off the heavy one
Oh, heavy like a loaded gun
What made me behave that way?
Using words I'd never say?
I can only think it must be love
Oh anyway,
It's looking like a beautiful day

Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like the final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight
'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with me half awake
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

When my face is chamois creased
If you think I wink, I did
Love be likely attributes
Oh, kiss me when my lips are thin

'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake, stumbling over what to say
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

So throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
