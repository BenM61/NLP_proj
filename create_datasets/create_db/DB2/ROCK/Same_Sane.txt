Slip out of my skin
Deny and try again 
A green trap kit is where I've been
Stop deciding
Whatever will remain
Both of us will lie again 
Captured with shame
Leave in silence

Don't cause any pain 
Livable but in your brain
We'll never be the same again
We came up fighting in 
We're tearing down what we began
Tear it down again
And no one else can take the blame
The day before you came

I was affected by the latest bliss
Come on over and take the risk
This time we built up 
A function to get numb 
But nothing will remain
And we'll never be the same again?
Someone turns off 
The close-up of this scene

And every little thing I've seen
Will never be the same again
We came up fighting in 
We're tearing down what we began
Tear it down again
And no one else can take the blame
The day before you came
I was affected by the latest bliss
Come on over and take the risk.
