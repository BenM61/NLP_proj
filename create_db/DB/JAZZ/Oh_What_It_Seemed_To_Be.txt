It was just a neighborhood dance
That's all that it was
But, oh, what it seemed to be
It was like a masquerade ball
With costumes and all

'Cause you were at the dance with me
It was just a ride on a train
That's all that it was
But, oh, what it seemed to be
It was like a trip to the stars
To Venus and Mars

'Cause you were on the train with me
And when I kissed you, darling
It was more than just a thrill for me
It was the promise, darling
Of the things that fate had willed for me
It was just a wedding in June

That's all that it was
But, oh, what it seemed to be
It was like a royal affair
With everyone there
'Cause you said "Yes, I do" to me
