My brain is haunted by this scent
It takes me back to a past event
It's like a drug that I need every day
I need to preserve it, have to get it my way

Forever I'll have this desire
This scent - keeps me alive and fills my soul
Forever engulfed by its fire
This scent - consumes my mind and takes control

The feelings I get when memory comes back
Gives me something in my life I lack
It takes me away to the place I seek
And my being reaches its highest peak

I follow the trail it leaves behind
Boxing it up is on my mind
Preserving this scent is my aim
I satisfy my senses, that scent must sustain.
