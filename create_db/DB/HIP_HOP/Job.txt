Nigga want to lay up on my couch watchin' cable 
Hands all in his pants feet up on my table 
Niggas I don't know rollin' droll 
Optimo blow you got to go 
Nigga out the door tryin' to throw some hints 
It's the first of the month tryin' to pay some rent 
Sendin' them niggas home and hit the streets 
'Cause you been up layin' up, chillin' in this bitch for weeks 
Know that ice is nice and sticks is sweet 
Look in the fridge is full, but the shit ain't sweet 
Nigga get caught to floss, keep shit to ask Newt 
Sure you can charge him but the bill is you 
See, ballers like you gotta pay to play 
Y'all Big Pun niggas gotta pay like you weigh 
You could come by, shit you can't say 
That my girl Mya sing what I can't even say, c'mon 
 
'Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent 
You got to have a J O be	 
If you want to be with me 
'Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent 
You got to have a J O be	 
If you want to be with me 

Uh, I need a heavy trick with a deadly dick (uh huh) 
With a Benz two-thou, SE 6 (whoa) 
Swatch, whatever, as long as he beds me sick 
At least three TVs in every wig 
I ain't tryin' to go to court for child support 
In a crib cramped up, fighting for Pampers (uh huh) 
I don't want draws witcha baby moms 
Nigga, all I want is a car to inch on 
Been tryin' to take it there, f*ck the movies 
I'm a red carpet bitch, nigga, world premiere 
Shit, I ain't the average, I gotta have shit 
And I'm a shopaholic, with a heavy shoe habit 
Not one two, I need a few karats 
Nigga try yourself, buy a stelleto 
And I gotta have them Parrotta Bags 
And them shopping sprees and a lotta cash, c'mon 

'Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent 
You got to have a J O be	 
If you want to be with me 
'Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent 
You got to have a J O be	 
If you want to be with me 

If you want to f*ck, I can spin 
If you want to friend, I gotta go 
If you got dough, let 'em in 
If you go broke, it ain't the end 
Remember how you did it before? 
Let's do it again 
You could start from the bottom 
Take it to the top 
Start it in the Hoopty, end it in the Drop 
want to know the secret how you stay on me? 
You gotta get on, stay on your J-O-B, c'mon 
 
'Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent 
You got to have a J O be	 
If you want to be with me 
'Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent 
You got to have a J O be	 
If you want to be with me
