Well, I play for keeps, baby
Said I play for keeps now
And once we get together
It's got to last forever

Now I won't let you love me
Turn around and snub me
Then shove me to the side
'Cause I've become accustomed
To having your sweet loving, baby
I won't be denied

And just as long as the flowers grow
Raindrops fall and the four winds blow
You've got to keep loving me and don't let go

'Cause, well, I play for keeps, baby
Said I play for keeps now
And once we get together
It's got to last forever now

You can have the soul of me
You got complete control of me
But you can love me just for a little while
You leave me cryin', cryin' like a baby child

But I don't want no one night man
To take me out on no one night stand
You've got to be a rest of my life man

'Cause I play for keeps, baby, yes I do
I play for keeps now
And once we get together
Ooh, it's got to last forever

If I can't have the soul of you
Then I don't want no part of you
'Cause if you can't love me forever and a day
Then you might as well go away

'Cause, well, I play for keeps, baby, yes I do
I play for keeps now
Said I don't want no one night man
Said I can't stand the one night stand, no, no

'Cause I play for keeps, baby
