Never again to feel your touch
Never again to be in love so much;
Never again.
Memories I cherished through the lonely years
Will I see through lonely tears.

Never again to feel your kiss
Never again to know that thrilling bliss;
Never again.

Though the world of love keeps growing,
I have lost the joy of knowing
You'll be by my side eternally
For now I see it can never be;
Your heart will be free.
But as for me,
Never again, never again.
