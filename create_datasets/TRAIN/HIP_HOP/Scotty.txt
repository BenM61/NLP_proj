I've gotta see my doctor...Scotty's calling me...
Scotty beam me up
I'm in the zone I wanna fly morning, noon, and night

I'm geeked up (x8)

I'm geeked up and I can't see
And all the walls keep looking at me
I tell myself there's nothing wrong
But I can't stop gritting my teeth
I can't sleep
I can't eat
I just geek
I just geek
And I know I can't take one so why not three shake it deep
I can't help the way I feel
When I geek I keep it real
In the hood I keep my steel
Try to blow my high you will get killed
Cause it's real bankhead real fabo
Broad daylight, don't keep shit low
Roll my blunt right in front of po po
F*ck them hoes the can blame it on the 'dro

I'm in the zone
I've gotta see my doctor...Scotty's calling me...Scotty beam me up
I'm in the zone I wanna fly morning, noon, and night

I'm geeked up (x8)

Star trek Star trek,
Scotty don't wanna give a star back
I'm in the zone and I bought me a star gack
And I'm really geeked up that's a star fact
I'm starting to see space ships on bankhead
I roll with gangsters pill poppers and dank heads
I got partners like, Worm, Lil' Boom, Buddy And Famous
I got sistas like Yasmine, Chocolate, Porcha, they dangerous
I fly like blaze when I'm burning purp
Real powder heads the burning hurt
Geek music I'm earning turf
While your footballs soft like nerf

I'm in the zone
I've gotta see my doctor...Scotty's calling me...Scotty beam me up
I'm in the zone I wanna fly morning, noon, and night

I'm geeked up (x8)
