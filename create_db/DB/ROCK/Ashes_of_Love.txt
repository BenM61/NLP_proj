One two three four
Ashes of love
Cold as ice
You made the debt
I paid the price
Our love was gone
There's no doubt
Ashes of love
Flames burned out

Love light that shined
In your eyes
Has gone out 
To my surprise
We said goodbye
My heart bled
Now I live without
Your love instead

Ashes of love
Cold as ice
You made the debt
I paid the price
Our love was gone
There's no doubt
Ashes of love
Flames burned out

I trusted you
Our love could stand
Your every wish
Was my command
My heart tells me
I must forget
I loved you then
I love you yet

Ashes of love
Cold as ice
You made the debt
I paid the price
Our love was wrong
There's no doubt
Ashes of love
Flames burned out

Our love was wrong
There's no doubt
Ashes of love
Flames burned out
