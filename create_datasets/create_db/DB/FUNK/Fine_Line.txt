We came in crawling this morning
Already getting ready to go (aah)
And now I got you calling for me
'Cause there's a plan and you wanna know (aah, oh)

I know how this thing goes (goes)
I know the beat to your love
I know how you like yours (yours)
(Aah, oh)
They say anything goes (goes)
But I have the beat to your love (your love)
Where are we gonna take it?

Now I'm dancing on a fine line
Somewhere between a minute and a lifetime
You do it to me, to me
I can't lie, I got a bit caught up tonight
But it's a fine line
You do it to me, to me
You do it to me, to me

I got a warning for you
Don't play me at this, I never lose
I'm all in, all in so follow me with your every move
(Aah, ooh, aah)

I know how this thing goes (goes)
I know the beat to your love
I know how you like yours (yours)
(Aah, oh)
They say anything goes (goes)
But I have the beat to your love (your love)
Where are we gonna take it?

Now I'm dancing on a fine line
Somewhere between a minute and a lifetime
You do it to me, to me
I can't lie, I got a bit caught up tonight
But it's a fine line
You do it to me, to me

You do it to me
But you don't know what you're doing to me
You're making my head explode
And it's mad how you make a brother lose his brain
A touch made me go insane
I know this is destiny
Every time you say my name
You ain't committed no crimes before
No felon, but you're dangerous
All these other people hating us
But we don't give a f*ck what they say to us
'Cause you got me and I know I got you
Everybody's eyes on us when we come through

Now we're dancing on a fine line
Somewhere between a minute and a lifetime
You do it to me, to me
I can't lie, I got a bit caught up tonight
But it's a fine line
You do it to me, to me
You do it to me, to me

But it's a fine line
