Well I've took enough pills for big Memphis town 
Ol' Jerry Lee's dranked enough whiskey to lift any ship off the ground 
I'll be the first to admit 
Sure do wish these people would quit it 

You know its tough enough 
To straightin' up when these idiots won't leave you alone. 
Jerry Lee Lewis's life would make a damn good country song 
I've always done my best 

I've tried to walk tall 
Walk on Killer 
But when the evening was over I was drunk stumbling into walls 
Well I know I've earned my reputation 

Can't they see I've found my salvation? 
I guess they'd rather prove me wrong 
My life would make a damn good country song 
Lets get it now! 

I've had my share of women 
But they always seem to leave 
Gonna put me another quarter 
In the ol' pinball machine 

Well I know the ol' Killers been wrong 
That ol' change came over me took too long 
My life would make a damn good country song 
Jerry Lee Lewis's life would make a damn good country song!
