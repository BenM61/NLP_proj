Sometimes there's no star shining 
Scouting the edge of the universe 
Sometimes you can't see the horizon 
Between the ocean and the earth 

And just when you're thinking about slinkin' down 
I'm gonna pull you up ? I'm gonna pull ya round 
May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 

And you say ? living ain't nothing but hassles? 
In a Manilla envelope rain 
And driving coal all-night to Newcastle 
It's getting to be a repetative strain 
And just when you're thinking about 
Going down the drain ? 

May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 

I'm gonna pull you up ? I'm gonna pull ya round 

May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 

Let a million mirror balls beam 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 

They say the stars can't see their rays 
Nor can they count their numbered days 
No flower can says what perfume is 
We got all this and Bird and Diz 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 

May I remind you of that scene
