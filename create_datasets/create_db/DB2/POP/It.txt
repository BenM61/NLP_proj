When it's cold, it comes slow
It is warm, just watch it grow
- all around me it is here.
It is now.

Just a little bit of it can bring you up or down.
Like the supper it is cooking in your hometown.
It is chicken, it is eggs,
It is in between your legs.
It is walking on the moon,
Leaving your cocoon.

It is the jigsaw. it is purple haze.
It never stays in one place, but it's not a passing phase
It is in the singles bar, in the distance of the face
It is in between the cages, it is always in a space
It is here. it is now.

Any rock can be made to roll
If you enough of it to pay the toll
It has no home in words or gold
Not even in your favourite hole
It is hope for the dope
It rides your horse without a hoof
It is shaken not stirred;
Cocktails on the roof.

When you eat right thru' it you see everything alive
It is inside the spirit, with enough grit to survive
If you think that it's pretentious, you've been taken for a ride.
Look across the mirror sonny, before you choose, decide
It is here. it is now
It is Real. it is Rael

'Cos it's only knock and knowall, but I like it
Yes it's only knock and knowall, but I like is
Yes it's only knock and knowall, but I like it like it...
