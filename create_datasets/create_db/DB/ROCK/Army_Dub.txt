From the bed to the car
Let us stick to you now and then
Move on, move on

Out of school, into home
Let us swallow you whole
Or just hold on, hold on

We were close
Army dub
Not as quick as you run, you run
You run, you run

Brand new shirt
Knackered shoes
Coffee made, office blues
And then run on, run on

Well, who's gonna take it like this?
No way
You are, you are
You are, you are, you are

Who's gonna take it like this?
No way
You are, you are
You are, you are, you are

The one-armed man
The one-armed man
The one-armed man

The one-armed man
The one-armed man
The one-armed man

Who's gonna take it like this?
No way
Who's gonna take it like this?
No way

From the bed, in the car
Let us shower your heart
And then move on, move on

It's the one fatal flaw
Let us swallow you all, you all
You all, you all

We were close
Army dub
Not as quick as you run, you run
You run, you run

Who's gonna take it like this?
No way
Who's gonna take it like this?
No way
I said, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

Who's gonna take it like this?
No way
I said, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

(Who's gonna take it like this?
No way
Who's gonna take it like this?
No way
Who's gonna take it like this?
No way)

You are, you are
You are, you are, you are
