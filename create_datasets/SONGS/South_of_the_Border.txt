South of the border down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now that I wander
My thoughts ever stray

South of the border down Mexico way
Ah, she was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face
It was fiesta we were so gay

South of the border down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreamed that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered manana

For tomorrow never came
South of the border I jumped backed one day
There in a veil of white by the candle light knelt to pray
Ah, the mission bells told me that I must not stay
South of the border down Mexico way

I yi yi yi I I I I
I yi yi yi
I yi yi yi
