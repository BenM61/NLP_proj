Out in the dark (walking in the rain)
On a lonely street (looking for the fire)
Escaping the noise (can you ever escape?)
You can hear your thoughts (an they're calling you a liar)

Out in the dark (walking in the rain)
On a lonely street (looking for the fire)
Escaping the noise (can you ever escape?)
You can hear your thoughts (and they're calling you a coward.)

A brave new world (it's all around)
You're walking too fast (to be able to see it)
Your wings are too small (to get off the ground)
The truth is too close (for you to believe it)

Too high, too low, too small too see
Too fast, too close, too scared to meet
The world outside, you're in my mind.
