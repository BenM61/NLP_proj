Words are in my head but I can't enunciate them clearly
Headphones on your hair, they prevent a chance to even try
Some might find me borderline attractive from afar
But afar is not where I can stay and there you are

Though I want you
I know I haven't a chance
Still I want you

I know yes and no in a couple dozen other languages
But your form of no is the kind of look I can't deny
Tell me, are resistance and stupidity the same?
Tell me, is resistance so enticing, please explain

Though I want you
I know I haven't a chance
Still I want you

(Though I want you) paging Mr. Delusional
You're wanted at the desk
Paging Mr. Delusional
You're wanted at the front desk
Wouldn't it be terrible if there's no music there?
Wouldn't it be terrible if she don't want you near?
Wouldn't it be terrible if there's no music there?
Wouldn't it be terrible if she don't want you near?

Though I want you (wouldn't it be terrible if there's no music there?)
I know I haven't a chance 
Still I want you (wouldn't it be terrible if she don't want you near?)
