A man, a room
A man alone in a room
Eyes, tears
His eyes are losing tears

A man who's down and out
He's got nothing to live for
He knows
There's no doubt! 

Emptiness
A soul that's filled with emptiness
A man, a room
A man alone in a room

A man who's down and out
He's got nothing to live for
He knows
There's no doubt! 

Yeah! 

A man, a room
A man alone in a room
He's down and out
Down and out
Down

He knows there's no doubt
No doubt
Oh, down and out
Oh yeah, yeah

Down and out
A man alone in a room
A man alone in a room
Down and out
