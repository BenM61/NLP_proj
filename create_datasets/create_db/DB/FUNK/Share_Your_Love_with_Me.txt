It's an evil wind that blows no good, yeah
It's a sad heart that won't love like I know it should
Oh how lonesome(oh how lonesome) you must be (you must be)
It's a shame (shame, shame) if you don't share your love with me

It's a heartache, yeah (it's a heartache)
When love is gone (baby it's a heartache)
But it's bad (bad) and even sad (sad) oh later on
And there's no one blinder than you won't see
It's a shame (shame, shame) if you don't share some of your love with me

I can't help it, oh no
He is gone
I must try to forget
Because I've got to live on
Oh it's a good thing it's a sweet thing (it's a sweet thing)
To love someone (such a sweet thing)
But it's bad (bad) and even sad (sad) when it's not returned
Oh, how lonesome, how lonesome, how lonesome (oh how lonesome)
You must be (you must be)
I tell you it would be a shame (shame, shame)
A shame if you don't share your love with me (share your love with me)
It would really be a mistake baby (shame, shame) if you don't share
Your love with me (share your love with me)
It would sure be a shame (shame, shame) if you don't share
Share your love with me (share your love with me)
