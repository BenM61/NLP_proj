Copping pains at night
Better off going bar hopping
Waiting to fight, right?
Nobody wants to get tapped by the gauntlet
If you got it flaunt it, they say rap is on it
By the living dead
Rip 'em to shreds
Give 'em the bread while sippin' the red, bled
Chip in the the head, MCs is bought in soul
Their rhymes ain't worth the weight they cost in gold, ho
It's like a thin chain from here to Brisbane
Y'all shall not print his name in vain
Rep the insane
Gotta do it
Snottily putrid, true grit
Came to spew spit like bodily fluid with mucus
Crews is useless, act like you knew it
Either that or get cold smacked like bluid, true it
Rules is rules, backed right into it
Ghouls is fools that's too cracked for school
Prove it

Other way that you care to be payed
Hear the echo of the bang in the cockney rhyming slang
Hurricane the fool your terrain
Hear the echo of the bang in the cockney rhyming slang

No guts no glory, what your story
Bore me poorly, saucy oftenly, enough for coffee
Rarely scarcely scary clary stare, let's be very clear
MCs is derriere, as well as aware, wearily
Just dont be nearly near you hear me? (Yeah!)
Slow flow speed beats see us on the speeds
From your nosebleed seats
DOOMington son, once all the swimming's done
Leaves the room with the groom's unassuming blooming nun
Lady friend
Sideway trainers like Barrigan
Hear radiant wavy baby skin
He stay pimping, rocky diamond ring
Uncle flow grandson, cockney rhyming slang
(Crazy brin)
Flows is handsome, cockney rhyming slang

(There go your anthem, cockney rhyming slang)
