Sidewalk
Sleep on the sidewalk
The Ragman stands
At the end of the line
His eyes burn
Hard in the light of day
So proud
Of the American way

But it's a lie, yeah, lie
And you believe every word
Well, it's a lie, yeah, lie
But what goes on in your mind?
And when the walls come down
On the American dream
You're gonna sleep on the
Sidewalk

In your hands
Dirt and blood on your hands
In your day
You didn't need anyone
So look around
Remember, yeah, these are your friends

But it's a lie, yeah, lie
And you believe every word
Well, it's a lie, yeah, lie
But what goes on in your mind?
And when the walls come down
On the American dream
You're gonna sleep on the
Sidewalk
