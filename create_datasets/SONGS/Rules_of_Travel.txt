Now that you've made your mistake
Now that you know how the heart bends and break
Just throw away the book, and take a second look
Behind the door: a guided tour; what we came here for
One: don't let the sun go down on
Two: love, but are undone by
Three: whose name is...
I won't even start before we learn the rules
Like one: don't let the sun go down on
Two: love, but are undone by
Three: whose name is...
I won't even start before we learn the rules of travel
Inside each other's hearts
Inside each other's hearts

When do the walls tumble down?
Into the sky, into the stars and the ground
Today, to give it up; surrender to the love, no man to hold
No way to know that you are home

One: don't let the sun go down on
Two: love, but are undone by
Three: whose name is...
I won't even start before we learn the rules
Like one: don't let the sun go down on
Two: love, but are undone by
Three: whose name is...
I won't even start before we learn the rules of travel
Inside each other's hearts
Inside each other's hearts

One: (Don't let the sun)
Two:
Three: (Don't let the sun.)
Four

One: don't let the sun go down on
Two: love, but are undone by
Three: whose name is...
I won't even start before we learn the rules
Like one: don't let the sun go down on
Two: love, but are undone by
Three: whose name is...
I won't even start before we learn the rules of travel
Inside each other's hearts
Inside each other's hearts
