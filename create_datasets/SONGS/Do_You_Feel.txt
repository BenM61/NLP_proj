I'm thinking 'bout other things I heard about today
All this week and tomorrow
And how these hands can create some better things, a better ring
But you see for now I got my own things

I can't help it, I got too many issues I own
So I cannot help I'm afraid, yeah
But keep on preachin', preachin' and heal the world
Lip service makes us look great

Do you feel the weight of the world singin' sorrow'
Or do you, is it just not real
'Cause you got your own things
Yeah, we all have our things I guess

I guess my mind wanders off from time to time
Sometimes I convince myself that all is fine
In the world it's not mine why should I have to try
To fix things I didn't create or contrive

Do you feel the weight of the world singin' sorrow'
Or do you, is it just not real
'Cause you got your own things
Yeah, we all have so many things

Have the habits had you'
Has it been for long'
Can you feel the souls behind'
What's going on'

Do you feel the weight of the world singin' sorrow'
Or do you, is it just not real
'Cause you got your own things
Yeah, we all have our things

Do you feel the weight of the world singin' sorrow'
Or do you, is it just not real
'Cause you got your own things
'Cause we all have so many things
And I can't get past these things, ohh
