And you don't stop, keep keep it on
Keep it on, keep keep it on
You don't stop, keep keep it on
(welcome to the after party)
Keep keep it on, where da party at

After the party
Lets take a little time
And talk about it
What's going through your mind
And as we're shakin'
Ooh it looks so right
I want to ride
See I would be lyin'
If I didn't tell you
It made me want to flip
And you can't tell me
You ain't feelin' the same shit
Girl its our chemistry
Like icing on the cake
I hope you stay
So we can do our thang

After the party

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop (baby do your thang)
Don't stop if the music drops (rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off (whats it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party

After the party
Let's go somewhere and finish
What we started
Cause right from the beginning
I was on it
I know you felt these thighs
You know I felt you rise
So why don't we slide
Up off the dance floor
You and me
Cause I want to know
Just how deep
Does your lovin' go
So tell your boys "good night"
Cause we're going right

After the party

Don't stop you ain't gotta stop (baby do your thang)
Don't stop if the music drops (rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off (whats it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party
(don't stop)
Don't stop you ain't gotta stop (baby do your thang)
Don't stop if the music drops (rock with me)
Get on top, you can take it off (whats it gonna be)
Doncha want the after party

Sweet baby come with me
Cause I want to do you right
Don't hold back, baby where you at
Cause I want to get inside
