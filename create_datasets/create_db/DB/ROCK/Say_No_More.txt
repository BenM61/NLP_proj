Well it felt so sad to be
Where I didn't need to be
Now I feel so good to know
How you still care for me

When it's alright in front of you
It's so hard to see
But there was a wall about you
Though it took me awhile just

To suss it out
And what I laid down
At my shout didn't help me none
'Cause you held me soul in your hands

It sifted through your fingers
Like fine silver sand
Well I don't need a swimming pool
I don't need hammocks on the wall

I just want you Babe
And that's all
I'll say no more
I laid all my cards on the table

I can give you what you need
Now I'm able to
Now I tell you how I feel
I hope you come through

'Cause if you're the sea
Then I'm your rock
And if I'm a key
Then you're my lock

Well if you're a foot
Then I'm your sock
So wear me well
Oh! Go away all alone

Don't leave me here Babe
With just this 1-way telephone
Without you I ain't no big shot
Even now looks like I hit the jackpot

I just need you Babe
That's my long shot
I can sing no more
