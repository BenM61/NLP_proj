Yes, I know, it's fallin'
Yes, I know, it's fallin'

Did you ever get that feeling
That your baby's gonna set you free?
Won't she tell you why it's over?
Do you sit and wonder "Was it me?"

You try and tell her she'll be sorry
It'll happen with somebody new
But all the time you're worried 'bout
The pain that's gonna fall on you

You forgot to make a payment
And they're gonna disconnect your phone
You better pay up what you owe
They're gonna try to repossess your home

They want their bread in the morning
Plus your next month's payment, too
But all the time you're worried 'bout
The pain that's gonna fall on you

You caught your baby cheatin'
But you say you love her any way
But all the time you're thinkin'
Just to find a way to make her pay

You think to leave her broken hearted
Is the only thing that you can do
But all the time you're worried 'bout
The pain that's gonna fall on you

Yes, I know, it's fallin'
Yes, I know, it's fallin'
