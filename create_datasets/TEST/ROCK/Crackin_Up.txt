You're always hollerin' bout where I've been
You're always screamin' bout the money I spend
What's buggin' you?
Yeah, yeah, you're crackin up

I do your laundry and your cooking too
What more for a woman could a man like me do
You're bugging me
Yeah, yeah, you're crackin up

I spoiled you woman, a long time ago
I used to bring your meals and bring 'em to your door
I'm all fed up
Yeah, yeah, you buggin' me
