Tha name is Krayzie
Big Bad Ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash
Even took the mayor's daughter
Now that theres kidnappin
But she was wid it so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double crossed by the law so theres nobody to run to 
Yeah, its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw, call him Leather Face
Im headed for the west
Heard they gotta couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time to get tha whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin dark so now Im watchin for them damn Injuns
They like to catch ya
Then they rob and split
I be a rootin tootin shootin damn fool
Protectin my chips
All of a sudden 
I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse
Whoa Nellie!
Who in the bushes?
Ya betta speak out
Or Ima let my shotgun song sing out

Who is this?
Hope this ain't tha law
Drawed out tha bushes with my sawed off shotgun

Come on out
Right now, Im gettin angry
Took a step back cuz it could get dangerous

Please don't shoot its just me, Thug Queen, a horse stealer

Then why the hell is you hidin in them bushes?

Im wanted in four counties 
For armed robbery
Killed 2 sheriffs, 6 of his best men with my hands
Stole 2 horses
Thought you was the law 
Thats why I jumped in tha bushes

Goodness
Now she was hotter than a barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job
So I told her to ride
C'mon

May I ask whatcha headin to the west for? 

I got a partna
Got a plan for some do
And if ya down
You can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute 
So be sure if you're wid it

We out before the sunrise 
Gotta style here 
For your partna to ride
Hit tha saloon for the moonshine
Down for whateva
Lets ride (lets ride)

These directions say we to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive
Ill cop a place we can bunk
Meet my boy in tha mornin
For details and hook up

Im peepin Krayzies wanted poster in tha saloon
So I assume
Itll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glance across the room
I see this youngsta gettin ready to fire
But if he messin tonight 
I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approach him and I pause
Look man
I really don't wanna brawl 
So wont ya chill before them laws
Come messin up this masta plan
Since he already rowdy 
I just asked the man (HEY)
You want some work?
Well partna put in your bid
And by the way now whats your name?
They call me Layzie the Kid

Tha names Powder P
Can I get a 12 guage?
Outlawd everyday
On the front page
Now Mr. Kid
If you give me the lowdown
Me and Blackjack
Be ready for the showdown
With 2 double barrels pointed at whateva
We stick togetha 
Im perty cleva

So saddle up 
Jump on the band wagon
Cuz its all goin down
I heard a guy run in the bar screamin "Krayzie's in town"

Now when we get to the saloon 
You don't worry
Wait outside
And don't be stealin nobody's damn horses
Step inside tha bar
Layzie Kid you son of a gun

Now lets go have some fun
And heres my partna Powder
Hes a young gun
