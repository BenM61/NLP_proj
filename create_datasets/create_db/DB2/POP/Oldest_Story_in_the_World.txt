Yeah, It makes perfect sense
Seeing how the seeds were sown
To find you out there on your own
You said your goodbyes
And broke all the ties
It struck me dumb to think I tried for you

Tonight you can feel the season changing
You'll never change
Well, you're no better than the weather
Your cool
But there's rain in your heart
You blown like a feather

And that's the oldest story in the world
You lost the key to paradise
That's the oldest story in the world

Did we have it made?
Somehow I thought we could remain
If nothing lasts, no one's to blame
And you can't look back
To where you got off the track
That's a mystery that we'll never crack

It's just the oldest story in the world
Lost the key to paradise
That's the oldest story in the world
Today we gotta set it right
And that's the oldest story in the world
You'll hear it again and again
That's the oldest story in the world yeah

Somehow I thought we could remain
If nothing lasts, no one's to blame
And you can't look back
To where you got off the track
That's a mystery that we'll never crack

And that's the oldest story in the world
Lost your key to paradise
That's the oldest story in the world
Someday we gotta set it right
That's the oldest story in the world
Just like a rolling stone
That's the oldest story
That's the oldest story
Now you can't go home
That's the oldest story in the world yeah
But I don't want to leave
But it's time to go
Well, well, I just don't know
And that's the oldest story in the world
Yeah!
