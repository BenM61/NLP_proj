"Music soothes the savage"
That's a well-known phrase 
But your heart becomes 
Full of kettle drums 
When the sweet potato piper plays 
Go on, throw your hat up
Shout a few hoorays
Cause you can't hold back 
You're a jumping jack 
When the sweet potato piper plays... 
Though it's not a magic flute 
There's a fascinating toot 
It's not exactly beautiful
It's sort of like an' I don't know 
I guess you'd call it cute! 
Sunbeams try new dance steps
Songbirds sound their a's
And the world joins in 
With a great big grin 
When the sweet potato piper plays! 
(whistle whistle whistle) 
 
Marion Hutton: 
Hello there, Texas, whatcha say? 
How come you're whistling
Why don't you play? 

Tex Beneke: 
I've been messing with this Sweet Potato all day long 
I can't make it play
What goes, what's wrong? 

MH: 
You're crazy, Texas 
You're outta your mind 
You can't blow that 
That's the eatin' kind! 

TB: 
But them baby rug-cutters down Texas way 
They been blowin' on Sweet Potatoes 
And really make 'em play! 

MH: 
Why don't you stick to your saxophone, man? 
You oughta know you can't jam on a yam...!
