I see the city, and it isn't what it used to be.
A million houses goin' up and down in front of me.
No time to let the concrete set before it's broken up again.
Don't care if it's historic; don't really care at all.

A hidden landscape on the brink of an envelopment.
The protesters rally, never satisfied with development.
Both strivin' for a perfect world, each havin' their own opinion.
They all they see; it grows; it grows on and on.

[Chorus]
All torn down.
All torn down.
All torn

I see the city, and it's grown into a big machine.
The streets are freeways, and the parks are just a memory.
No time to let the concrete set before it's broken up again.
Don't care if it's historic; don't really care at all.

[Chorus]

Ya got no reason.
Ya got no reason. 
Ya got no reason. 
Ya got no reason, you!

I see the city, and it isn't what it used to be.
A million houses goin' up and down in front of me.
No time to let the concrete set before it's broken up again.
Don't care if it's historic; don't really care at all.

[Chorus] 

Ya got no reason.
Ya got no reason.
Ya got no reason. 
Ya got no reason. 
Ya got no reason. 
Ya got no reason. 
Ya got no reason. 
Ya got no reason, you! 

You've got no reason.
You've got no reason.
You've got no reason.
