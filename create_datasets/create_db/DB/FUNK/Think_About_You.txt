Yo, yo 
Yo, girl 
I take a shower and I think about you 
I put on my clothes and I think about you 
I read the paper, I think about you 
I fix my dinner and I think about you 
I lay in bed and I think about you 
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do 

[Chorus]
Take a shower and I think about you 
Put on my clothes and I think about you 
Drive my car and I think about you 
What am I to do 
Read the paper and I think about you 
Fix my dinner and I think about you 
Lay in bed and I think about you 
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do 

I heard her say that this is make the hearts grow closer 
Well, I will never get over the way we bout that night 
And I want to get it back 
So, if you're out there 
Please listen to this message from me 
Know that I'm right here thinking about you 
Hope that you, too, will another day 
'Cause all I do 

[Chorus]
You should hear them telling me I must be crazy 
'Cause I'm waiting on you lately 
That's okay, all right 
'Cause I need to get you back 
I want you to know that 
I don't regret a single moment I spent on you and my friends 
Thinkin' about you 
Hope that you, too, will another day 

[Chorus] 

Always thinking about you (yea, yea) 
Poor me, I'm down about you 
I'd rather be alone 
If I can't have you at all, at all 

[Chorus: x2]
