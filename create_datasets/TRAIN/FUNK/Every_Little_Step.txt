Whoooaaaaa... ohhhhh whoaa (we'll be together)
Every little ... (Ohhh) every little step I take (Ohh ya)
Every little ... every little step I take

I can't sleep at night
I toss and turn
Listen for the telephone
When I get your call
I'm all chocked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to mee
Cause a boy like you is a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try and tell ya
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
Just like that, just like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

I can't sleep at night
I toss and turn
Listen for the telephone
When I get your call
I'm all chocked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Cause a boy like you is a dream come true
A ...real... life ...fantasyyyy...

No matter what your friends try and tell ya
We were made to fall in love (Ohh ohh)
And we will be together, any kind of weather
