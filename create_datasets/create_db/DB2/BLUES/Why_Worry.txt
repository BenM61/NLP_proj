Got to see all those headlines
Same old depressing news
Trouble surround us so I play my blues

Tell me why should I worry
All the world is crazed
We can take it, yes we do don't we
I'm so amazed

So I go to the ocean
Give me time to think
No time for troubles
Give me one more drink

I'm gonna leave for the ark
Do the best I can
Shake out my troubles
I'm not a worrying man

(Believe that stuff about gas gettin' cheaper)
(You know the price will be up before you get up in the morning)
(Now 'bout this, do you think we're gonna get them horses back to the
Ranch...)
