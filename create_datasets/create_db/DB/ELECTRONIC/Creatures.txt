We're back to creature 
Very hard to understand 
I can't imagine how it happened 
Impossible to comprehend 

I feel the danger 
What are things coming to 
They shut their eyes go into hiding 
There's no god for me and you 

Why are we creatures 
It's our natural way 
Why are we creatures 
I hear it day by day 

I call you creature 
And I'm not behind the times 
Do please forgive me, I'm a rebel 
I hit you right between the eyes 

Why are we creatures 
It's our natural way 
Why are we creatures 
I hear it day by day 

With all my power 
Against the wall of decadence 
You'll shut your eyes go into hiding 
Time to have some influence 

Why are we creatures 
It's our natural way 
Why are we creatures 
I hear it day by day
