Baby, understand everything
There's no one else in my life
Maybe I can make you happy, baby
If I spend some time with you
Tell me baby, baby not to change
I'm still in love with you
Don't be afraid, let me hold your heart
Control everything you do
 
Baby, you know that I wouldn't do
Couldn't do anything to hurt you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye
Baby, you know that I couldn't do
Wouldn't live my life without you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye
 
Ohh baby, if it's okay with you
I'll do all that I can do
To make this thing unbreakable
And if you need me to
I'll swim through the stars till I touch the moon
Do anything baby just to get to you
Won't be afraid to let you hold my heart
Control everything I do

Baby, you know that I wouldn't do
Couldn't do anything to hurt you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye
Baby, you know that I couldn't do
Wouldn't live my life without you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye
 
Baby, if it's okay with you (if it's okay)
I'll do anything that I can do (ooh)
No one else can do it like you (oh yeah)
I'll give my love and vow to you
I'll will never leave you, that is true
I'm a good woman, let me prove to you (let me prove it to you)
If you feel weak, boy don't you worry
Cause I can never say goodbye

Baby, you know that I wouldn't do
Couldn't do anything to hurt you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye
Baby, you know that I couldn't do
Wouldn't live my life without you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye

Couldn't do anything to hurt you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye

Wouldn't live my life without you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
Cause I never can say goodbye
