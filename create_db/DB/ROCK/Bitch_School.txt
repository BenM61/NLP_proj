You been bad
Don't do what I say.
You don't listen,
And you never obey.

Try to teach you,
But you just won't be good.
You won't behave the way a big girl should.
It's time to give that whip a crack.
I'm gonna have to send you back to

Bitch School.
Bitch School.

You're a beauty.
You're the best of your breed.
You're a handful,
And I know what you need.

You need training.
Gonna bring you to heel.
I'm gonna break you with my will of steel.
'Cause discipline's my middle name
And no one comes back the same from

Bitch School.
Bitch School.

No more sniffing strangers,
Or running free at night.
You think my bark's bad, honey -
Wait till you feel my bite.

You got problems.
You whine and you beg.
When I'm busy,
You want to dance with my leg.

I'm gonna chain you.
Make you sleep out of doors.
You're so fetching when you're down on all fours.
And when you hear your master,
You will come a little faster, thanks to

Bitch School.
Bitch School.
Bitch School.
(Goin' have to send you back to)
Bitch School.

(Good Girl!)
