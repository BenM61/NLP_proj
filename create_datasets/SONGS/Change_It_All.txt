They're closing all the schools down
Some teachers work for free now
And libraries won't be found
Cause there's not enough

Can you see a change in your town
Small business close it's cold out
I'm trying to sort it out
What we're giving up

Basically there are people left out
From living comfortably can we figure it out
I've been waiting restlessly for the words to a song
Change it all, change it all, change it all

I never found a nine to five
That was worth it from my soul 'til I
I pursued what brought joy in my life
And there's something for us all

And I still think it is my right
And it's the last and one of few
To get the luxury of learning
Something I could use

Oh, basically there are people left out
From living comfortably can we figure it out
I've been waiting restlessly for the words to a song
That could change it all, change it all, change it all
(If the words could change it all)
(Change it all)

So many laws are changing
They say it's the price for war
We send over, he spend billions
It's hard to believe that years ago people died to fight

But history feels so far away
We're not fighting for our lives anymore
It's hard to know what's really worth fighting for
Or is it killing and dying on the streets

Oh, basically there are people left out
From living comfortably can we figure it out
I've been waiting restlessly for the words to a song
That could change it all

Oh, basically there's enough for us all
So why can't we somehow figure it out
I've been waiting restlessly for the words to a song
That could change it all, change it all, change it all
(If the words could change it all)
Change it all, change it all

If a song could change it all
What if we could change it all
