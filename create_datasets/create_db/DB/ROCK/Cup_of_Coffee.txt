And this time round, it's all thanks to you, baby oh oh

Nothing, is strong enough to lead us astray
And it's always a mystery to me
I know you are the one for me, eh, eh 

You see, my world's turning around you 
And I'm, definitely in love with you
It's hard, it's hard to be far, oh, oh 

Anywhere in the world, I'm with you my girl
And I'm proud oh yeah so fucking proud you know
And I want to scream it out loud you know

It's cool! yeah you know that it's so cool
And no, you've got nothing to prove, I know
I know that I feel good 

A cup of coffee, by your side in the morning
A sip of sweet love, from your lips in the evening
Every now and then, life makes me happy, oh oh 

The last time we kissed, honey, sure I miss it
You said kind words, I never forget
You had this fucking look on your face

And this time round, it's all thanks to you baby oh oh
And this time round, it's all thanks to you baby oh oh
And this time round, it's all thanks to you baby oh oh
And this time round, it's all thanks to you baby oh oh
