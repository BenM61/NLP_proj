Seriously man,
Like, you know when you got a good girl,
Or you know when she means something to you, & you got like, a name. 

Here we go again
Here we go

Like I had a name for this girl, I used to call her "ladybird",
Cos she always played red, in connect four. 

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

Look, 
I call her nite nite
But we getting on fine right,
I don't wanna spoil it,
I don't why I can't commit to girls,
And I tell white lies, I'll find out the hard way,
Cos she got my favourite smile, her favourite style,
The first hotel, my favourite time, 
And maybe later we could have a baby, maybe a baby boy, my 
Favourite child,
"I'm way too tired", my favourite lie,
I wasnt too sure of her favourite rhyme
The windows are steaming up like it's naked time,
Wait, we're way too bait,
I bought her favourite shoes, or they better be,
And she's even my favourite size,
And she knows I hate holding hands, and I'm hooded up when it's 
Bait inside,
So I guess she's my favorite, right? 

Right,
Cos nothing comes close to you. 

So numbers? No boys are taking yours,
And no girls are taking mine,
Groupies? **** that, I'm taking time,
We speak from like 8 till late at night,
When we gets on top, drop my favourite line:

Girl, I ain't going nowhere. 

I plain ain't going nowhere,
But, I like you, and it might take some time,
But really I'm like

Here we go again,

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times,
Touch my phone, and her number my thumb finds,
Cos she's ideal, like a nice meal,
And a night in, with a nice feel,
Maybe some wine,
Maybe sometime we could hold hands in the park, in the sunshine,
Sometimes,
Be patient with me if I got 3 raves in 1 week,
Or in a studio, away for a week, 
One we could book a vacation and leave,
But please: "no drama", I don't need beef like (? )
I'm just focused on making the peas, breaking the team, chasing a 
Dream,
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes, 
But you can't say I don't make enough time,
We speak everyday and meet everyweek,
So I dunno. Maybe it's me. 
You? you got it planned out,
I don't make plans,
You know me, I wait and I see,
But if we were together, or even now,
If we weren't "sort-of", but were together,
Would you be faithfull to me? 
Treat me massage me and make me a tea? 
Come link me, lay and wake up from sleep, and look hot like 80 
Degrees? 

And you know I never say that sort of thing

See? that's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before, you get me? 

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow,
Baby we could do this again sometime,
I even have a special name for you,
It's "long baby", cos you always on my mind, yeah. 
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah,
I won't tell my mates,
No, no, I know, no, I know, oh
Yeah I like you,
Here we,
Here we go again,
Here we,
Here we go again.
