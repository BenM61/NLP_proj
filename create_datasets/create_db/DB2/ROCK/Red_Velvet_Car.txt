No need standing in the rain
Just call and tell me where you are
That icy wind will bring the pain
And I don't care if it's far

Don't sit crying in your room
Stealing candy from the jar
I will be there very soon
In my red velvet car

Maybe you got hit real hard
Maybe you are on the floor
People screaming out your name
'Cause they don't trust ya anymore

I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
I'm coming, oh yeah
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
Yeah, yeah I'm coming

So pull your weary bones inside
You can sleep while I drive
Or watch the moon out on the lake
I won't even touch the break
In my red velvet car
My red velvet car
My red velvet car
