He wears her leather just to satisfy
She really throws it around
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy
She's the richest bitch in town

Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter

Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch

She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house upon hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one ginormous thrill

She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover

Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just imitation woman up for sale

She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a professional smile
But I switch over 'cause she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while

She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master
