I never knew what I was missing
Love with no passion in the kissing
I can't explain it, how you made me open up
And you showed me things I never thought I'd do, ho
I'd hate to think of ever losing you
?Cause there is no one that makes me feel the way you do

You're some kinda lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kinda lover
Make me feel, oh, so real

Hold me and tell me that you love me, ho
Only with you is where I wanna be
We'll light a candle as a symbol of our love
Then we'll move real close like in a perfect fantasy, oh
I wish these moments could go on and on and on
But before you leave I want you to know

You're some kinda lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kinda lover, yeah
Make me feel, oh, so real

Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
Ho, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ho
Yeah

You're some kinda lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kinda lover, yeah
Make me feel, oh, so real

You're some kinda lover, yeah, yeah

You're some kinda lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kinda lover, yeah
You make me feel, oh, so real

You're some kinda lover, ho
