Get out of bed, pick up the phone
Time to tell the press
Say to myself, I can't do no-one else
There's a whole world outside

I'm gonna tell it all
I'm gonna sell it all
I'm gonna sell
Get out of bed
Come out and sing
Blue skies ahead
The man who told everything

And I feel, like I'm losing my head
I didn't mean to stay
Lives have been wrecked, and I've picked up my cheque
Catch a plane out of here

I'm gonna get out of here
I'm gonna get out of here
I'm gonna sell
Get out of bed
Come out and sing
Blue skies ahead
The man who told everything
