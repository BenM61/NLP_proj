There's a lady in a turban
In a cocaine tree
And she does a dance so rhythmically
She's a crying and a singing
Havin' a time
But don't that cocaine tree look fine

But you gotta put on your sailin shoes
Put on your sailin shoes
Everyone will start to cheer
When you put on your sailin shoes

Doctor, doctor, I feel so bad
This is the worst day I ever had
Have you this misery a very long time?
Well if you if, I'll lay it on the line

But you gotta put on your sailin shoes
Put on your sailin shoes
Everyone will hip hooray
When you put on your sailin shoes

Jedidah
He's got a dime
Says he catches more fish every time
Well I've gotta line
If you've got a pole
Well I'll meet you at the fishing hole

But you gotta put on your sailin shoes
Put on your sailin shoes
Everyone will start to cheer
When you put on your sailin shoes

Said, everyone put on
Put on your sailin shoes
