Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

They tell me that temptation, ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me, I tried to hide my feelings, d-o-g's
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what it is
You've got me singin' in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only, baby, won't you be there when it's hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

I've traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do
I guess I'll call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing I really want you to do

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
It's true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real g's gon' cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But what's the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be macking
I can't lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, ok
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on the phone

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone
