A star shining in a universe far away
My heart knows that we shall meet again some sweet day
And you, you will be the flame that burns in my breast
And oh, I know just by knowing you I was blessed,
Yes I was truly blessed
 
Heaven, Heaven, ooh waiting there for me
Heaven, Heaven, ooh always let it be

So why, tell me why the good die young my old friend
I pray that heaven waits for everyone in the end
And love, love is how we cross that bridge to the light
A star that is what you are in my darkest night
Be always by my side

Heaven, Heaven, ooh waiting there for me
Heaven, Heaven, ooh always let it be

Heaven, Heaven, ooh waiting there for me
Heaven, Heaven, ooh always let it be
