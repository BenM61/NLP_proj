Things get clear when I feel free
When whatever's next comes easily
When gentle hands give life to me
When your eyes fill with tiny tears

When I'm this still you are my life
When I'm this still you are my life

So at ease in the midnight sky
So at ease in the midnight sky

But my insides will look like war
My insides will look like war

Paralysed except through my thought

So why so sad
You live and you love
So why so sad
Dependent on above
Searching for the dead sea scrolls
So why, so why so sad

My smile as real as a hyena's
My smile as real as a hyena's

Burns an expressway to my skull
Burns an expressway to my skull

But I'll stick myself together again
Spirit so low that I no longer pretend

So why so sad
You live and you love
So why so sad
Dependent on above
Searching for the dead sea scrolls
So why, so why so sad

So why so sad
You live and you love
So why so sad
Dependent on above
Searching for the dead sea scrolls
So why, so why so sad
So why, so why so sad
So why, so why so sad
So why, so why so sad
