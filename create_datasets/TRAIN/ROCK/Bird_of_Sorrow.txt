Even if a day feels too long
You feel like you can't wait another one
You're slowly givin' up on everything
Love is gonna find you again

Love is gonna find you, you better be ready then

You been kneelin' in the dark for far too long
You've been waitin' for that spark, but it hasn't come
Well I'm callin' to you, please, get off the floor
A good heart will find you again

A good heart will find you, just be ready then

Tethered to a bird of sorrow
A voice that's buried in the hollow
You've given over to self-deceivin'
Your prostrate bowed would not be leavin'
You've squandered more than you could borrow
You've bet your joys on all tomorrows
For the hope of some returnin'
While everything around just burnin'

Come on, we gotta get out, get out of this mess we made
And still for all our talk, we're both so afraid
Will we leave this up to chance, like we do everything?
Love is gonna find us again

Love is gonna find us, we gotta be ready then

Tethered to a bird of sorrow
A voice that's buried in the hollow
You've given over to self-deceivin'
Your prostrate bowed would not be leavin'
You've squandered more than you could borrow
You've bet your joys on all tomorrows
For the hope of some returnin'
While everything around you's burnin'

But I'm not leavin' you yet
I'm not leavin' you yet
I'm not leavin'
I'm not leavin', yeah, yeah
I'm not leavin'
I'm not leavin', yeah, yeah
I'm hangin' on
Hangin' on
What's gonna come?
I'm hangin' on now
Hangin' on, hangin' on, hangin' on
Hangin' on, hangin' on, hangin' on

With the faithful
With the faithful
I'm hangin' on
What's gonna come?
What's gonna come?
Hangin' on
Hangin' on
