Was it the trick of the light?
Or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke our hearts?
Was it something I said?
Or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water 
Is it too late?
Oh, is it too late?

Man, all my life I've been
Searching for someone
To show me how it feels to be loved
And how to love somebody back
And after stumbling through the years
I thought I found you, just to see you fading out into the night

Was it the trick of the light?
Or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke her hearts?
Was it something you said?
Or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water 
And is it too late?

See, all my life I've been
Silently reaching for
A hand to hold, to warm the colder 
Sparkle lights, to guide me through, alright?
And after stumbling through the years
I thought I found you, just to see you fading out into the night

Was it the trick of the light?
Or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water 
That broke our hearts?
Was it something we did?
Or just a cruel twist of fate?
Was it hell or high water
And is it too late?

Was it a knife in my back?
Or a fork in the road?
Was it hell or high water that left us alone?
Is it really game over?
Is it really checkmate?
Was it hell or high water and is it too late?
Oh, is it too late?

Was it the trick of the light?
Or a shot in the dark?
Was it hell or high water that broke her heart?
