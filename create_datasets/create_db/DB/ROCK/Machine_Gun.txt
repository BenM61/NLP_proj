Well, the first time that I saw you
I could not speak a word
My tongue was tied in giant knots
And I felt so disturbed

At the feeling rushing through me
The heat inside my veins
At the way my nerve ends tingle
Every time you call my name

I've got a lust ignited fever
And I can't put out the flame

Next time that I saw you
I felt so at ease
You had a languid disposition
I had an willingness to please

And your candy apple red lips
Full of violets and sex
Had me harder than a coal train
Had my collar wringing wet

Now I'm gonna crash and burn
But I'm not finished yet

My heart is pounding like a big bass drum
Excited at the thought I might get me some
Lick it off my fingers
Taste it on my tongue
Love you little baby like a machine gun

You're a symphony of elegance
A masterpiece of grace
And animated work of art
Who's acquired a taste

For the flesh of weaker lovers
Lie down on their backs
To be ridden at your leisure
And be taken off like hats

I'm not here for you to walk on
And I'm not your welcome mat

My heart is pounding like a big bass drum
Excited at the thought I might get me some
Lick it off my fingers
Taste it on my tongue
Love you little baby like a machine gun

A machine gun, yeah

The first time that I saw you
I could not speak a word
My tongue was tied in giant knots
And I felt so disturbed

At the feeling rushing through me
The heat inside my veins
At the way my nerve ends tingle
Every time you call my name

I've got a lust ignited fever
And I can't put out the flame

My heart is pounding like a big bass drum
Excited at the thought I might get me some
Lick it off my fingers
Taste it on my tongue
Love you little baby like a machine gun

Ma-ma-ma-machine gun

Machine...
