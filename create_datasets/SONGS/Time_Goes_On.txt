Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Tick, tick

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

I'm seem forever, since time began 
So full of mysteries we don't understand
Searching for answers and remedies
As problems plague us like an enemy

Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

So many blinded by life today
When will we realize love the only way
It's time to wake up
'Cause times have changed
Time waits for no one
It's a crucial game

Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

Take care of business, don't procrastinate
We must decide on what becomes our fate
Nation to nation, love is the key
Let's take the time we need more unity

Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

Round and round in circles we go
Will we ever stop, nobody knows
Running with the hands of time
Always reaching, still we seem to find
Time just marches on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on

On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
On and on, time goes on, never stops,
Just goes on
