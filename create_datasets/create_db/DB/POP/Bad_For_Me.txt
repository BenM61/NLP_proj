I wore red 'cause you liked that
You're like hey, let me get that
But when I text, you don't text back,
No you didn't 'cause you didn't care.
Well the game makes me crazy
It's like yes, no maybe,
And you're calling me baby,
When I know that you just don't care
Oh oh
Sayin' that I'll quit but that's just not true
Like w-whoa whoa
I say I don't like it but you know I do
'Cause
You make me feel so right,
Even if it's so wrong
I wanna scream out loud
Boy but I just bite my tongue
This one's for the girls, messin' with boys
Like he's the melody and she's background noise
Baby why can't you see
It feels so good, but you're so bad for me
I always want what I can't have
Give it all, never get half
You're like girl where you been at
And I really wanna just not care
But
Whoa whoa
Sayin' that I'll quit but that's just not true
Like w-whoa whoa
I say I don't like it but you know I do
'Cause
You make me feel so right,
Even if it's so wrong
I wanna scream out loud
Boy but I just bite my tongue
This one's for the girls, messin' with boys
Like he's the melody and she's background noise
Baby why can't you see
It feels so good, but you're so bad for me
And I'm dying tonight
Trying to hide, hide
What I'm feeling, I'm feeling like I'm
Dying tonight
I'll keep it inside
When I say hello, should be saying goodbye
Like
You make me feel so right,
Even if it's so wrong
I wanna scream out loud
Boy but I just bite my tongue
This one's for the girls, messin' with boys
Like he's the melody and she's background noise
Baby why can't you see
It feels so good, but you're so bad for me
