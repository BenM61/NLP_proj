Every now and then, I wake up
In different rooms,
Light a cigarette, strawberry
Tea, and sing the blues.
Somehow I tend to leave behind
The tears and the truths,
And just forget, that I
Can't get over you.
Every now and then it just all
Remains the same.
We try to move ahead but get held back
In the game; somehow now I'm livin'
In the past.
I'm still with you, please don't forget,
'Cause this ain't over yet.
I'll be here, changin' the moods.
I'll straighten out my head'n all the foolish things I do.
And I'll be here changin' the moods, yeah.
Only 'cause I need the time, so I can get back to you.
I'll be changin' the moods.
Every now and then I seem to do nothing but wrong.
I blame it on my pride, yet that as such, is almost gone.
Every day there's choices to be made,
And memories are lingering, the future seems to fade.
Somehow now I'm livin' in the past.
I'm still with you, please don't forget,
'Cause this ain't over yet.
I'll be here.
