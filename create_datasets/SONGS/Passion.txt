Baby I'm so sorry I'm late
Its been such a long day
I went to go get my nails done,
I went shopping
And I'm in love with these shoes
I cant wait for you too see me with them on
(your welcome)
I'm so happy to see you
(your welcome)

How was your day?
Come in
Relax
Let your hair down
Please
(OK)
For me, for me, for me

Ooh you are so fine
So happy your mine (my girl)
Your presence is a gift and I don't wanna waste no time

So tell me what you need and I got it
Material or is it physical, 
Sexual, intellectual, let me know
Girl I been waiting all day 
And all night for you to come get back, in my life
You play a special part
And I'm giving you all my heart
(Will you give him yours, I'm asking?)
(And if I'm giving you that passion)
(Say that you'll forever be my baby)
(A nigga got me feeling so crazy)
I never wanna think about the next girl
Cause you made me forget about my ex girl
