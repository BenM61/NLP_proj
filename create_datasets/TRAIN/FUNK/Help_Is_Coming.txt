Situation could be much better
Much better than today
You know that you could do much better
Much better than you do today
But how come you never try to change situation
How come you always escape
Out of a serious conversation
Don't you know it can't never be too late
For us to succeed
Out of every misery
You can be released
As long as you believe

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be released
For us to be released

Your lifestyle could be so different
From how it is right now
Know that you could change so many things
If only you want that
You should know it can't never be too late
Just get up and try
And if you fall and wonder why
Just try an other time
But don't give up to fight

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be released
For us to be released

You're always looking for a scapegoat
Like everything is their fault
And never ever you gonna say maybe I did mistake
I black and white sky
Never you gonna say why
Like you know everything in what they say just can't be right
How come you never change
How come you always failed in everything you did before back then until today

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be released
For us to be released
