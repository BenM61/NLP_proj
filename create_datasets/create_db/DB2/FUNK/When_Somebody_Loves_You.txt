When somebody loves you, you feel it in your heart
When somebody loves you, you know it from the start
Every kiss becomes more than a kiss
Each look, each touch they mean so much
And that's when you discover how it feels to be a lover

When somebody loves you, it shows in every smile
When somebody loves you, your life becomes worthwhile
Always caring, always sharing everything you do
When somebody loves you like I love you

(When somebody loves you, it shows in every smile)
(When somebody loves you, your life becomes worthwhile)
Always caring, always sharing everything you do
When somebody loves you like I love you
