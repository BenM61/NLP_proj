I see the time
Hands, they're tickin' by me every day
Fallin' in love
While I feel your love is slippin' away

But if you should fall I'll be there to catch you
In 40 years I could never miss you
Baby I'll be there for you
But first you got to, got to let me know

How deep is your love? Are you willin' to go?
Ever an' every extra mile to show that you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love with you baby doll

You are my savior
Got me through my deepest darkness, girl
And I still love you
But I feel your love is leavin' my world

Now don't you remember you used to hold me
When you said you'd never leave me?
Women, it doesn't feel the same anymore
So baby please just let me know

How deep is your love? Are you willin' to go?
Ever an' every extra mile to show that you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love with you baby doll

How deep is your love? Are you willin' to go?
Ever an' every extra mile to show that you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love with you baby doll

How deep is your love? Are you willin' to go?
Ever an' every extra mile to show that you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love with you baby doll

How deep is your love? Are you willin' to go?
Ever an' every extra mile to show that you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love with you baby doll

How deep is your love? Are you willin' to go?
Ever an' every extra mile to show that you're fallin' in love
Like I am fallin' deeper in love with you baby doll

All I wanted, all I ever needed was you babe, oh oh
All I wanted, all I ever needed was you babe, oh oh
All I wanted, all I ever needed was you babe, oh oh
All I wanted, all I ever needed was you babe, oh oh
