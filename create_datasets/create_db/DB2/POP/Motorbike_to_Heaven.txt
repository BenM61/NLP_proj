I'm gonna drive my motorbike to heaven
I'm gonna slice a lemon in two
And when the charcoal's burning bright
We'll be there, in heaven
I'm gonna fly my motorbike to you

I don't know why
But I've got a good idea that 
We'll meet again some day
It makes me cry
There's a memory of you 
Standing in the woods
And then they sigh
'Cause they've got a good idea 
That my hair is full of ferns

I'm gonna shine my hair in blooms
Because my mind is full of you
I think I'm gonna dust my room
'Cause there's a notice in my head
I'm gonna shine my bike instead
'Cause that's what the notice said
I'm gonna shine my hair in blooms

I don't know why
But I've got a good idea that 
We'll meet again some day
It makes me cry
You're standing on a yacht and 
I don't know what to say
I dreamt last night
We were playing kiss and tell then 
I watched you fly away

Well there's a diamond in my car
And it's shining like a star
I feel I'm coming home to you
'Cause there's a message in my soup
And it could be like yesterday
I wish you'd never gone away
And it's shining like a star
I feel I'm coming home to you
