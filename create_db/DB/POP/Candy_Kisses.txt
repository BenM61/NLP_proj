Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses wrapped in paper you'd rather have them any old time

You don't mean it when you whisper those sweet love words in my ear
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dear

I built a castle
Out of dreams, dear
I thought that you
Were building one too

Now my castles
All have fallen
And I am left
Alone and blue

Once my heart was filled with gladness now there's sadness only tears
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dear
