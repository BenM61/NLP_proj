Absolute, on power drive
I need you so to keep me alive
Absolute, I long for you
A girl to make a dream come true
Oh baby understand

Absolute, on power drive
I need you so to keep me alive
Absolute, I long for you
A girl to make a dream come true
Absolute, a principal
To make your heart invincible
To love (do do-do-do)

(Ooh love you)
(Ooh love you)
(Ooh and I love you)
(Ooh and I love you)

Holy girl your lips of clay
Will whisper words of yesterday
Holy girl my paramour
I know too much to be so sure
Holy girl you kiss away
The meaning of the working day
For love (do do-do-do)

(Ooh love you)
(Ooh love you)
(Ooh and I love you)
(Ooh and I love you)

Where the words are worn away
We live to love another day
Where the words are hard 'n fast
We talk of nothing new but the past

(Ooh love you)
(Ooh love you)
(Ooh and I love you)
(Ooh and I love you)

Where the words are vodka clear
Forgetfulness has brought us near
Absolute, a principal
To make your heart invincible
To love (near)
To love (oh)
To love

(Love you) love you
(Love, love you)

(Love) absolute
(Love you) love you
(Love)
(Love you)

(Love) absolute
(Love you) love you
(Love)
(Love you)

(Love) absolute
(Love you) love you
(Love)
(Love you)

(Love) absolute
(Love you) love you
(Love)
(Love you)
