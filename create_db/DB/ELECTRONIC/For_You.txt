Can we meet on the street
Maybe tomorrow
See the world at our feet
Naked and hollow
I'll lead the climb, crystal and fine
For you to see
With every step that I take
Every rule that you make

Stay with me
In this foreign land
Just long enough for me
To make you understand

You could be my guiding light
The darkest of them all
You'd be the rise before my fall
And yet we both

Get along fine
Better than most
Some of the time
When I'm with you

I am on fire
You are the fuel
And my desire

Can we meet on the street
Maybe tomorrow
See the world at our feet
Naked and hollow

I'll even climb, [unknown]
For you to see
With every step that I take
Every rule that you make

What do you bring
What I can't possess
You always ask for more
Until there's nothing left

These hollow words
Make a wrong arrest
They beat upon my door
A spirit haunts forever more

But still I hope
And sometimes I pray
It won't be hard
We'll find a way

Color my dream
Show me I'm real
Turn on the light
Then let me feel

Can we meet on the street
Maybe tomorrow
See the world at our feet
Naked and hollow

I'll lead the climb, crystal and fine
For you to see
With every step that I take
Every rule that you make
