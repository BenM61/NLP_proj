Can We All Come Together
You are what you are
I am what I am
Can we all come together
With some kind of plan

I want you to laugh
But you want me to cry
Can we all come together
Hey, why don't we try

Can we all come together
Can we reach across the sea
There are worlds in between us
The sky is all we see
So let's all come together
Let's all come together

Why do we like different things
And we live different ways
Can we come together
For happier days

I want you to smile
But you let me down
Can we come together
Let's do it right now

I see you live for the sun
I live for the rain
Can we come together
Can we be the same

I want to settle down
But you want to run
Can we come together
Can we be like one
