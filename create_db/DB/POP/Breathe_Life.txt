I wouldn't compliment myself for what I've become
Tell her I owe it to her
Tell her I owe it to her
I wouldn't praise myself for every good thing I've done
Tell her I owe it to her
Tell her I owe it to her

Tell her I owe it to every heartbeat
Tell her I owe it to every exhale
Tell her I owe it to, owe it to her
Hands upon my chest

Oh, won't you breathe life into these dead lungs I keep under my coat oh oh oh
And keep life warm against the cold night as our bodies grow old oh oh oh

I donâ€™t want to give up and I know when to breathe
Believe me, I owe it to her
Tell her I owe it to her

Tell her I owe it to every heartbeat
Tell her I owe it to every inhale
Tell her I owe it to, owe it to her
Hands upon my chest

Oh, won't you breathe life into these dead lungs I keep under my coat oh oh oh
And keep life warm against the cold night as our bodies grow old oh oh oh
Oh, won't you breathe life into these dead lungs I keep under my coat oh oh oh
And keep life warm against the cold night as our bodies grow old oh oh oh

Take my silence as a warning
I will not deter your mourning

Take my silence as a warning
I will not deter your mourning

Oh, won't you breathe life into these dead lungs I keep under my coat oh oh oh
And keep life warm against the cold night as our bodies grow old oh oh oh
Oh, won't you breathe life into these dead lungs I keep under my coat oh oh oh
And keep life warm against the cold night as our bodies grow old oh oh oh
(Won't you breathe life into these dead lungs I keep under my coat oh oh oh)
(And keep life warm against the cold night as our bodies grow old oh oh oh)
