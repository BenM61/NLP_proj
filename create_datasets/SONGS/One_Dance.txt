Baby I like your style

Grips on your legs
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
OT, OT is never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

And that's why I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need to know where do you wanna go
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Cause if you're down

I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
