Hello, everybody
It's TV-Time! Off we go
I've got a holster for my gun
Silver spurs on my boots
I'll be ready when they come
God help the first one that shoots!
I guess I'll never change
'Cause I was born on the range

Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians

Heyup!

I won't make Custer's mistake
He didn't finish all his beans
Sometimes I get the shakes
Wish I was back in New Orleans
I guess I'll never change
'Cause I was born on the range

Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians

Hands up! Golly!
Howdy, pardner
I guess I'll never change
'Cause I was born on the range
Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians
Oh, no, we don't stand a chance!
This could be my last stand
War paint and colors everywhere
Aw, shucks! My Winny just did jam!
No Redskin's gonna trim my hair!
I guess I'll never change
'Cause I was born on the range

Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians

Now tell them the true story
Cowboys and Indians
How the west was really won

Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians
Cowboys and Indians
