Gimme a beat!

Sittin' in the movie show, thinkin' nasty thoughts, huh
Better be a gentleman, or you turn me off, huh
That's right,
a-let me tell it

Nasty Nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty Nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys!

I don't like no nasty car, I don't like a nasty food, huh (Oh oh yeah)
The only nasty thing I like is the nasty groove, huh
Will this one do?
Uhuh, I know Sing

Oh you nasty boys
Nasty Nasty boys, don't ever change, huh

So close the door if you want me to respond (Oh oh yeah)
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is Control
