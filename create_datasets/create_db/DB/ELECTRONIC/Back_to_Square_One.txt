Let all things be undone 
Live my life one more time 
Take me back to square one 
There is a state that I must find 

Which road do I take back to square one 
Which wall do I break back to square one 
Which road do I take back to square one 
Tell me which wall do I break back to square one 

Give me a clue 
Every day, every hour 
I,ve gone through in my mind 
Despite all my will power 
There is a place I cannot find 

Which road do I take back to square one 
Which wall do I break back to square one 
Which road do I take back to square one 
Just tell me which wall do I break back to square one 

Give me a clue now 
Will I ever reach our destination 
And if I do, will I make it in time? 
Gotta find a way before the day is over 

Let all things be undone 
Live my life one more time 
Take me back to square one 
Back to when everything was fine 

Which road do I take back to square one 
Which wall do I break back to square one 
Which road do I take back to square one 
Just tell me which wall do I break back to square one 

Show me the way to the road I seek 
And then the way to the wall to break down 
Cause I don't know which way to go 
Back to square one 

Show me the way to the road I seek 
And then the way to the wall to break down 
Cause I don't know which way to go 
Back to square one 

(Won't you tell me) Which road do I take back to square one 
Which wall do I break back to square one 
Which road do I take back to square one 
Won't you tell me which wall do I break back to square one 

Give me a clue now
