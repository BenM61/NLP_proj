Oh if I could touch you
It'd be a once in a life time dream come true
And oh, if I could have you
Just one night, just one time

But I know I'll never get the chance
I'll never get a second glance

Never in a million years
Never in a thousand tears
If I could ever hold you
I'd never let go
Never in a million years

Oh, I need you
If you could only see inside my heart
Oh, to be near you
Close enough to reach and touch
And I thought it over in my mind
If I could walk across the bridge of time

Never in a million years
Never in a thousand tears
If I could ever hold you
I'd never let go
Never in a million years

But I know I'll never never never get the chance
I'll never get a second glance

Never in a million years
Never in a thousand tears
If I could ever hold you
I'd never let go
Never in a million years
Never
Never in a million years
Never in a thousand tears
If I could ever hold you
I'd never let go
Never in a million years
