I hear a heart beat
It's ringing out across the Universe
It sounds so lost and lonely
Must come from somewhere deep inside of us

And the operator says
"All is calm and all is quiet
Close your eyes, sleep tonight"

This is the world calling
This is earth
This is the world calling
This is us

I'm on a train now
I'm moving through the yellow fields of rape
There's so much beauty
I wished that I believed enough to pray

Then the operator replied
"Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue
There's no one looks as good as you"

This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
This is us

This is the world calling
This is us
And it goes on and on

What we gonna to do because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me, come and get me because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me in your arms and baby keep me warm tonight

What we gonna to do because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me, come and get me because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me in your arms and baby keep me warm tonight

This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
This is us

This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
God help us
And it goes on and on

Where all is calm and all is quiet
Close your eyes, sleep tonight
(This is the world )
All is calm and all is quiet
Close your eyes, sleep tonight
(This is the world calling)

All is calm and all is quiet
(Incomprehensible)
(This is the world calling)

(This is the world calling)
(Incomprehensible) and that is you
There's no one else as good as you
(This is the world calling)
World calling
