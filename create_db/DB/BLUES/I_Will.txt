Wait while I see
If this is something I can do
If this is something I can be
'Cause I have never tried

To show you who I really am
Without telling you lies
And don't hestitate
Am standing on the edge of something
Am just too numb to know what it is

[Chorus]
If I can give it to you
You know I will
If I can give it to you
You know I will
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
And show you things that words can't do

Wait while I breathe
'Cause this is something that I still
Have not fully concieved
And you just don't know

The way this whole things turned on me
And I just can't let go
And don't make me wait
Your hanging on the edge of something
Am just too numb to know what it is.

[Chorus]

So there you go again
'Cause I see what you want
'Cause you want what you don't
In time things will work out right
So you say that I can wait
I can wait
I can wait.

If I can give it to you
You know I will
If I can give it to you
You know I will

I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you

If I can give it to you,
Then I will give it to you,
I just want to...
I will give it to you... to you...
