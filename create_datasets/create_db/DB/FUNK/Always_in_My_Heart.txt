(Brian HollandLamont DozierEdward Holland, Jr.) 
Gone is your smiling face
'Cause you're not around anymore
But the sound of your laughter
Still fills this empty place
'Cause you're always in my heart

Gone is the tender way
You used to whisper
How much you care
But the sound of your whisper
Still echoes lovely in the air
'Cause you're always in my heart

Though I removed
Your picture from the wall
Nothing's changed
For your image still remains

In my heart from you
It can't seem to part
Though gone is your warm embrace
But your memory
I can't erase

'Cause you're always in my heart
'Cause you're always in my heart
'Cause you're always in my heart
