Love befall from the apple tree
none have (verve?) left to come to me
(thus fallen, I turned around)
A good fair distance
bringing my presents
dressed like I had been
seeing the woman
seeing the woman
(finally, eyes familiar) 
With her bandaged face
she was mystery
with the falling leaves 
Wish these idiots 
would leave me the space
to bear my homage
to his prickly face

Love befall from the apple tree
Energy creates energy

Transmit to all of you is what I wanna do
What I want to do: not work but transmit
To transmit what i want

I have thought about being (nature's ????)
But I am worried about the health risks
Those who work but don't earn
Those who earn and don't work
(we want peace of the senses)
She could be my friend
??(And the jealous end)??
She was mystery
Of the (fallen?) rain

Transmit to all of you is what I wanna do
What I want to do: not work but transmit
To transmit what i want.
