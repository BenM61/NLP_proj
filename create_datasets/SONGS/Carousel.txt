See her walking alone in this city of heartache and stone 
She finds her way down to where she once found all her dreams she doesn't understand 
Why something she'd given her heart to could die 
But that's just the way it works out they say it's alright 

She's coming back down 
This carousel ride has stopped spinning round 
She wants to say she's sorry and stay but it's too late 
Now this carousel ride has shut down 

Fingertips trace the lines pens and papers recall the good times 
But clocks they do run and change what's been done say goodbye 

She's coming back down 
This carousel ride has stopped spinning round 
She wants to say she's sorry and stay but it's too late 
Now this carousel ride has shut down 

(Bridge)

And I want you to come with me tonight 
I don't know if it's real but it surely feels right 

She's coming back down 
This carousel ride has stopped spinning round 
She wants to say she's sorry and stay but it's too late 
Now this carousel ride has shut down
