Oh yeah, see I can’t work it out

Oh jeez, you tease, you're pretty much everything that I need
Good flirt, nice shirt, I can feel I'm gonna fall head first
Golden skin, cute grin, saying all the right things
And then you hit me from my number, babe
But then you go and call me mate, what?

All the things I like, but I guess I have to say goodbye
Until I figure it all

Are you into me boy or are you into someone else?
Like maybe that boy, cause you know I never can tell, ooh boy
I really wanna be your girl so I gotta know know know know
Cause you’re hanging around with him bare
Oooah oooah, what you want boy?
Oooah oooah

See you looking at me
It's kinda like you're checkin' my clothes
Don't care what's underneath
Just wanna know where I got them from, hmm
Mistook that look, I should've known it was all too good
To be true, me and you, oh were a fool

Are you into me boy or are you into someone else?
Like maybe that boy, cause you know I never can tell, ooh boy
I really wanna be your girl so I gotta know know know know
Cause you’re hanging around with him bare
Oooah oooah, what you want boy?
Oooah oooah, did I get you wrong?
Oooah oooah, what you want boy?
Oooah oooah

I was blinded took me so long to see
You ain't interested in knowing like me
All this time thinking how good this could be
I just couldn't believe that you were

You weren't into me boy, you were into someone else
Oh and it's that boy, but you know I never can tell
Oooh boy, totally wanted to be your girl
And now I know, know, know, know, know
Why you're hanging around with him bare
Oooah oooah, what you want boy?
Oooah oooah, did I get you wrong?
Oooah oooah, what you want boy?
Oooah oooah, and that's it
