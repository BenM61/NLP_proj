Well look here Jack
There's something down the track
He's got rhythm in his feet
But nothing in the sack
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa
Comes to town every Christmas day

Well he lives up in a mountain
Like a hermit in the cave
He never had a haircut
He never took a shave
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa
Comes this time every Christmas day

Well it's rock rock rock Mister Santa
Jump jump jump Mister Santa
Well the boogie woogie Santa Will boogie all your blues away

Got no presents for your tree
No Candy for your socks
When he starts to boogie
The whole town rocks

Mama get your hat
Put your best dress on
We're gonna jump for joy
On the Christmas morn'
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Boogie all your blues away

Well it's rock rock rock Mister Santa
Jump jump jump Mister Santa
Well the boogie woogie Santa Will boogie all your blues away
