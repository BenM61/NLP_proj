And to think
All along
I was lost
But not alone
Now I've crossed
To the unknown
And I'm looking for a way back home
A way back home

Where does this door go
I haven't been through
It's not feeling normal
What do I do?
And after all
I thought that I knew
Where does this door go?

I haven't been through
I haven't been through
I haven't been through
I haven't been through

And to think
All this time
I played it straight
On the line
Took a step
To the side
Now I'm looking for a place to hide
A place to hide

But where does this door go
I haven't been through
It's not feeling normal
What do I do?
And after all
I thought that I knew
Where does this door go?

I haven't been through
I haven't been through
I haven't been through
I haven't been through

Where does this door go
I haven't been through
It's not feeling normal
What do I do?
And after all
I thought that I knew
Where does this door go?

I haven't been through
I haven't been through
I haven't been through
I haven't been through
