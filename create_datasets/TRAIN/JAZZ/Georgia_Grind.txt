Papa, papa, just look at this
Out in the backyard, shakin' like this
Doin' that Georgia Grind
That old Georgia Grind

Now everybody's ravin' 'bout that old Georgia Grind

I can shake it East
And I can shake it West
But way down South I can shake it best
Doin' the Georgia Grind
I's just doin' the Georgia Grind

Everybody's talkin' 'bout that old Georgia Grind

Come in here, gal; come in here right now
I see you're tryin' to be bad, but if you don't know how
You do the Georgia Grind
Oh, the Georgia Grind

Everybody's tryin'
To do the Georgia Grind

Well, old Miss Jones was in second place
She did the Georgia Grind through a stick of waste
She did the Georgia Grind
She went crazy 'bout that Georgia Grind

Now everybody's ravin' 'bout that old Georgia Grind
