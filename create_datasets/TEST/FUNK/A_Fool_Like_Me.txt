Liars talk and fools like me believe
I keep hanging on where love is gone
Trusting along
Now liars like to see a fool like me

Love is lost but fools like me don't see
I don't realize at all those lies
Get surprised
When love cease to be, a fool like me

I don't know, I don't care
I know there's somewhere
Some love is gonna be true
I'm gonna find her too

Such a course fools just can't conceal
How I cling to you, though we're through
What can I do?
Just to break free, a fool like me

But I don't care
I know somewhere
Some love is gonna be true
I'm gonna find her too

Liars talk and fools like me believe
I keep hanging on where love is gone
Trusting along
Now liars like to see a fool like me, a fool like me
