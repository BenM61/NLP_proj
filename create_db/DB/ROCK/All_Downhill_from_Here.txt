You're hiding something, 'cause it's burning through your eyes
I try to get it out but all I hear from you are lies
I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were writing out your part
Once again we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end.

Catalyst you exist to pull me down,
You contradict the fact that you still want me around,
And its all downhill from here,
And its all downhill from here

Your good intentions slowly turn to bitterness
Reoccurring episodes with each and every kiss
I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were writing out your part
Once again we're playing off emotions
Which one of us will burn until the end.

Catalyst you exist to pull me down,
You contradict the fact that you still want me around,
And its all downhill from here,
And its all downhill from here

I can't believe you pulled it off again
I'm running till it all sets in
You'll deny it till you're at your bitter end
I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were writing out your part
Once again we're playing off emotions
Which one of us will burn until the end.

Catalyst you exist to pull me down,
You contradict the fact that you still want me around,
And its all downhill from here,
And its all downhill from here

(And you keep pulling me down)
Pulling me down pulling me down
Catalyst you exist to pull me down,
You contradict the fact that you still want me around,
And its all downhill from here,
And its all downhill from here
