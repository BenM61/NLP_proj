You came with your troubled eyes
Oh, and the push and pull of love's desires
You came with your easy smile
Oh, and your pretty words like coloured birds fly away

I don't wanna burn for you
I don't wanna yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet

When you leave you leave no clues
So I reinvent the things you meant
All of this undeclared charade
Keeps me so unsure, always wanting more every day

I don't wanna burn for you
I don't wanna yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet

You stay to say the things you say
A long embrace, you walk away
And now my eyes are full of light
As I pretend that it's okay

I don't wanna burn for you
I don't wanna yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet

I don't wanna burn for you (I don't want to burn for you)
I don't wanna yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet

I would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet (Know that I would lose myself)
