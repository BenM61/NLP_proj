Say hey
If you're always buyin' drink and smoke
You'll go broke
Just give it away
Cause you know you can't take it to the grave

Say hey
When you're holdin' on to too many keys
That's just greed
Keep makin' that sound
Ching ching
Money makes the world go
Round and round, round and round

Money makes the world go
Round and round
Say hey
Ching ching
Money makes the world go
Round and round, round and round and round

Say hey
Why you always spend your money so fast
It won't last
Just give it away
'Cause you know you can't take it to the grave

Say hey
When you're holdin' on to too many keys
That's just greed
Keep makin' that sound
Ching ching
Money makes the world go
Round and round, round and round

Money makes the world go
Round and round
Say hey
Ching ching
Money makes the world go
Round and round, round and round and round

Say hey
If you don't know by now
Money makes the world go round
'Cause you know you can't take it to the grave

Say hey
Gotta have some self control
Whatcha gonna do
When you get old
Ching ching
Money makes the world go
Round and round, round and round and round

Say hey
