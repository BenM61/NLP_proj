City, city of Satan
City, city of Satan 

Oh let me tell you 'bout a city known as Satan
City, city of Satan
Where all the people look so good you gotta hate them
City, city of Satan 

But when you feel it and your blood runs hot
You gotta keep on rockin', give it what you got
In the city, city of Satan
In the city, city of Satan 

A thousand years of lies and still they gotta fake it
City, city of Satan
You gotta wear a mask if you want to make it
City, city of Satan 

But when you feel it and your blood runs hot
You gotta keep on rockin', give it what you got
In the city, city of Satan
City, city of Satan 

You don't really want to go there
You don't really want to make it, go home
Put your make up on, make your hair real pretty
And meet me tonight down in Satan's city 

Oh Satan city boy I gave you all my leather 
(yes I did)
Oh Satan city man you gave me stormy weather 

But when you feel it and your blood runs hot
You gotta keep on rockin', give it what you got
In the city, city of Satan
City, city of Satan
Everybody now!
City, city of Satan
Everybody now!
City, city of Satan 

You don't really want to go there
You don't really want to make it, go home
Put your make up on, make your hair real pretty
And meet me tonight down in Satan's city 

Spend the night forever!
