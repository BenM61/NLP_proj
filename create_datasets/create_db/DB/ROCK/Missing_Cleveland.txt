You were dressed up at the bar
They expected us to fall from the heavens
It's only seven, they were monkeys all of them
Entertainment summer stain
Wondering whether, it's now or never

Strapped into the monkey scene
Like a Martian chimpanzee
Love you more than ever
When you broke my laws

You're holding on but letting go
I'm missing Cleveland and the snow
And lonely thoughts where everybody
Knows the truth and lets it be

We'll have a dream and you don't care
At least it seems so when you're there
What really hurts these sometimes lonely
When your feet are on the ground

There was you and there was me like the perfect family
Thought we'd always live forever
One and one and one makes three
And in change a glass of pain
Glad we got it truly toxic

Strapped into the monkey scene
Like a Martian chimpanzee
Love you more than ever
When you broke my laws

You're holding on but letting go
I'm missing Cleveland and the snow
The lonely thoughts where everybody
Knows the truth and lets it be

We'll have a dream and you don't care
At least it seems so when you're there
What really hurts these sometimes lonely
When your feet are on the ground

Once again I am alone, now I'm older
Never meant to let you go, no

You're holding on but letting go
I'm missing Cleveland and the snow
The lonely thoughts where everybody
Knows the truth and lets it be

We'll have a dream and you don't care
At least it seems so when you're there
What really hurts is sometimes lonely
When your feet are on the ground
