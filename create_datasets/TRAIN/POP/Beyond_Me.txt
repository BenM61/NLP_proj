Call it a reason to retreat 
I got some dreams that are bigger than me
I might be outmatched outsized the underdog in the fight of my life 
Is it so crazy to believe

That you gave me the stars put them out of my reach
Call me to waters a little to deep
Oh I've never been so aware of my need
You keep on making me see
It's way beyond me
It's way beyond me
Yeah it's out of my league 
It's way beyond me 
It's way beyond me 
It's way beyond

Anything that I got the strength to do
In over my head keeps me countin' on you
I'm leaving the sweet spot sure shot tradin' it all for the plans you got
Is it so crazy to believe 

That you gave me the stars put them out of my reach
Call me to waters a little to deep
Oh I've never been so aware of my need
You keep on making me see
It's way beyond me
It's way beyond me
Yeah it's out of my league 
It's way beyond me 
It's way beyond me 

You take me to the place where I know I need You
Straight to the depths that I can't handle on my own
And Lord I know, I know I need You
So take me to Your great
Take me to Your great unknown

It's way beyond me, way way beyond me
It's it's way beyond me, way way way beyond me

Yeah, You gave me the stars, put them out of my reach
Called me to waters just a little too deep
Oh, I've never been so aware of my need
Yeah, you keep on making me see
It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me)
It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me)
Yeah, it's out of my league (it's way beyond me)
It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me)
It's way beyond me (it's way beyond me)
It's way beyond me

You take me to the place where I know I need You
Straight to the depths that I can't handle on my own (it's way beyond me)
You take me to the place where I know I need You
Oh take me to Your place
Take me to Your great unknown
