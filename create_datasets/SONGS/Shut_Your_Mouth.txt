The only thing I ever wanted
The only thing I ever needed
Is my own way, I gotta have it all

I don't want your opinion, I don't need your ideas
Stay the f*ck out of my face, stay away from me
I am my own God, I do as I please

Just wipe your own ass and shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down
Shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around

My mind is playing tricks on me
I am not as stable as I used to be
Pushed and shoved, you know you're going too far

I will not break my back for you no more
I am gonna go my way, I am gonna take control
Time to wake up and dig myself out of this hell

Just wipe your own ass and shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down
Shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around
Shut your mouth

You're getting what your ego deserves
Shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around

Shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down
Shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around

Shut your mouth, shut your mouth, shut your mouth
