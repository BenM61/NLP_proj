Eventually your penalty will be to hurt as I do
Eventually my memory ah my memory will haunt the dreams of you
This look I'm wearing it's called a frown
But it was a smile till you turned it upside down
I'd hate to see I'd hate to see you feel like me but this will be
Eventually my memory will haunt the dreams of you

Oh oh this look I'm wearing its called a frown
But it use to be a smile till you turned it upside down
I'd hate to see you feel like me but baby this will be
Eventually my memory ah my memory will haunt the dreams of you
