Why baby why don't you treat me (why, baby, why)
Like you used to do (why, baby, why)
Why, baby, baby don't you need me (why, baby, why)
Like I'm needing you

If you need love and affection (why, baby, why)
Come to my loving arms (why, baby, why)
I'll be your shield and protection (why, baby, why)
I won't do ya no harm

There will be no trouble and strife
I'll be your slave the rest of my life
I offer you my heart and soul
Wrapped up in a bag of gold

Why, baby, why do you tease me (why, baby, why)
Won't you please be fair (why, baby, why)
Why, baby, why won't you please me (why, baby, why)
When you know you care

There will be no trouble and strife
