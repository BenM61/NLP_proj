Oh, yeah 
Mmm 
Still don't know what I was waitin' for 
And my time was runnin' wild 
A million dead end streets and 
Every time I thought I'd got it made 
It seemed the taste was not so sweet 
So I turned myself to face me 
But I've never caught a glimpse of 
How the others must see the faker 
I'm much too fast to take that test 
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-ch-changes 
Don't want to be a richer man 
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-ch-changes 
Just gonna have to be a different man 
Time may change me 
But I can't trace time 
Mmm, yeah I watch the ripples change their size 
But never leave the stream 
Of warm impermanence 
So the days float through my eyes 
But still the days seem the same 
And these children that you spit on 
As they try to change their worlds 
Are immune to your consultations 
They're quite aware of what they're goin' through 
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-ch-changes 
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it 
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-ch-changes 
Where's your shame? 
You've left us up to our necks in it 
Time may change me 
But you can't trace time 
Strange fascination, fascinatin' 
Ah, changes are takin' 
The pace I'm goin' through 
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-ch-changes 
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers 
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes 
Turn and face the strange 
Ch-ch-changes 
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older 
Time may change me 
But I can't trace time I said that time may change me 
But I can't trace time
