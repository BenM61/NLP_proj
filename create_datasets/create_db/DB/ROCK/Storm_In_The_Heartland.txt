The leaves on the tree are turnin' inside out
From the Great White North there's a big black cloud
Run for shelter if you can
There's a storm in the heartland

We made it through the flood of '93
But this is gonna be the death of me
I can't hide the tears of a desperate man
There's a storm in the heartland

She's leavin' me just like a restless wind
And I can see my world is comin' to an end
Like the sounds of thunder empty words ring out again
There's a storm in the heartland
There's a storm in the heartland

The love she gave was like a breath of spring
Sweet and pure as a mountain stream
I couldn't see the danger close at hand
There's a storm in the heartland

She's leavin' me just like a restless wind
And I can see my world is comin' to an end
Like the sounds of thunder empty words ring out again
There's a storm in the heartland
There's a storm in the heartland

There's a storm in the heartland
