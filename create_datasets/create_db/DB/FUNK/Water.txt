Funny how a blessing feels just like a curse
Bad lovers but somehow good love hurts me worse
'Cause lately I'm mistakin' honey for the bees
Havin' trouble sleepin' with you next to me

I sink in you like water
Pray you won't pull me under
One look and I die
Heaven in your eyes
Hell hot in the white lies
I dive in you like water
I sink like a
Stone in your water
Stone in your water

Tell the truth, you know you cannot keep me safe
There's more pain in love than we could find in hate
Lately I've been keepin' honey from the bees
So if you ever leave, at least it's bittersweet

I sink in you like water
Pray you won't pull me under
One look and I die
Heaven in your eyes
Hell hot in the white lies
I dive in you like water
I sink like a
Stone in your water
Stone in your water

Stone in your water
Stone in your water

Be gentle with me
Have patience with me
Oh, 'cause I've been in the corner
Of my mind that tells me
I'm not good enough
For anybody like you
Help me out
You know I need you like water (I do)

Stone in your water
Stone in your water
Stone in your water
Stone in your water
