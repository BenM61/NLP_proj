Phantom legs and Blinking Pigs
Haunting me
My long lost love
And the memories of
You

These nights are haunting
I don't  want to run I don't want to leave
Now that your standing closer
I don't want to Run don't want to leave

Was a distant moan
And a smell of home
Haunting me
From the clouds above
Oh the memory of
You

Thou these nights are haunting me
I don't want to run I don't want to leave
Now that your standing closer
I don't want to run I don't want to leave
