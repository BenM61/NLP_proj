(Rainfall)...

Like to know whats..going on
In this world we're living on
There's so much poverty all around me
This insanity that surrounds me
there's the world that seem so far away
Peoples lives changing everyday

[Chorus: x4]
OOh no
I can hear the rainfall 

Like to know when you and I
Will stop walking and passing by
So much ignorance that my eyes see
And my experience cannot blind me
'Tis the world seems so far from here
Seasons change and the rain is near

[Chorus]

Like to find a new reality
Something more than this fantasy
No more false streams
No more mind games

I can even see through this dark frame
There's the world seems so far away
Peoples lives changing everyday

[Chorus]
