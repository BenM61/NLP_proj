Brothers, sisters
Listen to what I say
Moanin' and groanin'
Won't drive those blues away
Lift up your voices in song
You know you've all done wrong

You sinners, drop everything
And let that harmony ring
Up to Heaven
And sing, you sinners

Just wave your arms all about
And let the Lord hear you shout
Pour the music right out
And sing, you sinners

Whenever there's music
The Devil kicks
He don't allow music
By the river Styx

You're wicked and you're depraved
And you've all misbehaved
If you wanna be saved
Well, sing, you sinners

Well, up until now
I've been asking you singers to sing
But if you can't sing, dance
C'mon band, swing

Swing, swing, swing
Swing, you sinners
Swing, swing, swing
Swing, you sinners

Whenever there's music
The Devil kicks
He don't allow music
By the river Styx

You're wicked and you're depraved
And you've all misbehaved
If you wanna be saved
If you wanna be saved
Well, sing, you sinners
