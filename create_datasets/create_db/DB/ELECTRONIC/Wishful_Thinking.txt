It's time we should talk about it
There's no secret kept in here
Forgive me for asking
Now wipe away your tears

And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

I sat on the roof
And watched the day go by
I see the likeness in his smile and the way he stands
Makes it all worthwhile

And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking

It's time we should talk about is
There's no secret kept in here
I see the likeness in his smile and the way he stands
Makes it all worthwhile

And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
And if I wish to stop it all
And if I wish to comfort the fall
It's just wishful thinking
