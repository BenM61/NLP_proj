You brought this upon yourself 
Don't try to pin this one on me tonight 
I give up at last I'm now a memory of your past 
I'll settle for the quiet type 
Oh tonight I'll get it right 
Hold your breath come and see we're coming closer 
Finally here we are alas how our days have come 
To pass hey brothers sisters lovers you are all I need
