I like noise, that's why I'm livin' where I am.
I like the noise and confusion of a traffic jam.
I like the sound of a jet as it's shakin' my dwellin'
I like ragin', rampagin' and screamin' and yellin'

Sound of a fire engine headed for a fire.
Emotions so high they can't get any higher
Goin' out of control in an outta hand crowd
I like noise and it's gotta be loud.

Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet
It was awfully quiet on the streets yesterday
People on the streets had little to say
Well I walked the streets and barely heard a sound

It was awfully quiet on the streets downtown.
Sometimes quiet's okay, sometimes quiet's alright.
Given the choice, I like noise, morning, noon, and night.
It was awfully quiet and on the trains last night.

People on the trains kept the conversation light.
I rode the trains and barely heard a word
Quietest train I ever heard.
Sometimes quiet's okay, sometimes quiet's alright.

Given the choice, I like noise, morning, noon, and night.
Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet
It was awfully quiet and I needed some noise
I got on the blower called up the boys

I was doing so bad I could barely hack it
They came to my house and they kicked up a racket
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah

They turned my place on its ear ooh
The boy's began to riot ah
It felt so good to hear ooh
On a day that was so quiet ah

I screamed and cheered them on ooh
And I helped out where I could ah
And when they all were gone ooh
I was feeling good!

Yeah it's gotta be loud
Oh yeah its gotta be loud
Come on its gotta be loud
From now on its gonna be loud oh yeah
