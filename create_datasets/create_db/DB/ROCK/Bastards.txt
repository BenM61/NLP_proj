Craig Leg broke his fuckin leg like a man
Drank a 40 ounce and he felt no pain
Gordy drank so much he forgot where his car was
So he drank some more and forgot where the bar was
When Big Jay fights he goes outta his mind
He likes to fight 4 or 5 guys at a time
We're bad boys and we're back in town
With D-Hodge at the wheel and Tim A. with the sound
We're bastards! Kings of rock & roll
Me Scotty, Craig, Jay, Gordy fuckin' roll into town after town with a trailer in tow
Scotty plays his drums till his hands fuckin bleed
Find him backstage with a bag full of weed
Rock and Roll isn't played by nice boys
Bastards play street punk rock and roll
We're bad boys, yea and we're back in town
With D-Hodge at the wheel and Tim A. with he sound
We're bastards! Kings of rock & roll
