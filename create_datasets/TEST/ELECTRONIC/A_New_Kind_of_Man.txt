He stepped out of the film again
Brushed off the dust and walked away
The touch of a hand was fading from him
A different scene began
A voice-over through scenes of sunrise
"It feels like someone's using my eyes"
Tinsel wind and curtains blowing
He looked down at his hands
He was a new kind of man
He was a new kind of man
He was a new kind, a new kind of man
He feels the rain upon his face
He's young again, nineteen again
Blue hills on a distant skyline
Someone took his hand
An underwater kind of silence
Humming of electric pylons
"Don't forget me" fades in static
Another scene began
He was a new kind of man
He was a new kind of man
He was a new kind, a new kind of man
He feels the rain upon his face
He's young again, nineteen again
Blue hills on a distant skyline
Someone took his hand
An underwater kind of silence
Humming of electric pylons
"Don't forget me" fades in static
Another scene began
Transparent faces from the old school
No-one to project them onto
He drives by 1958
And someone says his name
He waved out of the film again
He turned and he flickered and he walked away
He felt a distant kind of longing
Another scene began
He was a new kind of man
He was a new kind of man
He was a new kind, a new kind of man
He feels the rain upon his face
He's young again, nineteen again
Blue hills on a distant skyline
Someone took his hand
An underwater kind of silence
Humming of electric pylons
"Don't forget me" fades in static
Another scene began
Transparent faces from the old school
No-one to project them onto
He drives by 1958
And someone says his name
He waved out of the film again
He turned and he flickered and he walked away
He felt a distant kind of longing
Another scene began
