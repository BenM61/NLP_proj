I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time you're walking by my side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to happiness you've opened wide.

No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But, most of all I love you 'cause you're you.
