I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore
Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more
But the Master of the sea, heard my despairing cry
From the waters lifted me, now safe am I.
Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else could help, love lifted me
Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else could help, love lifted me.

All my heart to Him I'd give, ever to Him I'll cling
In His blessed presence live, ever His praises sing
Love so mighty and so true, merits my soul's best songs
Faithful, loving service too, to him belongs.
Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else could help, love lifted me
Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else could help, love lifted me.

Souls in danger, look above, Jesus completely saves
He will lift you by his love, out of the angry waves
He's the Master of the sea, billows his will obey
He your Savior wants to be, be saved today.
Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else could help, love lifted me
Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else could help, love lifted me
