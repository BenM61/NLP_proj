It's 2AM and I am trying to sleep
You told me "Lady, you were thinking of me"
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna live without it
You told me "Lady, you were thinking"

It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing

I always see you when I'm out on the street
I wanna talk and you appear on my screen
Dreaming like a broken record
Looping all you know forever
You told me "Lady, you were thinking"

It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing

We always play into
I love the way we move
(I love the way we move) heard your favorite record on the day before we met
Every time I hear it now I kinda start to swear (we always play)
Wanna call you over when I feel you getting closer (into)
Are you teasing me?

It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing

(It's a subtle thing)
(It's a subtle thing)
Such a subtle thing
