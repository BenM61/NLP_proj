Life has a billion problems
Try as you might to solve 'em
You won't resolve them all tonight
Relax, it's not your fault
You're such a fancy dancer
Problems are what you make them
You've got to take them with a glass of wine 
And a grain of salt

You gotta get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get into someone
Let yourself loose
Let yourself be
Let yourself see
Outside of yourself
Don't hide in yourself
Get outta yourself
Get into me

Start lookin' out the window
Stop lookin' in the mirror
Things'll look clearer if you give your brain the whole night off
You're not a desert island
Sure not a Robinson Crusoe
I'm into you so if you lose your mind you'll find right off

You gotta get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
And get into someone
Let yourself loose
Let yourself be
Let yourself see
In this side of yourself
That pride in yourself
Get outta yourself
And get into me

Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself

Up is the new direction
Love is the new sensation
More contemplation and you'll find you don't know how to walk

You gotta get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get into someone
Let yourself loose
Let yourself be
Let yourself see
That side of yourself
Don't hide in yourself
Get outta yourself
Get into

Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
And get into me

Get into me
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get into me
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get into me
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
Get into me
Get outta yourself
Get outta yourself
