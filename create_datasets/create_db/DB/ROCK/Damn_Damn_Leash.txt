You've got me on a leash, 
A damn damn leash
And its hard enough to be myself
You've got me on a leash,
A damn damn leash
And its hard enough to be myself,
Well I've got my problems over here,
You've got yours over there
And stop throwing shit on me because,
You know its not fair!

Stop dragging me around, around and around,
Because its hard enough to be my damn self!
Stop dragging me around, around and around,
Because its hard enough to be my damn self!

Around-around-around-around
Ah!!

Well I've got my problems over here,
You've got yours over there
And stop throwing shit on me because,
You know its not fair!
You've got me on a leash,
A damn damn leash
And its hard enough to be my damn self!
You've got me on a leash,
A damn damn leash
And its hard enough to be my damn self!
