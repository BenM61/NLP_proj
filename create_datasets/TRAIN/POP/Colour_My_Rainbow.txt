Colour my rainbow in blue 
Take me to much better places 
Baby come over and take me in your arms 
Let me be there and aware of your charmes 

Colour my rainbow please do 
And I follow you 
Why
Do I get lonesome when you're far away 

For just one day 
Why
Please tell me why 
I got to know I won't let go 

Colour my rainbow in blue... 
Some
Are about to run away when times get rough 
I need your love 

Stay
Please stay with me 
Until the end my friend 
Colour my rainbow in blue 

Take me to much better places 
Baby come over and take me in your arms 
Let me be there and aware of your charmes 
Colour my rainbow please do 

And I follow you
