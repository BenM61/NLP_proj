Why can't you do something right?
Your name is all over the town
Your reputation is sweeping the nation
The rumors are bringing me down

You stand on the tip of my tongue
I can't get you out of my head
There's no syncopation with any relation
Could it be that there's trouble ahead?

Four wheel drive, four wheel ride
Side by side, four wheel drive

Why don't you try to slow down?
I'm standing at the back of the line
We made reservations to meet at the station
My schedule is running behind

What can I do to survive?
Why am I always abused?
Anticipation of constant frustration
Can it be that there's any good news?

Four wheel drive, four wheel ride
Side by side, four wheel drive
