The problem is
For many years
I've lived my life
Publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And everytime I find someone I like
Gotta worry about
If it's really me
That they see
And I thought you were the one, yeah

Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me, don't think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I, I, oh

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

It's the car I drive
The clothes I wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
So I need someone
To stand by me
And supply my needs
And I'm just plain old Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

See the problem is
For many years
I've lived my life
Publicly
And everytime I find a man
I, I can't trust him
Oh
