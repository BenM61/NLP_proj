I met Jane at the center of the earth 
It was dark there was dirt all around 
But I gather you can figure that 

Jane says I'm your body in the night 
And I'll lead you where you might find yourself 
Better if you follow me 

So go right you'll be left at a big hotel 
You'll meet the devil at the bottom of a wishing well 
You know you better give him something 
Give him something good 
Like everybody else he's misunderstood 

Jane says it's a long way out,
I'm gonna make it out 
Cause I'm about her 

Jane says, you're as Holy as a ghost, 
But who loves you the most, if you offer 
I might let you carry me 

Jane there's nobody here but yourself 
In the end it's the wealth of your spirit 
Now hurry up get on with it 

I went left I got right at some big hotel 
There was a devil at the bottom of the wishing well 
He said you better give me something 
Give me something good 
Like everybody else I'm misunderstood 

Jane says it's a long way out 
I'm gonna make it out 
Cause I'm about 
Jane says it's a long way out 
I'm gonna make it out 

I took a guess and cut a portion out of my heart 
He said that's nowhere close enough but it's a damn good start 
I wrote the secret that I buried on the wishing well wall 
He said I've seen one, it follows that I've seen them all 
We spoke of human destination in a perfect world 
Derived the nature of the universe (found it unfulfilled) 
As I took him in my arms he screamed I'm not insane 
I'm just looking for someone to understand my pain

It's a long way out
I'm gonna make it out
