Hey, there, how you doin', how you been
Been a couple of weeks since I talked to you
Sorry that it's taken me so long to reach out to you
But I'm wondering maybe, possibly, say it again
Maybe could we get together this weekend

I still remember the way you felt
The way you smelled and the sexy way you wore your hair
Girl, can you tell me are you available
'Cause if you don't mind, I want to book you a flight

Meet me at the Creep Inn (Meet me at the Creep Inn)
We can spend the weekend (Oh), I got what you're seeking (Oh, oh)
We could start creepin' (Yeah, yeah)
Just jump in your ride, girl, I'll be there on time

Meet me at the Creep Inn
We can spend the weekend (We can spend the weekend)
I got what you're seeking (Whoa...whoa...whoa...whoa...whoa)
We could start creepin' (Oh, yeah)
Just jump in your ride, girl, I'll be there on time

I remember every detail about that night
Just you and I, bumpin' in a suite back in July
And I remember at first you were afraid to try
Every little itty bitty thing that was on your mind
Now I got some new details that we'll share
I hope you care enough for me to go there

Interesting details, thoughts of you and I
Locked in a room by candle light
You're flight lands at 9
Let's go for a ride

Meet me at the Creep Inn (Oh, baby)
