Winter's night, Oslo
Just a burning light in the snow
Keep me warm, shelter me from the storm
On this night, Oslo

From the start, Oslo
Light in my heart, red glow
Drink in bars, dance on the roofs of cars
In the burning streets of Oslo

I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
You're the warmth that's in my heart
And it makes me feel at home
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
I hope you'll still be here
Next year

We'll go home when the town close 
Hang up fur coats and lose our clothes
I'll keep you warm, shelter you from the storm
Winter's night, Oslo

I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
You're the warmth that's in my heart
And it makes me feel at home
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
I hope you'll still be here
Next year

I never wanna leave
I never wanna go
You're the warmth that's in my heart
And it makes me feel at home
I never wanna leave
