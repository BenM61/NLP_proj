On every boulevard I seek you
In every street cafe I meet you
When you say you're just passing this way
I know why you do
Babe you're warm as the sun
And you shine on everyone
Sweet river keep flowing strong
The music is just begun
Strong as the moon pulling the tide
I wanna walk by your side
You conquer me with your arrows of light
Like a highwayman you kill in the night
Every riverside bar knows you
And every lady loves you
Don't ask me why I try to catch your eye
You know why I do
On every boulevard I seek you
In every street cafe I meet you
You're a lover with a sweetheart on every boulevard
You're a lover with a sweetheart on every boulevard
Strong as the moon pulling the tide
I wanna walk by your side
You conquer me with your arrows of light
Like a highwayman you kill in the night
Strong as the moon pulling the tide
I wanna walk by your side
You conquer me with your arrows of light
Like a highwayman you kill in the night
Strong as the moon pulling the tide
I wanna walk by your side
You conquer me with your arrows of light
Like a highwayman you kill in the night
