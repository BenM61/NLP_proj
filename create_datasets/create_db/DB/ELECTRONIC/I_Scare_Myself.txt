I scare myself just thinking about you
I scare myself when I'm without you
I scare myself the moment that you're going
I scare myself when I let my thoughts run
And when they're running
I keep thinking of you
And when they're running
What can I do?
 
I scare myself, and I don't mean lightly
I scare myself, it can get frightening
I scare myself, to think what I could do
I scare myself it's some kind of voodoo
And with that voodoo
I keep thinking of you
And with that voodoo
What can I do?
 
But it's so so very different when we're together
And I'm so so much calmer; I feel better
Cause the stars already crossed our paths forever
And the sooner that you realize it the better
And then I'll be with you and I won't scare myself
And I'll know what to do and I won't scare myself
And my thoughts will run and I won't scare myself
And I'll think of you and I won't scare myself
