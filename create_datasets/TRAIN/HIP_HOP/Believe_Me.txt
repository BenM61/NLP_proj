Believe Me

I guess that this is where we've come to 
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me 
But I, won't be there when you go down 
Just so you know now 
You're on your own now, believe me

Ryu:
Yo, I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like fun and games, keep playin' 'em
I'm just sayin'
Think back then we was like one and the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
It's like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
In your brain like a maze you can never escape
The rain, every damn day's the same shade of grey

Mike:
Hey, I used to have a little bit of a plan
Used to, have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right outta my hand
Now, I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say? Maybe
I should do what I have to do to break free, and
Whatever happens to you, we'll see
But its not gonna happen with me

I guess that this is where we've come to 
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me 
But I, won't be there when you go down 
Just so you know now 
You're on your own now, believe me

Mike:
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'm thinkin' like the mistake that I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work cause its 
Really much worse than I thought
I wished you were something you were not 
And now this guilt is really all that I've got

Tak:
You turned your back and walk away ashamed
All you got
Is a memory and pain, nothing makes sense
You stare at the ground, and hear my voice inside your head 
When no one else is around
What do I have to say
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free, yeah
Whatever happens to you, we'll see
But it's not gonna happen to me

I guess that this is where we've come to 
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me 
But I, won't be there when you go down 
Just so you know now 
You're on your own now, believe me

(Yeah. Lets go)

I'm guess that this is where we've come to
(Yeah)
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me 
But I, won't be there when you go down 
(Yeah)
Just so you know now
You're on your own now, believe me

I'm doing what I have to do
You're on your own now believe me
Whatever happens to you
You're on your own now believe me
What do I have to say?
You're on your own now believe me
Its not gonna happen to me
You're on your own now believe me
