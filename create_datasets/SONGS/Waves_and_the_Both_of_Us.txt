I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I want your hands on my hips
I want you kissing my lips

I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I take off your shirt
You pull up my skirt

But I can't wait forever, boy

And the moon and the stars
And the look in your eyes
Better find it's way, into me
And your skin
On my skin
The bones that we're in
Better slide your way into me

I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I want your hands on my waist
There's no need to wait

I want the dance of the air
Run your hands through my hair
Releasing your breath
As I undress

But I can't wait forever, boy

And the moon and the stars
And the look in your eyes
Better find it's way, into me
And your skin
On my skin
The bones that we're in
Better slide your way into me

I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I want your hands on my hips
I want you kissing my lips

I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I take off your shirt
You pull up my skirt

And the moon and the stars
And the look in your eyes
Better find it's way, into me
And your skin
On my skin
The bones that we're in
Better slide your way into me

And the moon and the stars
And the look in your eyes
Better find it's way, into me
And your skin
On my skin
The bones that we're in
Better slide your way into me
