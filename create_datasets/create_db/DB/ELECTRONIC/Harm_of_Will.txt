If there is a troubadour washing
It is he
If there is a man about town
It is he
If there is one to be sought
It is he
If there are nine she is
They are bought for me

This way is as is she
And he placed her
Unclothed
Long long long legged
On top of the family tree

And if he has chosen the point
While she is under him
Then leave her coily placed
Crouched sucking him
For it is I with
Her on knee

I leave her
Without pith or feel
And leave her be
Leave it be
For he controls what there'll be
He makes his face known to none
For if he is seen
Then all will
And all will know
Know me
