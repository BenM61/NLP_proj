Yo,
Let me start off by first apologizing,
Girl you think I take you for granted,
But I'm,
I'm here to take it back

[Chorus]
Can we
Pull back a minute and make believe
that
I don't know you and you don't know me
Darling let's pretend
This old school love is brand new
Can we
Explore the places I've already been
Just
Tell me where and I'll kiss it again
Darling let's pretend
This old school love is brand new

I know I shouldn't have to ask
But it seems that I've relaxed
And I'm getting the feelings that
It's time I take it back
Remembering late night escapes
In the car callin out my name
You being scared when your friend was late
Then being cool when it finally came
Those were the days

[Chorus]

Way back when hickies were the thing
You wore bloomers, not that sexy g-string
And gettin blue balls was a daily thing
But it was alright, with me
To when that very first time went down
How you moaned when I went down
You were the one
I had no doubt
We need to get that back right now
'Cause those were the days

[Chorus]

We're still here (yah)
'Cause we conquered every feeling (every feeling)
The fire burns inside like yester year
My baby since back in the day
We knew it would be us
Holding on to that first crush
Got to say today, is what it was
So lets keep on sending, it's only beginning

[Chorus: x 2]

Back,
Like Cadillacs and hubcaps
Back,
Like leaving letters in your nap sack
Back,
like Jellies and pro cast
Back to girl,
When we first met
Back,
To when I got the glove on
Back,
To when our love was so strong
Back,
To the days I know you miss
I'll get back , I promise this
Take it back

[Chorus]
