There was a time I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy, woman, talkin' for hours and hours on the telephone
Then one day I set you up to walk right outta my life
Leavin' me all by myself, all alone, to cry every night
(Babe, babe, babe, babe, oh)
Oh, I want you to come back home, yeah
(Oh yeah)
Sweet little girl
(You been gone so long)
You've been away so long
Now listen to me
I said I made up my mind, woman when you left me there, oh
I was gonna find another sweet lover who's gonna feel all of my, all of my, all 
Of my cares

So I met a sweet little girl just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman but she turned around, and did the same thing 
Again to me, whoa

(Babe, babe, babe)
Oh baby, baby, please come home, home
(Come on home) home, yeah, it's alright
(Oh yeah) I know
(Ya been gone too long) been away so long
(Babe, babe, babe) I want you to please come home, oh
(Oh yeah, ya been gone too long)
So I made up my mind
I gonna crawl right back to you woman
I'm gonna plead and plead and plead, yeah
'Til you're here by my side
I can't even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
Cause I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinkin' about it
I want to make you mine
Oh, babe
(Babe, babe, babe)
Babe, babe, babe, please
(Come on home)
Please come home, yeah
(Oh yeah, ya been gone too long)
I want you to oh oh
(Babe, babe, babe come on home)
I want you to come back running home to me woman
(Oh yeah)
I want you to think about when we walk through the trees together
(Ya been gone too long)
You know we had such a real good time
Whoa, here they come
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
I believe it's always calling
Do you feel the brown leaf against your face you ought to sing and shout
(Oh yeah)
