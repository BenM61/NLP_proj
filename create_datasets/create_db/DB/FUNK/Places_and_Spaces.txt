Places and spaces I've been
Oh the places and spaces I've been
Oh the places and spaces I've been
Oh the places and spaces I've been
Oh the places and spaces I've been
Oh the places and spaces I've been

Well the places and spaces I've been

Down on the west-side
Where all the girls hide
All you have to do is east-side
What you gon' buy?

Sliding on the east coast
The very sleep coast
People getting high

Had a lot of women
Seen a lot of land
Takes a little while
Then you'll understand

Had a lot of women
Seen a lot of land
Takes a little while
Then you'll understand
