The moon is right 
The spirits up 
We're here tonight 
And that's enough 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 

The party's on 
The feelin's here 
That only comes 
This time of year 

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 

The choir of children sing their song 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Ding dong, ding oh 
Oh

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 

The word is out 
About the town 
To lift a glass 
Ahhh don't look down 

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 

The choir of children sing their song 
They practiced all year long 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Ding dong, ding dong 

The party's on 
The spirits up 
We're here tonight 
And that's enough 

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 

The moon is right 
The spirits up 
We're here tonight 
And that's enough 

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime 

Oh
Christmastime
