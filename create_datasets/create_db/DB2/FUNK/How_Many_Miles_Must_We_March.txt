Exactly how much will have to burn
Before we will look to the past to learn
We walk along this endless path
Which has led us in a circle
So here we are right back
We can't let the future become our past
If we are to change the world
Won't you tell me
Tell me please
How many miles must we march
How many miles must we march

When I was a baby I was not prejudiced
Hey how about you
This was something
That I learned in school
Something they taught us to do
We can't let our future become our past
If we are to change the world
Won't you tell me
Tell me please
How many miles must we march
How many miles must we march

There must come a day
When a box is not somebody's home
The unfinished work of our heroes
Must truly be our own
We can't let the future become our past
If we are to change the world
Won't you tell me
Tell me please
How many miles must we march
How many miles must we march
How many miles must we march
How many miles must we march
How many miles must we march
How many miles must we march
