Look at you, a fool in love.
A man too blind to see.
You never ask yourself why they all leave you.
You try to play so many games.
You give yourself away.
And then you wonder why no one believes you.

You've got to realise
That this is goin' nowhere.
You've got to understand
That there's so much you can share.

You know you've got to hold on to love
If you wanna learn to forget your sorrow.
You've got to hold on to love
Like there's no tomorrow.

Hold on, hold on, hold on,
Keep holdin' on.

There'll be a prize to pay,
If your love runs away.
Hold on, hold on,
Hold on to love.
