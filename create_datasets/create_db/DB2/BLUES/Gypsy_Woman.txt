You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child
You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after while

Well, you know I went to a gypsy woman to have my fortune told
She say, "You better go back home son and peep through your, your key hole"
You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be
Trouble after while

Well, now, you know I went back home, I took the gypsy woman as she said
I peeped through my key hole and there was another man laying in my bed
You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child

Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after while
