Talk about biting that hand that feeds
Sitting there watching as it bleeds
Try your best in the winter light
When it really should be summer night

Is it too late baby?
Too late now
Too late baby
Too late now
Too late for you to realise
Everything could have been all right

Has it been to long? yeah
Is it too long now
Is it too long for you to make the change
Gotta love yourself to make a better day

I hate the way you don't want to move
What's the matter?
Money rules the groove now
What we're doing here today
Won't make the bad life go away
You gotta grow the beard
Find the doubt
And maybe you'll work something out, hey

Is it too long baby?
Too long now yeah
Too long for you to make the change
You got to love yourself to make a better day, better day

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Look out
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Recognise your soul
And everythng's alright
You gotta see the whole
And everything's alright
C'mon give yourself a break
Everything's alright
We'll be breathng deep and everything's alright
Well c'mon c'mon c'mon everything's alright

In a dream I was crossing African plains
And elephant's graveyard
A bone dry place
And I was wondering why there was no more rain
And in a pile of bones I saw your face
Is it too late baby?
Is it too late now yeah

It's aright
It's alright
