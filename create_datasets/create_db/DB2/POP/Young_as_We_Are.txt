Young as we are
Young though we both may be
We're going far, my love and me
Oh, young as we are

We've a star
One burning high above
Our lucky star will guide are love
Oh, young as we are

They tell us "beware
Hasty hearts when they're young
Aren't wise,"
But how many share love
That's as warm and as sweet
As the love in your eyes?

Young as we are
Young though we both may be
We're going far, my love and me
Oh, young as we are

Our love was meant to be
Ooo, young as we are...
