Underneath a burning sun
There's always work to be done
We take much more than we care to give away
You'll be the moth, I'm the flame
I'll bless you and keep you safe and sound
Until sunrise comes around again
I'm like a mountain made of stone
I'm like a new day dawning
I'll be here every morning, close to you

We'll sail on a river, way out to the Baltic sea
Love will keep us together
And the tide will draw you close to me
(Never words so true, never words so wise)
Love will keep us together
'Cause there's more to this than meets the eye

I burn a candle in your place
I picture the passions on your face
Feelings that rise on a wave and fall away
All the pleasures have returned
All of the lessons I should have learned
Return again to light, for us to see
You're like the map of buried gold
I search for treasures in your soul
And when I'm gone, you'll know I will come back to you

We'll sail on a river, way down to the salty sea
Love will keep us together
And the tide will draw you close to me
(Never words so true, never words so wise)
Love will keep us together
'Cause there's more to this than meets the eye

I'm like a mountain made of stone
I'm like a new day dawning
I'll be here every morning, close to you
