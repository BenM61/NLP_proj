Is there word or right to sing
Even in this old fashion way
Go make your move girl, I'm not coming home
Would things have changed if I could have stayed
Would you have loved me either way
Dressed to the blues day to day with my collar up
Decisions sit, so make it quick, a breath inhaled from an air so sick
I curse the day that I heard of the web you spun

Hey, hey
If it was up to me, I would have figured you out before the gear dropped down
Oh I hope you're waiting
Oh I hope you're waiting

Listen well will you marry me, (not now boy) and are you well in the suffering (you've been)?
You've been the most gracious of hosts you may be invited girl but your not coming in
Listen well will you marry me, (not now boy) and are you well in the suffering (you've been)?
You've been the most gracious of hosts I may be invited girl but I'm not coming in

If it was up to me, I would have never walked out
So until the sun burns out, oh I hope you're waiting

And we have lived as a child would care
And with this vial to drink I dare
Only, (oh where have you been, oh where have you been, oh where have you been if it hurts you'll be forgiven) I cry all all alone with your taste on tongue
Should we try things again with hope
Hope isn't lost, give up the ghost
Or should I die all alone as I knew I would
Then burn in hell gods sinner
