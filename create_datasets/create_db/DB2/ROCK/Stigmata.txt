Stronger than reason
Stronger than lies
The only truth I know
Is the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes!

Just like a car crash
Just like a knife
My favourite weapon
Is the look in your eyes
You've run out of lies!

You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
There's a ton locked in your empty eyes
Get out of my life!

I'm chewing on glass
And eating my fingers
I'm not the one
Who's run out of lies
Lies!

You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
You've run out of lies!
You've run out of time!

Cutting my face
And walking on splinters
I lost my soul
To the look in your eyes
Your eyes!

You ran out of lies!
You ran out of lies!
You ran out of lies!
You ran out of time!

Stigmata!

O, you have empty eyes!...
They tell me nothing, nothing but lies
