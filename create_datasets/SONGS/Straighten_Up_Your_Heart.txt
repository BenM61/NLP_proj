Our cheating heart was
Playing from the start
And our love's becoming
The talk of the town
(Talking, talking, talking
All over town)

I can't live up to misery and pain
That I'm about to face
My tears would fall like rain
(Teardrops are falling on my pillow)

'Cause I happen to know
One day soon, you'll let me go
It's gonna hurt, it's gonna
Hurt me so inside

So if you don't wanna
Don't want to see my cry
Please don't ever, ever say goodbye

Just straighten up your heart
(Straighten up, straighten up your heart)
And we can start anew
And if you do this for me
I'll know your loving is true
(It's true, it's true)

So straighten up your heart
(Straighten up, straighten up your heart)
And we can start anew
And if you do this for me
I'll know your loving is true
(It's true, it's true)

Baby, I'll know your love is true
(It's true, it's true)
Darling, I'll know your love is true
(It's true, it's true)
So true (it's true, it's true) I'll know
