I've reached the end of my story
I still don't understand the plot
I've reached the end of the line
I can't do nothing but stop
I've reached the end of my glory
And no will forget me not
I've reached the top of my high
Can't do nothing but drop

Out of the sky

I'm on my way down
And I see some rising faces
But I'm fallin' much too fast
To tell 'em 'bout the fate that's waitin'
I'm headed straight for the ground
To the place where I used to stay
To suffer the wrath
Crash landing on the runway

Out of the sky
