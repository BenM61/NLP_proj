Solid as a candy in the sun
I'm a boy that's new and overrun
More like an extraction from a whole
A heart's something in almost everyone
Walked so far one night at home
Met a friend and sent him off alone
No patterns anywhere so
I shrugged off what I learned and blew off

Drank it through
Cause I'm so new
Not like I am

Got pushed to the ground by a bad girl
Had a smile on my face as I drove off
"You see, I've got a million options
I'll f*ck through them all, just watch them fall"

I watch them fall
I need them all
Watch them fall

Solid as a candy in the sun
I'm a boy that's new and overrun
More like an extraction from a whole
A heart's something in almost everyone

In everyone
In everyone
In everyone
