From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

Love bomb, until the time when hate has gone
From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Go up in a cloud of love
Reaching for the Lord above

All we need to live together hand in hand
And understand is simply plant the seed 
And make the world a much better place
Let's all embrace the human race

From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

You and me had better start to clean up the world
And in a while we could be making love
Instead of all the fighting and hate
Why should we wait? It's not too late
Love bomb!

Go up in a cloud of love
Reaching for the Lord above

From now on we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone

From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

A love bomb, a love bomb
