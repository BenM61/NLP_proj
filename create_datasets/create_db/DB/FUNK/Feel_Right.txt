Calling all cars in here for the Prince of the South
F*ck that yabba-dabba-doo shit, bitch, I just got out
Still rapping, slapping kittens and grabbing my crotch
I'm the artist, the godfather
Still hard as a rock
You gon f*ck around and make me knock your fruit juice loose
Banana, your watermelon and pomegranate too
Rhyming kung-fu that split bamboo
Crowd rockin', ain't no stopping that rapping ass fool
I been bad, bro, 'cha getting mad for?
I'm gon' have to f*ck you up
I eat flames up
Shit fire out
Don't make me light my butt
Excuse me, who me?
I got a lot of groupies
Oughta have a fucking doghouse like Snoopy
Curtains go up
It's going down
Tear the thing out the frame
With my band

Come on, come on

Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

Grabbing on my pants, she trying to pull it out my pocket
Don't yank on the motherfucker so hard, you're gonna pull it out the socket
It's exercise with thighs and hip muscles
Next exercise, we gon' burn some lip muscles
Let the music work your ear muscles
And if you're skinny then use your little muscles
Bag back or tea bag with these duffles
Pow pow get smash when we hustle
When the last time you have a knuckle sandwich, huh?
The last time a nigga had a foot so far up your ass you couldn't handle it?
You can't stand it
To make matters worse you gotta go to the studio with Bruno Mars on another planet
Don't get mad, I'm just saying
Don't believe it cause I'm saying it, bitch
Believe it cause I'm telling you
I'm doing the rapping and bussing
Ronson on the scratchin' and cuttin'

Come on, come on

Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

This the intermission
I'll break it down so you niggas listen
Take a second to wipe my sweat
Might be the only chance you get to catch your breath
Don't get too comfortable in here
Niggas know I'm bringing back the rumble in here
Just when you thought you could cool down and sip some of that water
Shit
A nigga back
Say it again

Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
