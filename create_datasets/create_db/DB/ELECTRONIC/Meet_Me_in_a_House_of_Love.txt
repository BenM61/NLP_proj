Don't shed your tears
Just meet me in a house of love
You know when you're there because the colors just soak you up
Once I was lost but in this house I can be found
Feel like the sun, we're rising and we won't come down

Into to the night
Into forever
Let's come together like the brightest stars
Into to the night
Into forever
Let's come together like the brightest stars

It's cold in the street
But we can build a house of love
We hold up the walls, the lovers in the yearning hearts
Once I was lost but in this house I can be found
Feel like the sun, we're rising and we won't come down

Into to the night
Into forever
Let's come together like the brightest stars
Into to the night
Into forever
Let's come together like the brightest stars

Into the hands
Into the night
Into the sunrise
Into my life
Into my hands
Through the night
Into the sunrise
And the rest of our lives

I'm movin' up now
We built this house together
Inside the four walls, we're gonna live together
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together, together

Into the night, into forever
Lets come together, like the brightest stars
Into the night, into forever
Lets come together, like the brightest stars

Come out into the light
