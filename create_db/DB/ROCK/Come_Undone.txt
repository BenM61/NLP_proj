I stumble and I fall, your time is on my side
Don't make sense of it all, despite my foolish pride
It's got me on my knees, tearin' up my heart
I'm shakin' at my bones, tearin' me apart

When I can't get close to you
I come undone, I come undone
Come undone, babe, I come undone

Time will take its toll, time can break your heart
And if I had the chance, we'd never have to part
Took my only flame, took my one desire
Threw it all away when jumping in the fire

I can't get close to you
I come undone, come undone
Come undone, babe, I come undone

When the day is done I lay me down to rest
Everyone will see that I loved you the best
When all is said and done here simple and explain
And if I have the chance I'll do it all again

But I can't get close to you
I come undone, I come undone
Come undone, babe, I come undone

I'm not scared of the dark though you tangle and tease me
But worse than your bark you said you'd never leave me
The devil make everybody, don't please believe me
Oh love of my life, won't you let me down easy?

Undone, I come undone
Come undone, babe, I come undone
I come undone, I come undone
Come undone, babe, I come undone
