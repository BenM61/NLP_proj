Be mine tonight
The time is right
For you and me
To get together

Be mine tonight
Our future's bright
And this could be
The start of forever

And, oh, be mine tonight
Girl, when we get together
It's gonne be like dynamite
Don't you know I love you
(Oh, be mine tonight)

Oh, be mine tonight
No more stormy weather
You don't need to be uptight
Don't you know I love you
Don't you know I love you

Be mine tonight
And with all my might
I'll try to show
That love can be tender

Be mine tonight
Give up, don't fight
And you will know
The thrill of surrender

And, oh, be mine tonight
Girl, when we get together
It's gonne be like dynamite
Don't you know I love you
(Oh, be mine tonight)

Oh, be mine tonight
No more stormy weather
You don't need to be uptight
Don't you know I love you
Don't you know I love you

Be mine tonight
We'll dim the light
But you and me
Will glow like an ember

Be mine tonight
We'll hold on tight
And this could be
A night to remember

And, oh, be mine tonight
Girl, when we get together
It's gonne be like dynamite
Don't you know I love you
(Oh, be mine tonight)

Oh, be mine tonight
No more stormy weather
You don't need to be uptight
Don't you know I love you
(Oh, be mine tonight)

Oh, be mine tonight
No more stormy weather
You don't need to be uptight
Don't you know I love you
(Oh, be mine tonight)

Oh, be mine tonight
Oh, be mine tonight
Oh, be mine tonight
Oh, be mine tonight
Oh, be mine tonight
