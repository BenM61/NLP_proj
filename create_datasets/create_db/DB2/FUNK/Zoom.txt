I may be just a foolish dreamer
But I don't care
'Cause I know my happiness is waiting
Out there somewhere

I'm searching for that silver lining
Horizons that I've never seen
Oh, I'd like to take just a moment
And dream my dreams, oh dream my dream

Woah, woah, zoom, I'd like to fly far away, yeah
Where my mind can be fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Whoa, I like to greet the sun each mornin'
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey in my life
In my life
Well, I've shared so many pains
And I played so many games
Ah, but everyone finds the right way
Somehow, some way, some day

Woah, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can see fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
People can be what they wanna be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh I wish the world were truly happy
Living as one
I wish the word they call freedom
Someday would come, someday would come

Woah, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind, can be fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Everybody can be what they wanna be

Hey baby
Woo
Ah, zoom, zoom baby, I'd like to fly away
Well I like to fly away, zoom, zoom, well I like to fly away, zoom

Zoom baby, I like to fly away (zoom, zoom)
Well I like to fly away, zoom, zoom, well I like to fly away, zoom
Zoom, baby, I like to fly away
Well I like to fly away, zoom, zoom, well I like to fly away, zoom
Zoom, I, zoom zoom
You and me baby, wild and free
Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go
