Rock-a-hula, rock-rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock-rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock-rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock-rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock-rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock

Rock-a-hula, rock
A-hula, rock

The way she moves her hips to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really move the grass around

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine

Rock-a-hula, rock-rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock

Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I want to hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock, rock, rock, rock

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock, rock, rock, rock

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine

Oh well, that rock-a-hula baby of mine
