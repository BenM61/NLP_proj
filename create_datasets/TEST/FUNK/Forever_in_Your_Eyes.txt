It came unannounced this feeling I feel for you.
I had to know Was it love you felt, too
Not thru mere words but the way that you looked at me
told me just how how much you really care
 
So don't you try and hide your feelings 
cause it's so very plain to see
forever in your eyes
Just let your heart faithfully guide you.
Guide you to love infinity
Forever in your eyes
 
Here we are Baby the time is right.
now there's no doubt what we feel is right
Just say the word cause I'm in it much too deep 
to turn away so please say you'll stay
 
So don't you try and hide your feelings 
cause it's so very plain to see
forever in your eyes
Just let your heart faithfully guide you.
Guide you to love infinity
Forever in your eyes
 
Girl I wanna hold ya your head on my shoulder
With you I'll never tire we'll take it higher and higher
I'll never hurt you baby never be untrue
All my hopes and dreams are realized in you
 
So don't you try and hide your feelings 
cause it's so very plain to see
forever in your eyes
Just let your heart faithfully guide you.
Guide you to love infinity
Forever in your eyes
