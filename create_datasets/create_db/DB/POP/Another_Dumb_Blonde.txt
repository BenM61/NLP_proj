I think that it's time that I should just let you go
So I'll tell it to your face instead of tell it to you on the phone
You see  I thought that you were special baby  somethin' unique
But lately I've come to find
That you're not really interested in my heart or mind

That's alright
That's okay
You never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright
That's okay
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
Cause it's not me, no, no

Cause it's not me, no, no
Oh, no

Last night I went to a party hopin' I'd see you there
And sure enough, you were hanging on some other girl, playin' with
her hair
And I overheard you tellin' her the very same thing you said to me
the night before
Hook, line and sinker
You were walkin' with her out the door

That's alright
That's okay
You never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright
That's okay
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
Cause it's not me, no, no

You are just a little trophy hangin' on your arm
So all all your friends will see you got it goin' on
But I see what you are so clearly
But baby, baby that's not all I ever need

That's alright
That's okay
I never loved you anyway
That's alright
That's okay
You never loved me anyway

You never loved me but it's alright
But it's alright, yeah, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Go ahead and find what you need
