You were all the rays of sunlight
Shinin' gold to me
Every color of the rainbow
I was blessed by her decree

You were every moment's magic
Joy beyond compare
You were all the rays of sunlight
I was lost without a care

Victims of the fury
Shadows in the dark
Victims of the fury
Arrows found their mark

So we lived our days in rapture
Like the world could never end
We weren't thinkin' 'bout the future
We had time enough to spend

We were blessed as though in heaven
We were messengers of joy
There were angels all around us
There was none who dared destroy

Victims of the fury
Shadows in the dark
Victims of the fury
Arrows found their mark

Then the world collapsed around us
And the tables overturned
We were lambs before the slaughter
We were driven out and burned

Yes, the world collapsed around us
And the archers found their mark
We were victims of the fury
We were shadows in the dark

Yeah, victims of the fury
Shadows in the dark
Oh, victims of the fury
Arrows found their mark

Victims of the fury
Shadows in the dark
Victims of the fury
Arrows found their mark
