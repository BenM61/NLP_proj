Once a night my bedroom light
Bleeds out from inside my window
Eyes white, I keep out of sight
This city's just not pretty like it used to be

It's always a nightmare, it's never a dream
The promise we made to kill the days between
They live in the heartbeat and sleep til the light is gone

It's been so long
Feels like pins and needles in my heart
So long
I can feel it tearing me apart

To the bed the left unsaid
Crawl in from outside my window
Hands red and cold as the dead
A pity they're not pretty like they used to be

It's always a nightmare, it's never a dream
The promise we made to kill the days between
They live in the heartbeat and sleep til the light is gone

It's been so long
Feels like pins and needles in my heart
So long
I can feel it tearing me apart

It's never a whisper, it's always a scream
The promise we made to kill the time between
They live in the heartbeat and sleep til the light is gone

It's been so long
Feels like pins and needles in my heart
So long
I can feel it tearing me apart
