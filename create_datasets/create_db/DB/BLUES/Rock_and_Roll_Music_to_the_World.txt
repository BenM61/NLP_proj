We did some rock and roll up in Texas
And the folks from the Coast Towns said
You better watch yourself up in Texas
Or you, you might just end up dead, boy

But the people I found grooving to the sound
Of rock and roll music in the air
We all had a ball with no hassles at all
Pretty soon I'm gonna go back there

I'm singing rock and roll music to the world
Rock and roll music to the world

Ain't no relation to the United Nations
Keep rock and rolling to the world
Give peace a chance, get up and dance
When I sing rock and roll music to the world

I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna shout
Get my emotions and work them all right out
I wanna live just like I give
No need to fight, wait for tonight
When I sing rock and roll music to the world

Rock and roll music to the world
Rock and roll music to the world

Ain't got no calling, except for balling
Rock and roll music to the world

Don't need no boost, just turn me loose
And I sing rock and roll music to the world
I tell the truth, I ain't no star
I only shout and leave the rest to my guitar

Rock and roll music to the world
Rock and roll music to the world

Ain't no relation to the United Nations
Keep rock and rolling to the world
Don't need no boost, just turn me loose
And I sing rock and roll music to the world
