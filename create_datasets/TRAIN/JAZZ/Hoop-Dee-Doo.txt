Hoop-De-Do, Hoop-De-Do
I hear a polka and my troubles are through
Hoop-De-Do, Hoop-De-De
This kind of music is like heaven to me
Hoop-De-Do, Hoop-De-Do
It's got me higher than a kite
Hand me down my soup and fish, I am gonna get my wish
Hoop-De-Doin' it tonight

(When there's a trombone playin', ra-ta-da-da-da)
I get a thrill, I always will
(When there's a concertina stretchin' out a mile)
I always smile 'cause that's my style
When there's a fiddle in the middle oh it really is a riddle how he
plays a tune so sweet
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die
Lead me to the floor and hear me yell for more
'cause I'm a Hoop-Dee-Doin' kind of guy

When there's a fiddle in the middle oh it really is a riddle how he
plays a tune so sweet
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die
(Orchestral Break)

Hoop-De-Do, (Hoop-De-Do)
Hoop-De-Doo, (Hoop-De-Do)
I hear a polka

and my troubles are through)
Hoop-De-De, (Hoop-Dee-Do)
Hoop-De-De, (Hoop-De-De)
This kind of music

is like heaven to me
Hoop-De-Do (Hoop-De-Do)
Hoop-De-Do (Hoop-De-Do)
It's got me higher than a kite
I'm in clover, I'm in bloom
When I'm dancin' give me room
Hoop-de-doin' it with all of my might

Rain may fall and snow may come
Nothin's gonna stop me from
Hoop-De-Doin' it tonight
