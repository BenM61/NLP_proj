Nothing to lose that's worth the keeping
Counting on you I stand to gain
You held the key to my heart for ransom
I'll pay the price and I won't complain
It's about time that I surrendered
Something that's dear and precious to me
By giving you all, all of the love, Babe, you ever need

I was afraid that I'd been waiting
For something that I could not possess
But honey my heart is overflowing
With joy and happiness
Writ your name across my future
And your face is all I'll ever see
I'm giving you all, all of my love, Babe, and all of me

Now come much closer, Babe
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna love you forever
More each day
With my arms wide open
And nothing to hide
Don't waste one moment darlin'
I'll be walking by your side

I don't want to give the wrong impression
About the truth that lies ahead
I'm gonna rush in with arms wide open
Where angels fear to tread
I want a harvest that is so fruitful
I'm gonna plant the perfect seed
By giving you all, all of the love, Baby
By giving you all, all the best of me
I'm giving you all, all of the love, Babe, you ever need
