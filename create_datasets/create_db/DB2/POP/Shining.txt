Call it over
Call it gone
Call it nothing
See what you've gone and done
Call it stupid
Call it wrong
Call it reckless
See what we've gone and done

Who am I to break this young girl's heart
How the mighty rise and fall
I will not be beaten
You have yet to see me shining, shining
I will not be beaten
You have yet to see me shining, shining
I won't take this lying down

Call me Sunday
Call me soon
Call me heartless
Call me to your room
Call me lonely
Call me lame
Call me blind and foolish just to spare you from the pain
