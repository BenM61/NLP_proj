The old covent garden
I remember only too well
The girl's a fool
She broke the rule

She hurt him hard
This time you will break down
She's lost his trust
And so she must

All is lost
The System has broke down
Romance has broke down
This boy is crack'in up

This boy has broke down
She plays it hard
She plays it tough
But that's enough

The love is over
She's broke his heart and that is rough
But in the end you'll soon recover
The romance is over

This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broke down

I've been spending my money
In the old town
It's not the same honey
When you're not around

I've been spending my time
In the old town
I sure miss you honey
Now you're not around

Now you're not around 
This old town
Ola
Ola

This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broke down

This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broke down

This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broke down
