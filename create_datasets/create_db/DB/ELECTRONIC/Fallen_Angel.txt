You say you wake up
In the morning
Feeling used
Like a fallen angel
Tired and bruised
It's got you feeling
So insane
More dead than alive
Love's got you stained
On the inside

Oh is it love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh is it love, sweet love

Oh is it love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh is it love, sweet love

So don't tell me
You feel pretty
When you're such a mess
Just try to remember
And don't forget
We're all dancing in the darkness
Don't shut out the light
I want so bad to ease your pain
On the inside

Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh is it love, sweet love

Oh is it love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh is it love, sweet love

You're drowning
In excess
Thoughts of suicide
Like a mirror
You can't hide
Fallen angel
Fallen angel

You cannot hide
Fallen angel
