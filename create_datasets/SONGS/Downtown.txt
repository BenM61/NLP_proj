Boy, I want you to listen closely to what I have to say 
'Cause this is the way to my heart 

You've been wondering how you can make it better 
Baby, it's easy to turn my world inside out 
Your discovery will take us to another place 
Baby, on that, there is no doubt 
I've been waiting for the special moment 
Anticipating all the things you'll do to me 
Make the first step to release my emotions 
To take the road to ecstasy 

You gotta go downtown 
That's the way to my love 
Take it round and round 
Ooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love 
Go downtown, To taste the sweetness 
Will be enough 
That's the love that you've been dreaming of 

Keep on doing, doing what you're doing 
'Til you feel the passion burning up inside of me 
If you do me right 
We'll be making love all through the night 
Until you uncover the mystery 
Take it nice and slow 
Baby, don't rush the feeling 
Now you know how you can make it happen, yeah 
My desire is begging for the healing 
Let me guide you down to the place to be 

You gotta go downtown 
That's the way to my love 
Take it round and round 
Ooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love 
Go downtown, To taste the sweetness 
Will be enough 
That's the love that you've been dreaming of 

That's where I keep the key to my love. 
(To my love) 
It opens up the door to so, so much more. 
(So, so, so much more) 
Baby, move on down, get closer 
To my sensitivity. 
Ooh, yeah 
Baby, send me. 





Downtown 

(Ooh you can't stop till you find my love) 
Baby don't you dare stop 
(That's the love that you been dreamin' of) 
That's the love you're dreamin of 
(Ooh you can't stop till you find my love) 
Don't you stop
