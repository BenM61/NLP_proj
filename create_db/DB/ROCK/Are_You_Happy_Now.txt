She stood out in the crowd, was a little to loud
But that's why we love her
She's not like other girls
She could have conquered the world
Until you broke her down

Are you happy now, that she's on the ground
And do you realize the words you say make bruises that don't fade away
Are you happy now, that you've brought her down
And she's thinking that she won't fit in
'Cause you said something's wrong with her
Are you happy now?

He liked science not sports
He knew what he stood for
He's not like you, you don't like that
15 years down the road, he could be everything you won't
But right now you're breaking him down

Are you happy now, that he's on the ground
And do you realize the words you say make bruises that don't fade away
Are you happy now, that you've brought him down
And he's thinking that he won't fit in
'Cause you said something's wrong with him
Are you happy now?

I've heard that it was done to you
Is that why you do what you do
Well that's no excuse, no
And if it felt like hell to you
Then why'd you want to put them through
What hurt you

Are you happy now
That you've brought them down

I-I-I, I don't think so

Are you happy now, that they're on the ground
And do you realize the words you say make bruises that don't fade away
Are you happy now, that you've brought them down
And they're thinking that they won't fit in
'Cause you said something's wrong with them
Are you happy now?

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
