You know how it feels
To roll away like a stone
And sing like a dove
That's found its way home 

The filth on the ground
Or washed up on the shore
We try where they've failed
But they'll reap what they sow 

And its the passion we feel
As we run through life
I hope a time will come
When they realize what they've done 

The lone CEO, chosen for his worth
To build cash-tiled walls
Above the smoke-stacked sky

But what if you never drew your breath
On a warm sun-filled day
Or caught all your dreams, in a season of
Tranquility, tranquility, tranquility

They're slowly destroying what we love
Shakin' it, breakin' it slowly
