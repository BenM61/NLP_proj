Do you recall that night in June when first we met
Do you remember, Love, the words we spoke
Have you forgotten all the tender vows we made
In the silent magical moonbeams' light
Gone are the golden dreams with summer roses
And all our tenderest vows were made, but to be broken

Song of songs, song of memory
And broken melody of love and life
Nevermore for me can that melody
Fill the heart with the joy once we knew

Oh night of bliss, night of June and love
Beneath the stars, amid the roses
Oh, dream of delight that faded at dawn
Oh, song of songs, oh, night of bliss
When you were my whole world of love

When you were my whole world of love, of love
