There's a time and a place
For you to make your mark and show your face
There's a place in time
When you must step outside the line

So understand what I mean
There is a time and place for you to have your dream
But here and now may not be
The time and place for you and me
You and me

It's the finest line
A missed opportunity or the perfect time
You must not despair
You'll recognise it when you're there

So understand what I mean
There is a time and place for you to have your dream
But here and now may not be
The time and place for you and me

The time and place for you and me
There's a time and there's a moment you will see
Don't lower your expectations
There are no limitations
There's a time and place for you and me

So understand hard as it seems
There is a time and place for you to have your dreams
Though here and now may not be
The time and place for you and me
You and me
