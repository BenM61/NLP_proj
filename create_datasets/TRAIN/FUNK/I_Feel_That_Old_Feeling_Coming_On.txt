I, I ,I feel, I feel that old feelin' coming on
Well, I feel, I feel that old feelin' coming on
Well, I been so unlucky ever since I was born

Tell me pretty baby, tell me what you goin' do
Well, well, tell me pretty baby, tell me what you goin' do
You goin' keep on runnin', let the woman make a fool of you

I, I, I,
I feel, I feel that old feelin' comin' on

I been buked pretty baby
Don't you know that I've been scorned
Well, I've been buked pretty baby
Don't you know that I've been scorned
I've been talked about just as sure as you're born

Now count on your fingers till you reach twenty one
Well, just keep on countin' baby, till you reach twenty one
I've been so unlucky, I'm my mothers seventh son

Count on your fingers till you reach 21
Well, well, I say keep on countin' baby, till you reach twenty one
I'm so unlucky, I'm my mothers seventh sun

I, I, I, I
I feel, I feel that old feelin' comin' on
I, I, I
I feel, I feel that old feelin' comin' on
