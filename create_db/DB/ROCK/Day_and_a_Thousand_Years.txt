Commit the compromise.
Restricts our rights the education society gives us.
You establish with your advertised tables.
What gives you our rights?
Laws shouldn't be put to what we read and hear.
Should nothing be said?
Shall we compromise?
No.
Our freedom, our rights, your mind.
Tear down the walls.
What can break must be broken.
You have proven, one person can omit regulations.
That can control our freedoms, our rights, and your fucking mind.
