Walk away nothing to do 
I forgot what doing time can do 
I'm on the chain gang 
The chain gang of love 
Wasting my time 
I'm just a prisoner of love 

I'm a jailbird baby 
Wasting my time 
At first feeling blue 
Then feeling fine 
I'm serving time 
For something I can't do 
They call it a crime 
'Cause I'm not in love with you 

I'm a jailbird baby 
'Cause I'm not in love with you
