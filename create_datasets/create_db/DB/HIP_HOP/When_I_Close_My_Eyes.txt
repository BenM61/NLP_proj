Darlin' here we are again
Right about now there is a need 
To tell you what I feel
I am so grateful to have a man like you
Who knows what to do
And makes me feel like a woman should 'cause

When I close my eyes I break down and cry
It's something ?bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss
My heart can't resist 
It's all about the way you love me

Never thought that I would find
So much piece of mind
In every moment that I share with you
Sometimes I don't know why
We fell so deep in love
But then it all comes back to me because

When I close my eyes I break down and cry
It's something ?bout the way you love me 
The thought of your kiss
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me

When  I'm with you I feel so good
No one loves me like you

When I close my eyes I break down and cry
It's something ?bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me
