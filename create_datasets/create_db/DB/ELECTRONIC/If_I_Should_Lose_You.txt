Baby, it's your life
I don't really wanna stand in your way
But I need consistent love
With me love is not a game that you play

We need to be closer baby, yeah
There's so many things that I wanna say
I'm loving you over and over and over
It'll hurt to see you walk away

If I should lose you
There'd be nothing left in my world but emptiness
If I should lose your love
I'd be nothing at all

I hold my pillow tight each night
I can't control the doubts in my mind
There's so many roads
That can lead us to the end of the line

Tossing and turning
Running out of ways to pass the time
So when the night comes in, baby
I wanna feel your body close to mine

If I should lose you
There'd be nothing left in my world but emptiness
If I should lose your love
I'd be nothing at all

Ooh If I should lose you
There'll be nothing left in my world but emptiness
If I should lose your love
I'll be nothing at all

Tossing and turning to pass the time
So when the night comes in, baby
I wanna feel your body close to mine

If I should lose you
There'd be nothing left in my world but emptiness
If I should lose your love
I'd be nothing at all

If I should lose you
If I should lose you
If I should lose your love
I'd be nothing at all
