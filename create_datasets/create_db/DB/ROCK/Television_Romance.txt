Everyone's getting so high
Losing their minds
And I'm looking for you, looking for you
I don't even know what I'm doing here
Why won't you just tell me?
'Cause I'd rather be lonely

Your heart's so heavy
Your heart is strange
You wanna love me
But honey, that ain't okay
You're not so heavenly
And I'm not sure that you're for me
But in the morning, it might just change

Oh, baby, won't you stop it?
You and I haven't got it

Oh, baby, won't you stop it?

Now I don't know what to say to you
I feel like you're getting to me
And I know that's what you're into
And your face isn't enough, never enough
To make me stay, stay, oh

Oh, baby, won't you stop it?
You and I haven't got it

do you think that you can have me tonight
I think that my, think my heart is alright
And oh baby think that I've got all the time
But in a few hours, I'll be out of my mind

Oh, baby, won't you stop it?
You and I haven't got it
