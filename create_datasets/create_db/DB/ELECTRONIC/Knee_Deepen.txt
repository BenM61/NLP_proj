Knee deepen
We deepen the game
In deeper
Don't walk away

Just foolish dreamers
We aspire
Do we deserve all that we desire?
If you decide that we can't set your heart alight
We'll walk on into the night

We know that there's no need to fear
We are there we are here
We move, we move, we move, we move on
So long
We're long gone

Knee deepen (knee deepen)
We deepen the game (the game)
In deeper (deepen)
Don't walk away (walk away)
Knee deepen (knee deepen)
We deepen the game (the game)
In deeper (in deeper)
Don't walk away

We will remember you
No, we won't forget
No, no fear of regret
And though we are the ones who walk into the night (we go on)
We won't vanish out of sight
We get over it, we go beyond
We find a way to get along
We move, we move, we move, we move on (we move we move)
So come on (come on), if you want to come along (come along, come along)
