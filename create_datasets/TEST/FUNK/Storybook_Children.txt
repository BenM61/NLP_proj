"You've got your world, & I've got mine, and it's a shame ...
2 grownup worlds that will never be the same ...

Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow ...
Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
In a wonderland, where nothing's planned, for tomorrow.

You've got his ring, you've got his heart, you've got his baby ...
and, Billy, it's too late to turn away and start all over again

Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow 

Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
In a wonderland, where nothing's planned, for tomorrow.

How happy we would be, if only we were Storybook Children
