Don't believe in the stories I hear 
Don't believe in the things you fear 
Give me strength 
Give me time 
Give me you now 

Don't believe in the message you tell 
Don't believe in your heaven or hell 
Give me faith 
Give me words 
Give me grace now 

I see the light right in front of my eyes 
I drive alone 
It's a cold, cold night 
Every path bares a cross for tomorrow 
Give me a sign 
Give me you 
And I'll follow 

Walking the line 
Water to wine 
Changing the tide 
Some Blessed night 

Don't believe in the wishing tree 
Don't believe every door has a key 
But there's hope and there's light in the shadow 
Give me a sign 
Give me you 
And I'll follow 

Walking the line 
Water to wine 
Changing the tides 
Some blessed night 

It take's a while 
To walk that highway 
I'll walk alone 

Walking the line 
Water to wine 
Changing the tides 
Some Blessed night
