Now this is all me, now this is all me
Watch out for late phone calls, we face them concrete walls
Go to far, live too long, time's too short, right and wrong
Block after block, block after block
Rolled down gates look the same, different trips, different trains

Hey friends, break in the back door
And turn it up while the lights are out
Eyes closed and shouting right now

Lights turn on and dark turns outside, blindside dream, - ding - you're next in line.
It's plain now this is all me, now this is all me.
Lights turn on and dark turns outside, blindside dream, - ding - you're next in line.
It's plain now this is all me, now this is all me.

Eat when you're hungry and sleep when you're slipping like
Tired dogs, rested paws, today we show our flaws
Block after block, block after block
If one way, now unwise, what was left now is right

Hey friends, we'll jump the turnstiles
And cut it down while the lights are out
Eyes closed and shouting right now

Lights turn on and dark turns outside, blindside dream, - ding - you're next in line.
It's plain now this is all me, now this is all me.
Lights turn on and dark turns outside, blindside dream, - ding - you're next in line.
It's plain now this is all me, now this is all me.

I think it takes a pile of bricks for us to make a home
And I'm not sure that I hear mountains grow from just one note
Block after block, block after block
Everything happened, every step I've took and street I've walked

Lights turn on and dark turns outside, blindside dream, - ding - you're next in line.
It's plain now this is all me, now this is all me.
Lights turn on and dark turns outside, blindside dream, - ding - you're next in line.
It's plain now this is all me, now this is all me.
