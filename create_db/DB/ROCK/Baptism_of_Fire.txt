Can you hear the thunder rolling
Somewhere in the night
Twenty thousand voices screaming
Blinded by the light
Makes no difference who you are
Or where you're going to
The sound of fury splits the night
Above the chosen few

Welcome to the nightmare
Let the show begin
Baptism of fire

Take the eagles from the sky
And ride into the sun
Make a stand, the time has come
The tournament's begun
Throw the dice, spin the wheel
Turn the card of fate
The day is coming soon my friend
You don't have to wait

Welcome to the nightmare
Let the show begin
Baptism of fire

Welcome to the nightmare
Let the show begin
Baptism of fire
