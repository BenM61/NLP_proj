This next one's the first song on our new album

People how you doin', there's a new day dawnin'
For the earth mother, it's a brand new mornin'
For such a long while, there's been such a longin'
But now the sun is shinin', let's roll back the awnin'

This is a type of kinda like a formal dedication
Givin' out a shout
for much inspiration
All I ever really want to do is get nice
Get loose and goof a little slice of life
Sendin' out love to all corners of the land
I jump up on the stage and take the mic in my hand
I'm not playin' the roll, just being who I am
And if you try to dis me, I couldn't give a damn

Bass from the back of my car feels soothin'
Eight bazookas is what I'm usin'
I'm Mike D, and it's been proven
I love it when I see the party people just movin'
Strapped on my ear goggles and what did I see?
But the music brought the people into harmony
