Sometimes I feel I almost touch you
I turn and almost see your face
For a moment my heart stops
Till the crowd moves on and fills the space

Oh, my life will be here waiting
For you, my love, to find your way
Back home to me

Sometimes I feel I almost touch you
I turn and almost see your face
For a moment my heart stops
Till the crowd moves on and fills the space

Oh,kindly the words are softly spoken 
Only echoing the emptiness I feel
Oh my life will be here waiting
For you my love to find your way
Oh baby find your way
Please baby find your way back home to me
