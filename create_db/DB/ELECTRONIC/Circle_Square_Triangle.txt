As these days pass
Underground
Breathe the air
Before you drown

One more time
Another line
Slowly divides
Before the night is over

We could do with some more poison 
We could do with some more poison 
We could do with some more poison 
We could do with some more poison 

Blinded by the burning lights
Turn 'em off, turn 'em off
Bodies break before they're white
Exposure sets before it's lost

Drawing lines
Making shapes
Stay alive
Sleep awake

We could do with some more poison 
We could do with some more poison 
We could do with some more poison 
And the end is here in noises

We could do with some more poison 
We could do with some more poison 
We could do with some more poison
And the end is here in noises

Yo, layers all exist within the beat
The shapes are moving all over the street
And I can see that nothing's moving
Is this something that's not worth losing?

This will do
It'll do
Still we could

We could do with some more noises 
We could do with some more noises
We could do with some more noises

And the end is here in noises
