He makes big generators chewing up the atmosphere
He learns the secrets of nature then destroys her without fear

See him burning the fruits of his labours
And with joy in his heart digs the graves of those
That he's trying to save oh, self destruction's his aim
See the soil turn to dust see the steel turn to rust
Killing all those he loves thanking god up above

The paradox of man the paradox of man
He has colossal power but he's helpless as a lamb
He's a mass of contradiction the paradox of man

And he envies the power of his neighbours
And he still fails to see he's become his own
Worst enemy oh, will he ever learn?
See the truth turn to lies see the greed in his eyes
Wasting all that remains his soul trapped in chains

The paradox of man the paradox of man
He makes big generators chewing up the atmosphere
He learns the secrets of nature then destroys her without fear

Soil turn to dust, can his power ever last?
The chains of his gain, reveal secrets of his past
Bitter is his greed, but man will never pay
Oh lead me through, lead me through, the faults of his rage

He has colossal power but he's helpless as a lamb
He's a mass of contradiction the paradox of man
