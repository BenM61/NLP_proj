I was minding my business like a good girl should
Maybe a little too cautious for my own good
It was just like living life in the dark
Til something jumped up and it grabbed my heart

I found love
I found real love

The beginning and end of every wish
Is balanced in the center of a vision like this
Maybe my emotions are inclined
To surrender to the notion of a glorious end

I found love
I found real love

One touch souls speak
The power's got me and it won't let me be
It's too much this heat
I want to laugh cry jump for joy scream and shout
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

At the end of every tunnel there's a shining light
At the end of every storm there's a quiet night
My joy was hidden in a big old dream
I didn't know it was there until you set me free

I found love
I found real love
