Do I look like I'm fakin' with you?
(And I) am out to hurt you
(And I) don't care about you
(And I) just wouldn't love you
(And I) would get me to you
(And I) just wanted from you
(And I) was not out to please you
(And I) could show you I'm true
(If I) gave my world to you
(If I) showed you how I do
(If I) made your words untrue
(If I) tell you I need you
(If I) set my heart for you
(If I) can't live without you
(If I) can't sleep without you

(If you) would just look my way
(If you) would not turn away
(If you) would see I don't play
(If you) just listen to me
