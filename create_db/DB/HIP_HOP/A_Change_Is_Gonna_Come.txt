I was born by the river 
In a little tent 
And gorgeous like the river 
I've been runnin' ever since 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I, I know a change gonna come 
Ooh yes it will 

It's been to hard living
But I am afraid to die 
Cause I don't know what's up there 
Beyond the sky 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I, I know a change gonna come 
Ooh yes it will 

There's been times that I thought 
I wouldn't last for long (naw) 
But somehow 
I think I'm able to carry on 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I know, I know a change is gonna come 
Ooh yes you will 

And then I go to my mother 
I said mother could you help me please? 
She said: I'd like to, I really would 
But I'm just not able 
Then I looked around 
And I was right back down 
Down on my knees 

There's been times that I thought 
I wouldn't last for long 
But somehow 
I think I'm able to carry on 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I know, a change gonna come 
Ooh yes it will
