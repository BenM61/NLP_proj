You see my hands are steady 
You've seen my face before 
Soon you can take your last look 
And they'll close the door 
I stand accused before you 
I have no tears to cry 
And you will never break me 
Till the day I die 

(Chorus) 
A criminal mind is all I've 
All I've ever known 
They tried to reform me 
But I'm made of cold stone 
My criminal mind is all I've 
All I've ever had 
Ask one who's known me 
If I'm really so bad... 
I AM 

I've spent my life behind these steel bars 
I've paid my debt in time 
But being brought to justice 
That was my only crime 
I don't regret a single action 
I'd do the same again 
These prison walls secure me 
And I'm numb to pain 

repeat chorus 
Before you hand me over 
Before you read my sentence 
I'd like to say a few words 
Here in my own defense... 
Some people struggle daily 
They struggle with their conscience 
Till the end 
I have no guilt to haunt me 
I feel no wrong intent 

A criminal mind is all I've 
All I've ever known 
Don't try to reform me 
Cause I'm made of cold stone 
My criminal mind is all I 
All I've ever had 
Ask one who's known me 
If I'm really so bad... 
I AM 
Oh I AM 
Oh I AM 
I'm made of cold stone 
Made of cold stone 
Just like these prison walls 
A criminal mind 
Oh 

Made of cold stone 
I'm made of cold stone 
Just like your prison walls 
I'm made of cold stone 
A criminal mind 
I am 
A criminal mind
