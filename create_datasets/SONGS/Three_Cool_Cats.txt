Three cool cats, three cool cats
Parked on the corner in a beat-up car
Dividing up a nickel candy bar
Talking all about how sharp they are, these
Three cool cats

Three cool chicks, three cool chicks
Walkin' down the street swingin' their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
And three cool cats did three big flips for
Three cool chicks

Up pops the first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!
Man, do you see what I see?"
"I want the middle chick!"
"I want that little chick!"
"Hey, man, save one chick for me!"

Three cool chicks, three cool chicks
They look like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks made three fools of these
Three cool cats, three cool cats

Three cool cats, three cool cats, three cool cats
Three cool cats
