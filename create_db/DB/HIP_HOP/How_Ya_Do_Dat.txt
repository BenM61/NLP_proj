And a mossberg pistol grip pump on my lap at all times

Hollin' bout huh, nigga what, huh, giv a f*ck nigga what
Full of that weed, lick it like a popsicle, a slanted and a janted
Have a nigga named young bleed party on, in the jungle,
Where the murder million mumble for months and dayz
Trippin' off these blunts we blaze, hellin' for high
And tellin' em' why, I'm a neva say die, see it my eyes
And niggas say I fly like a eagle, see no evil
And ain't no sequel to this here, this year I'm bailin' in tha doe
Super natural, wit ends, ya'll niggas don't here me though
But see how they runnin' everythang on tha cool
But they know I'm fittin' to act a fool in this muthafucka
