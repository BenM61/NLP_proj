It began in a moment, the moment's done
I was there when it happened, put on the phone
Then I just stopped to listen, the moment's done
It began in the moment, I drop the phone

Then I just lost the signal, the signal's done
With the room all around me, the dial tone
Then I just tried to number, it said, "Hello"
Then I just lost the signal, the signal's done, I drop the phone

All the people in the circle
All of the phones have a signal on their cell phones
All the people in the circle
All on a phone, how did they know from the middle?

Then I just dropped my cell phone, my cell phone's done
Then I just stopped a minute, the minute's done
Then I just use the land line to call my phone
Then I checked in the voice mail, message 1

Know when and where to hit it, then just say no
Know where and when to hold it, ah yeah, and let it go
Know when and how to feel it to make it glow
Know how and when to suck it and when to blow, I drop the phone

All the people in the circle
All of the phones have a signal on their cell phones
All the people in the circle
All on a phone, how did they know from the middle?

All the people in the circle
All on a phone have the signal on their cell phones
How did they know from the middle like the circle?
All the people in the circle, all on a phone have a signal
On the cell phones in the west coast, in the east coast

On the one stop a second, the second's done
On the one stop a second, the second's done
On the one stop a second, the second's done
On the one stop a second, the second's done
