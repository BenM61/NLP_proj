There ain't no place for me today,
Sure ain't no reason for me to stay,
I'm tired of wasting precious time,
I'm waking up to leave this time

I'm gonna quit this town,
Stop hanging around,
I'm gonna quit this town,
Got my feet on the ground,
I'm gonna quit this town tonight

I ain't no fool but I ain't proud,
And I'm going where the music's loud,
And I'm tired of waiting, keeping in,
And going home for half past ten

I'm gonna quit this town,
Stop hanging around,
I'm gonna quit this town,
Got my feet on the ground,
I'm gonna quit this town tonight

The work I do just bores me sick,
And how I live I just can't pick,
The place I live sure feels like jail,
I got no-one to post my bail

I'm gonna quit this town,
Stop hanging around,
I'm gonna quit this town,
Got my feet on the ground,
I'm gonna quit this town tonight
