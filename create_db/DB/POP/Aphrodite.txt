Can you feel me on your stereo?
Can you feel me on your stereo?
Can you feel me on your stereo?
Oh, can you feel me in your stereo?

This song lets you in
Gonna get back down and up again
I got you on my side
It's just a roller ride
It's the truth, it's a fact
I was gone and now I'm back, yeah

Can you feel me on your stereo?
Can you feel me on your stereo?

I got soul; you can check
In my heart, in my head
I got spirit you can feel
Did you think I wasn't real?
I'm going back and forth and forth and back

Oh, can you feel me on your stereo?
Oh, can you feel me on your stereo?

Oh, I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an Aphrodite, all right
All right, yeah, yeah
I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
Don't you mess with me; you don't wanna fight me, all right
All right, yeah, yeah

Here's what I do
When I know what I can do
I'll let you into my world

With mouth to mouth
And kiss to kiss
Oh, oh

Can you feel me on your stereo?
Ah, can you feel me on your stereo?

You sure you can take me in?
Because this is where the fun begins
I'm gonna feel your heart stop in my hands
I'm going back and forth and forth and back

Oh, can you feel me on your stereo?
Oh, can you feel me on your stereo?

Oh, I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an Aphrodite, all right
All right, yeah, yeah
I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
Don't you mess with me; you don't wanna fight me, all right
All right, yeah, yeah

You know that I'm magical
I am the original
I am the only one to make you feel this way

The moment that you kiss me
You know that you'll miss me
I am the only one

Can you feel me on your stereo?
Can you feel me on your stereo?

Oh, can you feel?

Can you feel me on your stereo?
Oh, can you feel me on your stereo?

I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an Aphrodite
All right, all right

Oh, I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an Aphrodite, all right
All right, yeah, yeah
I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
Don't you mess with me; you don't wanna fight me, all right
All right, yeah, yeah

You know that I'm magical
I am the original
I am the only one to make you feel this way

The moment that you kiss me
You know that you'll miss me
I am the only one
