Ooooh 
I can show you the world 
Shining shimmering splendid 
Tell me princess 
Now when did you last 
Let your heart decide 
I can open your eyes 
Take you wonder by wonder 
Over sideways and under 
On a magic carpet ride 


A whole new world 
A new fantastic point of view 
No one to tell us no 
Or where to go 
We say were only dreaming 
(Katie) 
A whole new world 
A dazzling place I never knew 
But now from way up here 
Its crystal clear 
That now I'm in a whole new world with you 

Unbelieveable sites 
Indescribable feeling 
Soaring tumbling free-wheeling 
Through an endless diamond sky 
A whole new world 
(peter) don't you dare close your eyes 
(katie) a hundered thousand things to see 
(peter) hold your breath it gets better 
(Both) I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far 
(katie) I can't go back to where I used to be 
(peter) a whole new world with new horizons to pursue 
(Both) I'll chase them any where there's time to spare 
(peter) let me share this whole new world with you 

ooh 
Aah 

(katie) a whole new world 
(peter) a whole new world 
(peter) a new fantastic point of view 
(both) no one to tell us no or where to go 
(katie) or say where only dreaming 
(peter) a whole new world 
(katie) every turn a surprise 
(peter) with new horizons to pursue 
(katie) every moment gets better 
(Both) I'll chase them anywhere there's time to spare 
(katie) any where 
(peter) there's time to spare 
(katie) let me share 
(peter) this whole new world 
(katie) with you 
(peter) oo 
(katie) a whole new world 
(peter) a whole new world 
(katie) that's where we will be 
(peter) that's where we will be 
(katie) a thrilling chase 
(peter) a wonderous place 
(Both) for you and me 
(peter) ooo yeah
