Back when I was a freshman
I learned a valuable lesson
A hoe goin' be a hoe and
It don't matter about you stressin'
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down, stainin' her dress
She's making a great big one yes, can I get something off your chest?
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with john
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one (one on one)
One on one

I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

Now that I'm a graduate, she still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
Joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, cool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise,
Shoulda coulda and wit a ohhh
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with john
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one (one on one)
One on one

I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

Ain't talking about commitment, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
Ain't talking about no wedding ring, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
I hope you ain't a gold-diggin bitch, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
But you a find a sexy thing, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop

(OutKast & Khujo Goodie: x2)
I, I don't want no girlfiend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)

I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

(Big Boi)
Girl, bye
I.e., get the hell on, I'm through, make me a sandwich, I love you
Only at this moment, maybe not tomorrow
Kisses, toodles
