Yesterday I heard the rain
Whispering your name
Asking where you'd gone

It fell softly from the clouds
On the silent crowds
As I wandered on

Out of doorways
Black umbrellas came to pursue me
Faceless people as they passed
Were looking through me, no one knew me

Yesterday I shut my eyes
Face-up to the skies
Shrinkin' in the rain

But your image still was there
Floating in the air
Brighter than a flame

Yesterday I saw a city
Full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain
Whispering your name, whispering your name

Yesterday I saw a city
Full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain
Whispering your name, whispering your name, whispering your name
