The earth can quiver and quake
The heavens shiver and shake
But hell hath no fury
Not half the fury
Of a woman whose been scorned

The wind can scream in the night
The rain can teem in the night
But hell hath no fury
Not half the fury
Of a woman whose been scorned

You'll find when she's calm
She's a sly sister 
Her calm is the calm
Before the storm mister
That calm has the feel of a real twister

The only solution 
Is in retribution
That flash of lightning you fear
Will soon be frightening to hear

So don't say you haven't been warned
Hell hath no fury
Not a fraction of the fury
Of a woman
Whose been scorned
