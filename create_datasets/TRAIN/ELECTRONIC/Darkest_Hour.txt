It wasn't meant to be like this
A life for someone else
There's a road to the righteous
That doesn't lead through hell
There's a drop on your eyelid
That stays just for him
There's a scream in your silence
That doesn't let anyone in

Now you don't understand why you stayed
As you wake in the coffin he made you
You're a stone that's been thrown in the lake
Now you sink in, it sinks in

In the top of the tower
The devil he waits, the devil he waits for you
In the darkest of hours
We pray, pray for you
I know you've been locked up there
With no hope anywhere
In the top of the tower
Devil he waits, the devil he waits for you

Now you lay in the ashes
Of the house you built
Out of old books and matches
But you lay there still
In the town of black magic
And they're out to kill
Here's my heart, you can have it
And you always will

Now you don't understand why you stayed
As you wake in the coffin he made you
You're a stone that's been thrown in the lake
Now you sink in, it sinks in

In the top of the tower
The devil he waits, the devil he waits for you
In the darkest of hours
We pray, pray for you
I know you've been locked up there
With no hope anywhere
In the top of the tower
Devil he waits, the devil he waits for you

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

It wasn't meant to be like this
A life for someone else
There's a road to the righteous
That doesn't lead through hell
Oh oh oh

In the top of the tower
The devil he waits, the devil he waits for you
In the darkest of hours
We pray, pray for you
I know you've been locked up there
With no hope anywhere
In the top of the tower
Devil he waits, the devil he waits for you
In the top of the tower
Devil he waits, the devil he waits for you
In the darkest of hours
We pray, pray for you
I know you've been locked up there
But go open your way
In the top of the tower
Devil he waits, the devil he waits for you
