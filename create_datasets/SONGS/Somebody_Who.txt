Can't stay awake, I wonder how long I can fake it.
Outside I wait, I feel my body hesitating.
Can't find a little more time, this world knows how to take it.
Don't even know but I need somebody else to break this.

Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.

You're saying one thing but I just can't see the vision.
Not sitting right with the impression that you're giving.
Sometimes I wish the night could show me what I'm missing.
Hands tied, just act natural, I want.

Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.

Take me over, turn me on.
I can't stop, it's what I want.
Take me over, turn me on.
I can't stop, it's what I want.

Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
Somebody who can stay awake. I need somebody who.
