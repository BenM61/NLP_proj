I read you like an autograph
You love the spotlight
You shoot me like a photograph
You get me uptight

You're gunnin' for me every day
Go straight for the heart
Say you want me, you push me away
Say it tears you apart

You're on the inside
I'm on the outside
Don't matter whose side
You take the other side

I can see you walkin' down the aisle
You're thinkin' long range
I've seen you work the miracle
Mile for loose change

You can have it anyway you want
Your fancy dinners in the restaurants
Even though they leave you hungry inside
It's a free ride

You show your bad side
It's so undignified
Get off your back side
You're talkin' suicide

Go and be what you wanna be
Sink your time and your hooks in me
You can hold me down
Take me 'round and 'round and 'round

You catch me when I'm 'bout to fall
But you leave me there
What really matters doesn't matter at all
You don't care

It's hard to figure in your life
It's a roundabout
You're makin' it so hard to give in
But you won't let me out

You take the right side
I'm on the wrong side
No matter who's side
We're talkin' suicide
