Deep dead blue that I invite
Bringing on disguise of night
Turn the whole kaleidoscope
Deep dead blue
Deep dead blue

Deep dead blue that nightly shades
Most unlikely escapades
As the lights that frighten fade
'Til the dawn drags into view
I'm lost in deep dead blue

Deep dead blue I'd rather stay
Far from the cruel colored day
Leave me in my monochrome
'Til I find a finer hue
Beyond the deep dead blue
