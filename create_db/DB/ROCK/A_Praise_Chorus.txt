Are you going to live your life wondering
Standing in the back looking around?
Are you going to waste your time thinking
How you've grown up
Or how you missed out?

Things are never gonna be the way you want
Where's it going to get you acting serious?
Things are never going to be quite what you want
Even at twenty five you got to start sometime

I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

Are you gonna to live your life standing in the back looking around?
Are you going to waste your time?
Gotta make a move or you'll miss out

Someone's gonna to ask you what it's all about
Stick around nostalgia won't let you down
Someone's gonna to ask you what's it's all about
What are you gonna have to say for yourself?

I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over

Our house in the middle of the street
(Crimson and clover, over and over)
Why did we ever meet
Start in my rock and roll fantasy
(Crimson and clover, over and over)
Don't don't don't let's start
(Crimson and clover, over and over)
Why did we ever part
Kick start my rock and roll heart

I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go

So come on Davey, sing me something that I know
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Here, tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
Here tonight
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight.
