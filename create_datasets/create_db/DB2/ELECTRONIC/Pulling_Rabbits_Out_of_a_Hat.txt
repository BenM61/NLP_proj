I'll grab the sun and the moon
I'll hold the world in my hand
These things are easy for me
I can't make you understand

Pulling rabbits out of a hat
All I get is polite applause
Applause, applause, applause, applause

Marvel at heaven and hell
Gasp at the Champs-Elysees
Raise the Titanic and then
I see you turning away

Pulling rabbits out of a hat
All I get is polite applause
Applause, applause, applause, applause

Entertaining, that's the word I get from you
Entertaining, and then you bid a fond adieu
Well, adieu
I'll make a pauper a king
I'll turn your water to wine
These things are easy for me
How come I can't change your mind

Pulling rabbits out of a hat
All I get is polite applause
Applause, applause, applause, applause
