I'm goin' out walkin'
Walking down through the park
I'm goin' out walkin'
Walking down through the park
I'm gonna walk in the moonlight
Wait until the night gets dark

I'm goin' out walkin'
Down the old avenue
I'm goin' out walkin'
Down the old avenue
I'm gonna walk for so long
Till she don't know what to do

I'm goin' out walkin'
Walkin' down on the street
I'm goin' out walkin'
Walkin' down on the street
I'm gonna walk her right beside me 'cause I
Know she can't be beat

Don't bother my baby
No tellin' what she'll do
Don't you bother my baby
No tellin' what she'll do
Now, the girl she may cut you
She may shoot you too
