Would you believe me if I told you that I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to make you sad
When I heard that you were leaving home to travel
I didn't get a chance to take it back, but what I wanna know is

How was London, how was Crete?
How was Amsterdam and gay Parie
How was Barcelona and Sicily?
Did you spare a little thought for me
Did you spare a little thought for me
(Oh Angelene)
Did you spare a little thought for me

Do you remember when we queued outside forever?
Just to go and get ID'd
I walked you home - you blagged a bottle of Sambucca
And you tasted of Aniseed

But what I wanna know is...

How was London, how was Crete?
How was Amsterdam and gay Parie
How was Barcelona and Sicily?
Did you spare a little thought for me
(Oh Angelene)
Did you spare a little thought for me
(Oh Angelene)
Did you spare a little thought for me

I saw your dad last week
He told me you got married
He was glad you settled down
I told him if you ever came back home to visit
To ask you to pop around

'Cus what I wanna know is...

How was London, how was Crete?
How was Amsterdam and gay Parie
How was Barcelona and Sicily?
Did you spare a little thought for me
(Oh Angelene)
Did you spare a little thought for me
(Oh Angelene)
How was London, how was Crete?
How was Amsterdam and gay Parie
How was Barcelona and Sicily?
Did you spare a little thought for me
(Oh Angelene)
Did you spare a little thought for me
