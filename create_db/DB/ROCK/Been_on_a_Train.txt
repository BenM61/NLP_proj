Been on a train
And did you hear the whistle blow?
Been on a train north
Baby did you hear the whistle blow?
I saw a man take a needleful of hard drug
And die slow.

Been on a train
And I'm never gonna be the same.

There's a bright light in the north wind
Gonna bring you home
Mister there's a bright light in the north wind
It's gonna bring you home
He said: "Sweet darling woman
Leave me alone".

Been on a train
And I'm never gonna be the same.

You got more tracks on you baby
Than the tracks of this train
You got no guts, no gospel
And you got no brains
He said: "I got just one thing
Gonna soothe my pain?"
No, no
Damn you mister
And I dragged him out the door
Damn you mister
And I dragged him out the door.

He died in the morning sun
And I ain't going north no more.

I suspect there's a train
Going north in a month or two
I still hear his words
He said: "There's nothing left to say or do"
But mister you were wrong
And I'm gonna sing my song for you.

Been on a train
And I'm never gonna be the same.
