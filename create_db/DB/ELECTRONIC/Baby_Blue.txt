Boxing shadows in my sleep 
It's the company I keep 
The perfect exercise 
As I grow older 

I can't believe what God has done 
He took the heat out of the sun 
And now it seems the world 
Is growing colder 

Between the pleasure and the pain 
Wishing your life away 
No more sinister than sane 
Briefing your life away 
Between the flicker and the flame 
No one can explain 
Baby blue is born again 

I'm looking for some place to go 
Sucking out screams in stereo 
Before my bare eyes 
I saw her drowning 

Keep my daughter in a jar 
She can't get out she won't go far 
My heart is in my mouth 
But still keep pounding 

Between the pleasure and the pain 
Wishing your life away 
No more sinister than sane 
Briefing your life away 
Between the flicker and the flame 
No one can explain 
Baby blue is born again 

Between the pleasure and the pain 
Wishing your life away 
No more sinister than sane 
Briefing your life away 
Between the flicker and the flame 
No one can explain 
Baby blue is born again
