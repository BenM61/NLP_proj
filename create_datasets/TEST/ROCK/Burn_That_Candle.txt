Keep that candle burnin' birght, mother
I'll be kinda late tonight, mother
There's a yellow moon above, mother
Shinin' on the one I love, mother

Burn that candle, night and day
Burn that candle, light our way
Keep that doorway open wide
Until we come slowly strolling side by side

While that candle's burnin' high, mother
I'll be with my sugar pie, mother
We'll be comin' home you know, mother
Lookin' for that candle glow, mother

Burn that candle, night and day
Burn that candle, light our way
Keep that doorway open wide
Until we come slowly strolling side by side

After we have had the wedding, mother
To that candle we'll be heading, mother
So, before we're wining, dining, mother
Start that candle light a shining, mother

Burn that candle, night and day
Burn that candle, light our way
Keep that doorway open wide
Until we come slowly strolling side by side

Until we come slowly strolling side by side
'Till I'm strolling through that doorway with my bride
