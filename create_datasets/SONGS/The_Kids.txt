Drug boy said it's show time
Streets don't give a damn
They filled with such pollution
The kids don't stand a chance

We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're fill with so much hatred
The kids don't stand a chance

I said the kids don't,
The kids don't stand,
The kids don't stand a chance
I said the kids don't,
The kids don't stand,
The kids don't stand a chance

Well, since I was planted at birth
I abandoned my own planet and I landed on earth
As I kid I never understood what I observed n'
Some of it was strange but most of it disturbed me
Always in detention for the lack of my attention
You could call it deficit, really I just didn't listen
And I was always missin'
The teachers like, where is Bobby Simmons?
But tryna get a record deal is all I can I remember
It's funny cause lookin' back on the past
That I had all my days in the streets tryna prove that I was bad
I still elevated to the level that I'm at
Still elevated to the level that I'm at

We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're fill with so much hatred
The kids don't stand a chance

I said the kids don't,
The kids don't stand,
The kids don't stand a chance
I said the kids don't,
The kids don't stand,
The kids don't stand a chance

Sometimes it's hard to grow
While livin' in fear of the unknown
How can he ever give love
When no love is in his heart?
A child can barely sleep at night
To worry 'bout tomorrow
And what it beholds,
He drowns himself
Deep down in his sorrow
Will you run or will you share your light
Tell a story of the live and try
See it when we're given hope
That we know that we can grow

We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're fill with so much hatred
The kids don't stand a chance

I said the kids don't,
The kids don't stand,
The kids don't stand a chance
I said the kids don't,
The kids don't stand,
The kids don't stand a chance
