I've never been afraid of the highest heights
Or afraid of flying now
I've never been afraid of the wildest fights
Not afraid of dying
But now I want off this ride 'cause your scaring me and I don't like where were going
I need a new fun fair 'cause your scaring me and I don't like where were going

And now you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I guarantee you'll miss me 'cause you changed the way you kiss me
'Cause you changed the way you kiss me

We used to be so so soulful
Al Green on the background vocals
T total were on the next high
We get by with a so called soul mate made for each other chit chat
But that dried up wise up to the cutting edge facts
Now I'm chilling on my Jack Jones
Looking for a way back home but I can't get back

Our love feels wrong please wind it back
Our love feels wrong cant hide the cracks
I guarantee you'll miss me 'cause you changed the way you kiss me

I've never been afraid of the highest heights
Or afraid of flying now
I've never been afraid of the wildest fights
Not afraid of dying
I need a new fun fair 'cause your scaring me and I don't like where were going
I guarantee you'll miss me 'cause you changed the way you kiss me

Our love feels wrong please wind it back
Our love feels wrong cant hide the cracks
I guarantee you'll miss me 'cause you changed the way you kiss me
I guarantee you'll miss me 'cause you changed the way you kiss me
