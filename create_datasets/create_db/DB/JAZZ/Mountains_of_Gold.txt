It's much louder than before
Can you hear me?
Who were we before?
It's much louder than before
When we lived 10 thousand lives?
Can you hear me?
I would like to know
It's much louder than before
All the secrets of our tribes
Can you hear me?

Mountains of gold (It's much louder than before)
Diamonds and pearls
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know (Can you hear me?)
Arrows and bows (It's much louder than before)
Gunshots in the snow
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know (Can you hear me?)

Only thing we learned from history class
Nah, we ain't learned from the past
Build it up, burn it down, leave it as ash
Build it up, burn it down, build it up, burn it down
Damn, man, it turns into a reason to laugh
Think about the cats leading the pack
At least half got
Clapped, scrapped, meeting they match
Slow down, no numbers, don't believe in the facts
That I spew when I'm reading these raps
All I know is what I see, I'm seeing bridges get burned
And then I see lessons get learned after that
On a smaller level out in Parkchester in the six just skipped
Thinking last time I ditched my chick
Man, it really ain't shit as big as the bridge
But goddamn, man, this cycle is sick
Goddamn, man, this cycle is sick
Goddamn, man, this cycle is sick, ya heard?

We'll spread the love that we all deserve
Chasing this global pain undisturbed
We'll have faith
It's much louder than before
What comes around, goes around someday

Mountains of gold (It's much louder than before)
Diamonds and pearls
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know (Can you hear me?)
Arrows and bows (It's much louder than before)
Gunshots in the snow
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know

It's much louder than before
Can you hear me?
It's much louder than before
Can you hear me?
It's much louder than before
Can you hear me?
