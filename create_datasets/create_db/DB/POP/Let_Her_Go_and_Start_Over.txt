Trapped in a love for years 
And now I think I've found the real thing 
And when I think about your tears 
And all the joy that true love can bring 
What can I do? I gotta find a way to tell you 
What can I say? 'cause I don't want to break your heart 

Let her go and start over 
There ain't nothing that I can do 
Let her go and start over 
Baby, it's up to you 
Let her go and start over 
There ain't nothing that you can say 
Let her go and start over 
How can I tell you, baby? 
After all the good times we've seen? 
I know I gotta leave but maybe 
You think I'm trying to be mean 
What can I do? Now I know I love another? 

What can I say? It hurts you when I say I love her 
What can I do to be fair to me to be fair to you? 
My friends tell me
