As another day lays down its head
I sit here reading by your light
My mind is singing
With all we've said
Scared at how final it can be
For wrong and right
Are not black and white
Everything falls in the middle
Oh self doubt
Surrounds you in the night
You suddenly find yourself running
Keep out the people
Keep out the day
Let us begin by beginning
The secret of the future's never told
Let us begin by beginning
Let us begin by beginning
