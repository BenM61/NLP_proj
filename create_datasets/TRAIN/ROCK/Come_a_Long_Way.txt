I kicked in his door at five a.m.,
"I've come for my bike" I told the repo man.
My 920's gonna take me far today,
You can travel for miles and never leave L.A.

I've come a long way,
I've come a long way,
I've gone five hundred miles today.
I've come a long way,
I've come a long way,
And never even left L.A.

I drive by the Plaza where the gay boys pose,
Stand in their windows wearing no clothes.
I heard the screams of the dying dark,
Through the sweet green icing of MacArthur Park.
And then I crossed the river into East L.A.
Pescado mojado me encontre.
And I've giving up on rock 'n roll,
And I'm saving up for norteno.
The river she runs by the railroad tracks,
I swear I'll never take it back.
A train, she cries on the midnight hour,
All along the Watts Tower.
Oh

I've come a long way,
I've come a long way,
I've gone five hundred miles today.
I've come a long way,
I've come along way,
And never even left L.A.

I gunned it down to San Pedro Bay,
Watched my ship sail in, watched her sail away.
The sun was sinking into the sea.
But a ball of fire inside of me,
Was burning my motor and driving me hard,
Past the big hair on the Boulevard.
And up Mulholland where I made the scene,
Like the one that took little Jimmy Dean.
And then I shimmied up Wilshire like a little silk worm,
Past the rodeo and the pachyderm.
And then I stopped for coffee at an art cafe,
I saw the repo man and made my getaway.
Doing the Eagle Rock,
Heading for the hills.
Oh try to let my engines cool.
And it is not my fault that this town shakes,
I saw the falling rock and I hit my brakes.

I've come a long way,
I've come a long way,
I've gone five hundred miles today.
I've come a long way,
I've come along way,
And never even left L.A.

Now you tow it to the repo man's front door,
And you give him these keys, I don't need them no more.
You tow it to the repo man's front door,
And you give him these keys, I don't need them no more.

I've come a long way,
I've come a long way,
Gone five hundred miles today.
I've come a long way,
I've come along way,
And never even left L.A.
I've come a long way,
I've come a long way,
I've gone five hundred miles today.
I've come a long way,
I've come along way,
And never even left L.A.
And never even left L.A.
And never even left L.A.
