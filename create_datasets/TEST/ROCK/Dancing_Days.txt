Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

I said it's alright, You know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Crazy ways are evident
In the way that you're wearing your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

You told your mamma I'd get you home
But you didn't say I had no car
I saw a lion he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

I said it's alright, You know it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
