If a lie as love
Tell me what you'd do
If the people that you knew
Seemed different to you

If a lie was love
All of us would change 
Lives would re-arrange
It's really not so strange

What did lies ever do to you, my friend?
They're the keepers of truth
They'll be with you till the bitter end

If a lie was love
Worlds would just collide
Nothing could survive
No matter how we tried

If a lie was love
Love would be a lie
In the blinking of an eye
A rift in space and time

What did lies ever do to you, my friend?
They're the keepers of truth 
The right lie can seal your fate
That's all it takes

The right lie can seal your fate
That's all it takes

If a lie was love 
If a lie was love 
If a lie was love 
Be careful what you say
