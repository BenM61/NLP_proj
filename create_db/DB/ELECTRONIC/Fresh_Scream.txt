To all these rappers I apologize
I know it ain't fair
The only ball I drop
New Years, Times Square
The world is mine
Sixth sense
I see the seven signs
Now baby
Let's get started for life

Every time I look into your eyes
(Mr Worldwide)
I feel i can, can stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) We can get started for life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) We can get started

You know it feels right
Big news, Pitbull
Tom Cruise, Mumbai
All it up like 4th of July, Vanilla Sky
Thrilla in Manilla
Knocking 'em out like Pacquiao
New Ali, new Frazier
But for now it's off to Malaysia
Two pa**ports, three cities,
Two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide
If you think it's a game, let's play
Dale

Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I can, can stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) We can get started for life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) We can get started

You know it feels right
I am what they thought I'd never become
I believed and became it
Now I'm here to claim it
I hustle anything, you name it, name it
I went from evictions to food stamps
To back in work, what damn
To a pa**port, flooded with stamps
Now slowly, everywhere I land
Two pa**ports, three cities,
Two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide
If you think it's a game, let's play
Dale

'Cause if it feels right
We shouldn't waste any more time
Let's get started (Let's get started)
Don't think about it (Let's get started)
You know I'm gonna make it alright, alright (Just go)
Cause if it feels right
You know I've made up my mind
Let's get started (Let's get started)
Don't think about it (Let's get started)
I know that we can make it alright, alright
Every time I look into your eyes
I feel i can, can stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) We can get started for life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) For life
(Tonight) We can get started

Don't start what you can't finish
