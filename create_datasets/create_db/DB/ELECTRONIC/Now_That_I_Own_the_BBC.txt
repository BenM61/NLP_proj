What was I thinking, what was I thinking, what was I thinking,
what could I have been thinking.
It's going one time, it's going two times, sold to the gent
who wears the stunned expression.
As I took it off their hands, a five pound note was changinghands.
I had plans, I had plans

Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to do with that thing
Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to make of this thing

All this power, all this glory, all these DJ's and all theselorries
What was I thinking, what was I thinking, what was I thinking
What could I have been thinking
Hey Rupert Murdoch, help me out
I'm flying blind, I'm flying blind
You know the way to lay things out, for the refined andunrefined.

Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to do with that thing
Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to make of this thing
Hey Ted Turner, help me out
I'm flying blind, I'm flying blind
You know the way to lay things out, to colorize and still feelfine.

Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to do with that thing
Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to make of this thing
Make of it what you will, make of it what you will, make of itwhat you will
make of it what you will
Should we go brighter, should we go lighter, should we gowhiter
Go left or righter
What was I thinking, what was i thinking, what was I thinking
I wasn't thinking, what could I have been thinking.

Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to do with that thing
Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to make of this thing
Make of it what you will, make of it what you will, make of itwhat you will
Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to do with that thing
Now that I own the BBC
What am I supposed to make of this thing
