Listen to me 

Do you know how much you want it? 
You're trying to be cool about it 
You're trying to big about it 
You're constantly just denying 
You're like a moth to a flame 
You hardly wane 
But listen 'cause I know what I'm saying 

He's trying to catch you in it 
And then he'll back you in it 
'Cause he's just another girl addict 
And if you give it away 
You've gotta be crazy...crazy

[Chorus:]
Stop! 
You better shake him off 
Before he gets ya 
(He's coming to getcha, he's coming to getcha) 
Stop! 
He'll only build you up 
And then he'll getcha 
He's dirty to the bone - beware of the dog! 

I was damn near addicted 
I got into trouble with him, I got in the bubble with him 
Everything was just how he wanted 
Oh but then I got wise 
I got out of sight 
So take my advice 

[Chorus: Repeat 2X] 

I know you hear me 
I know you hear me - I know you hear me!
Arr! Arr! 

You better reach out and touch me! 
(Reach out and touch me) 

[Chorus: Repeat 4X] 

Beware of the dog... 
Beware of the dog... 
Beware of the dog...
