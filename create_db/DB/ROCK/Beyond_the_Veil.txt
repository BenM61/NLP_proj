Not fear, nor tears can reach me now
The light seems so clear as the night fades away
Behold of thy flame, below of all shame
Come conquer me sweet dreams of paradise

Dusk drawn hither to my evening star
A glance in thy mirror
The trance of thy mirror
Venus... through the looking glass

Dance so frail and lost in the fields afar
Cast off thy mourning
Clasp life and glory
Venus... through the looking glass

The sense of angels in veils of dawn
Like she runs forever among thy halls
The pale horizons are closing down
The reasons for living are lost somehow

Cross my heart with a glance upon the star of riddance
Drift afar like teardrops on the Stygian River

I'm the nightfall and wizard that summon thee
You're the blizzard that drape my eyes
I'm thy sorrow and vein of obscurity
You're the dagger that cuts

Shivers on the bleak horizon
Profound words... you're my frailty

See the light cease in thy life
Profound words... hurting me
