Wake up in the moring feel the sun shine on my face
It's a perfect day to get up and hang with my friends
Hit em' on the two way and I tell them I'll be their
Before five Feelings right mood is right and I can't
Wait to have fun in the warm.

(Chorus)Sunny days lovely days gonna chase those gray skies all away
Gonna do whatever we want do whatever we do. don't you wanna do it too Sunny
Days lovely days gonna chase those skies all away gonna play whatever we want
Do whatever we do its all about feeling good

Driving in my drop wind blowing through my hair seekers wanna stop and stay
Talkin bout ooh baby can I give you all my time Talkn' bout' ooh baby can I
Give you all my time

(chorus)Sunny days lovely days gonna chase those gray skies all away gonna
Do whatever we want do whatever we do don't you wanna do it too
Sunnydays lovelydays gonna chase those gray skies all away gonna play whatever
We want do whatever we do its all about feeling good

Sunnyday.. lovelyday.. wish I had more of these days
Sunnydays.. lovelydats.. wish I had more of these days

Repeat Chorus 2x till end
