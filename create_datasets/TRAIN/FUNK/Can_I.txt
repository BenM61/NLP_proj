The night is almost over
So I'm
What about
Can I tuck you in?
Can I fluff your pillow?
Can I sing you a lullaby?
Come on baby
Can I, can I have breakfast in bed?
Can I give you that feeling?
Can we share a sunrise together?

Where are you sleeping, baby
What are you doing, honey
When are you leaving, I gotta know?
Not talking dirty, baby
But it's 1 30 AM
And neither one of us needs to be alone
So can I?

Can I tuck you in?
Can I fluff your pillow?
Can I sing you a lullaby, can I?
Can I have breakfast in Bed?
Can I give you that feeling?
Can I show you the sunrise, can I?

This is the last dance, baby
Could be our last chance
And we may not see one another ever again
So I'll sing into your ear mama
While everyone does the cha-cha
Until we're lovers, can we pretend?
So can I?

Can I tuck you in?
Can I fluff your pillow?
Can I sing you a lullaby, can I?
Can I have breakfast in Bed?
Can I give you that feeling?
Can I show you the sunrise, can I?

Baby can I?
Can I, can I baby?
Oh baby, can I? (Oh)
Please baby can I?
(Need to know now)

Can I, can I baby?
Oh baby, can I? (oh yeah)
Please baby can I?
(Baby won't you tell me can I?)

Can I, can I baby?
Oh baby, can I? (Oh)
Please baby can I?
(Baby tell me can I?)

Can I, can I baby?
Oh, baby, can I?

It's on tonight, lady please can I?

Can I tuck you in?
Can I fluff your pillow?
Can I sing you a lullaby, can I?
Can I have breakfast in Bed?
Can I give you that feeling?
Can I show you the sunrise, can I?

Can I tuck you in?
Can I fluff your pillow?
Can I sing you a lullaby, can I?
Can I have breakfast in Bed?
Can I give you that feeling?
Can I show you the sunrise, can I?

Can I tuck you in?
Can I fluff your pillow?
Can I sing you a lullaby, can I?
Can I have breakfast in Bed?
Can I give you that feeling?
Can I show you the sunrise, can I?

Breakfast in bed
Can I give you that feeling?
Can I show you the sunrise?
Can I?

Can I show you the sunrise?
Can I?
