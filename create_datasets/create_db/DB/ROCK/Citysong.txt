i'm taking the side streets
and i'm cruising down the alleyways
and i'm feeling the cool breeze
across my face
i'm losing to find
and i'm breaking to fix
cause i'm not fit to go on like this
music in my head
the rhythm keeps me fed
these sounds surround me
in these in high frequencies
there's no place like home
there's no place like home
stone alone 
in the city of bastard roots
 
when i'm about to go crazy
cause i'm still living here
i just get my friends together
and we dance, dance, dance
cause this is the state of the world
this is the state of the world
this city tells me what it's like to live

hey bike messenger
what's your name?
have you got the time
to talk to me?
tell you what.
we'll sit on this here stoop
and talk all about you
we'll just keep sitting here
til you roll on through.

when i'm about to go crazy
cause i'm still living here
i just get my friends together
and we dance, dance, dance
cause this is the state of the world
this is the state of the world
this city tells me what it's like to live
cause this is the state of the world 
cause this is the state of the world
cause this is the state of the world 
cause this is the state of the world

serpico he's still around
screwed up police ya might
get found
city crime's for city cops
you've got to know 
the streets you rock
the subway tells the story here
this is the place to disappear

cause this is the state of the world 
cause this is the state of the world
cause this is the state of the world 
cause this is the state of the world
and i'll die in my open mind
i live in my open mind
and i'll die in my open mind
i live in my open mind
and i'll die in my open mind
i live in my open mind
and i'll die in my open mind
