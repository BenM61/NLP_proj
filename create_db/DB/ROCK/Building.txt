No I don't just hate everyone 
No I don't just hate everything 
You know I won't just love anything 
You know I won't just love everything 
Baby... love is building, 
Our lives are building 
Hate is a building torn down 
Love is building, 
You know we didn't know what to think,
You knew all along we would work it all out, 
You know we didn't know what to believe 
Baby... love is building, 
Our lives are building 
Hate is a building burned down 
Love is building 
WERE YOU
IN DOUBT
OF A NEW DAY, 
YOU LIFTED
MY DOUBT
OF A NEW DAY
Building,
Love is building, 
Building 
Love is building 
Building.
Love is building
BUILDING...BUILDING...BUILDING
