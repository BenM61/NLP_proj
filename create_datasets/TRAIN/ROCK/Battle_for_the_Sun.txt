I, I, I, will battle for the sun, sun, sun
And I, I, I won't stop until I'm done, done, done
You, you, you are getting in the way, way, way
And I, I, I have nothing left to say, say, say

I, I, I, I, I  will brush off all the dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt
And I, I, I, I, I will pretend it didn't hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt
You, you, you, you, you are a black and heavy weight,
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight
And I, I, I, I, I will not participate, pate, pate, pate, pate, pate, pate, pate

Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover

I, I, I will battle for the sun, sun, sun, sun
'Cause I I I have stared down the barrel of a gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
No falling
You you you you you are a cheap and nasty fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
And I, I, I, I, I, am the bones you couldn't break
Break, break, break, break, break, break, break

Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover

Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover

Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover

I, I, I will battle for the sun
