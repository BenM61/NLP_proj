Well, you can't sleep in my bed no more
Well, you can't ride in my car
I won't let you cook for me, baby
It's never gonna get that far

Gonna send you back to wherever
The hell it was you came
Then I'm gonna get this tattoo
Changed to another girl's name

[Chorus]
Oh, it ain't no fun no more
I don't know what to say
The honeymoon is over, baby
It's never gonna be that way again

Well, you can't borrow my shirts no more
You can't make love to me
This ain't gonna be your gig no more
Ain't the way it's gonna be

I should have left you, baby
Back in that last town
'Cause the kind of fool you made me girl
I'll never live it down

[Chorus]

Well, you can't sleep in my bed no more
Well, you can't ride in my car
I won't let you cook for me, baby
It's never gonna get that far

Gonna send you back to wherever
The hell it was you came
Then I'm gonna get this tattoo
Changed to another girl's name

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
