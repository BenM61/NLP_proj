Sandy lost her head to a man with no heart
Lately I know 'cause I inflicted his scar
I'm not ashamed I was not to blame
It was purely self-defence, one shot that sucker down in flame

We love that cold cash
Love that cold hard cash
Won't mess around with American Express
I'm living that low life
I love that sweet low life
Glad I'm not mad you know
It's just too bad about Sandy

Sandy lost her mind
It's a family disease
Every little sister gotta have what she pleases
I don't forbid her but I don't feel nice
Who would've thought that lightning
Could strike this family twice

I love that cold cash
Love that cold hard cash
Won't mess around with American Express
I'm living that low life
I love that sweet low life
Glad I'm not mad you know
It's just too bad about Sandy

Sandy lost her pride
Asked me for advice
I said, "Honey, can't be love if you've gotta ask twice"
Sandy went blind
Couldn't see what kind of man
Would have her countin' pennies
While she's sittin' on the can

They love that cold Cash
Love that cold hard cash
Won't mess around with American Express
I'm living that low life
I love that sweet low life
Glad I'm not mad you know
It's just too bad about Sandy

Love that cold cash
They love that cold hard Cash
Won't mess around with American Express
I'm living that Lowe life
I love that sweet low life
Glad I'm not mad you know
It's just too bad about Sandy
They love that cold hard cash
Won't mess around with American Express
I'm living that low life
I love that sweet Lowe life
Glad I'm not mad you know
It's just too bad about Sandy
