Feel it
Feel me there tonight
With every beating
With every the light

I go that you cut the
And forever lost in paradise

Spread a little love
If we spread a little love will never die
Spread a little love
If we spread a little love will never die

Under moving eyes
Your desires he don't grow with every sound
Like a color eyes
And forever lost in paradise

Spread a little love
If we spread a little love will never die
Spread a little love
If we spread a little love will never die
