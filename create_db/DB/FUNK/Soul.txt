Never saw myself floating without you friend
Now you wanna go out on your own
Well, where you wanna be, it's not for me
You'll have to, alone

Like my father said, I just can't sell my soul
And my mother said, I just can't sell my soul
And my brother said, I just can't sell my soul
And my sister said, I just can't sell my soul
And the haters said, shhh
And my baby said, you just can't sell your soul
And the people said, I just can't sell my soul
No, no price on my soul

I went deep inside myself, 
And there, I found this music
With a melody, so sincere
A message, for all to share

'Cause my father said, I just can't sell my soul
And my mother said, I just can't sell my soul
And my brother said, I just can't sell my soul
And my sister said, I just can't sell my soul
And the haters said, shhh
And my baby said, you just can't sell your soul
And the people said, I just can't sell my soul
No, no price on my soul
Aha, aaa, aha, aaa, aha, 

'Cause my father said, I just can't sell my soul
And my mother said, I just can't sell my soul
And my brother said, I just can't sell my soul
And my sister said, I just can't sell my soul
And the haters said, shhh
And my baby said, you just can't sell your soul
And the people said, I just can't sell my soul
No, no price on my soul
