Hit it maestro
Duck rock

All join hands and circle south
A little bit of moonshine in your mouth
Hold your hoe and resashay
Come on back the other way

First couple out to the couple on the right
Circle up four for half the night

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock a hole in the old tin can

Circle up two and buckle up four
Away you go around the floor

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock a hole in the old tin can

Circle up two and buckle up four
Away you go around the floor

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock a hole in the old tin can

And everybody swing
Swing her high
Swing her low
Swing the gal in calico
Promenade around you go
Promenade

Next couple out to the couple on the right
Circle up four for half the night

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock a hole in the old tin can

Circle up two and buckle up four
Away you go around the floor

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock that hole in the old tin can

Circle up two and buckle up four
Away you go around the floor

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock a hole in the old tin can

And everybody swing
Swing her high
Swing her low
Swing the gal in calico
Promenade around you go
Promenade

Fourth couple out to the couple on the right
Circle up four for half the night

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock a hole in the old tin can

Circle up two and buckle up four
Away you go around the floor

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock a hole in the old tin can

Circle up two and buckle up four
Away you go around the floor

Duck for the oyster, duck, duck, duck
Dig for the clam, dig, dig, dig
Knock that hole in the old tin can

Allemande left as you go around
With a big foot up and a little foot down
Like an Indian walking on the frozen ground

Hey sift your meal and mix your dough
Save your heel, tap your toe
Take your honey and walk her slow

Promenade
You know where
And I don?t care
Take your honey to a nice, soft chair.
