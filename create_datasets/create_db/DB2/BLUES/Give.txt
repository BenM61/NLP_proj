Didn't really want to say
What I said to you today
'Cause I feel I'm givin' in

But if life's a game we play
Then I made a move today
And I know I'm givin' in

Words that can sound so empty
Something that you said so easy
Make it midnight everyday

In this world, I'm livin' in
Is the truth so hard to find?
And if love is givin' in
Then I do it all the time

Now I've seen you wash your hands
While you do the best you can
And I've watched you turn away
Afraid that love's a price you pay

Why do we run so fast
Trying to forget the past?
We forget to live today

In this world, I'm livin' in
Is the truth so hard to find?
In this world, I'm livin' in
Is it cruel or is it kind?

In this world we're livin' in
Is the truth so hard to find?
And if love is givin' in
Is it cruel or is it kind?

Oh down, I seldom topple down, topple down
In this world (Incomprehensible)
(Incomprehensible)
Don't find, take your time
Talk about love sometime
