Behold this night, still and clear
You look here just like an angel sleeping
I wish I could ease your fears 
I would catch the diamond tears you're weeping
In your eyes I would hide 
By your side I could defy 
The forces tearing us apart 
But reality, as it seems 
Looking back, is that our dream
Was fated from the start 

Girl we're star-crossed and can't escape
We're condemned and can only wait
At this time now it's far too late
To save us from our fate

I'll remain in your hold
Body, mind, heart and soul
As long as I breathe
Though consequence takes its toll
All is out of our control
That's how it will be
So close your eyes my young bride
Listen to me one last time
There's something I have to say
When your faith turns to despair 
Always will my love be there 
And never fade away

Girl we're star-crossed and can't escape 
We're condemned and can only wait 
At this time now it's far too late 
To save us from our fate 
You can't save us 
You can't save us

Girl we're star-crossed and can't escape 
We're condemned and can only wait 
At this time now it's far too late 
The poison's in our veins 
It's true 
You know that I'd die for you 
You know that I'd die for you 
You know that I'd die for you

Forever true 
I'll see you through
