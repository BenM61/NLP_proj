You are the one 
Who has done me in 
Guess you knew from the start
I call again, but there's no one in 
Don't know where
With whom you've been 
But I do love you
Any way you want me to

And you are the one
Now the state I'm in! 
Catching you was so hard 
I fought for you
Did you let me win?
You don't even care
You don't care where I've been 
But I do love you
Any way you want me to

You are the one

I've done all I can do
All the letters I've sent through
Put my life in the palms of your hand
Maybe now you can see
That it's got to be me 
If you leave me 
I'll understand, yeah
If you leave me
I'll understand

Oh, you are the one 
Who has done me in 
Guess you knew from the start 
I call your friends
But there's no one in 
Catching you is so hard 

You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You, you are the one
You are the one
