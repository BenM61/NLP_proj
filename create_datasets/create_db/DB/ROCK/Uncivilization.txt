Population control. The only alternative left was to increase the death rate,
No one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution,
Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
Discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
Very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
Would absolve the decision-makers of guilt, something that could be blamed
Upon Mother Nature. The answer, a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
Does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
World health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on death row
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate, come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own
Motherfucker you're wrong, your on your own

We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights

Population control 
Population control

Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.

Rip their arms off from limb to limb
Make them regret they thought they would win
Cut their tongues out to stop spreading lies
Their poisonous venom has kept me blind
Open your eyes don't you realize
Come together, it's time we rise

We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights

Population Control 

Population Control

The vaccine was administered by the world health organization.

We all go to fight for our rights
Stand against those opposed
We all go to fight for our rights

The cure will be administered to the survivors when it is decided
That enough people have died.
