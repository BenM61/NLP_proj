Say you try 
But you just can't help your self
want to feel special
Man want to make you feel like everybody else
Take away your freedom
Strip away your pride
Say you know you weren't born
With the blue blood son
So take your place in line

Where's my mule?
Where's my forty acres
Where's my dream
Mr Emancipator
Live this way
Might as well meet my maker
Where's my mule?
Where's my mule?

I say trust me
But you say it's too much bother
Yeah, the way the man try to beat you down
Make you want to kill your brother
So go on and bust me
For what's in my mason jar
Yeah, I owes my soul
To the company store
How I'm doing so far?

Where's my mule?
Where's my forty acres
Where's my dream
Mr Emancipator
Live this way
Might as well meet my maker
Where's my mule?
Where's my mule? 

Where's my mule?
Where's my forty acres
Where's my dream
Mr Emancipator
Live this way
Might as well meet my maker
Where's my, my, my, my, my, my mule?
