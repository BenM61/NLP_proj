I feel so estranged
Fear runs around my brain
I had to leave
I could not stand the heat

They look at me with scorn
One more dead life was born
Formed from the clay
Of their unhappy ways

One word can just describe
Modern life comes to mind
This word alone
Puts the ache in my bones

It's weirdness
My dear
The weirdness
Is here
Weirdness
Weirdness

My, all this atmosphere
Chills my desire dear
You're so attractive
And I am a man

Like the guy in Psycho
Voices tell me hello
There's death and danger here
For something is queer

One word can just describe
Modern life comes to mind
This word alone
It's the ache in my bones

It's weirdness
My dear
The weirdness
Is here
Weirdness
Weirdness

The weirdness
The weirdness
The weirdness
The weirdness
The weirdness
