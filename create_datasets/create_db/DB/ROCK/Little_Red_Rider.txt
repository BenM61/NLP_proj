Little red rider, ride on the railroad
There she goes
Little red rider, ride on the railroad
Wave goodbye

So long sunshine, ride away
I know you'll come back someday
And relax my mind

Little Miss Red's asleep on the railroad
There she goes
Little Miss Red's asleep on the railroad
No one knows
That little Miss Red is little Miss Blue
And she looks a lot like you around the eyes

Nobody was home in time
Oh, nobody was home in time
Nobody was hom in the time I called home
Somebody said they all had drowned

Bye bye, sweet miss, give me one kiss
And then I'll go
Bye bye, sweet miss, give me one kiss
Don't let it show
Then turn your brown eyes to the wall
Was that message there before?
You were so wise

Bye bye, sweet miss, give me one kiss
And then I'll go
Bye bye, sweet miss, give me one kiss
Don't let it show
Then turn your brown eyes to the wall
Was that message there before?
You were so wise
