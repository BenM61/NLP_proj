Girl if you're asking
What it would take
I can shed some light
Have understanding
Forgive my mistakes
Treat me good
Treat me right
Make my heart beat out of control
And lift me up when I'm feeling low

Give me one love
That I can believe
Worthy of my trust
And faithful deeds
Tell me now baby
Your heart is true
And you want one love
The way that I do

Girl I've been cheated
Treated so wrong
Though I gave my best
Now I want something
I can count on
Something maybe
You possess

Making promises is easily done
I've got to know
I can count on someone

Give me one love
That I can believe
Worthy of my trust
And faithful deeds
Tell me now baby
Your heart is true
And you want one love
The way that I do

Making promises is easily done
I've got to know
I can count on someone

Give me one love
That I can believe
Worthy of my trust
And faithful deeds
Tell me now baby
Your heart is true
And you want one love
The way that I do
