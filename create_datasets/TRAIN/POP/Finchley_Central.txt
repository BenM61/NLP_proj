Finchley Central is two and sixpence 
From Golders Green on the Northern Line 
And on the platform, by the kiosk 
That's where you said you'd be mine 

There we made a date 
For hours I waited 
But I'm blowed, she never showed 

At Finchley Central, ten long stations 
From Golders Green, change at Camden Town 
I thought I'd made you
But I'm afraid you really let me down

At Finchley Central, ten long stations 
From Golders Green, change at Camden Town 
I thought I'd made you
But I'm afraid you really let me down

There we made a date 
For hours I waited 
But I'm blowed, she never showed 

At Finchley Central, ten long stations 
From Golders Green, change at Camden Town 
I thought I'd made you
But I'm afraid you really let me down

Finchley Central
Two and sixpence 
Mind the dogs please
