Faster kill faster still pussycat
I can't stand to see you cry
Honey you know where the world is at
Get what you want with your lucky eyes

You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)

Better wake up this sleepy head
Big old world pass us by
So many things we could do instead
Get what you want with your lucky eyes

Faster kill faster still pussy
Those high heels are not your friends
Honey you know where the world is at
Come home with me when the party ends

You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)

(Pussycat...)

Heaven knows I tried to let you go
I can't help myself, you know I'm out of control
Heaven knows I tried to let you go
I can't help myself, I think I'm losing control

You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
You turn me on (yeah you turn me, yeah you turn me on)
