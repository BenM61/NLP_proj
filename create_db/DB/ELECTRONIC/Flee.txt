Your eyes are calling me to go
Just what is holding me back I don't know
I can see you're free, free in you love
And this freedom I've got to know

(chorus)
Flee into one anothers' arms
Love 'til our last breath is gone
Free as the night turns into dawn
Love 'til our last breath is gone

We'd better start thinking 'bout somewhere to go
Forgetting about the trouble below
We'd better start thinking 'bout somewhere to flee
This time tomorrow who knows where we'll be

(repeat chorus)
