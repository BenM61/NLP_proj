Take a look around
At what technology has found
Is it what we need?
Or are we killing the seed?
Dictated by the screen
No more following your dreams
The world's become a difficult place to be 

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
This Is Insania

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
This Is Insania

Cloning will diverse
Aging will reverse
Insanity is slowly, creeping into our lives, yeah
Where is yesterday? Cause people ain't the same
Have we lost the faith? Or have we lost our minds

Where are we going?
Does anyone care?
Hold on to real love
There's so much to share 

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
This Is Insania

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
This Is Insania
