Can you feel it
It's like a thunder
Something moving like an echo through your heart
Do you hear it
A voice is calling
Out of nowhere through the noise to where you are
You can't ignore it
You're created for it

Do you wanna fly
There's a higher high
Just this side of heaven
Brings you to your knees
Brings you back to life
You can make it last forever

It's like adrenaline
Rushing through you
It can make your heartbreak jump right off the chart
Like a fire
It consumes you
And in a second it can saturate the dark
You're in the movement
Before you even know it

You can't search the world forever
But you'll never find love better
No, you'll never, ever, never
Bigger than the universe
