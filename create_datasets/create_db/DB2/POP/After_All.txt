We had that first love, heartbreak, romance way back
When our heart's wound we knew it all
Whatever's felt in the blast

I remember was you and me
When each other was all we needed
I remember what could have been
We were just too young to see

There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love
There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love

Strings with answers
Who knows if we've missed our chance
We'll be here waiting
Wouldn't change our circumstance

I remember was you and me
When each other was all we needed
I remember what could have been
We were just too young to see

There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love
There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love

All the reasons why we said it's over
Doesn't seem to matter after all
All the reasons why we said it's over
Doesn't seem to matter after all

Something about the way
Something about the way
Something about the way
Something about the way
Something about the way
Something about the way
Something about the way

All the reasons why we said it's over
Doesn't seem to matter after all
All the reasons why we said it's over
Doesn't seem to matter after all

There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love
There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love

First love, heartbreak, romance way back
Yeah we thought we knew it all
