I want to feel your touch
You know it's easier if we get closer
I'm not asking for too much
I just get this feeling over and over

'cause it's just you that I see
Nothing but you I feel so free
I just get this feeling over and over

You make me feel high on life
When I'm with you I can fly
I wouldn't stop this feeling
I wouldn't stop this feeling
It makes me feel high on life
Intensifies what's inside
I wouldn't stop this feeling from taking over

If you could only say
Why it feels so good
When you move closer
I think we're on our way
I just get this feeling over and over

'cause it's just you that I see
Nothing but you, I feel so free
I just get this feeling over and over

You make me feel high on life
When I'm with you, I can fly
I wouldn't stop this feeling
I wouldn't stop this feeling
You make me feel high on life
Intensifies what's inside
I wouldn't stop this feeling
From taking over

(Spoken:)
Right here in this crowded place
I feel it we're at the center of it all
Looking at you I'm amazed
It seems I'll never fall

'cause it's just you that I see 
Nothing but you I feel so free
I just get this feeling over and over 

You make me feel high on life
When I'm with you I can fly
I wouldn't stop this feeling
I wouldn't stop this feeling
You make me feel high on life
Intensifies what's inside
I wouldn't stop this feeling from taking over
