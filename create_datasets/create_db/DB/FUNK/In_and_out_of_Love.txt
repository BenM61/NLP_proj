Ah ah yeah

I keep fallin' (in and out of love)
I keep fallin' (in and out of love)
In and out of love

Hey love, look what you've done to me
You chained me with hostility
So I could never see
You know the nightmares I've been havin'
about you and me definitely gonna come through
(Here today gone tomorrow) tomorrow
So much hurt, tears and sorrow

(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) in and out of love
(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) in and out of love

So long it was scared us
She was in my hands once again
Drove me round and round
I lied, hated and abused her
Then I touch and kiss, caress her lips
And confuse my mind

(Here today gone tomorrow) tomorrow
(So much hurt, tears and sorrow) Ooh ooh

(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) in and out of love
(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) I keep fallin'
(in and out of love) in and out of love

Aaah yeah
