make me last
make me last
through our love
make me last
new masquerade
to be absorbed
I had to act before
now I talk
and make me last
make me last
through our love
make me last
bring on the microphones
hidden under stones
record my sobs
in baritones
and make me last
make me last
through our love
make me last
in the new west
the orange groves
grow like a plague
wherever you go
I told the heads
we'll show the world
we'll film ourselves in history and chrome
and I said that
just not sure
make me last
through our love
box office law
simple and grand
an endless stream
one can draw
the flicker of light
piano keys
a silent screen, a silent star
make me last
make me last
through our love
make me last
in the new west
the orange groves
grow like a plague
wherever you go
I told the heads
we'll show the world
we'll film ourselves in history and chrome
and I said that, just not sure
what's to be done
it's thunder town they'll do
what they can to hold you down (x 4)
