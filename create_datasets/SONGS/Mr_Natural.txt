Burning embers. 
I still remember all of those little things. 
But I don't feel it so much 'cause I am so out of touch 
With my heart and it won't sing. 

Rusty rainbows. 
That's how the pain goes , turning me inside out . 
Well , I come home at night and you are out of my sight. 
Yes. I'm dying and there ain't no doubt. 

Well, I'm dying and there's no way out. 
Well I try try try try try 
Mr. Natural (come on baby) 
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying. 

A smile on my face and I'm trying. 
I'm trying to understand that a love that is lost can never be found again. 
And you see me dance , I look like a happy man . 
Just when I think I'm getting it over, an old friend I should see. 

He said he knew you well , and baby I could tell . 
You know he knew you more then me. 
I went home laughing and inside I'm crying . 
We had a special thing . 

You know I loved you so much , but girl I'm so out of touch 
With my heart and it won't sing . 
You know my heart just won't sing. 
Well I try try try try try . 

Mr. Natural ( come on baby)

And you see me dance , I look like a happy man. 
Still I try try try try try. 
Mr. Natural ( come on baby) 
Well I try try try try try 

Mr. Natural (come on baby)
