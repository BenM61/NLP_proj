What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me, would you agree?
Its almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy When I tell your love has come here and now

A Moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
I cant believe its happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes, but beauty remains
Something so tender I cant explain
Well I may be dreaming but 'til I awake
Can we make the dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A Moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
I cant believe its happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

A Moment like this

A Moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
I cant believe its happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

A Moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
I cant believe its happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
