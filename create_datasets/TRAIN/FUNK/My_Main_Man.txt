Look over my shoulder now what do you think I see
Me and my main man just him and me
'Round the corner now, I found love
Me and my main man against the whole wide world

He walks with me, he talks with me
He threw my troubles in the deep blue sea
Me and my main man against the whole wide world
Now, me and my main man, we gotta pocket full of love

I've been around now a mighty long time
I just discovered he's a personal friend of mine
He don't know how it feels to find something real
Now that's my main man and that's the way I feel

He took me out the dark into the light
He made my whole world light so bright
Me and my main man against the whole wide world
Now me and my main man, we gotta a pocket full of love

Me and my main man against the whole wide world
Now, me and my main man we gotta pocket full of love
Me and my main man against the whole wide world
Now, me and my main man we gotta pocket full of love

Me and my main man against the whole wide world
Now, me and my main man we gotta pocket full of love
Me and my main man against the whole wide world
Now, me and my main man we gotta pocket full of love
