Lifeless yet alive and eager to live
I laugh braveiy, I dare
May your day be
Suffused with light
Come pick my bone
Bathe mein your night

Wherever I turn
My road seems to go nowhere
6 feet underground
Fated to fail
And damaged beyond repair
6 feet underground

Life, mere existence
Go, fill my day
I'm drowing, tired
Say you're my own one
Say you'll always be
When I came home
Tne wind had blown you away
