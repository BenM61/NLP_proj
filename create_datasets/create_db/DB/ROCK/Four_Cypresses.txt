Instead of moving
You stared into the wall
Tangled up in a pile
It's early
Make no sound

Living in a pile
It's chaos but it works
Planes flying overhead so early
Dreadful sound

Four cypresses seen from a neighbor's yard
No memory, a future
Drawing down

Planes flying overhead so early
Make no sound

Four cypresses torn from the roadside
Great thundering noise from the hillside
Some thousands of years built it up
Some crumbling form to be torn down

Living in a pile
Tangled in a pile
It's chaos but it works
