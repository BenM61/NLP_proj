The clock is striking, guess it must be two
My baby left me for somebody new
I've been here playing since she said we're through
An old piano plays the blues

The clock is striking, guess it must be three
My room is lonely as a room can be
I'm improvising on a memory
An old piano plays the blues

Each evening since we met, we were a close duet
From dusk until the moon would glow
And though she's gone I find she's hangin' round my mind
I guess I'm not the kind to do a solo

The clock is striking, Lord it can't be four
Perhaps I'd better lock the downstairs door
The one I play for will be here no more
An old piano plays the blues

I guess I'd better lock the door
She won't be coming back no more
An old piano plays the blues
An old piano plays the blues.
