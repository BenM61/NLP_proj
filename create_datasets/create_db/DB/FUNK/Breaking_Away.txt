I'd like to think that you're thinking of me
So close to you, you just seem so far away
So far away, so far until I cannot see

By breaking away you've broken the rules
By breaking my heart you've loved like a fool
I'm breaking away, you made me give in
And making me loose what I thought I could win
Ohoho

You're just a man with a modern problem
Can rest his heart, has to be so far away
So far away, so far I'm loosing all believe

By breaking away you've broken the rules
By breaking my heart you've loved like a fool
I'm breaking away, you made me give in
And making me loose what I thought I could win
Oh

I saw the writing clearly on the wall
It told me what your heart it hurts when you fall
And yet we've more to loose I couldn't give in
It's a fight I just wanted to win

By breaking away you've broken the rules
By breaking my heart you've loved like a fool
I'm breaking away, you made me give in
And making me loose what I thought I could win
Oho

By breaking away you've broken the rules
By breaking my heart you've loved like a fool
I'm breaking away, you made me give in
And making me loose what I thought I could win
Oho

By breaking away you've broken the rules
By breaking my heart you've loved like a fool
I'm breaking away, you made me give in
