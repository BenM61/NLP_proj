You've got to pay to the piper
Ask your mama!

I spend my money on you--every dime
You even told me you had a good time
The night is through and we're all alone
You said it's time that you went home

You've been wined and dined in front of me
Just how nice must I be?
I played the tune, you dug the beat
Now come on, girl--be nice to me

Come on, come on, yeah
Come on, come on, darling

You say that you haven't known me long
How much longer will this go on?
Girl, my patience is wearing thin
I want to be more than just a friend

Girl, I need some love desperately
Stop teasing, girl--take care of me
I played the tune, you dug the beat
Now come on, girl--be nice to me

If you dance to the music, don't you know
You've got to pay to the piper
Ask your mama!
If you dance to the music, don't you know
You've got to pay to the piper, oh yeah

Come on, come on, yeah
