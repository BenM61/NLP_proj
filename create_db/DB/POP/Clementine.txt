Fifty states
Fifty lines
Fifty "crying all the time"s
Fifty boys
Fifty lies
Fifty "I'm gonna change my mind"s
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
Now I feel indifferent

We were young
We were young
We were young we didn't care
Is it gone
Is it gone
Is it floating in the air?
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
Now I feel indifferent

All that time, wasted
I wish I was a little more delicate
I wish my
I wish my
I wish my
I wish my
I wish my name was Clementine
