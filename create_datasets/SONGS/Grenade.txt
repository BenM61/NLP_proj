Your cellphone, you're wronged
Your time, your ideas
No barcode, no party
No ID, no beers
Your bank card, your license
Your thoughts, your fears
No SIM card, no disco
No photo, not here

Your blood, your sweat
Your passions, your regrets
Your profits, your time-off
Your affections, your sex
Your pills, your graphs
Your tits, your ass
Your laughs, your falls

We want (we want your soul)
Your house, your phone
Your life, your cash
Your house, your phone
We want your soul
Your house, your phone
Your life, your cash
Your house, your phone
We want (We want your so-o-o)
W-W-Want you
