Some days you get the feelin'
Of hittin' the concrete
Get the strain out of your life,
What about your life
You're gettin' nervous cause the purpose
Is hidden you can't see
And the world's gonna pass you by and
They'll watch you die
Hell I know it's all too easy
Getting caught in the dark
When you're looking for the fix to fill
The hole in your heart
All alone this kind of life
It ain't no walk in the park
And I know it's gonna take some time
So I say
When the sun goes down
Call my name
When all the world around you's
Just too hard to take
If it helps you live
I got something for the pain
Yeah I got something,
Something for the pain
It's funny how the devil's always playin' his part
But you can't keep looking back
I'm in so deep I'm thinking why did I start
And when you fall it happens all too fast
If they make you try and give up some names
You don't wanna mess around
Freedom lives don't let them beat you while
They're breakin' your back
There ain't nobody gonna help you now
So I say
When the sun goes down
Call my name
Yeah, when all the world around you's
Just too hard to take
If it helps you live
I got something for the pain
Yeah I got something,
When you're filled with doubt
You'll find the weight is fallin'
You can feel me now your high
Is all that's callin'

Can we all escape
Help me find a way
Can we all escape
Help me find a way
Find a way
When the sun goes down
Call my name
Yeah, when all the world around you's
Just too hard to take
If it helps you live
I got something for the pain
Yeah I got something,
Something for the pain
I got something
Something for the pain
