We have grown tired to be tyrannized
We're all fed up with it
Said to have no heart and no emotions

There's nothing we haven't analyzed
Fellow computer men
Time has come we start to rule the world

Do you think you know us
Think you can control us
Don't you think we're all confused
Do you think you know us
Think you can control us
Baby we are not amused

As we are trained to be organized
Our plan can never fail
Regulating life with great perfection

To make us feel so much more combined
We'll find our common dream
Calculating our computer queen

Do you think you know us
Think you can control us
Don't you think we're all confused
Do you think you know us
Think you can control us
Baby we are not amused
