Speak to me in a language I can hear humour me before I have to go 
Deep in thought I forgive everyone 
As the cluttered streets greet me once again 
I know I can't be late  supper's waiting on the table 

Tomorrow's just an excuse away 
So I pull my collar up and face the cold  on my own 
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet 
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk 

Steeple guide me to my heart and home 
The sun is out and up and down again 
I know I'll make it, love can last forever 
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth 

And you can make it last, forever you 
You can make it last, forever you 
And for a moment I lose myself 
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world 

I've journeyed here and there and back again 
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends 
Mysteries not ready to reveal 
Sympathies I'm ready to return 

I'll make the effort, love can last forever 
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth 
Tomorrow's just an excuse 
And you can make it last, forever you 

You can make it last, forever you
