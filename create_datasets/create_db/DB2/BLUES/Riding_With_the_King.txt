I dreamed I had a good job and I got well paid.
I blew it all at the penny arcade.
A hundred dollars on a Kewpie doll.
No pretty chick is gonna make me crawl.

Get on a TWA to the promised land.
Every woman, child and man
Gets a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring.
Don't you know you're riding with the king?

He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier,
He's gonna check us all on out of here.
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your prescription filled.

Get on a TWA to the promised land.
Everybody clap your hands.
And don't you just love the way that he sings?
Don't you know we're riding with the king?
Riding with the king.
Don't you know we're riding with the king?

A tuxedo and shiny 335.
You can see it in his face, the blue never lie.
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings.
And don't you know we're riding with the king?

I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old
With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold.
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die.

Don't you know we're riding with the king?
Don't you know we're riding with the king?
Riding, you're riding with the king.
You're riding, you're riding with the king.
