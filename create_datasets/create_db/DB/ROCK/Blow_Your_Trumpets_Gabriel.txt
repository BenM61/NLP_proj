I saw the Virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes of Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve dissolved by flame
Looked down on son of God snuffed in vain

Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment of Eden
Break the bread and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den
Nations fall prey
Hail my return

Hosanna (Hosanna)
Tribe of Judah decimate
Hosanna (Hosanna)
Roots of David eradicate

Hosanna (Hosanna)
Let wine of Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna (Hosanna)
May sin of Gomorrah grace our hearts
