Like an angel out of the sky you came
Clearing up all the clouds of sadness and the rain
So pure you and healing was the love you bring
I knew inside (it felt so right)

For me, I've struggled, all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will, love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again, again

I was scared to let go and trust your love
After what I'd been through I have had enough
Whispering through your eyes you never said a word
But something said
(You're heart's safe)

For me, I've struggled, all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again

A friend is what you always have in me
I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be
And it doesn't matter who you happen to meet
You'll forever be (a secret part of me)

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again, again
