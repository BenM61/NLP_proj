He doesn't fight crime
Or wear a cape
He doesn't read minds
Or levitate
But every time my world needs saving
He's my Superman
Some folks don't believe in heroes
'Cause they haven't met my dad

He loves his workshop
And rock 'n roll
He's got a hot rod
And a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man of few words
But he talks a lot within
And even though I'm a little taller
I still look up to him

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see that
My dad's a hero to me

Rust ridden fenders
And doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry
'Til our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you
But I can hear him loud and clear

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

(My dad's a hero)
(My dad's a hero)
(My dad's a hero)
My dad's a hero to me

(My dad's a hero)
(My dad's a hero)
(My dad's a hero)
My dad's a hero to me
