Below the cities hustle begins 
Expression lost in suburban winds 
Don't waste my time the way you do it 
My heart on main street 
My love for you 

So take your turn on the love carrousel 
Your time will come and I wish you well 
'Cause, you've got love 
Got a whole lot more 
Now you got what I've been searching for, my baby 

Earth wind, earth wind and fire 
Cannot take me, take me much higher 
Earth wind, earth wind and fire 
Cannot push me, push me much higher 

No slow down, a love can't wait 
When time comes for you 
You can't be late 
We're burning love the whole night through 
What I do baby, I do for you 
It's coming though so 
Let the wind come rushing in 
I feel that soul sensation begin 
'Cause you've got love 
Got a whole lot more 
Now you've got what I've been searching for 
Come on baby 

Earth wind, earth wind and fire 
Cannot take me, take me much higher 
Earth wind, earth wind and fire 
Cannot push me, push me much higher
