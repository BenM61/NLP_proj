I could be a soldier
Go out there and fight to save this land
Be a people's soldier
Paramilitary gun in hand
I won't be a soldier
I won't take no orders from no-one
Stuff their fucking armies
Killing isn't my idea of fun

And they want to waste my life
They want to waste my time
They want to waste my life
And they've stolen it away

I could be a hero
Live and die for their important cause
A united nation
Or an independent state with laws
And rules and regulations
That merely cause disturbances and wars
And that's what I have got now
All thanks to the freedom-seeking hordes

And they want to waste my life
They want to waste my time
They want to waste my life
And they've stolen it away

I'm not gonna be taken in
They said if I don't join, I just can't win
I've heard that story many times before
And every time I threw it out the door

Still they come up to me
With a different name but the same old face
I can see the connection
With another time and a different place
Now, they ain't blonde-haired or blue-eyed
But they think that they're a master race
They're nothing but blind fascists
Brought up to hate and given lives to waste

And they want to waste my life
They want to waste my time
They want to waste my life
And they've stolen it away

What they wanna do, they want to waste my life
They want to waste my time
They want to waste my life
And they've stolen it away
