Sleight of hand
Hands of fate
Chance you take
Life's a snake

And it's all in the draw of the cards

Lightnin' strike
Breath of life
Red black or white
Watch 'em fall

And it's all in the draw of the cards
And it's all in the draw of the cards

Drop the cards
Watch the eyes
Down and dirty
Let 'em ride

Boulevard
Small cafe
Cavaliers
Pass the day

The joker laughs
From the street
Weaves his web
Bittersweet

Ace is high
Deuce is low
Take the first
The rest should go

And it's all in the draw of the cards
And it's all in the draw of the cards
