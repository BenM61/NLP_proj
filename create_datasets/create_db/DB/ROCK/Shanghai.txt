Let's move away together, 
Go interplanetary 
Maybe in Chinese weather, 
Where it's sanitary 

I'll go out trawler fishing, 
Yeah we'll have tuna steak 
I'm on a special mission, 
For us to have a break 

We'll climb the corporate buildings 
Spray-paint the outside walls 
You bet that they'll be yielding 
When the castle falls 

We'll swim beneath the ocean 
Near the coral reef 
I have a certain notion 
That it will not be brief 

We're going to Shanghai
To watch the red sky 
We're moving to Shanghai 
Goodbye, goodbye 

We're going to Shanghai
So don't you cry 
We're moving to Shanghai 

Looks like we might have made it
Put on your silkworm dress 
You look so beautiful 
And I look such a mess 

Across the city's landscape, 
The sun burns crimson red 
Maybe the moon will wait, 
Before we go to bed 

We're going to Shanghai 
To watch the red sky 
We're moving to Shanghai 
Goodbye, goodbye 

We're going to Shanghai 
So don't you cry 
We're moving to Shanghai 

Maybe, maybe we'll have 
A fresh new start 
I'll learn the martial arts 
We'll have our own rickshaw cart 
We're moving to Shanghai
