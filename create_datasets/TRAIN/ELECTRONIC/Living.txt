Stuck in a rut you can't get out
There's too much causing you doubt
No cash, no job, no self-esteem
Me I'm takin' and I'm givin'

If you got the gift you should use it
Opportunity, don't want to lose it
Climb over the walls, break down all the doors
When your future calls

Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down

Just surviving and living
Just surviving and living
Just surviving and

Stuck in a rut you can't get out
There's too much causing you doubt
No cash, no job, no self-esteem
Me I'm takin' and I'm givin'

They may wreck your dreams if you let them
Keep them goals in sight, don't forget them
Keep your head up high, yes the future's bright
Keep your head up high

Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down
Don't let nothing hold you down
Nothing hold you down, down

Just surviving and living
Just surviving and living
Just surviving and
Just surviving and
