It only took a glance
Of fortune or guess
A little drumming boy
Was beating in my chest

La La La

Is this a competition?
I'm definitely winning
Because two by two
They came through
And one in everyone
Fits a million

La La La

You keep on holding back
Can't break it to yourself
That your life is nothing
But the fear's making sense
The fear's making sense

La La La
