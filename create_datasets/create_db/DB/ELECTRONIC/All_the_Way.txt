First time I saw you, I knew right away
Made up my mind, you'll be mine someday
You know I need you, so don't turn away
'Cause at the end of the day, I'll be alright
Still I'm praying that you'll change your mind
I'll be okay
'Cause you'll come around eventually

He-he-hey
Will I love someone, and loving all the way?
He-he-hey
You know I'm the one to take you all the way

I know you hope that I'll just let it go,
'Cause I won't just stand that you walk alone,
Don't be afraid, you're not on your own
As I as you know will be alright
Still I'm praying that you'll change your mind,
I'll be okay
'Cause you'll come around eventually

He-he-hey
Will I love someone, and loving all the way?
He-he-hey
You know I'm the one to take you all the way

(Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh)
(Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh)

I told the truth
Will I love someone, and loving all the way?
He-he-hey
You know I'm the one to take you all the way

He-he-hey
Will I love someone, and loving all the way?
He-he-hey
You know I'm the one to take you all the way

(Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh)
(Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh)

You know I'm the one to take you all the way
