A single failure, a little slip
A misdemeanor, a little trip
Does this condemn me, lock me away?
Before you turn the key, I have one more thing to say
To make amends, maybe be friends

Everybody gets a second chance
The circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
Take my chance and tell you I'm sorry too

A little stumble, a little fall
Inconsequential, nothing at all
Now there was someone, I heard him say
That the best laid plans sometimes go astray
So don't be surprised if I offer you no alibis

Everybody gets a second chance
The circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
Take my chance and tell you I'm sorry

Everybody gets a second chance
The circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
I'll take my chance and tell you I
Take my chance and tell you I love you

Oh baby

Everybody gets a second chance
The circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
Well, I take my chance to tell you I'm sorry

Everybody gets a second chance
The circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
I take my chance to tell you I'm sorry

Everybody wants a second chance
Everybody needs a circumstance
Everybody gets a second chance
