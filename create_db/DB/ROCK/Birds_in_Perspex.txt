Well I take off my clothes with you,
But I'm not naked underneath.
I was born with trousers on,
Just about like everyone.
I'm so lonely I could melt,
And be forgotten instantly.
I love you very patiently,
Honey, please don't finish me.
Birds in Perspex come alive,
Come alive.
Colliapies and Xylophones
Lay backwards in a broken stream.
No one gives you anything,
Unless, of course, you ask for it.
Birds in Perspex come alive,
Come alive.
Perspex Island she's my girl,
Away above the chimney tops.
And when the sun goes down on her,
So beautiful my heart just stopped.
Birds in Perspex come alive,
Come alive.
