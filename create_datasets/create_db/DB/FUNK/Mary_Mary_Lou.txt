Mary, Mary Lou
Why must you do
The things that you always do

Honey, I've been here a-crying
Sipping and a-sighing
To think it's all because of you

I know the other night you told me
You were gonna marry
Someone who's in love with you, yeah
And the time I used to
Be your golden rooster
But now I can see that we are through

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
You're always doing me so wrong

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
And know you want to say so long

Mary, Mary Lou
Why must you do
Those things that you always do

I can hear a-crying
Sipping and a-sighing
To think it's all because of you

You were gonna marry
Someone who's in love with you, yeah
And the time I used to
Be your golden rooster
But now I can see that we are through

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
You're always doing me so wrong

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
And knew you want to say so long

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
