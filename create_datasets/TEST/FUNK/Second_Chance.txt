Why should be
Just a memory
It's like a bell that keeps on ringing
Calling me

But I believe
What I can see
And I can feel the warmth of love
Surrounding me

So tonight I lay me down to sleep
And pray my soul to keep
In that your love will rescue me, for the rest of my life
I live to say good bye
To all the promises left behind
Here we are you and I
A second chance

I have changed (I have changed)
But take the blame (take the blame)
For all the words left and spoken through the pain
I played the game and lost and spayed
But I have cleansed myself by walking through the rain

So tonight I lay me down to sleep
And pray my soul to keep
In that your love will rescue me, for the rest of my life
I live to say good bye
To all the promises left behind
Here we are you and I
A second chance

If you listen there's a melody in how you live your life(how you live your life)
You can write the song you want to hear
And I pray (pray)
To live mine
So in the mirror speaks
It tells me you have faced your inner fears
And in loving this song

So tonight I lay me down to sleep and pray my soul to keep
In that your love will rescue me, for the rest of my life
I live to say good bye
To all the promises left behind
Here we are you and I

No I not giving up
I am here to stay

A second chance
A second chance
A second chance
