Your letter I read early this morning baby
And I read every word you had to say
But if you love me like you say you do baby
I want to know what in the world did you go away

Your letter said that you're doing ok baby
But then I read please, let me come back home
Your letter read that you're doing ok now baby
And then you said please, let me come back home

And you would have someone you could call your own

Yes, my memory don't me fail on me baby
You know I'll remember the day you left
Yeah, my memory don't fail on me baby
You know I'll remember the day you left
You know you said baby I believe you now baby
That you were grown and you've been taking care yourself

And the words come straight from my heart
Oh, here is the answer to your letter baby
