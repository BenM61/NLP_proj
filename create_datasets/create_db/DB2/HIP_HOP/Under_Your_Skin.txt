i'm gettin' in
under your skin

i got the hungry eye
at a northern spy
i watch your smile
my words they float
in and out of the light
i try to make sense
but it's still a fight
we got a smokey past
where minutes last
it took so long to leave so fast
it might not be sweet
feeling this heat

lie down in the fire with me
i burn everything frequently
if it don't feel good
when you first get in
wait 'til it gets under your skin
lie down underneath the breeze
can't cool down when you're down with me
if it don't feel good
when you first get in
wait 'til it gets under your skin

some deeds done wrong
won't scare me long
i've done a few
maybe one or two
if you want to know
all of my original sins
ask the virgin
she knows where i've been
if it ain't too far for you to come
and you want to get to know
someone
it might be sweet
feeling this heat

lie down in the fire with me
i burn everything frequently
if it don't feel good
when you first get in
wait 'til it gets under your skin
lie down underneath the breeze
can't cool down when you're down with me
if it don't feel good
when you first get in
wait 'til it gets under your skin

lie down in the fire with me
i burn everything frequently
if it don't feel good
when you first get in
wait 'til it gets under your skin
