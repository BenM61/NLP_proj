I got my heart set on you and I'm ready to wait
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like a must've known you in another life
'cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
(Can't wait)
Oh, I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking bout
Like I couldn't breathe you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said, ?Oh she's just being Miley?
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest till then oh, woah woah
I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking bout
Like I couldn't breathe you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said, ?Oh she's just being Miley?
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest till then oh, woah woah
I can't wait to see you again

I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to wait

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking bout
Like I couldn't breathe you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said, ?Oh she's just being Miley?
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest till then oh, woah woah
I can't wait to see you again
