Why did you leave me here?
Now where do I belong?
And now I ask myself
If all I did was wrong
What good is love when it can break a lonely heart?
And tearing my life apart

I still got the ring
I gave you last year
I won't get caught like that
I swear the tears you shed
You didn't care
I need somebody that will always be there
All I feel and what's inside
The love I had I could not hide
That how it is so
Now I'll come clean
Don't want to say it twice
You know what I mean

Why did you leave me here?
Now where do I belong?
And now I ask myself
If all I did was wrong
What good is love when it can break a lonely heart?
And tearing my life apart

Got bitten once before
Won't happen again so don't come crying
Saying you need a friend
Why did you leave me hanging in the den?
Wanted to write but I couldn't find a pen
You didn't even want me
You didn't even care
There is nothing more in common
And nothing more to share
That's it is
So now I'll come clean, it's time to say goodbye
So, don't cause a scene

Why did you leave me here?
Now where do I belong?
And now I ask myself
If all I did was wrong
What good is love when it can break a lonely heart?
And tearing my life apart
