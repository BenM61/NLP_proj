Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go I see an image of her face
She talks to me
She talks to me in a thousand ways

Everyone I know
Everyone I know is calling on the telephone
"are you OK are you alright
'cos you're never at home?"
Well I couldn't be better
I found my way
She is an open door to a brand new day

Everywhere I go I see her face again
Everywhere I look I see her smile and wave
Everywhere I hear her voice is calling
This time I finally opened my eyes to a beautiful angel
Oh who's been caring for me like a mother for a child

Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go I see the shadow of a light
It shines on me it shines on me from another time

So many dark days and lonely nights
Until she found the way to change my life

Everywhere I go I see her face again
Everywhere I look I see her smile and wave
Everywhere I hear her voice is calling
This time I finally opened my eyes!

Everywhere I go I see her face again
(everywhere I go)
Everywhere I look I see her smile and wave
(everywhere I look)
Everywhere I hear her voice is calling
This time I finally opened my eyes to my beautiful angel
Oh who's been caring for me like a mother for her child
Everywhere I go

This time I finally opened my eyes
Everywhere I go.
