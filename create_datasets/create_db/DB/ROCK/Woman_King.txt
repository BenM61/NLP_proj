Blackbird claw, raven wing
Under the red sunlight
Long clothesline, two shirtsleeves
Waving as we go by

Hundred years, hundred more
Someday we may see a
Woman king, wristwatch time
Slowing as she goes to sleep.

Black horse fly, lemonade
Jar on the red ant hill
Garden worm, cigarette
Ash on the window sill

Hundred years, hundred more
Someday we may see a
Woman king, sword I hand
Swing at some evil and bleed.

Black hoof mare, broken leg
Eye on the shot gun shell
Age old dog, hornet nest
Built in the big church bell

Hundred years, hundred more
Someday we may see a
Woman king, bloodshot eye
Thumb down and starting to weep.
