Why do you whisper, green grass?
Why tell the tress what ain't so?
Whispering grass, the trees don't have to know
no, no

Why tell them all your secrets?
Who kissed there long ago?
Whispering grass, the trees don't need to know

Don't you tell it to the breeze
She will tell the birds and bees
And everyone will know
Because you told the blabbering trees
Yes, you told them once before
It's no secret anymore

Why tell them all the old things?
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees
'Cause the trees don't need to know

Now, don't you tell it to the breeze 
'Cause she'll run and tell it to the birds and bees
And everyone would know 'cause you done told the blabberng trees
Yes you did, you told 'em once before
So that's why it ain't no secret any more, hmm, hmm, hmm

Why tell them all the old things?
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees
'Cause the trees don't need to know
