They say you stand
By your man
Tell me something
I don't understand
You said you loved me
And that's a fact
And then you left me
Said you felt trapped

Well,somethings you can explain away
But the heartache's with me till this day

did you stand by me
No,not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

All the times
That we were closed
I remember
These things the most
I've seen all our dreams
Come tumblin' down
I can't stay happy
Without you around

So alone I keep the wolves a bay
And there's only one thing I can say

did you stand by me
No,not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me

Did you stand by me
No,not at all

Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through
Without you love I won't make it through

But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

did you stand by me
No,not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

Stand by me,no way
Stand by me,not at all
Stand by me,no way
Stand by me,not at all
Stand by me,no way
