featuring Notorious B.I.G. 

(Notorious B.I.G.) 
F*ck that  I preach it  my nine reaches 
The prestigious cats who speak this Willie shit 
Flood in pieces  my hand releases snatches 
Smackin cabbage  half ass rappers shouldn't have it 
So I grab it  never run  the out come is usually 
a beat down brutally  f*ck who you be or where you from 
West or East coast  squeeze toast leave most 
in the blood they layin in, ask Tray and them 

(Tracey Lee) 
Oh shit, I suppose its time to go snitch 
Flip a line and get the show lit 
You clown niggaz hold it 
Down your flow lax, just so you know that 
We could battle for days like old cats 
Black, you dealing with a throw back 
Winnin like straight jacks, with a wide range 
of rhyme teams, my lyrics they bang like migraines 
Nigga my name, Tray the terrible 
Philadelph, wild child incredible 
too sick for medical attention, people listen 
It's verbal ascension, like Maxwell many dimensions 
Flood over tracks, well, mics in critical condition 
Killin ya Maxell, unveil lyrical skills unknown 
for my people with illegal cell phones 
A real MC let's bring it back home 
Live from the two-one-five, that lost a back bone 
in charge, and heavily on like break fog 
You for saw it, nigga stay down 
Biggie make them hit the floor face down 

(Notorious B.I.G.) 
What, what, what, the rings and things you speak about 
bring em out, it's hard to yell with my bat round 
in your mouth, its more than I expected 
I thought them jewels was rented, but they wasn't 
So run it, cousin, I could chill the heat does it 
Ran up in your shell about a dozen, you never seen 
bank like Frank White, ya hand clutchin 
ya chest plate contemplates, bout to die nigga wait 
Keep ya hands high 


You don't want to die, keep your hands high 
Ain't no right or wrong in this game called survive 
So you know it's Tray and be	-I, G schemin on your cream 
Why try, keep ya hands high 

(Tracey Lee) 
Hey yo it's show time, so I'ma blow nines into your spine 
So what's yours is mine, you know what this is 
Bag the Benjamins with all ya riches 
How quickly, the milli turn Willies to bitches 
Controllin your fate, a hole in your plate 
F*ck the show dates, I want the whole state 
with squads harassin, all of y'all niggaz who flashin 
We doing this the Tray Lee way, delay 
Then nigga we spray, ain't no ignoring us 
Me and Notorious 

(Notorious B.I.G.) 
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due south with keys 
y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed 
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks 
F*ck the hip-hop, them one-two's and it don't stop 
Me and my nigga Lance, took him and Cease in vans 
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants 
from Branson, now we lamp in, twelve room mansions 
Bitches get naked off Get Money, Playas Anthem 
Don't forget One More Chance and, my other hits 
Other shit niggaz spit be counterfeit 
Robbing come naturally, in and out like fuckin rapidly 
Pass the gat to me 
Make his chest rest where his back should be 
Fuckin blasphemy, blast me, your family rest in coffins 
Often, Franquiza, far from soft or fragile, uh 
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper slash dope dealer 
slash guerilla, slash illest turn iller 

(Tracey Lee) 
So nigga keep ya hands high 
Run all your so called possessions, links with baguettes in 
Keys to your Lex, for us to make your shorties dressed in 
A full jack maneuver, don't no body move, just the moolah 
It's RNF and Junior M.A.F., runnin through ya like Kahlua 
If rum sung then you fly, niggaz with the 45 
but True Lies, but you brought out the real nigga in me 
Now I'ma cock the semi, watch you strip like Demi
