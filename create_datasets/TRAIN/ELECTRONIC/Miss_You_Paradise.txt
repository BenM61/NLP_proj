And there is something we leave behind to join the ride
I couldn't wait but did not realize I'd never come back
And the calling is taking over and it lasts more than awhile
Another reason I won't be around to say goodnight

Don't write to me I'll call you

All of my life I've been a lost satellite
It's all a waste of time with me before I get it right
And I miss you paradise
Although you're over
And I miss you paradise
I know you're over

I lie awake and I count the hours passing by
Too many questions that won't be answered here tonight
And they rise in waves before you and the force opens your eyes
Another reason I won't be around to say goodnight

Don't write to me I'll call you

All of my life I've been a lost satellite
It's all a waste of time with me before I get it right
And I miss you paradise
Although you're over
And I miss you paradise
I know you're over

All of my life I've been a lost satellite
Circling alone out here you're always on my mind
And I miss you paradise
Although you're over
And I miss you paradise
I know you're over

And I miss you
