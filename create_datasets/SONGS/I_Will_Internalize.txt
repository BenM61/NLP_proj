I will internalize everything
I will hold back the pain
And I will count the raindrops
That fall on my head 
From above and below
And I am wet and weak
I am wet and weak

'Cause I have seen the light
And it's in, it's in your eyes

I can get used to anything
As long as it's shit-stained
And I will bleed on your knees
And I am comfortable on my knees
In the corner whispering, whispering, whispering
Whispering "please"

'Cause I have seen the light
And it's in, it's in your eyes
I have seen the light
And it's in, it's in your eyes

And the moon is lost every night
When you turn on those eyes
And the stars go dark too
When you say those words
"I love you"

'Cause I have seen the light
And it's in, it's in your eyes
I have seen the light
And it's in, it's in your eyes
I have seen the light
And it's in your eyes
