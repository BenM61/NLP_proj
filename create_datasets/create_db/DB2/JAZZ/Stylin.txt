I can see that you're cool, got something I want
I want to be down with anything you're selling now, now
You give me palpitations

Make your move, time to prove, show me what you've got
I can see you're ready when you're on the spot like now, now
You give me palpitations

Girl, your styling, that's your appeal
You're making me wild and that's how I feel
Wanna get near you every day
And do things to you in every way

Every day you seem to come my way
Making waves with all your jazzy moves
And what a price to pay, loving you this way
There's nothing else to say, sink or swim is what we do

Baby please, can't you see it's not all my fault?
I can't be myself when you're around me, baby, wow, wow
You give me palpitations

We can be anything that our hearts desire
Moving with the universe, we can inspire love, love
You give me inspiration

Girl, your styling, that's your appeal
You're making me wild and that's how I feel
Wanna get near you every day
And do things to you in every way

I'm loving you and the things you do
Makes it easier for me to say, oh yeah
If I need to prove my love for you is true
Baby, sink swim or float, you can meet me at the shore, yeah
