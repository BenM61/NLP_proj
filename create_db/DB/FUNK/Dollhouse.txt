I'm just a girl, you're just a boy
This is my heart, it's not a toy
So what's with you playing with my mind
We used to be cool, this used to be love
Now it's become, something like a job
Like it or not, maybe things were changing right before our eyes

I tried to be a picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

Cause I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be, puttin' me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No, I could never be, stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls, cause I ain't a doll

You call the shots, right down to my shoes
I liked what you liked cause you told me to
And I don't think that you could even tell
I fell out of love, but it never showed
I gave up on us so long ago
But you'll never know
Baby don't pretend like you know me so well

I tried to be a picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Try to control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be, puttin' me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No, I could never be, stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls, cause I ain't a doll

I'll never be made of plastic
So glad that my heart's elastic
No matter what you do
I'll bounce back offa you
Cut me but I'm not bleeding

I tried to be a picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna to control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be, puttin' me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No I could never be, stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls, I ain't a doll

And I come with imperfections
Epitome of perfection
If you can't understand, loving the way I am
Then you're no good for me, so glad I kept my receipt
