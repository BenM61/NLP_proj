Welcome to a new day
Don't know what's on the way
But whatever it is I'll be ready
On your mark get set go
Here's the show and the road
But with you it's a load I can carry
And with each breath I would take it
Every moment gonna make it

It's a wonderful crazy
It's a beautiful out of control
Kinda scary amazing
But I don't really mind at all
It's like I'm falling, flying, laughing, crying
Hanging on and letting go
Cause my life' so wonderful crazy crazy

Some days get intense
And breakdown my defense
But I'm here and I'm not giving up
Gonna take in the sights
On the ride of my life
Living just to survive's not enough
So much love to discover
I don't need any other

It's a beautiful crazy
I'ts a beautiful out of control
Kinda scary amazing
But I don't really mind at all
