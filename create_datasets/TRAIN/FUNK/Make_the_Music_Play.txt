Make the music play, 
Just a little slower, play a little slower. 
Let him hold me in his arms, a little longer. 
Make the music play, 

Just a little softer, play a little softer. 
Let him hear me when I sigh, how much I love him. 
Make the music play, 
Keep the magic going, 

Keep the love-light glowing, within his arms; 
Don't even skip a beat, or he may get away. 
And if we were parted, I?d be broken-hearted, 
'Til I'm in his arms to stay. 

Please make the music play. 
Let him hear me when I sigh, how much I love him. 
Make the music play, 
Keep the magic going, keep the love-light glowing
