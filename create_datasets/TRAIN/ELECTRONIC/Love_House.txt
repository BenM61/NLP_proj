Are you ready to do things tonight
That you never dreamed were possible?
Let, let let's go
(I hope so)

Love house, house, house

Want to visit a house, hmmm?
I am ready, anything
Follow me

There's love in my house for fun, wee
There's love in my house for you
There's love in my house, you won't be sorry
'Cos I know just what to do

I'll be good to you

It's Friday night, I'll burn heat
I'm dynamite, just touch me
and I'll explode, yeah

This is Sam Fox, I have some fun
Whose you are? This is Samantha

Love house

I'll open the door, come closer
Something good in stone, woo what you got me for, yeah
This is Samantha---

Just knock---
I'll be good to you

I hope you enjoyed your visit to the house
