Did you ever see a dream walkin'
Well I did
Did you ever hear a dream talkin'
Well I did
Did you ever have a dream to thrill you
With will you be mine
Oh it's so grand
And it's too too divine
Did you ever see a dream dancin'
Well I did
Did you ever see a dream romancin'
Well I did
Did you ever find heaven
Right in your arms
Sayin' I love you I do
Well the dream that was walkin'
In the dream that was talkin'
In the heaven in my arms was you
