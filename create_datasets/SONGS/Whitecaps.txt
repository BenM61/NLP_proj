I saw whitecaps on the water today
15 Minutes after you went away
Couldn't find a reason to make you stay
It's windy now, but it's gonna be okay

I saw a black butterfly lose it's wings today
Cinched by the candle underneath the archway
Wherever they land they'll have to stay
Who can say, but what a price to pay

Whitecaps on the water
But that's okay
Ain't never been a storm I'm running from
Come my way
Weather man said it would be easy
Over in a day
It's windy now
But it's gonna be okay

For the life of me I just can't recall
It's still a mystery, that's all
'Cause dark gallows lead to brighter holes
And masquerade (Masquerade, masquerade)
Masquerade us all

Whitecaps on the water
But that's okay
Ain't never been a storm I'm running from
Come my way
Weather man said it would be easy
Over in a day
It's windy now
But it's gonna be okay

I saw whitecaps on the water today
15 Minutes after you went away
