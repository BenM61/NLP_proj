There's a house on a hill in a driveway
I see a busted angel looking my way
Oh no, stay low, grey crows
It ain't your business, what I wanna do now

Oh, I don't wanna take a bow, woah
'Cause I've been dreaming for a while, oh
I settle with the butterflies, no
The night is going out of style, woah
Since I can't forget why I went for it, oh
Then why don't we just make it now? No
Ain't no need to wait it

I fly with angels in my zoo
I tried reaching out at the wild moon
Ruin clouds, just do it now
Play on through it, make it now
High with the feeling in this flume
I tried swimming under the wild moon
Ruin clouds, just do it now
Wave on through it, take it out

Oh, I'm an angel in a raincoat, woah
Driving in a Range Rov', oh
I always wear the same clothes, no
Stranger than my dress code, woah
In my blind ambition kit, tissues don't regret
So why don't we just make it now? No
Ain't no need to wait it

I fly with angels in my zoo
I tried reaching out at the wild moon
Ruin clouds, just do it now
Play on through it, make it now
High with the feeling in this flume
I tried swimming under the wild moon
Ruin clouds, just do it now
Wave on through it, take it out

Angels come and go
Don't let ambition lead you blind, I'm taken out of time
Can't go flying with a crow (I can't)
Gotta leave the house, I gotta leave it now
'Cause I'm on it, on it, on it, on it, I'm on it
Ha-du-du-du-du
On it, on it, I'm on it
I fly away now and I'll promise you to wait

I fly with angels in my zoo
I tried reaching out at the wild moon
Ruin clouds, just do it now
Play on through it, make it now
High with the feeling in this flume
I tried swimming under the wild moon
Ruin clouds, just do it now
Wave on through it, take it out
