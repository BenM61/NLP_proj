Well Lord I got to raise a fuss, Lord I got to raise a holler
About a workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Well, Lord, I tried to call my baby, I tried to get a date

Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom and papa told me son you gotta make some money
Well if you wanna use the car to go a ridin' next sunday
Oh, Lord, I didn't go to work I told the boss I was sick, said

Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I've got to take three weeks I gotta have a fine vacation
I gotta take my problems to the United Nations
I done told my congress man and he said "vote" (dig this boy)

Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I gotta take three weeks I gotta have a fine vacation
I gotta take my problems to the United Nations
I done told my congress man and he said "vote" (dig this boy)

Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
Lord, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Woah, there ain't no cure
