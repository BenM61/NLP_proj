Love makes people so blind
That's why I can't make up my mind
If you stop me dead in my tracks
Or you just paper over the cracks

You're the one I've wanted so long
But then again I might be wrong
Now you look just right in the pale moonlight
But let me turn the headlights on

'Cause I'm nearly in love, I'm nearly in love
I'm almost aware of walking on air
Yes, I'm nearly in love

I'm nearly in love, I'm nearly in love
I wish I was really, I'd love to dearly
But I'm nearly in love

I don't want to cause you doubt
But I'm really checking you out
You're the closest to my heart bar none
Except for my wallet and my gun

I never felt like this before
That's why I want to make quite sure
That it's not just a dose of the flu
That gives me the chills for you

I'm nearly in love, I'm nearly in love
I'm almost aware of walking on air
Yes, I'm nearly in love

I'm nearly in love, I'm nearly in love
I wish I was really, I'd love to dearly
But I'm nearly in love

I reserve the right to love you
After all I'm the first in line
I'm not one for shout and screaming
Mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine

I'm nearly in love, I'm nearly in love
I'm almost aware of walking on air
Yes, I'm nearly in love

I'm nearly in love, I'm nearly in love
I wish I was really, I'd love to dearly
But I'm nearly in love
