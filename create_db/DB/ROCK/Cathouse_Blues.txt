I got the Cathouse Blues
I wear the highest of high heel shoes
Whoa, darling, it's hard to be surrounded
Where the women are lazy,
And the men are rude
I got the cat walk, don't talk blues
I creep on cat's feet,
I don't speak loose
Yourself in velvet,
Forget we ever met
I got the closed in,
The Cathouse Blues
Blue gray eyes that say
I guess you don't remember
I guess that I was younger
To say the cat sleeps alone,
Sleeps only in the sun
But she'll awake tonight
And she'll be gone
Singing the Cathouse Blues
I need some new red velvet shoes
I'm still a dreamer's fancy
Well they say I'm pretty classy
I'm just a feeling silky cat come true
I'm just a feeling silky cat come true
I'm just a feeling silky cat come true
Oh yeah

I'm still a dreamer's fancy
They say I'm pretty classy
I'm just a feeling silky cat come true
I'm just a feeling silky cat come true
I'm just a feeling silky cat come true
