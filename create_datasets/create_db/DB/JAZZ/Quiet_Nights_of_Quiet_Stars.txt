Quiet nights of quiet stars quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, how lovely

This is where I want to be here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I who was lost and lonely believing love was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, 
The meaning of existence, oh my love
