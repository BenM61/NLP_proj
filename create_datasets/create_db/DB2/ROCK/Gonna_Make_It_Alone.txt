I'm gettin' older day by day 
It's comin' time to break away 
So many things I want to do 
On my own, I'm gonna make it alone, 'lone, 'lone 
I'm gonna get myself a car 
I'll travel near, I'll travel far 
Just like the men I'll be free 
On my own, I'm gonna make it alone, 'lone, 'lone 
Wo wo wo yeah now 
Wo wo wo yeah 
Wo wo wo wo 
Wo wo wo wo 

I'll find a town to hang around 
I'll be the man to shake my hand 
The girls you find will all be mine 
I'll make some money in a rush...yeah, be too much 

I'm gonna get out of this place right now 
It's gonna change my luck somehow 
I'm gonna leave with no goodbyes 
On my own, I'm gonna make it alone, 'lone, 'lone 
Wo wo wo wo 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah now 
Wo wo wo wo 
Wo wo wo wo 

I'll find a town to hang around 
I'll be the man to shake my hand 
The girls you find will all be mine 
I'll make some money in a rush...yeah, be too much 

(Fade)
Wo, wo, wo, ect...
