I can't belive we met like this,
Is it just coincidence?
I had a feeling I'd be seeing you again.
Your every bit as beautiful as the last time we met.
When you told me, you were leaving, and going back to him,
How I wish that I could tell you, it's all in the past.
But I was never good at lying, and baby since you asked,

I don't want to hear that song again, from the night we first met.
I don't want to hear you wispering, things I'd rather forget.
I don't want to look into your eyes, 'cause you know what happens next.
We'll be making love and then,
I fall all over again.

I can't begin to tell you, just how sorry I am,
That the man you built your dreams around, just broke your heart again.
I think I know the feeling,
'Cause I once loved you so much.
That I swore I'd rather die, than live a day without your touch.
If I held you in my arms you know, I'd never let you go,
But this ain't the time or place to get emotional.

I don't want to hear that song again, from the night we first met.
I don't want to hear you wispering, things I'd rather forget.
I don't want to look into your eyes, 'cause you know what happens next.
We'll be making love and then,
I fall all over again.

I was crying when you kissed me,
Then you walked out that door.
Oh, you were always such a mystery.
I still dream we're making love,
Then I stop myself because,

I don't want to hear that song again, from the night we first met.
I don't want to hear you wispering, things I'd rather forget.
I don't want to look into your eyes, 'cause you know what happens next.
We'll be making love and then,
I fall all over again.

I fall all over again.
