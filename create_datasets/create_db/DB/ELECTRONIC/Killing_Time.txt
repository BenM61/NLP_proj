In my dreams
(I can kill you)
Close to me
You open the cage and he sets you free
Come to me
(we run away forever from this misery)
Lost my mind
Are you calling me

Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
I'm always falling down
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
It's coming for you now

(So how can it be)
The color of the world had turned dark on me
(Falling free)
Losing my reflection and my clarity
(Talk to me)
I feel the sickness taking over me
(Let me be)
Imagining that you are here with me

Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
I'm always falling down
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
It's coming for you now
