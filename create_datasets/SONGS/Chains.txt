Oh, I'm a prisoner in cell block why, oh you
I can't escape and I don't know what to do
You treat me bad but my love keeps growing stronger
Can't turn away and I can't hold out any longer

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in his chains
Sometimes I just don't even know the game
My baby's got me locked up in his chains
Sometimes I just don't even know my name
You got me sittin' here, out of gear, a prisoner of your love

Oh, I'm a prisoner in your penitentiary
I've been convicted and my sentence is first degree
I might as well just put my numbers and my stripes on
'Cause I'll be here with you till all else but the hype is gone

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in his chains
Sometimes I just don't even know the game
My baby's got me locked up in his chains
Sometimes I just don't even know my name
You got me sittin' here, out of gear, a prisoner of your love

Boy I'm just a captive in your penitentiary
Here I am in Alcatraz just throw away the key
Lock it up tight, show you right, it's all that I can do
Ball and chain it's all a game in cell block why, oh you

Chains
Lock it up
Lock it up tight, show you right lockin' up my loving
Lock it up tight, show you right lockin' up my loving
