Boom boom boom boom 
I'm gonna shoot you right down, 
Right offa your feet 
Take you home with me, 
Put you in my house 
Boom boom boom boom 
A-haw haw haw haw 
Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm 
Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm 

I love to see you strut, 
Up and down the floor 
When you talking to me, 
That baby talk 
I like it like that 
Whoa, yeah! 
Talk that talk, walk that walk 

When she walk that walk, 
And talk that talk, 
And whisper in my ear, 
Tell me that you love me 
I love that talk 
When you talk like that, 
You knocks me out, 
Right off of my feet 
Hoo hoo hoo 
Talk that talk, and walk that walk
