Oh, I know that I'm guilty
Do I ever cross your mind ?
Oh, I feel that you need me
I said I have no time
I'm losing more than I ever had
After all the love is gone
And the more I look it drives me mad
Where does my heart belong ?

Oh, it's a 21st love century
It's love time for you and me
Baby, I love you ...............
Baby, I hold you once more
Baby, I'm dying for sweet love
Oh, it's a 21st love century
Don't you feel the energy
Baby, I miss you for sure
Baby, I kiss you once more
Baby, I'm dying your sweet love

Will you love me tomorrow ?
Oh, this love will miss a flame
In the world full of sorrow
Love's such a thing
Oh, the way I go - oh, the less you know
I feel passion - I feel pain
There's a broken heart and it tears apart
Leave me in the rain
