I met you at JC Penney 
I think your name tag said "Jenny" 
I cold step to you with a fresh pack of gum 
Somehow I knew you were lookin' for some 
Like a fruit that's ripe for a pickin' 
I wouldn't do you like that Zankou Chicken 
Cause only you've got a thing 
That I just got to get with 
I just got to get with you 
And you know what we're gonna do 

I want to get with you 
And your sister 
I think her name's Debra 

I want to get with you 
And your sister 
I think her name's Debra 

I pick you up late at night after work 
I said "lady, step inside my Hyundai" 
I'm gonna take you up to Glendale 
Gonna take you for a real good meal 

Cause when our eyes did meet 
Girl you know I was packin' heat 
Ain't no use in wastin' no time gettin' to know each other 
You know the deal
Cause only you got a thing 
That I just got to get with 

I want to get with you 
And your sister 
I think her name's Debra 

I want to get with you 
And your sister 
I think her name's Debra 

Lovely lady 
Girl you drive me crazy
