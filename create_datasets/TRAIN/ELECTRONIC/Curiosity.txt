(Nicole) 
c'mon  make it hot 
Ooh ooh (x2) 
Let me know  let me know 
What you want  what you want 
(Nicole Verse One) 
The curiosity  baby it's killing me 
Cause I can tell that you're interested  I 
Can sense that you're feeling me 
Your actions mean more to me  than 
Words you are too shy to say 
To my friends behind your back  baby 
Won't you say it to my face 
If you want to be with me 
And you got a thing for me 
Don't you walk away from me 
Don't you be afraid of me 
If you want to roll with me 
c'mon and roll with me 
(Nicole - Verse Two) 
Intensity, made me sweat a brother majorly, I 
Was sure it was you, you that was paging me 
All the seven days of the week 
But you got a case of butterflies, baby 
I wonder why 
Heard you say, "I'm so fly" (I'm so fly) 
Let's hook up on later tonight 
If you want to be with me 
And you got a thing for me 
Don't you walk away from me 
Don't you be afraid of me 
If you want to roll with me 
c'mon and roll with me 
(Nicole - Verse Two)

(Nicole) 
If you really want me baby 
Let me know 
Let me know, what you want 
What you looking for baby, out the door 
Gotta go, gotta go 
(Lil' Mo - Rap) 
Yo I heard from a bird that you liked it hot 
Could we meet at the spot 
In the parking lot 
I got my mama's car so don't go slow 
It's 11:22, and at 12, I ghost, yo 
(Dent - Rap) 
Yo, slow it down lover, bout a half an ounce 
I got 38 minutes just to make you bounce 
So lets take a ride 
You and I 
don't you let me pass you by 
Here we go 
Let em know 
You don't even gotta watch 
(Lil' Mo - Rap) 
So whatcha say yo, you got the joes for me 
Caught a glimpse of my Benz, now you roll with me 
You want to lay up in my ride, and get fly with me 
In the drivers seat 
You want to shine with me 
(Dent - Rap) 
Damn right, I want to shine, if I can shine with you 
And you say you're getting yours, I gotta get mine too (uh huh) 
It sounds good coming from a lady looking like you (say what, playa) 
It's just the things we do 
(Nicole)

Gotta thing 
Don't you walk away 
Don't you walk away 
No no no no no 
If you want to roll, c'mon and roll with me 
Baby baby yea 
If you want to be with me 
And you got a thing for me 
Don't you walk away from me 
Don't you be afraid of me 
If you want to roll with me 
c'mon and roll with me
