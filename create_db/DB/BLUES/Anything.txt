No doubt
You're gonna be thinkin'
I'll run out
That's where you're so mistaken
You take me to a high
Of just no other kind
I don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything (but you)
I don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything (but you)

The size
Just seems to get bigger
The prize is, well, just go figure
When I think way back when
I can't go back again

I don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything (but you)
I don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything (but you)

My half
I thought I'd be stronger
But my path
T you just seems longer
You fake me to a high
Of just no other kind

I don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything (but you)
I don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything (but you)

Don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything (but you)
I don't want anything (but you)
I don't need anything
