Here we are we are big cigars today
What can I say?
We're goin' fast in our cars astray
Off to confusion bay

Light me up please
Take a big whiff
Can I smoke these??
Save some for me

We are liquor shots of grey
and we're here to stay
Girls seem prettier everyday

Pour me some please
One for my stead
Watch me get laid
Watch us succeed

Here we can all be lovers
And Take off our covers for each other
And if you get lucky one day
You can visit my place
and the others
