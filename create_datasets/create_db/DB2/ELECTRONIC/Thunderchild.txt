There were ships of shapes and sizes
Scatter out along the bay
And I thought I heard her calling
As the steamer pulled away
The Invaders must have seen them
As across the coast they filed
Standing firm between them
There lay Thunder Child

Moving swiftly through the waters
Cannons blazing as she came
Brought a might metal war-lord
Crashing down in sheets of flame

Sensing victory was nearing
Thinking fortune must have smiled
People started cheering
"Come on Thunder Child"
"Come on Thunder Child"

The Martians released their black smoke, but the ship sped on, 
Cutting down one of the tripod figures 
Instantly, the others raised their Heat Rays 
And melted the Thunder Child's valiant heart

Lashing ropes and smashing timbers
Flashing Heat Rays pierced the deck
Dashing hopes for our deliverance
As we watched the sinking wreck
With the smoke of battle clearing
Over graves in waves defiled
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child!
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child!
Farewell Thunder Child!

When the smoke had cleared, the little steamer had reached the misty horizon, 
And Carrie was safe
But the Thunder Child had vanished forever, 
Taking with her man's last hope of victory
The leaden sky was lit by green flashes, cylinder following cylinder, 
And no one and nothing was left now to fight them
The Earth belong to the Martians.

Ulla!
