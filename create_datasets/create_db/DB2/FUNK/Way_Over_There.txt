Oh, oh, woah, oh oh
I've got a lover way over there on the mountain side
And I know that's where I should be
Don't you know
I've got a lover way over there across the river wide
I can hear her calling to me
Oh, she's calling my name (calling my name)
So sweet so plain (calling my name) I can hear her saying
(Come to me, baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby) ah

They tell me that the river's too deep 
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't get across to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying
(Come to me baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna get to you
(Come to me baby)
No matter what I have to do
(Come to me baby)

Oh, they tell me that the river's too deep 
And it's much too wide
Boy, you can't make it over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying
(Come to me baby)
I'm on my way
(Come to me baby)
I'm gonna stay
(Come to me baby)
Oh, baby when I get there
I'm going nowhere
Oh, oh, 'cause the river ain't deep enough
Oh, nothing's deep enough to keep me from your side
Ah, ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
