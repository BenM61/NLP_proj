Angels of Mercy, there's so much to do 
The heavens are gray overhead 
Angels of Mercy, they're calling to you 
So march with your crosses of red 
March where the darkness shuts out the night
March where there is no dawn 
Angels of Mercy, the world?s covered with night 
But your mercy goes marching on 
Angels of Mercy, through darkest night 
Your mercy goes marching on...
