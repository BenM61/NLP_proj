A is for angry, which is what you are at me
A is for adult, which is what I'll never be
A is for applesauce, my favorite meal
A is for Adam, which is how I sometimes feel;
Like I'm the only man on earth, and I've forgotten what that's worth

A is for Arthur, he's a lovable drunk
A M & Azing, like Thelonius Monk
A is for argument, A is for apparent
A is for antagonism that's not even there and
It's just you begging for attention or something I won't even mention

And I don't even know why you keep on trying
I don't even know why I keep on lying
There are millions of people in worlds of their own
And two of them can't let go

A is for algebra, I learned it in school
A is what Fonzie said, 'cause he was very cool
A is for adversery, A is for alection
A is arousal, you are giving me an arection,
c'mon I'm trying to show affection for longer than a half an hour

And I don't even know why you keep on trying
I don't even know why I keep on lying
There are millions of people in worlds of their own
And two of them can't let go

I met a woman I used to know
Long before you, long ago
All I could say, after hello
Was "are you still single?"

A is attitude I can't help but wield
A is for arrogance; emotional shield
A is for acting, A is for abhorrently
A is for asshole, which is what I am, how rude of me,
I owe you an apology I'm sorry

And I don't even know why I keep on trying
I don't even know why I keep on lying
There are millions of people in worlds of their own
And two of them can't let go

A
