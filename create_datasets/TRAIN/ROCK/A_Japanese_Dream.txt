I'm going back to the land of the blind
Back to the land where the sun never shines
I'm going back there and I'm hoping to find
Everything just as it was before I left it all behind

I slept at nights there hysterically
Twisted and turned but I just couldn't get free
I opened my eyes, I still couldn't see
But I could feel her, China white girl

So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey, oh

Ooh, that was a Japanese dream alright
The sound of the storm and the flickering light
And the way that her scent used to fill up the night like
Like her scent used to fill up the night

So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey

Just look at me now, just look at me this way
It looks like I am quite insane
It looks like I am trying to eat off my face
Looks like I'm going to the land of the blind anyway

Back where the sun never shines
Back to the land of the blind
Back in a Japanese dream

In a Japanese dream
