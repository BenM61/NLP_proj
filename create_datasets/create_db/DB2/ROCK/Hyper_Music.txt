Your golden lies feed my role
In this forgotten space race under my control
Who's returned from the dead?
Who remains?

You know I don't want you
and I never did
I don't want you
and I never will

You wanted more than I was worth
And you think I was scared
And you needed proof
Who really cares anymore?
Who restrains?

You know I don't love you
and I never did
I don't want you
and I never will
