Rub yourself down, finger f*ck yourself
Lookin' like you enjoy yourself

The way that you bend your body
Only keeps me in the mood
You're too exotic, so naughty
I love that look on your face
You give them feel good expressions

Bring your body close to mine

Even though this foreplay's fun
The night isn't done until we both cum
