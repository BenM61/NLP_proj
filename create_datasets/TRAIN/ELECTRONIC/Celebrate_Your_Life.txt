where is the hope today
and where is the passion?
it seemed just like yesterday
love was in fashion
a rumour that was spread around
all the answers had been found
and then it felt like moving on
and suddenly was gone
you want a reason, i'll give you reason
don't change your ideals with every season
just look inside yourself for explanation
and make your own life a celebration
do you dream of better days
gazing through a purple haze
bathed in ultra-violet rays
or do you want your conscience raised?
you want a reason, i'll give you reason
don't change your ideals with every season
just look inside yourself for explanation
and make your own life a celebration
you've got the power, power to be strong
an education that should be lifelong
so don't be a victim of expectation
just make your own life a celebration
you want a reason, i'll give you reason...
