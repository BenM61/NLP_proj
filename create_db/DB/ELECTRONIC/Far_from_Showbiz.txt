I am someone a few seconds now and then between the real
No I don't really want to know when
One hundred ringing bells are flirting so intensely with my hands
And now dizziness
I feel like someone else so uncertain
I'm going up to front expensive microphones
I don't promise to speak an honest word
When it's absurd I'm even so fry
I take no measure whatsoever out of the applause
In the room what can I do but move around the floor
It's just a silly joke
Pleasure keeps on burnin' up my nose
If I only were a little more disturbed
I would have done it

Am I that far from shobiz
I feel I press my head against the ceiling
I set my aim for the sky
I can't be short of soul or lack the meaning

Am I that far from shobiz
I have not even tried expressing feelings
With the light in my eyes
Fucked from behind
I touch freedom
