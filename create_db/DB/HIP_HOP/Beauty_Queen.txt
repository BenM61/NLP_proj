Welcome
Ya see, what we want to talk about today
Is dimes that turn to pennies
Women that turn to bitches
Honeys that turn to hoes
I know y'all out there know exacty what I'm talkin' about
Somebody that'll take their welfare check
And go buy some weed, new outfit, do shit like that
Yo, fella's, have your say
Come on

I used to see her at school
She always talked to the older dudes
The ones with nice clothes and all the shoes
I guess I should of knew

She grew up fast in a short time
Older body but her actions showed a young mind
I mean this girl was so fine
Whoa, who would  known

Who would've known
She would have grown to become
She's a

[Chorus]
Drug running, jeep jumpin'
Club frontin', know nothing
Dick suckin', smoke something
Booster hustlin', dealer fuckin'
Roller duckin', street lovin'
Six children, no husband
Beauty queen

Who would've known, who would've known

[Chorus]

Who would've known

I'm away, my stay, you was treated like you was a supermodel
Had your little Gucci dough, 'ce Gabanna and your Perotta
Then you went and got yourself a no good baby father (Ew, you)
Started going down, sleeping around, look at you now
Disrespecting yourself, giving it up, easy to touch
Ready to f*ck, now they just callin' you slut, why

Who would've known
She would have grown to become

[Chorus: x2]

I'm talking to my ghetto
Ghetto beauty queen, how will you find a king
When you're searchin' for one thing, oh
Know you want the nicer things
Get a job and buy them things
Ain't like he got you a ring
Close your legs, don't let him in between
Don't you know that you're a queen
I'm talking to my ghetto queen

[Chorus: x2]

[Chorus]

Check this out now
Dru Hill said you're sleeping in their bed
Then the twins said you slept with Jagged Edge
112 said you gave them all head
Why girl, why yeah
(I don't know what you're talking about)
