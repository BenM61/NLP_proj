I've got ways to make you sorry,
Start my life with someone else.
I've got ways to make you fall,
I'll tell you all the things that I lied about.
I've got ways to make you mad,
Laughing at the girl sitting on your lap.
I've got ways to make you sing my songs,
Ones I ain't written yet.

I've got lights you've never seen.
I've got moves I've never used.
I've got ways to make you come back to me.

I've got ways to make you strange,
Drug you up and drag you home.
I've got ways to track you down,
In all the places you like to go.
I've got ways to make you crazy,
Wear all the things you always wanted me to.
I've got ways to make you run,
My daddy is coming for you.

I've got lights you've never seen.
I've got moves I've never used.
I've got ways to make you come back to me.

I've got ways to make you hear me,
Just by whispering your name.
I've got ways to make you think,
You'll never be happy again.
I've got ways to make you see,
I'm so much better than before.
I've got ways to make you swear,
You won't want your old life anymore.

I've got lights you've never seen.
I've got moves I've never used.
I've got ways to make you come back to me.
