Stone blind alibi
I will eat the lie
Find the word
Could break any spell that binds you
Prayers like ammonites
Curl beneath the lights
How I long to
Bite every hand that feeds you more
Where'd it all go wrong
My Friday night infant
Where'd it all go wrong
My Friday night infant

All night buzz on a line
It's only blood on the rime
Wrecks my head every time
It leads me on
Where'd it all go wrong
My Friday night infant
Where'd it all go wrong
My Friday night infant

Tonight tonight
Tonight I'm running wild I'm running
Tonight I'm running wild I'm running
Tonight I'm running wild I'm running
Tonight I'm running wild I'm running
Tonight I'm running wild
