I went back my home town 
To the school and walked around 
And the way it felt 
It seemed just like yesterday 

From the cradle to the grave 
Some say we never change 
No matter how we try 
We try to rearrange 

Life father so like son 
It's as if wife we're both as one 
Just as if our fate was preordained 

In some countries far from here 
You know the one s we used to fear 
Are they waiting to return to 
Those old evil ways 

You can take a correspondence course 
Be single married or divorced 
You can psychoanalyze your brain 
But you know some things will never change 

And what will those people do 
When Russia starts anew 
They'll just stand in line 
All under a different name 

You can listen to those brainwash tapes 
Take a Jewish, Catholic, Buddhist faith 
But I'm sure it's gonna be in vain 
'cause you know some things will never change 

If their theories all come true 
Then there's nothin' we can do 
Where the future lies 
Well it's not to hard to tell 

But after all is said and done 
And if the world it lives as one 
You can bid those old taboo's 
A fond fare well 

Yes a fond fare well 
A very long fare well
