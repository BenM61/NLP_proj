Deep is the longing in the heart that ever strives
The expanses far and wide that still confine
The simple facts that yet lay waiting to be found
As lost as some forgotten promised land

Consider reasons through long goodbyes
Looking back for one last time

Just for a second look into your heart
As you stand and look across the great divide
Remember well the things that you will leave behind
As you set out to cross the vast and great divide

Guard and defend when forces hinder and collide
Solemn intentions both blessed and divine
You still pulled victory from shattered hope
Count your doubts with broken smiles
Covered your hurt in your pride

No need for reasons
None to confide
Look back and bid farewell for one last time

Just for a second look into your heart
As you stand and look across the great divide
Remember well the things that you will leave behind
As you set out to cross the vast and great divide

Just for a second look into your heart
As you stand and look across the great divide
Remember well the things that you will leave behind
As you set out to cross the vast and great divide

Just for a second look into my eyes
As you stand and look across the great divide
As you let go of tears for what you leave behind
While looking back again to say farewell for one last time

Before looking back again to say farewell for one last time
Before looking back again to say farewell for one last time
