Last time could have saved my life
Pulling me in like a tide
I feel the energy rise girl
Too late to be giving me your two faces
See ya riding a new wave
But you're floating in my world

Oooh
You can't deny that you wanna stay, ooh
Oooh
I can't see this working any other way, ooh

If you want
Just say you wanna
'Cause when I hold you
I feel your aura

If you want
Just say you wanna
'Cause when I hold you
I feel your aura

Blue I don't like, red lights
Just might take it to edge baby girl
I'll jump, you fly, I'm falling baby
'Cause you shine
I don't even need the moonlight
Pulling me in like a tide
I got your energy now girl

Oooh
You can't deny that you wanna stay, ooh
Oooh
I can't see this working any other way, ooh

If you want
Just say you wanna
'Cause when I hold you
I feel your aura

If you want
Just say you wanna
'Cause when I hold you
I feel your aura

If you want
Just say you wanna
'Cause when I hold you
I feel your aura

If you want
Just say you wanna
'Cause when I hold you
I feel your aura
