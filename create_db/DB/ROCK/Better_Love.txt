Well, you wake the love that sleeps inside
And dreamed that she had never died
Wipe that tear, but you don't know why

Boy, you're pretty, but
You're just not for me
And better love I do not see

This girl, she had it kinda sweet
'Till fame swept her off her feet
She see's nothing she did before
Let's her colors hit the floor

Scars are in her name
And she scars me with blame
Hey Scarlet, you're not the same

So, be careful what you choose
I felt love for me and you
I'm not ashamed

As I walk another mile
I help you find out, child
I don't know what to do, I feel lost without you
Better love will come to you

And so, I flew west to see her pride
Two weeks since the music died
I watch the camera shoot this girl
Seems to me a hollow pearl

Mother sat me down
Oh, what's it like, oh my boy,
To be so destroyed?

So, be careful what you choose
I felt love for me and you
I'm not ashamed

So I walk another mile
To help you find out, child
I don't know what to do, I feel lost without you
Better love will take you

So, here I sit, some years have passed
I say I don't, but I miss her bad
I smell her in my sheets, you see
Like she's sleeping next to me

She'll say,
"Jack, I'm leaving now,
And don't you wait up for me,
Cause better love I'm yet to see."
