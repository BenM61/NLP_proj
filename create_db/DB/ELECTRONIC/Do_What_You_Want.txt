Do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo

I know I can't control it
A little voice in my head
A voice that's telling me to
(Do what you want)
Temperature elevated
The air is suffocating
I'm going out where I can
(Do what you want)

It feels better when you
It feels better when you
It feels better when you
(Do what you want)
It feels better when you
It feels better when you
No need to ask again
(Do what you want)

Do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want
(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo)

I'm feeling technicolor
Oh, go on, have another
My mama said I oughta
(Do what you want)
My ego dominating
A fear to medicate it
It isn't complicated
(Do what you want, oh)

(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo)
(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo)
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want

I'm not the [?]
The biggest [?] around here
I gotta fever
Delirious to power
A world of dominoes
They fall where others push you
A string of broken hearts
Is all I really need
Tick, clicky time bomb
Nothing can't stop it
And the only thing that kill me
When you tell me how you feel about it

(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo)
(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do what you want)
(Do-do, yo-yo, want-want, yo-yo)
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want, do what you want
Do what you want
