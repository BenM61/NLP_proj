Static tone on the phone I'll be breaking again
Must be something better, babe 
All the names you called out of bed seem to fade
To sometime never planned

I won't cry for all the hunger in my heart, no
I won't cry because I've made it through this far

Just coz you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't phase me how you spend your time, ooh-oooh
Just coz you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't phase me how you spend your time, ooh-oooh

Out of the fire that burns inside me
A phoenix is rising
If you don't feel that you can love me
I won't shoot you down

I won't cry for all the hunger in my heart, no
I won't cry because I've stumbled through this far

Just coz you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't phase me how you spend your time, ooh-oooh
Just coz you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't phase me how you spend your time, ooh-oooh

I've seen life burn bright, I've seen it shimmer
They fade like starlight to a glimmer
I've seen life flow by, like a river
So full of twilight, dreams that glitter

Just coz you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't phase me how you spend your time, ooh-oooh
Just coz you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't phase me how you spend your time, ooh-oooh
