Every night doll
Every night I dream of you
Every night my darlin'
Every night I dream of you
You know I miss you so bad baby
Ever since you walk away
Every night
Every night I sing the blues
Every night time baby
Every night I sing the blues
If I'm late and I want love
I wonder what a baby you could be
Oh every night
Pack your clothes darlin'
Right here back home to me
Pack your clothes darlin'
Bring it back home to me
Because I dream about you baby
Every night and every day
