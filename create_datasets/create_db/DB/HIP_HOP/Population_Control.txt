[El P] 
You and your whole fucking canned crewmen'll end tepid 
So when I Pearl Harbor don't let me catch you intrepid 
I'm telling you the wishbone be broke in my favorite crumbcake your 
Mistake 
Enterprise and see Indelibles  the number one feel bad crew of the 
Season 
Just give me one reason to splash  I should let the flag half mast 
Take time to wallow 
Company Flow the toughest penis sucky sucky 
So of course in an attempt to defend you end up unkempt 
Plus this agent get orange E-L-P-F-see-F rock for you 
First cousin to sling red dye number five be the potion 
In the subterrain warden for a gem of fate like stop motion 
Best to get ak-a-nickulous 
Our masks aren't intangible 
Auto man verse mandible 
We answer to no one, we 911 
Silent alarm this is harm fear the duck of learning 
El-P phase through these walls like vision 
Choked in the shallow water, a bad executive decision 
Release the crack and please put down your skin flutes 
How could you...motherfuckers think ya 
To this mercenary sunblock 2000 burner 
All of your knowledge is truant 
Unlearn all of the shit and then over time you become fluent 
Send a fucking storm 
After I present enter the spectrum your career's never no more 
Enter the rectum 
And at twilight we'll skip stones and laugh about your poems 
But a blood-red book when the others got funcrushed is a spot 
The terror fabulously gets hot 
Co Flow mossie 
Walt Disney meets Kaiser Soze 
There will be no grand comebacks unless Lazarus or Kotter 
Inflicted bitch styles in a cave with stigmata 
We're locked in a box but you can't say Jack 
Trying to paint them fucking red doors black 
Like that spilled milk spoiled 
When Bill Gates and Ted Turner rub each other down with olive oils 
Company Flow f*ck please 
Bitch put away the fucking piteous punchlines 
Blue Blockers break under the red light, belittled by my design 
I don't try to be different I am 
So inevitably my style will survive when your now turns to then 
El-P, vastly crapaphobic 
3-2-1 contact never no more that's a promise 
You hold toast, well I hold Thomas 
Golden nooks and crannies 
Win my ticket raffle off the recycled thought shopping spree winner 
Congratu-fucking-lations, I dropped it now you got it 
But it's only a matter of time before Waldo gets spotted 
Pulled out of the crowd and martyred, a good old fashioned stoning 
My children, the professional has left the fucking building 
Until but for now 
You can't get run at night 
Curfews is issued in the daylight x2 
Population Control 
Until but for now 
You can't get run at night 
Curfews is issued in the daylight 
[Bigg Jus] 
Like gargling, even in the nights we rip shit up 
The two franchise players that make your whole squad look butt 
Who brought the March Madness competition till October 
Got you thinking that shit became a bit little harder 
These niggas is fucking soldiers 
Indelible mercenaries that's why ballin' gets me on the nutsack 
The murderous intellect highly infections on contact 
You need to come quicker than that 
To snatch the cheddar from the mousetrap 
Small timer, it takes crazy engineering 
To f*ck with anything from quantum physics to thought transmitters 
Next up be that over .400 switch hitter 
Out the park kingpin Dave couldn't do Justice 
Pound for pound it be these 2000 rap slugfests 
Hardcore when future emcees fight future wars 
But for now I'm fighting a squad of super-whores 
Butt-fucking invincible Co Flow skills for take-out 
Where you can get the beef broccoli with extra duck sauce 
The quick draw intend to keep cops reaching for the bearclaws 
Come meet the Coney Island intruder hit the arts way after midnight 
Had a scheme for a burner etched out tonight in graphite 
Apply the same ideology of be	-boys to men to the mic 
And scratch the sounds like a quarter inch bolt broken off 
Co Flow coming at you from every verse payola shit 
Got stations blessing me off two thousand for every song minute 
Secretly teach background voclas in R&B clinics 
Until but for now 
You can't get run at night 
Curfews is issued in the daylight x2 
Population Control 
Until but for now 
You can't get run at night 
Curfews is issued in the daylight 
Population Control x6
