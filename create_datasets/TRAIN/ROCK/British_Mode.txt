Give me a reason to cool you down 
An explanation 
I'm gonna lift you to up a crown 
A great location 

I try to hit it hard 
Give me a reason 
This ain't no heart attack 
Nobody 

Give me a reason to cool you down 
An explanation 
I'm gonna lift you to up a crown 
A great location 

I try to hit it hard 
Give me a reason 
This ain't no heart attack 
Nobody 

Give me a reason to pull you down 
An explanation 
I'm gonna lift you to up a crown 
A great location 

I'm gonna beat you to the ground 
No conversation 
Give me a reason to cool you down 
An explanation. 

I try to hit it hart 
Give me a reason 
This ain't no heart attack 
Nobody 

I try to hit it hard 
Give me a reason 
An explanation.
