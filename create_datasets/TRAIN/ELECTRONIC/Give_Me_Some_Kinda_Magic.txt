I was a young man choosing to be alone
You were a young girl breaking out on your own
It''s the change you made in me
And your smile can make me see
That it''s easy to try
When I know that you''re taking me high
(You take me higher and higher)

You give me some kinda magic
And I don''t wanna lose my hold on you
You give me some kinda magic
''cause you set me alight when I''m close to you
(It shows)

No good pretending don''t wanna be alone
(Don''t want to be on my own)
With you beside me we''re making our house our home
(We''re going to make our house our home)
It''s the way you look at me
''cause you set my spirits free
And it''s easy to try
When I know that you''re taking me high
(You take me higher and higher when)


Thinking of you girl I always do
You take up all my time
''cause you make me strong
And your magic lingers on
(You take me high so high)
