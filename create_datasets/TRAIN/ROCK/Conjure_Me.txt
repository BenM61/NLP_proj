I smell your blood, my love,
But I can't taste it yet.
I have your mind, my love,
But I can't waste it yet.
Please understand, my love,
I find this sickening.
My head is ice, my love.
My skin is thickening.
But, oh, my love,
We could still be friends.
And, oh, my love,
With me you must contend.
I'm gonna turn on you before you turn on me.
I'm gonna turn on you -- can you conjure me?
And, walk the mile into this web of my conspiracy?
I'm gonna turn on you before you turn on me.
I'm in a hole,
But I don't feel the safety net.
I have your soul,
But I am wasting it.
But oh, my love,
We could still be friends.
And, oh, my love,
With me you must contend.
