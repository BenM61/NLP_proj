Hurray, hallelujah
Hurray, hallelujah
And I hope you're satisfied, you rascal you

So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody
You met someone and now you know how it feels, goody goody
You gave her your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
And she broke it in little pieces; now how do you do?

So you lie awake just singin' the blues all night, goody goody
You think that love's a barrel of dynamite
Hurray and hallelujah, you had it comin' to ya
Goody goody for her, goody goody for me
And I hope you're satisfied, you rascal you

You gave her your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
And she stuck it in her collection, section ninety-two
So you lie awake just singin' the blues all night, goody goody

You think that love's a barrel of dynamite
Hurray and hallelujah, you had it comin' to ya
Goody goody for her, goody goody for me
And I hope you're satisfied, you rascal you
