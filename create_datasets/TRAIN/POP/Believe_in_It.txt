It's hard to bet your life on love
When all we learn is how to keep on moving
And the odds are never good enough
For all we know, nothing lasts forever in this life

Show me one thing that will never fade away
What goes with the fall, returns with the spring
This whole world is made that way
Who's to know if love will stay

But there's nothing quite like this
That I've ever known
And I believe in it
There's no way out of it 
I can't let go
Because I believe in it

We second guess the things we see
When all too soon you know time will show
If love was never meant to be
Then we can't hide before too long
We'll know if it was right

Show me one thing that will never fade away
What goes with the fall, returns with the spring
This whole world is made that way
Who's to know if love will stay
