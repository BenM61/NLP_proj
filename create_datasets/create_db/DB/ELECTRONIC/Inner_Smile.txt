Oh yeh

You gave me something
Like loving
And took me in so soon
You took my feelings
From nothing
Came back at noon
Just meet me
I'm ready
To show myself to you

So if I lose my patience
You must try to understand
(Try to understand)
If I lose my patience
Oh yeah

Cause you make me feel
Cause you make me feel wild
You touch my inner smile
You got me in the mood
So come on and make your move
And free me

You make my wishes
As much as
Your kisses make me blue
You've found my river
Now will you
Escape away too
But baby
I'm ready
I'm falling into you

So if I lose my patience
You must try to understand
(Try to understand)
If I lose my patience

So come on and make your move
And free me

Free me
Free me

Cause you make me feel
Cause you make me feel wild
You touch my inner smile
You got me in the mood
So come on and make your move
And touch my inner smile

Come get my inner smile

Sometimes I need to be alone
There's times I need for you to phone
Sometimes you make me feel so high
There's times I ask myself why

Sometimes I need to be alone
There's times
