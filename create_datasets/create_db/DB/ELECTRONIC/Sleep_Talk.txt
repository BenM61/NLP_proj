Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep
Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep

You don't know but you'd done gone
And told on yourself, baby
I always thought but now I know
You're just a lowdown so and so, hey, hey

He's sayin', oh, how I love you, place the one above you
Wish you could be all mine, yeah
But instead of tellin' lies, it's the truth that makes me cry
As you talk in your sleep

You said you will love only me and I will love only you
And now you come running back to me
Call the stats, disrespect
Little boy, you can't be trusted, yeah

Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep
Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep

Early in the next morning, he was a-stretchin' and a-yawnin'
Woke up with a big smile
He had sparkles in his eyes
That I never took the time to notice before

Hum, hey, hey baby, what's happening?
Good morning, how you're doing, sugar?
I've been changed myself
You know, I'm gonna get some weed

Baby, what's wrong?
You look kinda pinky, did you sleep well?
Did you sleep alright?
Got something in your eye?

You said you will love only me and I will love only you
And now you come running back to me
Call the stats, disrespect
Little boy, you can't be trusted, yeah

Sleep talk, yeah
You been talking in your sleep
Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep

Sleep talk, yeah
You been talking in your sleep
Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep

Sleep talk
