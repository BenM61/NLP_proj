Let me out, slow it down, I'll get off here
It's been a rush for both of us,
But I just can't shake this fear

So I'll go away, with nothing to say
But you're gonna be just fine
We got all of track so I'm putting you back
Maybe you'll get it right next time

A fairy tale, we'd never fail
It all looked so good
Now you want more, but I'm not sure
That I ever could give you all that you need

So I'll go away, with nothing to say
But you're gonna be just fine
We got all off track so I'm putting you back
Maybe you'll get it right next time

By the time I came back home
You were gone.

Now I close my eyes
And I try to fight
The pain in my heart
But I still relive
And I can't forgive
The night I tore us apart

So I'll go away, with nothing to say
But you're gonna be just fine
We got all off track so I put you back
Thinking you'd get it right next time

Yeah, I went away with nothing to say
But you're gonna be just fine
We got all off track so I put you back

Maybe I'll get it right next time
