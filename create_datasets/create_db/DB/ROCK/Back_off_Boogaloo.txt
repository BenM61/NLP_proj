Back off, Boo-ga-loo, I said,
Back off, Boo-ga-loo, come on,
Back off, Boo-ga-loo, Boo.

Back off, Boo-ga-loo,
What d'yer think you're gonna do
I got a flash right from the start.

Wake up, meat head
Don't pretend that you are dead
Get yourself up off the cart.

Get yourself together now
And give me something tasty,
Everything you try to do
You know it sure sound wasted!

Back off, Boo-ga-loo, I said,
Back off, Boo-ga-loo.
You think you're a groove
Standing there in your wallpapers shoes
And your socks that match your eyes

Back off, Boo-ga-loo, I said,
Back off, Boo-ga-loo, come on,
Back off, Boo-ga-loo, Boo.
