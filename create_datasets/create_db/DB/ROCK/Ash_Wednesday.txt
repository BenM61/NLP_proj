The tents go up 
As I go down
Down to the flats and into the sound
The closer I get to the city
The further I am from memory
In the green grass looking up
For the words of the angry sun
'no one' when he says 'no one'
Yeah he means 'no one' 
No one
No one will survive
Ash Wednesday alive
No soldier no lover
No father no mother
Not a lonely child
In the up and in the bedroom
A black and white of the bride and the groon
Will bring me to my knees
With the colorized bad dream
That takes its place on 
Ash Wednesday

White noise and love
Will be my only drug
On this day nine 
Suns away 
From that sad sad Saturday
When fire my friend
Fire my villain
You take away yesterday
To give to me today
When nothing's free no now it's
Ash Wednesday

So each day is ash Wednesday
All this life is ash Wednesday

All the doors are shut
And the windows barely opened up
The fires all around
It's the ending of the drought
And we are ready now
For tear gas clouds
On my mind
Come on fill the house
Finally and weep
For it's king and queen sleep
Both now 
In the arms of 
Ash Wednesday
Ash Wednesday
