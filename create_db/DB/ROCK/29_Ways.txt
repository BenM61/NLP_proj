I got 29 ways to make it to my baby's door
I got 29 ways to make it to my baby's door
And if she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more

I got one through the basement
Two down the hall
And when the going gets tough
I got a hole in the wall

29 ways just to make it to my baby's door
And if she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more

I can come through the chimney like Santa Claus
Go through the window and that ain't all
A lot of good ways I don't want you to know
I even got a hole in the bedroom floor

29 ways to make it to my baby's door
If she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more

I got a way through the closet behind her clothes
A way through the attic that no one knows
A master key that fits every lock
A hidden door behind the grandfather clock

I got 29 ways to make it to my baby's door
And if she needs me bad
I can find about two or three more
