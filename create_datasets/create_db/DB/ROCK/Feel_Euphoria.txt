If I come to break your balls
It's alright
If you can't keep from climbing the walls
It's alright
When the clouds are closing in
It's alright
No I will not give in
It's alright

You can feel my every move
Sooner or later I'll refuse
To let you into my good graces
See the smiles upon their faces
Leading up to my reply
Their voices fill up the night sky

Feel Euphoria
All around you

You made your own bed now lie in it
No one put a gun to your head

Did you hear the news today?
Have you read what the papers say?
Neon green in alabaster
Spinning heads are spinning faster
Should you stay or should you go
That's for you to wonder and for me to know

Feel Euphoria
All around you

If I choose I will give nothing
You can't stop me from feeling something
Digging in I'm digging faster
Trying hard to avoid disaster
