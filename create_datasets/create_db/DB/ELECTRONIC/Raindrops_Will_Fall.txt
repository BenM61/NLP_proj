There's a time 4 every star 2 shine
And a place 4 every dream 2 see the light
When you have everything
you don't need another reason 2b something

Hold on, and look to your faith
Can't let nobody, nobody get in your way

I walked through the fire
Fought through the ragin storm
Til I found the peace
That's inside of me
I've got 2 be	 strong
I stand 4 my dreams 
I was made 4 this moment
Take me as I am
Or nothin at all
I'll keep holdin on
Raindrops will fall

Haunting echoes from a careless word
You'll never know how much they hurt
Dreams are precious don't you know
But they are so hard to follow

Hold on and look to your faith
Don't let nobody, nobody get in your way

I walked through the fire
Fought through the ragin storm
Til I found the peace
That's inside of me
I've got 2 be	 strong
I stand 4 my dreams 
I was made 4 this moment
Take me as I am
Or nothin at all
I'll keep holdin on
Raindrops will fall

I was taught not 2 run away
'Cause raindrops will always fall on your face
When it seems like all hope is gone
Gotta get through the storm
before you can see the dawn
This is all I am
This is all I know
And I won't never ever let go 
No I won't let go

I walked through the fire
Fought through the ragin storm
Til I found the peace
That's inside of me
I've got 2 be	 strong
I stand 4 my dreams 
I was made 4 this moment
Take me as I am
Or nothin at all
I'll keep holdin on
Raindrops will fall
