Look at that lil' ass Westside doped out 
Insane in the brain little nigga servin' caine 
Use to have to axe could he cross the street 
Now he's rollin' in a Gee  the Gee is on E 
He's quick to hit you up with the two fingers spread (whats up?) 
Don't roll that shit (whats up?) and hold that shit (whats up?) 
Now you know what fuckin' set he's claimin'
A wild little nigga and it ain't no tamin'
And just when you think everything is calm 
That motherfucker is the first to bum 
Like bang, ping, catch you with the sleeper 
He'll draw down and then check his beeper 
He's clockin' them chicks and bucks 
Gettin', his little dick sucked by the, clucks 
And will he do dirt? Fool oh please 
Little locs are harder then the O-G's 
You fall to the ground and beg please 
Just got served by little niggas on the 10-speed 
12 years old, got bumps they can't keep 
A straight killer, a fool, a lil' ass gee

God damn, it's a trick 
Use to have the G.I.Joe with the kung-fu grip 
Now he's straight Crip, or Blood 
Now ya sag, you use the blunt 
Now ya known as the favorite groupie 
Goin' to camp and it ain't Camp Snoopy (whats up?) 
But I ain't surprised 
It's 12 months later, year, I see you got a little size 
You motherfuckin' crook 
You want respect 'cause you didn't get'cha manhood took 
Drinkin' that 'yac like it's no tomorr-why 
West side hustler fucker-tory 
In the jail and it ain't no thing 
Can't wait til you get 22's on the hang (Uh) 
A underage boy that's lookin' tossed 
And that's ya idea of who you hide 
All you want for Christmas is guns and drinkers 
Little nigga nuttier than a Snicker 
You don't want to be like Mike, you want to be like me 
A fool, a killer, a lil' ass gee

See, I knew it wouldn't be long 
They got your ass stretched like Stretch Armstrong 
In the one-man cell, it got'cha thinkin'
Sendin' more kites than Benjamin Franklin 
20 years old but ya still a veteran 
Won't touch down til we're livin' like the Jetsons 
Proud of ya self, because ya done done it 
Gotcha 22's and your name on your stomach 
Never even think about a woman to f*ck 
Rather stand in line or bust the ass of a young buck 
Got stuck, now you're bleedin'
Hospital ward, is got your reading 
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see 
That ya mad enough to go and stick the death to these 
See, it ain't about bein hard 
But that's what'cha tell the little homies in the yard 
Ya already done did 10 
And wish you could start all over again 
Brand new inmates and who do ya see 
Your baby brother in shackles, a fool, a lil' ass gee

A fool, a lil' ass gee 
Yo this go out to the little hard head homies 
Who probably goin' see more, ah, assholes than pussy holes 
When they get you in that system
