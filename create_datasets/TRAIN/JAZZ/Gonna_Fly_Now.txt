Gonna fly now, flying high now
Gonna fly, fly, fly
Rocky's ready to make a move, yeah
Rocky's ready he just can't lose, yeah
Every nerve a wire sweatin' blood, like fire
Body's achin' from the hurt it's takin'
muscles screamin' like a burnin' demon
Every nerve a wire sweatin' blood, like fire
 
Tryin' hard now, it's so hard now
Tryin' hard now, Rocky power by the hour
Pumpin' iron God ya know he's tryin'
Every nerve a wire sweatin' blood, like fire
Gonna fly now, flyin' high now
Gonna fly, fly, fly
 
Feelin' strong now, won't be long now
Gettin' strong now, fists like thunder gonna put you under
Pumpin' iron God ya know he's tryin'
Every nerve a wire sweatin' blood, like fire
Gonna fly now, flyin' high now
