They say it takes a lot to keep a love alive:
In every heart there pumps a different beat

But if we shift the rhythm into overdrive,
We could generate a lot of heat...

On 52nd Street
On 52nd Street

We're gonna throw a little soul parade,
Before they know the second bar was played

We're gonna slip it to 'em short and sweet

On 52nd Street
On 52nd Street
