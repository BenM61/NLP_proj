Money, money, money, money
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil

You work for a man and you get no pay
Brother don't do nothing wrong
Don't beg the one inflating you
When Jah will come, it's you all alone

Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, tell you
Is the root of all evil

Some steal it, some kill for it
Some do iniquity for it
It makes friends, it break friends
Judas betrayed Christ for it

Money, money, money, tell you
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil

Hey yeah, money, money, yeah

Some steal it, some kill for it
Some do iniquity for it
It makes friends, it break friends
Judas betrayed Christ for it

Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, tell you
Is the root of all evil

We can't live without it
We got to buy food to eat
It's good and it's bad
And yet we can't live without it

Money, money, money, tell you
Is the root of all evil
Money, money, money, people
Is the root of all evil
