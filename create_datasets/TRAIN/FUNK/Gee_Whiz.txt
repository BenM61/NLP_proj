Gee whiz, look at his eyes 
Gee whiz, how they hypnotize 
He's got everything a girl could want 
Man, oh, man, what a prize! Oooh ooh 

Gee whiz, he's all the joy 
Gee whiz, I could find in a boy 
He's awful nice, its paradise 
I hope I'm not he's decoy 

Heaven up above knows how much 
I love that gentle soul 
Angels sing of a love like this 
I hope our love will grow and grow 

Oh, gee whiz, I love that guy 
Gee whiz, my, my, oh my 
There are things we could do 
I could say I love you 
But all I can say is
Gee whiz!
