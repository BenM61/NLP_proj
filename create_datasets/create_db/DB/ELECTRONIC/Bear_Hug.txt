All you, hey want to give you a bear hug
Out there on the floor, gonna get you in my paws
And give you a bear hug
We brought you all a gift, for maximum dancefloor uplift
It's called the bear hug

Sent to make you move, just get up on this groove
And have a bear hug, bear hug,
Till the morning
Gonna give you a bear hug till the morning
Bear hug, till the morning, everybody do the bear hug

I am here to chirps or try and lift your skirt
Let's have a bear hug
I've seen you round the bits and I don't want to feel your tits
Wanna give you a bear hug

It gets lonely in the woods but right now I'm here in the hood
Let's have a bear hug, bear hug, till the morning
Gonna give you a bear hug, till the morning
Bear hug, till the morning 
Everybody give a bear hug

So if you are leaving with a bear tonight
For some loving in the pale moonlight
Well, know everything's going to be alright

(I know you want it, you know you want it)

So if you are leaving with a bear tonight
For some loving in the pale moonlight
Well, know everything's going to be alright
I know you want it, you know you want it

There is no quack who'd give you pills
That will give you natural thrills like a bear hug
Ain't no other drug as good as this here love
Give me a bear hug

Take it easy take your time, we're gonna blow your mind
With a bear hug, do the bear till the morning
Everybody do the bear hug, don't matter who you are
Just get down and have a bear hug
