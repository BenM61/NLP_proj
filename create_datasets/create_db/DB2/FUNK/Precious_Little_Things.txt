A comfort in word when I'm feeling low
A roof over my head when there's nowhere to go
A gentle touch
When the world is hard and dreams are broken
Ears that don't hear
When the words of generous minds have spoken
Precious little things (precious little things)
You mean the world to me (those precious things)
Mean the world to me (those precious things)

A delicate smile when laughter seems a strain
And you're my stopper in life's tub
When I'm headed down the drain
Mm, a caring eye that sees me as I am
A tower of strength
Though you're gentle as a lamb
Precious little things (precious little things)
You mean the world to me (those precious things)
Mean the world to me (those precious things)
Yeah

Welcoming arms when I've been wrong
Mm, yeah
An unselfish heart that shows me I'm belong
Those extra special things you bring a quite of few
This special part of life I share with only you
Precious little things (precious little things)
You mean the world to me (those precious things)
Mean the world to me (those precious things)
Those precious little things you say
Precious things you do each day
