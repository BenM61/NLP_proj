Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

I need some help, I get beside myself
And I got so many things in life to do
Like, reach for a star or maybe shoot ten under par
I'd like to do it all before I'm through

Fly into space or maybe save the human race
All these things seem so appealing
But I'll never get the chance, 'cause all I do is dance
My mama said my brains are in my feet

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Papa told, every night when he would scold me
He knew I'd never make him very proud
So I ran away from home to live all alone
And make myself a standout in the crowd

Then it hit, my ideas began to fit
I had to be what I was meant to be
Now my name is up in lights and I hoof here every night
They were right my brains are in my feet

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
