I almost got drunk at school at fourteen,
Where I almost made out with the Homecoming Queen,
Who almost went on to be Ms. Texas,
But lost to a slut with much bigger breastests
I almost dropped out to move to L.A.,
Where I was almost famous for almost a day,

And I almost had you,
But I guess that doesn't cut it,
Almost loved you,
I almost wish you would've loved me too,

I almost held up a grocery store,
Where I almost did five years and then seven more,
Cause I almost got caught for a fight with a thug,
Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs,
That I almost got hooked on cause you ran away,
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay,

And I almost had you,
But I guess that doesn't cut it,
Almost had you,
And I didn't even know it,
You kept me guessing and now I'm destined to spend my time missing you,
I almost wish you would've loved me too,

Here I go thinking about all the things I could of done,
I'm gonna need a forklift cause all the baggage weighs a ton,
And though we had our problems I can't remember one,

I almost forgot to say something else,
And if I can't fit it in
I'll keep it all to myself,
I almost wrote a song about you today,
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away,

And I almost had you,
But I guess that doesn't cut it,
Almost had you,
And I didn't even know it,
You kept me guessing and now I'm destined to spend my time missing you,
And I almost had you,
And I almost had you,
I almost wish you would've loved me too
