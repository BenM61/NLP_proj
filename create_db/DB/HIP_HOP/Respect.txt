[Featuring Dr. Dre, Prince Ital] 
Intro: Dr. Dre 
I know you're bobbin your head, cause I can see yah (repeat 4X) 
You can't see me, hah 
Back up in that ass once again 
With some of Dat Nigga Daz shit 
Beatin up on your ear drums with some of that G Funk 
Some of that gangsta funk 
Some of that ghetto funk 
Call it what you want, just don't forget the G 
Got the motherfuckin Dogg Pound in the house 
Verse One: Dogg Pound 
Now tell me what's poppin in your head my brother 
What you want to do end up dead motherfucker 
I don't know why we got to kill each other 
Cause on the streets it's do or die motherfucker 
[Kurupt] 
Now as a child I was raised in the church 
Now what ever possessed me to do the shit that I do to put you in the 
dirt 
I gives a f*ck about a nigga on the street 
I'm runnin ninety-fo' and I done ran ninety-three, don't like no 
hurdle 
For the murders I committed in my Omni Fo' convertable 
And not a soul saw who did it 
As I lean to the side in my Omni G-Ride 
On a mission, fo' deep, Dogg Pound do or die 
[Daz] 
Now if you see me mobbin down the street what would you think (not) 
Realizing that I'm surviving off instinct 
What makes my mind click to perfect timing 
For me to twist shit switchin bullshit the f*ck up like The Shining 
Cause I'm in my own zone, alone look down 
You think you saw but death is all round like a ghost town 
Perhaps you, know I axe you 
Fool if I have to, can you comprehend or adapt to 
Chorus: Prince Ital 
Respect to the Deathrow Inmates 
Deathrow Inmates lawd dem never hesitate 
To bust a gun shot, in a i-diot face 
Dis is Dogg Pound and your life goes to waste 
Fraid, Dogg Pound carry no grace 
Lifetime in static, put you inna your place 
Dogg Pound be killin a bitch mentality 
Mess with Dogg Pound and you be dead each way 
Lawd 
Verse Two: Dogg Pound 
[Daz] 
Now I'm Dat Nigga Daz, everywhere I roll I'm set to blast 
The way to success is elevating too fast 
Every corner that I turn, there's money to burn 
With no concern count the amount there's more to be earned 
Set-Trip, the word I hear every nigga spit 
Sixty percent's trippin forty percent's bullshittin 
Industy's shady, my safety's in jeapordy 
Control the mind with mental telepathy nigga 
Shady as f*ck, Kurupt can see it in your eyes 
Anticipatin for the real to come from the disguise 
The Pound, we roll thick like one-time 
And I could f*ck your bitch after I bust just one rhyme 
All we do is smoke weed and get blitzed 
And kick that motherfuckin gangsta shit 
(Say what say what say what say what say what?) 
Kick that motherfuckin gangsta shit 
[Kurupt] 
Well I see myself on top, by the age of twenty-two 
or will I drop, a fallen star that has been forgotten not 
In the past, I mainly hustled for the cash 
surprised to see that nigga rise up on that ass 
Anybody killa, do or die if I have to 
On deck, twenty-four seven and blastin if I have to 
I live my life I done swore to courtin trigger long 
Who would stop the movement why I journied so far 
From the danger that lurks, from the one that's out doin dirt 
Step to modify this and vanish away from this Earth 
Beyond the heartbreaks and heartaches, rest in peace 
Riders died death is unexplainable when you die 
Outro: Prince Ital 
We don't got to stoop low 
We don't got to stoop low 
We don't got to stoop to your level 
But when they see we coming lawd 
Now when they see we coming lawd 
Now when they see we coming lawd they tremble 
Cause we a rebel, terror from a well fractured gun
