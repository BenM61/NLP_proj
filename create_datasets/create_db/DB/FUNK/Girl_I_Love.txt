I told my friends all about you
How much I miss you and love to kiss you
I'm in love with you, darlin', and I hope you love me too

Woke up this morning, I was all alone
Looked for the girl I love, but she was gone
Somebody help me, help me find the girl I love

I left my baby in California
Oh, how I cried when she said goodbye
Somebody help me, help me find the girl I love
