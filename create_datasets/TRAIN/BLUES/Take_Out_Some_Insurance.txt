If you leave me, baby, say you won't be back
That would be the end of me, 'cause I'd have a heart attack
You better get some insurance on me, baby, take out some insurance on me, baby
'Cause if you ever, ever say goodbye, I'm gonna haul right off and die

Darlin', how I love you, long as I got breath
If we part, I know sweetheart, it would worry me to death
You better get some insurance on me, baby, take out some insurance on me, baby
'Cause if you ever, ever say goodbye, I'm gonna haul right off and die

Don't get no sick and accident, 'cause I'm healthy as can be
Now, if ya got any sense, you'd take the hint and get a Penn Life, on me
You don't know me, baby, like I know myself,
I couldn't live if you should give your love to someone else
Better get some insurance on me, baby, take out some insurance on me, baby
'Cause if you ever, ever say goodbye, I'm gonna haul right off and die
