In my secluded state my mind 
Valued things are hard to find 
My mind's gone I know not where 
left without a care 

When my thoughts are taking flight 
pen them down on sheets of white 
Building castles in the air 
left without a care 

In a crowded room alone that's where you'll find me 
I have left my mind somewhere floating behind me 

Blue skies white clouds to be seen 
wish my mind could be as clean 
As the clouds that swim above 
all the world is love 

[Chorus ]
Bubbles forming all around 
Left my body on the ground 
Unattached too hard to move 
All the world is love 
All the world is love 
All the world is love
