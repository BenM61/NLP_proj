You, you are the reason I
I know the world is here for me
To get away, oh, like we did that night
Yeah, we were lost, but we were free

Then you said, "You wanna go for a little ride?" Yeah
I said "I'ma be right there with you," oh
You said, "I wanna go up a little higher"

You know that I'm down, down, down, down for anything
So down, down, down, down for anything
I'm down, down, down, down for anything
So down, down, down, down for anything
For anything, ooh

Down for anything

Take, you take me in so deep
Where no one's ever been before
Beyond the moon, just like a masterpiece
You leave me wanting nothing more, more, yeah

You said, "You wanna go for a little ride?" Yeah
I said "I'ma be right there with you," oh
You said, "I wanna go up a little higher"

You know that I'm down, down, down, down for anything
So down, down, down, down for anything
I'm down, down, down, down for anything
So down, down, down, down for anything
For anything, ooh yeah

So down
So down, down, down, yeah
Down for anything
Down for anything
