The way you kiss me babe makes my body come alive 
The way you hold me babe hold me close when you're deep in side 
The way you lick my face and you show your kinky side 
The way you grab my waist send chills up and down my spine 

Cause you make it feel like the first time, every time we make love
Then you explore my body babe, don't rush with every touch 
Cause you make it feel like the first time, every time we make love
You take over my body babe, Hold my body babe like the first time 
The first time 

The way you pull my hair lets me know you're in control
The way you say my name makes me fall deeper in love 
And the way you taste my love shows you're not afraid to please me 
So baby this love is you're whenever you want me whenever you need me 

Cause you make it feel like the first time, every time we make love
Then you explore my body babe, don't rush with every touch 
Cause you make it feel like the first time, every time we make love
You take over my body babe, Hold my body babe like the first time 
The first time 

Oh boy, you showed your way 
That you ain't afraid to take your time to let me ride 
And you never rushed when were making love
And you ain't no one minute man you always made sure that I get mine 
That's why I've always shared my body with you 
Cause it feels like the first time 
Cause you know how to make it feel like 

Cause you make it feel like the first time, every time we make love
Then you explore my body babe, don't rush with every touch 
Cause you make it feel like the first time, every time we make love
