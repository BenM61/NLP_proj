The scout's report that you've been seen down the river
They say you sleep with one eye open, one eye dreaming
Did they tell you madness passes? Did they tell you?
There's no such thing as passing madness 

The monstrous has become mundane
Routine takes the place of pain
Voici le temps des assassins
You're addicted to revolution
Addiction is no revolution 

Make sure your knife is sharp and clean
Make sure you're not too late, not too soon
Voici le temps des assassins
Voici le temps des assassins
Voici le temps des assassins
