You know you'd better stop
Stop it baby
Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better
If you leave I know my life will never be the same
One more chance that's all I ask
My heart is full of shame
Let me explain
Ooh I fooled around and took the chance on a one night fling
You caught me wrong
I promise you girl ill try my best to do the right thing
Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better stop
Stop it baby
Wait a minute now
There's one thing id like to say if you have the time
Ill confess the wrong I've done
If you say you're mine
Let me explain
Ooh I fooled around and took the chance on a one night fling
Honey
You caught me wrong
I promise you girl ill try my best to do the right thing
Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better
Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better
Stop
