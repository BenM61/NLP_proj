Everything so clear now
It's written on your face
In a world within a world
I can smell the bridges burn
Sharks ever circling
They never go away
In these dark, murky waters
So hard to navigate and so easy to hate

Paint me black, demonize me, this is how you pay me back?
Do you ever really know someone until you look away?
Misplaced my trust, only to learn, honesty is just a word

This is a stolen life
Before you walk away
Don't forget to turn the knife

What's next, more betrayal?
Have I not suffered enough?
You made me feel so alive
Now you're just killing me killing me

Carve away the rotten flesh
It's time to burn
Strip away the dirty lies
Expose the ugly truth
