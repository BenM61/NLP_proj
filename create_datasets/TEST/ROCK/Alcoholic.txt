Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes 
And your Daddy was an alcoholic 
But your mother kept it all inside 
Threw it all away 
I was looking for another you 
And I found another one 
I was looking for another you
When I looked round you were gone 
Stay by my side 
And the pipe dream is yours now 
Stay by my side 
And the singer won't get in our way 
Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes 
And your Daddy was an alcoholic 
But your mother kept it all inside 
Threw it all away 
I was looking for another you 
And I found another one 
I was looking for another you
When I looked round you were gone 
Stay by my side 
And the pipe dream is yours now 
Stay by my side 
And the cynics won't get in our way 
Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes 
And your Daddy was an alcoholic 
But your mother kept it all inside 
Threw it all away 
I was looking for another chance 
To see your blue eyed problem
