We keep dancing 'til the world falls
Go on and on 'til the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down
Hey

The world has gone mad
We might be safer on the dancefloor
So much destruction in our path
Wake up, wake up
They're comin' back for more, they comin' back for more

It's still real so let's just rock the floor
(And live now like tomorrow never comes)
Lose ourselves tonight, with no remorse
Until forever

We keep dancing 'til the world falls
Go on and on 'til the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

My record coast is clear, we have no fear
We're the survivors
Wake up because that day is finally here
A new horizon
(Time is up)

And it's still real so let's just rock the floor
(And live now like tomorrow never comes)
Lose ourselves tonight, with no remorse
Oh baby

We keep dancing 'til the world falls
Go on and on 'til the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

Let's step out tonight, ay
My feet don't walk, they fly, I dance on clouds tonight, yeah
With me, oh natural high
And it's my birthday
I'ma just rock my birthday suit
I take the shirt and the shoes off the Vantage too
Call that my birthday coupe

And I wanna be free
Wanna feel good to be me
Me, lil' bitch I'm a king
I got a dream
I might just call up my team and go skydiving off of my wings
I feel flyer than Mya, I know what a caged bird sings
'Cause you gotta have a song when the world falls down
You don't wanna be alone so we just keep dancing

We keep dancing 'til the world falls
Go on and on 'til the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

We can go on and on and on
Until the world falls down
We can go on and on and on
Until the world falls down

We keep dancing 'til the world falls
Go on and on 'til the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down
