Don't walk out, listen to me when I say
We've got a whole lot of magic, don't let it slip away
Now there's tears on you eyes not the pages of the book
If I find time to read them just to take a second look

You can fall down, you can fall for the line
You can feel it, baby give me one more time
You can fall down, you can fight and never know
But you never learn now you learn to let it go

Fall down trying and you learn the lesson of love
You can fall, fall down trying
Trying to learn the lesson of love
Hold on, listen to me when I say

Time is an illusion but it just won't fade away
We can walk out, learn it all
But we never go easy and you know that it should fall
Feeling all had to run away

But you fall down alone it's a long distance train
Moving out from the city of love
To the valley of reason where you just don't get enough
Fall down now and you learn the lesson of love

Fall, fall, fall, down, down, down
And you learn the lesson of love
Don't walk out listen to me when I say
We've got a whole lot of magic, don't let it slip away

Now there's tears in your eyes on the pages of the book
And it took me down trying just to take a second look
Fall down trying and you learn the lesson of love
If you're rich or poor,

If you're down by law
You can learn the lesson of love
You came all the way in a fragile state
Just to learn the lesson of love

If you're a self made liar if your heart's on fire
You can learn the lesson of love.
