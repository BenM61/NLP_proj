Two loves have I and they tear me apart,
Two loves have I, both are in my heart,
One is a flower and the other a flame,
Two loves have I, but they're not the same

When I'm in a gay mood, 'tis then my light love I crave,
Then again at times my other love can make me a slave,
I can't deny that to both I am true,
Two loves have I, both of them are you

I can't deny that to both I am true,
Two loves have I, both of them are you
