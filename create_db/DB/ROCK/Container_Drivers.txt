Net cap. of 58 thousand pounds
They sweat on their way down 
Grey ports with customs bastards 
Hang around like clowns the 
Uh-containers and their drivers 

Bad indigestion
Bad bowel retention
Speed for their wages
Suntan, torn short sleeves 

Look at a car park for two days
Look at a grey port for two days
Train line, stone and grey 

This is not their town
Big cigars come out of the ground
Sweat on their way down 
F. Jack's a distant relation 
Communists are just part time workers
And there's no thanks 
From the loading bay ranks 

Look at a car park for two days
Look at a grey port for two days
Train line, stone and grey 
RO-RO roll on roll off 
The container drivers 
Speed for their wages 
Uh-containers 
Uh-and their drivers
