And so we're chastened
We feel so insecure
We're frightened
Now not sleeping around's

Enlightened
What did we do wrong?
While love bereaves me
I can't believe in me

Natalie it started
Only an hour ago
Lying on your carpet
I knew what I didn't know

I felt myself let go.
You know I see you
Blushing in the dark
Recalling all those requited moments

Of longing
Can I accept each love
You've taken
The case continues

Down bourgeois avenues.
And you like a teenage Isabelle Huppert
Swapping foot noted thoughts
On what we share

On lying there
Last night the stardust
Settled in the cradled apartments
Across the evenings sweet indulgence

We satisfied ourselves.
The gears are changing
But we're going nowhere.
Natalie it started

Only an hour ago
Lying on your carpet
I knew what I didn't know.
Natalie it started

Only an hour ago
Lying on your carpet
I knew what I didn't know
I felt myself let go.
