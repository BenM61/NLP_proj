Well be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll

Well she's the girl in the red blue jeans
She's the queen of all the teens
She's the one that I know
She's the woman that loves me so

Say be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
Let's rock!

Well now she's the one that's got that beat
She's the woman with the flyin' feet
She's the one that walks around the store
She's the one that gets more more more

Be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
Let's rock again, now!

Well be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
