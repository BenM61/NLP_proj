Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And if violence causes the silence
Who are we mistaking
But you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head in your head
They are fighting

With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head in your head they are crying

In your head
In your head
Zombie zombie zombie ei ei
What's in your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie ei, ei, ei, oh do do do do do do do do

Another mother's breaking heart is taking over the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old thing since nineteen-sixteen
In your head in your head
Their still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head in your head they are dying

In your head
In your head
Zombie zombie zombie ei ei
What's in your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie ei, ei, ei, oh do do do do do do do do
