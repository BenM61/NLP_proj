Across a starless sky
It cuts like tiny knives
Rain beating down
Rain beating down

Blunt uneasy glares
They've nothing on you or me yet
Nights here alone
Nights here are cursed

There's wild in your eyes 
There's a light, oh Thea, there's a feeling
It's cruel and it's dark in this town
Are they mad were we dreaming

Tender and town
Won't leave you now

Wanted you so bad
I feel like I'm caught with no air
Wanted you gone
Wanted you there

There's wild in your eyes 
There's a light, oh Thea, there's a feeling
It's cruel and it's dark in this town
Are they mad were we dreaming

Tender torn sundown on Isthmus
It's all for you oh hungry moon
It's a long long night of waiting
All for you oh hungry moon

Tender torn sundown on Isthmus
All for you oh hungry moon
It's a long long night of waiting
I want you there I want you gone
