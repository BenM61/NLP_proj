Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away (yes it has)

Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away (yes it is)

Well I've been away forever
Suicide's crossin' my mind
Well I'll never, never get so far behind
I said, the ways of the night are evil
Without that Lord of Day
But I'll never, never get so far away

I said write me
Write me
Write me
Write me
I said write me
Write me
Write me

Well there's nothin' I can see
That'd ever make me
Want to be without her
She's good, she good to me
Said there's no way to explain
The kind of feelin' that you get out in the
She good, she good to me
She good, she good to me
I love her

Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away (yes it has)

Write me a letter
Write me a letter
Write it today
I'm goin' away (yes it is)

Well I've been away forever
Suicide's crossin' my mind
Well I'll never, never get so far behind
Well I've been so many places
Hidin' from the wind and the rain
But you could write me a letter
For to save me from goin' insane

Write me
Excite me
Write me

Write me
Write me
Write me...
