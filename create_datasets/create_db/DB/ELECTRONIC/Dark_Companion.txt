Another round for my dark companion
The view from here is crowded now
I raise my glass
To my doppelganger

He smiles at me
From across the room
The great social issues mean less than nothing
Two-dimensional bests

On my T.V. screen
I will wear only black and white
and hide in the alleys
On Saturday nights

The endless prattle of politicians
Rings in my ears
The rain makes my mascara run
Another round for my dark companion

The view from here is crowded now
I raise my glass
To my doppelganger
He smiles at me

From across the room
Another round for my dark companion
Another round for my dark companion
