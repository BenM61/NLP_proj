Well you can just believe 
I'm the only girl in your life
I'll be your sugar in the morning 
And the sweet stuff you need at night
And you can just make believe
When it comes down to makin' love
I'll satisfy your every need 
And every fantasy you think up

[Chorus]
So when you need a little peace of mind
Come on over boy, anytime
I'll keep you happy and so satisfied
In my house, in my house

So when you need some lovin' tenderness
And it's me baby that you miss
Here's the key to unlock the door
To my house (to my house)
wo-oo-oo-oo- in my house
wo-oo-oo-oo in my house

Well anytime of the day or night
When you call me I'll be there
Just call me up on the phone 
When you need someone around to care
And when you feel sad and blue
You just come and see me anytime
I'll be waitin' for you dear
And your fears you can leave behind
So when you need a little peace of mind
Come on over boy, anytime
I'll keep you happy and so satisfied
In my house, in my house
So when you need some love and tenderness
And it's me baby that you miss
Here's the key to unlock the door to my house (to my house)
In my house
In my house
In my house.
