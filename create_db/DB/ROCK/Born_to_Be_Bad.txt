Bodies without minds
I hear you're the ones with the bleeding hearts
Blue and bitter sweet
You tear my dreams apart.

'Cause I was born to be bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad
I think you should all get with it.

The damn don't cry
Cry out when they're betrayed
Bodies slam, they scream
As the keynote fades.

'Cause I was born to be bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad
Yeah.

How many times has the Lord called to you
Accused you of somethin' that you haven't copped to
Yeah, it happens there just was a night
My boyfriend Larry came up to me and he said
"I think you've been a, I think you've been a bad girl
Because you've been acting very bad"
I said "Yeah, because it's my world
And I've been all too bad"
I said "I suppose you care less, I think you'd better go home now
I don't want to see you no more".

I said "Baby, oh baby
I really hate to leave you
But I know there's someone else out there
That I can go home with
So, my dear, go on home, go home
You know what I'm talkin' about?"

I want ya to bring me daises
For my mad desires
And if it bites the dust
I guess you're just gonna have to miss my fire.

I was born to bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it.
