Eddie's got one crazy eye
That turns him into a cartoon
When a pretty girl comes by
And there's nothin' here to do anymore
He sits on the stoop all day
Like there's something he's waiting for
Cunt-finger Louie picks up Eddie in the alley
He's got all those guys with him
From that town where they all look like Frankie Valli
They speak fluently blonde
From her legs to her cigarette
And Louie told Eddie that he'd fix him up
But he ain't come back yet
Well, you know

It's more trouble than it's worth
It's more trouble than it's worth
Oh Wild and the Only ones
Tell him where you are -
Oh Wild and the Only ones
Tell him where you are
Tell him where you are

Zero quit school
And she lost her job again
And then her boyfriend beat her up
And now he won't let her in
So she's walking by his joint
In a black and blue dress
She looks at Louie who elbows Eddie who says
"Don't tell me, lemme guess."

It's more trouble than it's worth
He's more trouble than he's worth
Oh Wild and the Only ones
Tell him where you are 
Oh Wild and the Only ones
Tell him where you are

Well at first when it was this way
When they're the only ones
And you've got all these ideas
You never tell to anyone
There are always magnets
Pulling each of you there
Living every story you'd dare
To be the only ones
The only ones

Oh, who are living it up
Oh yeah, we're living it up
Oh yeah, we'll be living it up
Oh yeah, we're living it up
Gotta be living it up
Oh yeah, we're living it up
Oh yeah, we're living it up
Oh yeah, we're living it up
Oh yeah, we're living it up
Oh yeah, we're living it up

Louie and Eddie found a reason then and there
Carried her over the bridges like fluttering pages they didn't care
In the terminal where dreams
Let so many tickets through
When strangers look in faces
And see somebody there they knew
You might meet me tomorrow
As all the lights are blooming green
And you're feeling a little lonely,
A little sad, a little mean
Remember a place
Inside of that hotel
Where you could do anything you want to do
You couldn't tell

If it's more trouble than it's worth
Ah, this is more trouble than it's worth
Oh Wild and the Only ones
Tell him where you are 
Oh Wild and the Only ones
I'm waiting you could
Tell him where you are 
Oh Wild and the Only ones
Why don't you tell him where you are?
