I'd gave you all my money
If love was the currency
If my back was up against it
I'd swear on my property
I know you ain't the one to gamble
I bet you, you gonna win
Lay all your cards on table
Let me know if you're out or in

If you give a little time then I'll be yours (oh)
Just spend a little time 'cause it don't cost (oh)

One, two, three add it up
You plus me that's enough
Put it all down on a good thing
Don't you wanna know what you're missing?
One, two, three add it up
What I need ain't a lot
Put it all down on a good thing
Don't you wanna know what you're missing?

Put a little love on me
A little love down on me
Won't you put it down on me?
Put a little loving down on me

If you want security
Then baby invest in me
You don't need to bail me out, no
'Cause everything I've got is there for you

If you give a little time then I'll be yours (oh)
Just spend a little time 'cause it don't cost (oh)

One, two, three add it up
You plus me that's enough
Put it all down on a good thing
Don't you wanna know what you're missing?
One, two, three add it up
What I need ain't a lot

Won't you put it down on me?
Put a little loving down on me

No, I won't let it all go to waste (put your love on me)
'Cause I know, yeah, I know what it takes (put your love on me)
