And I love to tie you up
And you love to let me down
We both try to cover it up
With a sound
You ain't my buttercup
I ain't your little fool
I know that ain't a part of the deal
We're through
It's just a matter of time

It's just a matter of time
And I'd love to share the cost

Butterfly
The reason why we need to fly, high away
It's just a matter of time

It's just a matter of time
Before we're thrown back in the wheel!
Before we're thrown back in the wheel!
Baby, I'll be hard pressed

Maybe we're more simple too
Ain't a region of water!
Before we're thrown back in the wheel!
