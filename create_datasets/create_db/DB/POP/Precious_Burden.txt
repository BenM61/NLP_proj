The life we shared together
Is no life anymore
It's time to praise the memories
And put them wherever they can grow

So you live in the stars now
You live in the meads
I'll spread you with my heart
Over the fertile fields

The love we gave each other
Was the love that we would make
Those years became our lifetime
A lifetime faith would break

Now you're living in the oceans
In the trees, in the air
It's a precious burden
The cross we've come to bear

This burden is a precious burden
As precious as you
Brought into my world
The world that's after you
