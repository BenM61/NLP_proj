This was how I broke the best
Indifference, overblown with confidence and ignorance
It all made sense
And then I watched them take the test

I believe it's better to inflict than to attempt relief
You ask me what you need 
Hate is all you need 

Hate is all around find it in your heart in every waking sound
On your way to school, work or church you'll find that it's the only rule
Build a different world, hate will help you find what you've been looking for
Hate is everywhere, inside your mother's heart and you will find it there
You ask me what you need hate is all you need

This was how I won the west
Charity, a joke that friendly cities think that we believe
Or so it seems
We kicked and punched and stabbed to death

And everyone applauded my fine actions I was overcome
You ask me what I've seen 
Hate is all I've seen

Hate is in the air
Come on people feel it like you just don't care
Everlasting hate feel it in the people where it's warm and great
Come on hate yourself everyone here does so just enjoy yourself

Hate is everywhere, look inside your heart and you will find it there
You ask me what I mean
Hate is all I mean
