(There's a bluebird)

There's a bluebird

(There's a rainbow)

There's a bluebird on your windowsill
There's a rainbow in your sky
There are happy thoughts, your heart to fill
Near enough to make you cry

(There's a bluebird)

There he is.

(There's a rainbow)

And with every tear you've washed away
All the things you've kept inside
You count your joys this lovely day
And you wonder why you cried

There's a bluebird on your windowsill
There's a rainbow in your sky
There are happy thoughts, your heart to fill
Near enough to make you cry

(There's a bluebird)

Look at him out there, ain't he pretty

(There's a rainbow)

And if perchance your heart grow sad
You still can smile again
And with every tear you've ever had
Comes the sunshine after rain

There's a bluebird

(Yes, yes)

There's a rainbow

(Hear, hear.)

[Orchestral Break]

The rainy days may come and go
But the clouds soon roll away
Everything will come that you wish it so
As an answer when you pray.

There's a bluebird on your windowsill
There's a rainbow in your sky
There're happy thoughts, your heart to fill
Near enough to make you cry

(There's a bluebird)

Cutest feathers.

(There's a rainbow)

Lovely weather.

(There's a bluebird)

Look at that bluebird and the rainbow in the sky.
