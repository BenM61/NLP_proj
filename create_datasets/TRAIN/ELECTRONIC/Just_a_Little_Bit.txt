Woke up too early this morning
Shaken by a dream I had when I was in danger of losin' you
And I made up my mind
I was gonna tell you when you opened your eyes I thought it through

Wanna be someone
Better than the one who wasn't there when you needed her
Someone who
Wants you, needs you, someone who'd never leave you

My almost was not enough
Never sacrificed too much
I'm ready to give
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

(Moooore)

'Cause I was so busy driving
I didn't see the road ahead or where I was going, ignored the signs
Why didn't somebody tell me
The one that I was looking for was there all the time - I was blind

It took a bad dream to show me
Without you there how it would be I realized
I want you, I need you
And baby I'll never leave you

My almost was not enough
Never sacrificed too much
I'm ready to give
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

When you wake up
I'll be different
I don't know how I'm gonna find the right words to say
I'll have a whole lot more to give than I did yesterday (just a little bit)

(Moooooore)
(just a little bit)
Yesterday
(just a little bit)

My almost was not enough
Never sacrificed too much
I'm ready to give
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

My almost was not enough
Never sacrificed too much
I'm ready to give
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)
