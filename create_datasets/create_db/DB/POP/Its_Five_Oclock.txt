It's five o'clock
and I walk through the empty streets
thoughts fill my head
but then still
No one speaks to me
My mind takes me back
to the years that have passed me by

(interlude)

It is so hard te believe
that it's me
that I see
in the window pane
It it so hard to believe
that all this the way
that it has to be
It's five o'clock
and I walk through the empty streets
The night is my friend
And in him
I find sympathy thus so
And so I go back to the years that have past me by

(interlude)

It is so hard to believe
that it's me
that I see
in the window pane
It it so hard to believe
that all this is the way
that it has to be

It's five o'clock
and I walk through the empty streets
The night is my friend
And in him I find sympathy
He gives me day
gives me hope
and a little dream too
