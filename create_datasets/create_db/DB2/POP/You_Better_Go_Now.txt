You better go now
Because I like you much, too much
You have a way with you
You ought to know now
Just why I like you very much
The night was gay with you

There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be Spring
I want you so now
You have the lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because I like you much, too much

There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be Spring
I want you so now
You have the lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because I like you much, too much
You better go, because I like you much, too much
