Now you look like you just got back from somewhere
Somewhere, you know that it's true
Together we went nearly to nowhere
Nowhere really worth going to
Standing at the city center
In the middle of the winter
I was waiting for you and you were due

When I got back you said you was leaving
Leaving, you said, right away
And coming back for the sake of retrieving
Things you'd forgotten on that day
Still now my eyes are burning
With the sight of your returning
Everywhere I look, I'm finding you

I remember you

Familiar places that we turned into gardens
Somewhere, yeah, you know that it's true
I'm begging you now a thousand pardons
For all of the wastelands we've been through
I remember asking whether
Or where we could be together
You smiled at me and you said "soon"
