When she walked in
I was losing
She took a long look
At my hand, at my hand
And said, There's one card you're not using.

She said,
King, queen or jack
Love's the wild card in the pack.
King, queen or jack
Love's the wild card in the pack.

I said, sit down,
I'm pleased to meet you
Where'd you learn to
Play this game, play this game?
She said Thank you, this game is not new.
You see, King, Queen or jack
Love's the wild card in the pack
King, Queen or jack
Love's the wild card in the pack.

Luck comes and goes
Well, it's a tumbleweed
The wild wind blows
Love's constant flame
Well, it's the card that keeps you in the game

Now I'll fortune
May pursue you
Still here's how to
Beat the odds, beat the odds.
You seat someone smart beside you
If they're watching your back,
Love's the wild card in the pack

Luck comes and goes
Well, it's a tumbleweed

Keeps you in the game

You need someone smart beside you
If they're watching your back,
Love's the wild card in the pack.
King, Queen or jack
Love's the wild card in the pack
King, Queen or jack
Love's the wild card in the pack

Love's the wild card in the pack
