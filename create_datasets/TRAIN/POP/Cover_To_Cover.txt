He tore out the pages one by one
They went in the fire when he was done
Watching the paper burn was fun while it lasted
He found her diary in a drawer
Promised, he'd read one page, no more
But a part of him was sure, he'd read past it

He saw a name he recognized
He saw the truth with his own eyes
How a restless heart can find brand new love
She never really said goodbye
Two hundred pages told him why
And he cried, cover to cover

Sometimes they lock them with a key
Serves him right, her's would have to be
In a place that's guaranteed he would find it
He watched them meet on page fifteen
Describing a man he'd never seen
Her heart going back and forth, between aware and blinded

You know it could mean a broken heart
He was a fool to even start
But with every page he reads he turns another
In her own hand now leather bound
He just could not put it down
So he cried, cover to cover, yes, he cried, cover to cover
