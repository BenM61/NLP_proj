Dam dam dubi do dam
I need you more than everyone
Dam dam dubi do dam
I know it hurts to be alone
Oh, do you really go ?
Baby, say it isn't so
Do you really really know ?
That I miss you baby (oh be my baby)
Baby, how will I know ?
Your love is like a fire
Baby, how will I know ?
You'll feel a strong desire
How will you go from here to me
How will I know ?
Your eyes are always lying
Oh, how will I know
I never saw you crying
How will you go from here to me
