Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

The stolen glances, broken threads
The visions loomin' in our heads
The years spent runnin' parallel
To everything that might of been
No longer possible to hide
The feeling welling up inside
Ain't never been this close before
Ain't never felt so far away

When a moment
A moment changes everything
When a moment
A moment changes everything
When a moment, it changes everything

The summer sky is blushing pink
The heart is running out of sin
Could this just be the day, I think
When anything is possible

Well, hey now you've been here before
To see your face and slam the door
And waiting for the floor to drop
Feel like time is standing still

When a moment
A moment changes everything
When a moment
A moment changes everything
When a moment
A moment changes everything
When a moment, it changes everything

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

A moment, 
(Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on)
a moment changes everything

A moment, 
(Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on)
a moment changes everything

A moment, 
(Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on)
a moment changes everything

A moment, 
(Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on)
a moment changes everything

Then a moment
A moment changes everything
A moment
