If practice makes perfect
Let's try that old embrace
In some romantic place
Where we can take out time

If practice makes perfect
Just close you eyes again
We'll try those sights again
And make them more sublime

We're in love's kindergarten
Learning from A to Z
And if it's fun just starting
Think what it's going to be

If practice makes perfect
Let's have that kiss again
We must'n miss again
We're not doing bad right now

We're not doing bad
Let's practice some more
We're not doing bad right now
