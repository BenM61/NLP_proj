On the rooftop thinkin' it's about to pour
People run for shelter tryin' to get out that storm
But I got you with me the sun behind me
So what are we leavin' for?
Let's stay, let's get carried away
Your eyes are beggin' me to touch you there
Could be a thousand people watchin' but we don't care

But I look at you tonight
So beautiful under these neon lights yeah
Who needs lovers lane?
Right up on this rooftop
Let's make love in the summer rain
Ah ha, ah ha in the summer rain
Ah ha, ah, ha

Nothin' better than givin' this all to you
And the weather's only adding to the mood
See the wind's blowin' fire's growin' both of us soakin' wet
But let's stay, yeah let's get carried away
Your eyes are beggin' me to touch you there
Could be a thousand people watchin' but we don't care

But I look at you tonight
So beautiful under these neon lights yeah
Who needs lovers lane?
Right up on this rooftop
Let's make love in the summer rain
Ah ha, ah ha in the summer rain
Ah ha, ah, ha

There's no place that I'd rather make la-la-la-la-la love to you
Right here on this roof, yeah

Yeah I look at you tonight
So beautiful under these neon lights yeah
Who needs lovers lane?
Right up on this rooftop
Let's make love in the summer rain

But I look at you tonight
So beautiful under these neon lights yeah
Who needs lovers lane?
Right up on this rooftop
Let's make love in the summer rain
Ah ha, ah ha in the summer rain
Ah ha, ah, ha

In the summer rain
Ah ha, ah, ha
In the summer rain
