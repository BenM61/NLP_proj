Lying naked in the sun making eyes at everyone
You're the one
Later on you'll stand alone, a lone empty moon, with an empty heart in you're empty hands
And the flowers and the trees
All laughing at your bike
And the neighbors kids run and hide
If they only knew you were really one of them
But you're not
You're the
One
The one
The one
The one

The one
The one
The one
The one
Could it be we're alone and the moon was full of gold
You're heart was filled with blood and the sun was in you're hands
The sun that burned you then,
Now warms you're empty heart,
People come and go,
But you're the
One

The one
The one
The one
