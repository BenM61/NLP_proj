I gotta go
But it won't be so
I don't be back again
I gotta leave
But I don't believe                 5
We won't be back again
No no no no
Everything's inside another
No no no no no, alright yeah

I gotta walk                        10
But I'm gonna put my fork
Next to your spoon
I gotta split
It's a quaint
Old-fashioned way to leave the room the room   15
Smell them burning leaves
Everyone beside another
No no no no no, alright yeah

Whatever you pray to
That's were you belong              20
I'm gonna get mine someday
I'm gonna get mine

I gotta laugh
But there's half
Of me that wants to sit and cry     25
I gotta split
It's a quaint
Old-fashioned way to say goodbye, goodbye
What's your mother for?
Not a launchpad for your father     30
No no no no no, alright yeah
Alright yeah
Alright... yeah
