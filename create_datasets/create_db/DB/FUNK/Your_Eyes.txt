I wanna look into your eyes again
I wanna look into the windows of your soul...again, again
Who's to know where time will lead us now?
I can't believe this is happening now
I'm not scared, I'm just wondering how
I wanna see your eyes
All the time we've shared between us now
The feeling I have needs me to make a vow
Now as I leave I must return somehow
Cause I wanna see your eyes

When I look at you I fumble, my confidence takes a tumble
But when I look into your eyes, I just crumble
'Cos I know that it's you that my heart burns for
That it's you that I'm yearning for

Who's to know where time will lead us now
I can't believe this is happening now
Well I'm not scared, I'm just wondering how
I wanna see your eyes, I wanna make it right
