You love me in the sunshine 
You hate me in the rain 
When old man trouble is hanging 'round 
It always seems to rain 
I'm tired of livin' in this old world 
You've done me wrong, false hearted girl 
You said that you'd be true babe 
And told me that we'd wed 
Now you won't even see me 
And I wish that I was dead 
I'm tired of livin' in this old world 
You've done me wrong, false hearted girl 
You double crossed me babe 
You know you done it too 
You never hug and kiss me 
Until the red is due 
I'm tired of livin' in this old world 
You've done me wrong, false hearted girl 
I wish I was an outlaw I'd draw my gun and fire 
I'd fire it at your heart babe 
Because you are a liar 
I'm tired of livin' in this old world
You've done me wrong, false hearted girl 
When Gabriel blows his trumpet 
And we shall all arise 
There'll be nobody up there
Who'll believe your dirty lies 
I'm tired of livin' in this old world 
You've done me wrong, false hearted girl 
And if you go before me 
And find it different there I know that you'll remember 
You did not treat me fair 
I'm tired of livin' in this old world 
You've done me wrong, false hearted girl 
You've done me wrong, false hearted girl
