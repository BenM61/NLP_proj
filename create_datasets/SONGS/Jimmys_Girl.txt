Jimmy's girl, Jimmy's girl
Wish that I were holdin' Jimmy's girl
I'm in love with Jimmy's girl
Though I've never met her

Still I can't forget her
Jimmy's girl
Jimmy's always telling me
That her hair is golden

Wish that I were holdin'
Jimmy's girl
He says her lips are warm
Each time they kiss good night

And just as sweet as any lips can be-ee
And then I close my eyes
And though it's make-believe
I pretend she's in love with me-ee

How I long for Jimmy's girl
But her love is taken
So my heart is breakin'
For Jimmy's girl (Jimmy's girl)

When I close my eyes
Although it's make-believe
I pretend she's in love with me-ee
I'm in love with Jimmy's girl

But her love is taken
So my heart is breakin'
For Jimmy's girl, Jimmy's girl
How my heart is breakin'

For Jimmy's girl (Jimmy's girl)
