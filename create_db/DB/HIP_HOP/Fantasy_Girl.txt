Yea, yea
A fairy tale a piece of fiction
Tell me she's make believe
Got a body you can never dream of
She a fantasy fantasy
She a fantasy fantasy girl
(all time that girl's a beast)
She's like a real life
She a fantasy fantasy
She a fantasy fantasy girl
(all time that girl's a beast)
She's like a real life

TV, movies, and magazines
Novelas, game shows, and fancy dreams
Living way lavish on fancy things
High definition H-D so clean
Playboy bunny like the girl next door
Sh-she snow white and I'm Hugh Hefner
Fre-freshtastic christian Dior
With a body of a temple I must explore
Girl I must incline quirking down low
With that hot behind
Tell me is I dreaming or you just that fine
If you got imagination then imagine mine

She a fantasy fantasy girl
(all time that girl's a beast)

Quiet like my night brand new moon
Lo-look at the allusion across the room
Day time night girl afternoon
Do-doing the most so Dolche perfume
Now how am I gonna handle this
Iphone, mac book, bl-blue ray disc
And she look like she comin' from a video
You know the one they say shawty get it low
Sippin' sangria mama mia
Welcome everybody to my fantacia
Way more styles than a fashionista
My freak in a sheets my diamond diva

A fairy tale, a piece of fiction
Tell me she's make believe
Got a body you can never dream of
She a fantasy fantasy
She a fantasy fantasy girl
(all time that girl's a beast)
She's like a real life
She a fantasy fantasy
She a fantasy fantasy girl
(all time that girl's a beast)
She's like a real life

You can't spell fantasy, without n-a-s-t-y
But you better be a real time
You can't spell fantasy, without n-a-s-t-y
It don't matter when the clock strikes
That's how the story go-go-go-goes
So work your magic oh,
I got to have it oh,
So let me it sho-sho-sho-show
And drop it right here
Make this money disappear (yea)
