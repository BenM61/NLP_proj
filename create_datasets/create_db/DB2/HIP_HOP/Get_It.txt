If you can feel it, feel it
Then get with it, with it
We stay witty with it
So you can get it, get it

We stay above average, stay killin' these tracks, yo
I stay off in the country but stay city with that so
Stay keeping y'all guessin', stay in higher demand
Stay true to who I'm rapping, steady movin' ahead
I stay original, stay spiritual, never move outta line

If you could read up in between I stay's clear with mine
Since 89 I stayed straight, no more livin' off state
The only bars I stay locked in now are 16 or 8
You wanna stay in the kitchen
When grits is hot they bubble

Stay poppin' out the top, stay ready to tussle
Who wanna muscle, flex context in combat with bone
I'll have you cryin' to your mamma
Talking 'bout leave me alone, mixed views misconstrued
By the way that we present it

Send it out through verbal lessons
Herbal essence when we spit it
If you hit you gone feel it and get addicted, I'll admit it
The first time's for free but the rest cost life, get it

Bass how low can you go
Evangelic shatter false hope like a useless relic
I'm an animal covered with hair insides mechanical
Guardin' my heart like I'm botanical
I'm snatchin' satans mandible

I damned him at best with random access
Forever banished when he left his lies vanished
Standing in the midst of chaos
Hours of praying and fasting began to pay off
At times like these can't take a day off

What I compete with I get street with
My strange language bone crushing anguish
Pain can't be quenched or vanquished
My anger rise up its ludicrous the way I throw dem bows
And swell his eyes up, ain't that cute

The honey pot that money got his hand in
It's funny how he think he got it on lock, he just a stand in
Reprimandin', rebuking 'til you understandin'
Juke with reckless abandon, you can get it
Get it, get it, get it

We can get wild child
Keep looking at me now
We can get wild child
You see exactly how
