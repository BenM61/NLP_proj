I'm like a loaded gun I got you in my sight
And you're the only one I want to shoot tonight
Ready and able the trigger to fire
Locked on target for my desire
Got you covered and there's nothing that you can do
But say

Hold your fire
Hold your fire

I'm speeding like a bullet never miss my mark
With infrared eyes that can see in the dark
Actions semi-automatic
Satisfaction the instant I hit
I got you covered and there's
Nothing that you can do
But say

Hold your fire
Hold your fire
