Sometimes when I feel low and things look blue
I wish a boy I had, say, one like you

Someone within her heart to build a throne
Someone who'd never part, to call my own

If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in this world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy
I could say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy

No one I'd ever care for, dear, but you
No one I'd fancy there for to love me too

Your eyes can set me dreaming all night long
Your eyes have set me scheming, right or wrong

If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in this world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy
I could say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
