From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment your boss
They just came up with
The way you think
Got too down, admittin' it

They tell you you can do your very own thing
Ooh, but try people, see the herded green, yeah
Soon little boys will learn to be ashamed of tears they cry
If a girl wants a football, someone must go in and ask her why

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

Look at the kindly lawyer whom you turn to when in need
Steals with the other lawyer making underhand deals
The judge gives his judgment with his holy book
Doesn't always go by fast but really how you look

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

Love should be beautiful too
If you know know tomorrow if we don't change the world
Life, we gather to save our future children from what we haven't made

From the moment they're born
You know, from the moment they're born

They're on the la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la line

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

(One, two, three, four)

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind

From the moment you thought
You're on the bad line, assembly line
Keeps on messing with your mind
