Oops alright 
I'll come over 
And pour myself over you 
Jars of fun! 
Exciting stories 
I'll make you forget 

Tickle you a little bit 
Seduce out your good temper 
I'll shine all over 
I'll cook my best dish for you 

But then it's my turn 
I want all your adoration 

Dog, I own you 
Sit down fool 
You own me 
I'm yours 
I'm the sun 
I'll shine all over you 
Grab the rays 
Sugar 

Oops alright 
I'll come over 
And pour myself over you 
Jars of fun! 
Exciting stories 
I'll make you forget 
I'll make you for-get
