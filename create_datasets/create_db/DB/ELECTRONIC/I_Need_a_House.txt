Finding me, finding truth
Finding love in a changing world
Finding peace, in simplicity
Finding out where I come from

Finding curage, finding faith
Finding acceptance in a narrow space
Finding time, when time has gone
Finding out what's going on

I need a house, I need a room
I need a bed to sleep in
I need a coffee and a kitchen sink
I need a friend, I need a love, I need someone
Who'll miss me
When I get home
Don't wanna be all alone

Finding the gate, finding the dorr
Finding the streets I used to walk before
When I was free, when I could see
When I was crazy
I wish somebody told me

I need a house, I need a room
I need a bed to sleep in
I need a coffee and a kitchen sink
I need a friend, I need a love, I need someone
Who'll miss me
When I get home
Don't wanna be all alone

I wonder, what about reality
I wonder who'll be starting at me
When I look into my mirror

Mmm mmm mmm

I need a house, I need a room
(I need a bed to sleep in!)
I need a coffee and a kitchen sink
I need a friend, I need a love, I need someone
Who'll miss me
When I get home
Don't wanna be all alone
