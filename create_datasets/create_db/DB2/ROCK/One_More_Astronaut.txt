One more astronaut in black skin 
Of universe 
One more travelin' man 
With heavy tired eyes, feeling cold 
Thinking around the clock of drinking 
On the job, of the powdered food 
And piss bags, never having sex and growing old 

Head space alive and painless, 
Weightless and almost sane 
I close my eyes, I become the sky 
Head space alone and shameless 
Can't wait to find the faces 
I left behind in a troubled time 
Back home 

It gets so lonely you know 
Weeks and months alone chasing 
Sleep and space junk and the dying 
Stars I've known and loved 
Through true decline 
Of the five billion minds or so 
Through mudslides 
And earthquakes, the blue one holds 
And rolls along 

One more astronaut in 
Endless old universe with 
One more second chance at 
Wondering why he's here at all 
Bold are the ones who 
Come over the line to fall over 
The horizon never ones to fade away 
Then it hit me, this 
Cosmic pull and energy 
It kinda makes me wonder 
If I'll ever make it Back home
