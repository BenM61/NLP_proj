Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Yes, a merry old soul was he
Kick it on down, kick it on down
Kick it Pelham one, two, three

No one gets out, no one gets out
No one gets out of here
All you got, all you got
All you got is what you hear
Ah, shock um down

Walk this way, walk this way
And I'll tell ya what you got now
Got the torch? Got downtown?
And the man with the one eyeball

You got shee-a, you got shee-a
And I'm comin' for you today
Now I'm here, now I'm here
Chill pill is what I play
Ah, shock um down

Balls in the world, balls in the world
Balls in the world today
I got food, I got booze
And I got the money that can pay

Livin' in this country, livin' in this country
This is (unverified) where it's at
Got the guns, got the bombs
And we're good enough to kick your ass
Ah, shock um down
