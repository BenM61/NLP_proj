You come home late
And you come home early
You come on big
When you're feelin' small
You come home straight
And you come home curly
Sometimes you don't come home at all

So what in the world's come over you?
What in heavens name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin'
Just to be on the run

Well, I got a heart that burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
Well how can a love
That will last forever
Get left so far behind
