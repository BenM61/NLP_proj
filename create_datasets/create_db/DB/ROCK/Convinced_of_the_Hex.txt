She submits and she donates
She gets out of her head
And she talks to the ceiling
You can hear what she said

She said
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
You see, that's the difference between us

She said I like your theory
But it won't pass no tests
Watch the watcher
Get shot in the chest

That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
You see, that's the difference between us

She said (can't understand) of some system
That controls and effects
I believe in nothing
And your convinced of the hex
I believe in nothing
And your convinced of the hex

That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
You see, that's the difference between us
