You live somewhere inside of me
 Somewhere inside of me
 So warm, touching each part of me
 Somewhere inside of me
 When the world turns cold
 You are here to warm me from inside
 You're my silver lining, you keep me shining
 When you're not around I'll be found
 Living inside your love, I will be found
 If I had to, I couldn't go now
 I wouldn't know how
 All my life I'll be 
 Living inside your love
 You sing somewhere inside of me
 Somewhere inside of me
 So soft, making sweet sounds for me
Somewhere inside of me
 When the world turns cold
 You are here to warm me from inside
 You're my silver lining, you keep me shining
 When you're not around, I'll be found
 Living inside your love, I will be found
 If I had to, I couldn't go now
 I wouldn't know how
 All my life I'll be 
 Living inside your love
 If I start to miss you
 I'd feel lost tonight
 But I know I could never lose
 The love you left behind
 When the world turns cold
 You are here to warm me from inside
 You're my silver lining, you keep me shining
 When you're not around, I'll be found
 Living inside your love
