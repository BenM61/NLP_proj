Well it's out of the fryin' pan and into the fire 
You bent over, baby, and let me be the driver 
Just a cut of pink, wouldn't believe me if I told you 
But this time you bit off more than you can chew 
My my, yeah, just listen to this, babe 

I got nasty habits, it's a fine line, so many girls and so little time 
When love rears its head, I want to get on your case 
Ooh baby, want to put my log in your fireplace, maybe baby, you want to get laid 

Burn bitch burn, oooh, burn bitch burn, oooh 
Burn bitch burn, oooh, burn bitch burn 

Well it's an act of thrust and anyway you slice it 
No sticks and stones, no kicks and groans can hide it 
So why kid yourself, it's so cut and dry 
Your body's condemned, and figures don't lie 

Gonna cover my class, won't sit up and beg 
Gotta keep my tail between my legs 
You're cuttin' off your nose to spite your face 
Ooh babe, gonna put you in your place 

So burn bitch burn, oooh - well the heels are stacked now 
Burn bitch burn, oooh - and there's nothin' you can do 
Burn bitch burn, oooh - so don't burn your bridges 
Burn bitch burn - we're all through, we are all through baby, so just burn 

Well the heels are stacked against you 
Don't burn your bridges, we're all through
Hey babe and there's nothin' you can do 

Burn bitch burn, oooh - and there's nothin' you can do babe 
Burn bitch burn, oooh - we're all through 
Burn bitch burn, oooh - ooh burn, burn my baby 
Burn bitch burn, oooh - yeah
