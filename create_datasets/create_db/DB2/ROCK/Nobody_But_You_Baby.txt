I don't want nobody to tell me bout' what to do 
Nobody to tell me bout' me and you 
Nobody to tell me bout' what to do 
Nobody to tell me bout' me and you 
Oh baby, nobody but you, baby 
Nobody, nobody but you, baby 
Nobody 

Baby, when I see you walking down the street 
Baby, I can tell we're on a winning streak 
Nobody can tell me bout' what to do 
Cause' baby I know that your love is true 
Oh baby, nobody but you, baby 
Nobody, nobody but you, baby 
Woo, nobody, nobody but you, baby 
Nobody, nobody but you, woo baby 
Nobody 

Baby, when I see you walkin' down the street 
Baby, I can tell we're on a winning streak 
Nobody can tell me bout' me and you 
Cause' baby I know that your love is true 
Woo baby, nobody but you, baby 
Nobody, woo baby, nobody but you, baby 
Woo nobody, nobody but you, baby 
Nobody, nobody but you, baby
