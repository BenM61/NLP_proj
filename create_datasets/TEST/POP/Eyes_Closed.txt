I, I know where to lay
I know what to say
It's all the same
And I, I know how to play
I know this game
It's all the same

Now if I keep my eyes closed he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
So tell me where I went wrong
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)
Would've trade it all for you, there for you
So tell me how to move on
Would've trade it all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)

Now if I keep my eyes closed he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

They don't realize that I'm thinking about you
It's nothing new, it's nothing new

Now if I keep my eyes closed he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new
