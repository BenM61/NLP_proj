It's cool
It's really never been that deep
Wasn’t thinking about you
'Cause you didn’t give a f*ck about me

Thought I was up in my room
Crying myself to sleep
I was with a better you
While you were busy playing me

I was playing you too
I was playing you too

Thought I wouldn't find out
Thought I didn’t know how to play the game
Could’ve screamed at you for hours
Instead I was screaming somebody else’s name

There were no rules
Now I can do whatever I want
I can never lose
So it’s funny how you thought you won

But I was playing you too
I was playing you too
I was playing you too
I was playing you too

I was playing you
I was playing you
I was playing you
I was, I was playing
I was, I was playing you

Too
I was playing you too
I was playing you too
I was playing you too
Too
Too
