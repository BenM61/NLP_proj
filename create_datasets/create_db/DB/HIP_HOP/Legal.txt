[Chorus x2]
She's legal, tender and fine
She's not conceited but she knows she's a dime
She's legal, tender and fine
She picked my pocket but committed no crime

Let me tell ya a little story about this girl name Missy
She a born and she raised to keep dem mon hungry
Body shape, hair cut like Halle Berry
Fool of the mon that try to come tame this sassy
What she want is a man who can handle her right
All through the night, baller for life
Well I can smash it up
And I can love it up
But only girl if you want to give it up

Can I get that
Can I hit that
Can I get that
I want that
I need that

Can I kiss that
Wouldn't miss that
Cause I know what you need
Mama shake that

[Chorus x2]

Here's another tale about this girl name Laura
You can find her shiny teeth at any corner
Nice and ready for da man who want spend him dollar
So soon as she see Snow she wasn't spend me dollar
So we jump in da whip and headed to the crib
Then she started to express how she like that informer
She said I'll nice it up then I'll love it up
But when da Laura through you'll have to pay it up

Can I get that
Can I hit that
Can I get that

Can I kiss that
Wouldn't miss that
Cause I know what you need
Mama shake that

[Chorus x4]
