Do it the hard way and it's easy sailing
Do it the hard way and it's hard to loose
Only the soft way has a chance of failing
You have to choose

I tried the hard way when I tried to get you
You took the soft way when you said, "We'll see"
Darling, now I let you do it the hard way
Now that you want me
