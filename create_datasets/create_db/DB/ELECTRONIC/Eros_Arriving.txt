Curtains are closing
Over my windows, 
Waiting for someone
Who knows where the time goes

This time it's working, 
Bodies uncover
Every moment
Belongs to another 

Here without warning, 
The end of my tether
I watch from the doorway, 
Some things take forever

Curtains are closing
Over my windows, 
Waiting for someone
Who knows where the time goes

This time it's working, 
Bodies uncover 
Every moment
Belongs to another

Eros arriving
