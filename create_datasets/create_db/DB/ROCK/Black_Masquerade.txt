I know the key to secrets never told, they're hidden in your soul
Feelings you hide never wanting me to find they've always been mine
Release all the madness within let it all begin
Now you'll see, the dark side of me
In our black masquerade
Let the moonlight surround you
The game that we play is
The black masquerade
The full moon unmasks the stranger in us all
And the cruel world takes its toll
The shadow is cast on who you used to be
Let me set you free
Come now, come take my hand, then you'll understand
We'll go to that forbidden land
Of our black masquerade
Let the darkness surround you
The game that we play is the black masquerade
Release all the madness within, let it all begin
We'll go to that forbidden land
Come let me take you there
Let the moonlight surround you
Don't be afraid, it's the black masquerade
