Sunset stomp got folks jumpin'
Sunset stomp got folks
Jumpin' up and down, all around
They yell, band men play some more

Charleston, Charleston
I'll say it's hot
But your black bottom, it's got 'em
But, oh, that sunset stomp

Lord, it's going
And the people strain
Created in the crazy house
It sets good folks insane

Gentlemen, ladies too
Push 'em round n round
They loose their head
They'll drop dead

Doin' that sunset stomp
I said, doin' sunset stomp
