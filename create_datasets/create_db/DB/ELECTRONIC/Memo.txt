Are you gonna hide are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
Let me take your heart
Love you in the dark
No one has to see
I, I, I want more, I want more
I, I, I want more, I want more

Oh, you seek yourself in another way
I try my best but I don't ever change
Oh, I love to watch your body lie
Makes me feel better, makes me satisfied
And oh oh, you could bring it back
Who wouldn't want it when he looks like that?
Oh oh, I want you to stay
And if I try my hardest, would you look my way?

Are you gonna hurt are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
Let me take your heart
Love you in the dark,
No one has to see
I, I, I want more, I want more
I, I, I want more, I want more

No oh oh, you could bring it back
Who wouldn't want it when he looks like that?
Oh oh, I want you to stay
And if I try my hardest, would you look my way?

Oh, are you gonna hurt are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
Let me take your heart love you in the dark
No one has to see
I, I, I want more, I want more
I, I, I want more, I want more
