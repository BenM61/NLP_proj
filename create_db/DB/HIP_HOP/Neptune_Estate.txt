I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
You know I'll hold you tight
Can't you bare just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used

I hope you feel used
And cope the way you do
Should conjure up abuse
Select your loss, slip to lose
Just to get the muse
There's no new news here
This world, it doesn't hold a fear
This girl, she doesn't hold a tear in my head
The brain lives on but the vibes are dead
Corrosively tread through emotionally spoon fed purpose
Hel me as the worthless
A surplus, blank, white surface
Hel me as the worthless
A surplus, blank, white surface
Hel me as the worthless

I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bear just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bear just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used
Can't you bear just one more night?
I can lay inside
You know I'd hold you tight
Can't you bear just one more night?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be used

I can stay in your mind
Wish me to stay away
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say
Some cats flee to see
On the lap of deceit
When true blue love means
This faithful dissolve
This melting control can be solved
The soft touch, the hopes, the souls
To one another, dear lover
Dear brother
Dear brother
Cause there's still life to be lived in hell
Can we lose our emotions and still live well?
Can you tell that this faith is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways

I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
I could stay in your mind
