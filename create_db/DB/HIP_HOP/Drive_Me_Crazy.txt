She's got the touch I love so much, that's all I ever wanted (i'm surely god blessed) 
Under her spell she had me crushed I sworn I was anointed (*got caught* by her magic)
She had me drooling for a while (with her sexual motion) 
Like taking candy from a child (stuck on her love potion)
I can't believe the changes I've made since I met my baby, you know

[Chorus: x2]
She drives me crazy (on and on) what a beautiful lady (on and on)
She drives me crazy (on and on) and there's no if's nor maybes she goes (on and on) 

Like a volcano she erupts blowing up my pager (every minute every hour)
I realized she likes my *stuff* I chose the right flavor (this moment I'm a savor)
I've never trusted pretty smiles ('cause looks are deceiving)
Sexy walk my love profound (pretty girls are misleading)
Lesson learned don't judge a book by looking at the cover, you know

[Chorus]

My life my time and my *heart I've* dedicated to her (thats the *love* she wanted)
*I'm saying this I'd never starve* 'cause she is my dream maker (and now we gonna flaunt it)
Thank god I'm stuck with her for life (she's having my shorty)
Perfect girl for my wife (cause it's my baby's mommy)
Girls flaunt *their best designs but there was always something missing

[Chorus]
