Back against the wall, now!"
"Well, I don't need to stand for any of this shit!"
Cancel the time
Stop the disturbance,

Turn out the lights,
I don't want to see.
Shut down the mind
End all its functions

Destroy all the rules
Block all emotions.
Stop interference,
Just be cold.

Leave me alone -
I don't want it.
Find someone else, to be your slave
It's too late.

"Well, I don't need to stand for any of this shit"
"Hands against the wall now!"

The damage is done. [Repeat; x 9]

Throw out your thoughts
Start again.
Malicious redemption - the options are few.
Blow up the world

And start again.
Move through the night with caution.
The damage is done ......

The damage is done. [Repeat: x 9]
