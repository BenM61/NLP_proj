There ain't nobody cooking but me and you

Too many cooks are trying to get in your kitchen
The first thing you know there's something missin'
You got a real good oven, you've got a hot range, too
Let me butter your buns while you stir the stew

The stew that you're cooking, it smells so good
It's got everybody talking in the neighborhood
Your spice's spicy, your sugar so sweet
Your meat is so tender and your juice is a treat
