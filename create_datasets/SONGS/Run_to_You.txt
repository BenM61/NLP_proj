Oh ah ohH
So many nights I've cried
And you have given me all that I need and'
'Cause you

So many nights I've cried
'Cause I couldn't see
Your eyes
And no matter how hard I tried
I couldn't break from my ties
But now that I am free -well
I'll go where my heart 
Heart takes me
You're all that I wanna see
And now I'm gonna
Run to you

Running running run 
Run to you
'Cause I love of you and I need you
So I'm gonna run gonna run 
Gonna run to you

So many nights
I stayed
Always counting the days
And I'll never stray
'Cause I
Wouldn't love you that way
But now that I am
But now that I am free well
I'll go where my heart 
Heart takes me
You're all that I wanna see
And now I'm gonna
Run to you

Running running run 
Run to you
'Cause I love of you and I need you
So I'm gonna run gonna run 
Gonna run to you

Don't you know I need your loving loving
Cause I need your love

So many nights
I have cried cause I couldn't see
Your eyes
And no matter how hard I tried
I couldn't break my ties
But now all I want from you is your sweet
Sweet sweet loving
And my hearts for ever true
Here I come running to you
Run to you.
