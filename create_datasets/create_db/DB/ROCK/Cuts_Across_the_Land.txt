Make me, tour joy 
Walk in say nothing and ya speak like myth, girl no-one wants out 
And I don't think so 
Never ever gonna let go 
All sold with these fingers in pockets 
Every little mind wrapped up yeah 

I will do it like we know it's real 
I can spend it like I know its real 
I imagine you just like you're real 
I will do it till I know it's real 

It might suck you in, yeah you're always near 
It might suck you in, yeah you're always near 

You give me as much you can 
No big no little amount would ever owe yeah 
Just save me from walking out 
I'm gonna watch myself make these big cuts across the land 

I will do it like we know it's real 
I can spend it like I know its real 
'cause imagine you just like you're real 
I will spend it like I know it's real 

It might suck you in, yeah I'm always near 
It might suck you in, yeah I'm always near

It might suck you in, yeah I'm always near 
It might suck you in, yeah I'm always near 
It might suck you in, oh I'm always near 
It might suck you in, it might suck you in
But not if you're always near then it won't
