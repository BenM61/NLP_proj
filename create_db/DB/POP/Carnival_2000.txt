Tonight let's raise a glass my friend
To those who couldn't make it
A century has shut its eyes
And who are we to wake it ?
Cool music we play, dance and say
Carnival 2000 :
Lives come and go but life no denial
Is always in style. Welcome to :
Carnival 2000 :
Loves come and go but love above all
Is belle of the ball
We ask for any wrong we've done
The years ahead forgive us
We ask for any good we've done
That all of it outlive us
Cool music we play, dance and say
Carnival 2000 :
Lives come and go but life no denial
Is always in style. Welcome to :
Carnival 2000 :
Loves come and go but love above all
Is belle of the ball
Welcome to :
Carnival 2000 :
Lives come and go but life no denial
Is always in style. Welcome to :
Carnival 2000 :
Loves come and go but love above all
Is belle of the ball
