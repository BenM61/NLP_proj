Oh lady, got something to say
Alright baby, oh yes I do
Oh now lady, mm yeah
Got something to say, something to say
Check it out, well

All up in the mix on a Friday night, Friday night
Me and my guys lookin' oh so tight, oh so tight
Bounced from the crib to the car,
From the car on our way to the bar
Girl I wonder where you are, always loved you from afar
Hold that, wait a minute this hit it up from the back
And girl I really wanna come and get with you tonight, alright alright
Oh girl you look so fine, and I want you to be mine
Well I got nothing to lose, gonna make my move
Getting close to you is all I wanna do oh
I can remember so clearly you all up in your ride but didn't notice me,
So maybe, now's the time to make my move lady
So I asked her if she'd mind could we share a little time
Told me that would be just fine

Couldn't believe I had her by my side
Who'd ever thought she'd end up in my ride
Straight to the top, girl you really make me hot
You're just four times a lady
Spinning around til the morning light
Gonna be making sweet love with her all through the night
Straight to the top, girl you really make me hot
You're just four times a lady

Now she calls me up on the phone nearly every night
Just to make sure im not feeling lonely yeah
She'd even come around telling me how she was feel uptight, yeah baby
So I said that I'll take ya darling, for a minute
She's the type of girl you wanna have around, she's all up in it
She's my everything, takes good care of me 
And she's all the things that a girl's supposed to be, yeah
Can't imagine living without you
I love you, yes I do
Never thought my dreams would all come true when I stopped to talk to you
So you're out with your girlfriends, thought she's so damn fine
And I wish she could be mine, but every time I saw her
She'd always pass me by, never could catch her eye

Couldn't believe I had her by my side
Who'd ever thought she'd end up in my ride
Straight to the top, girl you're gonna make me hot
You're just four times a lady
You're four times a lady, yes you are yeah
You're four, you're four times a lady yeah
You're four times a lady, oh baby oh baby

When you said to me inside you felt the same
