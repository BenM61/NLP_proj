Lights, camera, distraction! 
From such show business pretension
Where's your invention baby?
Save yourself and kill the drama.
Save yourself and kill the drama! 

You play the telephone game
Whisper, Whisper, Whisper, Whisper! 
Betsie's always dropping names
Save yourself and kill the drama, 
Save yourself and kill the drama.

Lay off the theatrics! 
Lay off the theatrics! 
Lay off the theatrics! 
Lay off the theatrics  

Such is this scenario played out a million times.
Make up and costumed clothes
This joke got a great punch line! 
You're such a joke, oh baby.

Drape this dramedy with such ordained disdain, 

Blackguarded character, 
You scoundrel, you  

Drape this dramedy with such ordained disdain, 
Blackguarded character, 
You scoundrel, you.

Feed me another line, 
I'll believe you this time, oh girl.
Feed me another line, 
I'll believe you this time, oh girl.
Feed me another line, 
I'll believe you this time, oh girl  

You make love to the he-said, she-said scene
These lines are spoon fed direct from the drama queen
You're no royalty, 
You're no royalty, 
You're no royalty, 
You're no royalty  
It's curtain call.
