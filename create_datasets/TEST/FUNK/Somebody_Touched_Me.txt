You gotta get the rhythm if you're gonna rock
You gotta get a-movin' and don't stop
Here we go

Oh, here we go (here we go!)

Well, somebody touched me, in the dark last night
Yeah, somebody touched me, in the dark last night
Well, somebody touched me in the dark last night
Well, moved me when she held me tight
Oh who (who) who (who) who in the dark last night?

Last night, a stranger (stranger) took my hand (took my hand)
Last night, a stranger (stranger) took my hand (took my hand)
Well, last night a stranger took my hand
She said, 'You'll be my lovin' man'
Oh who (who) who (who) who in the dark last night?

(Bop-ba-do, bop-ba-do-be-do)
(Bop-by-do, bop-ba-do-be-do)

We gonna move on with a roll and rock
Here we go
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
(Here we go!)

Well, somebody made me fall in love last night
Yeah, somebody made me fall in love last night
Well, somebody made me fall in love
Sets my heart and soul above
Oh, who (who) who (who) who in the dark last night?

Last night, a stranger (stranger) took my hand (took my hand)
Last night, a stranger (stranger) took my hand (took my hand)
Well, last night a stranger took my hand
She said, 'You're gonna be my lovin' man'
