Sometime I feel like a smoke without a light
Sometimes I fell like a ghost that's died of fright
But the Boogie Brothers got to be in town tonight
The Boogie Brothers got to be in town tonight

Streets signs and lights are fading, fading into one
Came down from the moon and up with the light of the sun
Yes the Boogie Brothers got to be in town tonight
The Boogie Brothers got to be in town tonight

Sometimes I feel like a joke without a laugh
Most times I feel like a whole that's dropped in half
But the Boogie Brothers got to be in town tonight
The Boogie Brothers got to be in town tonight
