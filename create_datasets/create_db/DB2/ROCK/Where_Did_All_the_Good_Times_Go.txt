It's time to leave you 
Cause I got nothing more to give 
I've got to begin to live 
We've been lonely together to long 
Oh it's hard to leave you 
But it's very much harder to stay 
The good times are gone 

But the memory's of you linger on 
Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
They've gone so far away 

This time tomorrow 
I'll be learning to live on my own 
I thank you and I have know 
We've been lonely together to long 
It's hard to leave you 
But it's very much harder to stay 
The good times are gone 

But the memory's of you linger on 
Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
They've gone so far away 

Oh baby 
Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
They've gone so far away 

Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
Where did all the good times go 
They've gone so far away
