It was right here in this cafe
We kissed and said goodbye today
I've known that girl for so long
I hope I'm not doin' wrong

To lose her from my mind somehow
For those she's gone, she haunts me now
I think I should make a start
To put her out of my heart

Give me another glass of wine
To heal this broken heart of mine
And help me ease my achin' mind 
Of all the sorrow

For now, the wine's the only way
To help me pass the lonely day
Afraid of sleepless nights
And broken dreams tomorrow

It seems an old familiar score
That girl has left me twice before
Not long ago in my dreams
My dreams have come true, it seems

She'll call me on the phone and then
She'll say she wants me back again
But this time it was the end
Can't stand this game of pretend

Give me another glass of wine
To heal this broken heart of mine
And help me ease my achin' mind 
Of all the sorrow

For now, the wine's the only way
To help me pass the lonely day
Afraid of sleepless nights
And broken dreams tomorrow

For now, the wine's the only way
To help me pass the lonely day
Afraid of sleepless nights
And broken dreams tomorrow
