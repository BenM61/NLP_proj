I know you met the devil once when you were young
You let him in, just enough to push you out
You managed 21 years before he talked you round to giving up
We traded knowledge in our fields of expertise 
Then we parted ways and you gave up on everything

Do you think you'd still want to leave now?
You always were just a stubborn kid back then
I saw the words that you wrote down,
On the back of your book in the room where we spent our days

I remember you told me you threw
Your father's Jimmy Nail CD
Out of the window of his car
It didn't get you very far, in his good books
Because I know when you got home
He bent your spine over the back of a kitchen chair
You lost so many days in there

Do you think you'd still want to leave now?
You always were just a stubborn kid back then
I saw the words that you wrote down,
On the back of your book in the room where we spent our days
I saw the words that you wrote down,
On the back of your book in the room where we spent our days
In the room where we spent our days

I thought I saw your reflection, in the window of a passing car,
But I guess I was wrong, all I am is wrong these days 

Do you think you'd still want to leave now?
You always were just a stubborn kid back then
I saw the words that you wrote down,
On the back of your book in the room where we spent our days
I saw the words that you wrote down,
On the back of your book in the room where we spent our days
