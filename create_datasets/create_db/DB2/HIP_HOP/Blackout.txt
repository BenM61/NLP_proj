Yo, Kane, let's get 'em
I'm talking blackout
Putting (?), tapout
(?)
(?)

Yeah, relentless
Murderous intentions
The henchmen's garments is all black
Caught up in my smells
Smell exotic (?) trees
Black love's bullet's will fly when the 9's squeezed
(?)
Robbing the whole globe
Black polo, hooded, with Gucci wheels with a nice grip
So when the blood hit the floor, I won't slip
Dynamic with my dial-up, (?)
Crack your cranium like crab does if you cross me
Raging bull (?) Mr. Kane is so raunchy

Death rose (?) through lethal injection
Execute him and chop up his body in sections
Clean cut butcher knives
X they're eyes out
Nail 'em to a billboard
Let 'em dry out

Let me a show you a crime (?) blowing your minds out
If you ain't ready (?) then sign out
Nickel plated 40's are blowing your spine out
Old school Caddies (?), come take a line out
Stingin' (?) for they're jewels in they're stash house
Snatch a (?) by his butterfly
Sing him a lullaby
Closed casket, make sure his mother cry
You (?) tunes are suicidal
And now we ain't homies
The bullets are homicidal
Get ready for the (?), just call it my arrival

Bash him with a disco ball, it's the 70's
Drop a set of the Daily News so they remember these
(?), ruthless killers

Watch me thrill ya
Guarded killers, we won't die
(?), me and cats is gonna fry
(?)
Wanna swim with the sharks
Be my guest, go take a dive
The name of the game is Blood Sport
You won't make it out alive
I see what you trying for so give it up
We terrorize (?)
Kane and Ghost, lit it up
