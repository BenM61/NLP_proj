If the song of the songbird
Could replace my wrong word
Then my dear, that's the song I would borrow

And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow

If the song of the swallow
Could reveal my sorrow
Then my dear, he would sing just for you

And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow

Just tonight, while in flight
On your windowsill they lie
To tell you all of my tears

And tonight you would hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow

If the song of the swallow
Could reveal my sorrow
Then my dear, he would sing, he would sing just for you

And tonight, tonight you would hear
The saddest song, oh, of the year
And you'd be mine once again come tomorrow
Oh, yes, tonight, tonight you'd hear
The saddest song of the year
And you'd be mine, you'd be mine once again come tomorrow

Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, Mr. Songbird
Come on and sing just once, little swallow
And make her mine once again come tomorrow
