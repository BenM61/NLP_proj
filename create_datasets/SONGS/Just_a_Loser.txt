Maybe I'm just a loser
Whose will is none too strong
But I don't want to lose her
Even if my choice is wrong

I've been used to all the heartache
The jealousy and pain
So I'm well aware of what it takes
To win her back again

I played a fool for her smile, I found a groove in her style
I hung on every word that she said
But she was living up inside my head
And I better think this whole thing through for awhile

I'm not one to gamble
But in love my rules slide
When my heart starts to ramble
I just hang on for the ride

I've sought advice from all of my friends
I've even read a million books
But all those good intentions and
When she gives me that come on look

I played a fool for her smile, I found a groove in her style
I hung on every word that she said
But she was living up inside my head
And I better think this whole thing through for awhile

I could go on in misery
But this feeling just won't die
She's healing on delivery
I have to give her one more try

It's really time to figure out
If this love we have is real
And let's find out what it's all about
And give the old cards one more deal

I played a fool for her smile, I found a groove in her style
I hung on every word that she said
But she was living up inside my head
And I better think this whole thing through for awhile
