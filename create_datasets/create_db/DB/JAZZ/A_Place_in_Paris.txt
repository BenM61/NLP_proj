Where the roofs of Paris lie
Underneath the Paris sky
There's a place where you and I
Once left the world far behind us
And no one could find us
Alone but not alone
So unknown but not unknown
Where our dreams were all our own
No one will know
No one could know
Just how beautiful you were
How young how fair
How it felt to see you there
And that perfume you would wear
You said was Paris the air of Paris
And we loved our little street
And the wine of life was sweet
And at times our eyes would meet
As if we knew
Oh yes we knew
Life was beautiful
Although the years have flown
And I find myself alone
There's a memory I have known
A place in Paris
A place that will always be all our own
