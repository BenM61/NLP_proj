Govern me
Storm onto the light
I feel like life's design is a battlefield of mine
Marching on, what do we worship for?
I see the blood marks on my door
I run, we run, you cannot hide

We are diamonds of nature
We are more than strangers
Fighting with eyes closed
We are lighting up the night
Ain't no star that shines so bright
And we're all aligned
Love is a temple
Love is a temple
Love is a temple
Love is a temple
Love is a temple

I run, we run, you cannot hide
Home, sing out, waiting for that call
Will this be the day we fall?
Some, they pray for sun to stop
Marching on, my brothers got my back
I can see some fading along the track
I fight, we fight, there is no end

We are diamonds of nature
We are more than strangers
Fighting with eyes closed
We are lighting up the night
Ain't no star that shines so bright
And we're all aligned
Love is a temple
Love is a temple
Love is a temple
Love is a temple
Love is a temple
