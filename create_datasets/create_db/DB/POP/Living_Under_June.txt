Living under June, living under her 
Living under June, living under her 
I?e got a black and white television 
I?e got an indigo gas oven 
I?e got holes in my head 
Holes in my head 
I?e got filthy rotten wall to wall 
I?e got a couch made out of corduroy 
My cat's dying, words flying, leading 
down from the shower stall 
And that? not all 

Living under June, living under her 
Living under June, living under her 
I can? believe the things I hear 
Falling from the atmosphere 
Sexual atrocities are happening right over me 
And I can? sleep 

Living under June, living under her 
Living under June, living under her 
Living under June, living under her 
etc...
