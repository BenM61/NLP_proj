Yes you can pack your suitcase
I don't want you here no more
Yes you can pack your suitcase
I don't want you here no more
You know you done me wrong
And it's time for you to go

I used to give you all my money
And all my loving too
I used to give you all my money
And all my loving too
Yet the things you got me
I wouldn't do them to you

No, don't want you no more!
No, don't want you no more!
You done me wrong, time for you to go!

Well if you see my mama
Tell her I'm coming home to stay
Yes if you see my mama
Tell her I'm coming home to stay
Tell her I'm tired of being mistreated
Can't go on this way
