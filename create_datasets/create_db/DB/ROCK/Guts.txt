Shooting for the stars
Desperately reaching
For something in the dark
Pictures of memories

Buried in my heart
Lie awake and dream of
The endless possibilities
Catch my breath and go for it

Take apart
Everything that's
Holding me down
Make a point
To pick a new direction
To make a new connection

Is this what it feels like?
Finding out
That I've got the guts
To say anything
Feels like
Breaking out
When I can
Give up my reputation
Finally,
I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts
To say anything

Bold enough to fall
Flat on my face
But I walk as they crawl
Slowing down
It's just a waste of
Time to let go
Tapping my fingers
To the rhythm of a metronome
Counting opportunities

Take apart
The gravity
That's holding me down
Make a point
To find a resolution
To be my own solution

Is this what it feels like?
Finding out
That I've got the guts
To say anything
Feels like
Breaking out
When I can
Give up my reputation
Finally,
I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts
To say anything

Go down
Let me go
Let me go
Down alone
Let me go
Down
Just let me go
Down

If I'm gonna go down
Then just let me go
Let me go, down
Let me go, down
Just let me go
Let me go
(Go, go, go, go,
Go, go, go, go)

It feels like
Finding out
That I've got the guts
To say anything
Feels like
Breaking out
When I can
Give up my reputation

Finally,
I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts
To say anything
Finally,
I can see
Honestly, I've got the guts
To say anything
