(C. Stepney - R. Rudolph)

Only in the time it takes to tell you
For not to tell, but to know is wrong
Only in the time it takes to want you
I've known it all by myself to long
Only in the time it takes to tease you
Don't be dismayed by my subtle ways
Only in the time it takes to kiss you
I've wasted so may precious days
I've known too long
This can't go on

Now that I have found a way it's up to me
Oh, by the way
Oh, by the way
Oh, by the way
