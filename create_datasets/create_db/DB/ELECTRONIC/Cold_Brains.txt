Cold brains,
Unmoved,
Untouched,
Unglued
Alone at last
No thoughts,
No mind
To rot
Behind
A trail of disaster

A final curse
Abandoned hearse
We ride disowned
Corroded to the bone

The fields of green
Are bent, obscene
I lay upon the gravel
A worm of hope
A hangman's rope
Pulls me one way or the other 

A final curse
Abandoned hearse
We write this song
Corroded to the bone

A bird of song
Is heard no longer
In the evacuated heavens
The drain is drawn
And drained and gone
And on and on, it doesn't matter 

A final the curse
Abandoned hearse
We write this song
Corroded to the bone
