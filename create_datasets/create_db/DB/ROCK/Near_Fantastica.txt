The pink pills are for our sanity
We are buried in the Earth because we can't beat gravity
You are still here and so made to figure
You are an important part o the computer

Born of the sea, blink
The sea is dead
Falls out of me these sockets in my head
Everyone's a captain baby, ship of fools
Drowning while they're telling you it's been alright

Dream the dream of your attrition
The nameless name of your condition
It will be needing you a little while longer
You are an important part of the computer

After this mission it will let you go
Help you to forget everything and everyone you know
In a world of captains baby, ship of fools
Don't you know they're lying when they're telling you it's been all right?
