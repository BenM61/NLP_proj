An elaborate tale
So convincingly real
Things can seem so amazing
'Til you get up close
And see they're no big deal

Like the stars in the sky
Or the one on the stage
Just a big ball of gas
And a regular guy
Fresh out of minimum wage

In a jackalope space, on a jackalope high
I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope eye

Many things in this life
Are not what they appear
Yeah, I look like a hare
But if you stop and you stare
I'm related to a deer

I got a jackalope face, I'm a jackalope guy
And I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope eye

Is it so hard to imagine
Is it so hard to believe
Something so outrageous
Something so far fetched
Well how 'bout Adam and Eve?

I know you gotta have faith
I know the need to hope
But the truth is always in place
It's right in front of my face
The mighty jackalope, yeah

In a jackalope space, on a jackalope high
I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope
And I'm staring down, creepy jackalope

And I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope eye
Freaky jackalope eye, creepy jackalope eye
Creepy jackalope eye
