Ow, there it is

Hey, soul, soul
Need a taste
Mine is right, yeah
In the right place

You're doing your do
Like you want to be
Give up trying
To run the game on me

Then dig it
From the real side
Stand, sure enough
To be satisfied

Meet be at the big house
Get down
Let everybody know
Let everybody know

My main squeeze
Just hit the town
Get up and do what, what you can
Get up and do what you can

For the world to see
Games don't mean
Nothing to me

You can't run a game on me
Don't need to thank me
Don't mean a thing
Hey, hit it, come on, uh

Playing in the car (Incomprehensible)
Wipe the sweat
Gonna have some fun
Time's getting short

We got to move
But in the meantime
Mama, we got to groove, hey

Long as you see
Can't run a game on me
Long as you see
Games don't mean a thing to me
Long as you see

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hit it

Hit it, hit it
Hit it, hit it, hit it

Well, then dig it
From the real side
Stand, sure enough
And be satisfied

Meet at the big house
Where we all get down
Let everybody know
The main man just hit the town

Got a mean man
We got a mean man
I wanna see the man scream
I got the mean man
