So can I tell you a little bit about myself
My armour's worn too thin
Don't want to think
I gotta stop for a while

So can she tell him a little bit about herself
Her patience's wearing out but she want him to realise

But I fall so hard it makes me cry out...
So, can he tell her a little bit about himself
He doesn't want to hurt, he wants to start again and be ok

So they tell me a little about themselves
A love that lasts a life, the joy she brings him at the end of the day

But I fall so hard it makes me cry out...
So, can he tell her a little bit about himself
He doesn't want to hurt, he wants to start again and be ok

But I fall so hard it makes me cry out
