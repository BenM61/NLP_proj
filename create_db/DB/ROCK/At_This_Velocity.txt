Okay
We were safe, now we're paralyzed
Suspended in flight
At this speed it makes no difference
Where I start and where I end
Or if we're sitting in an emergency aisle

We could be dead, complete the equation
Our names are X and N
We have no value in these calculations

Placed on a plane, pointed straight down
Traveling at 500 feet per second
5000 feet from the ground

How long will it take us to hit
How fast will we start the disintegration
Don't die now, just keep moving
Don't die now, just keep moving
How long will it take us to hit
How fast will we start the disintegration

We could be safe here forever
Floating in the clean blue air
Somewhere between the sun that gives us light and the ground that puts it out

And we'll kneel in the aisles
Press our hands together and close our eyes
Speak these words so softly
To the black box, and it goes:
Mother, father can you hear this?
I want to thank you for all of your sweetness
I'm not coming home, I'm never coming home
