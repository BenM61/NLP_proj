I killed a man 'cause he killed my goat
I put my hands around his throat
He tried to reason with the sky and the clouds
But it didn't matter, 'cause they can't hear a sound

Oh
Oh 
Oh
Oh oh oh

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

Splinters in my skin, just like needles and pins
I cut through the pine, love the feeling it gives
Been out here for days running through these trees
I'm using my hands, cuttin' through the disease

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh oh oh

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

I feed the powerless
Chewed it up, spit the rest
I feed the powerless
Chewed it up, spit out the rest

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh

Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh
