You're not the girl I used to know
How the hell did you get so cold?
I bet you kick yourself to know
Where I've been since you let me go (yeah)
Now you wanna be with me (yeah)
But you let your colors show
And it's a long way home (home)

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted
All good since the day we parted
Now table's turned,
Lessons learned,
You got burnt, yeah
Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you broke, brokenhearted

La la la
La la la
La la la

La la la
La la la
La la la

I was standing in the dark girl,
But now I'm in control
And we're a million miles apart
But tell me why you sold your soul
'Cause now you are the lonely one
Since you let your colors show
Baby it's a long way home (home)

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted (wanted)
All good since the day we parted
Now table's turned,
Lessons learned,
You got burnt, yeah.
Hey girl look at what you started

La la la

La la la (Yeah)
La la la (Hey, Lawson, what's up?)
La la la (Yeah)

It's funny how the table's turned
I used to go for you but I was not your main concern
(So it burned) I had to let it burn
Expect the unexpected you never know what you learn
You never know what you do or what you'll get in return
See life is like a mission, you only get what you earn
But you would be in attention you really didn't deserve
But now we're feeling vicious
I kicked the bitch to the curb
And you have been booted
That's just how we do it
If I had a remote then you would be muted
But you made your choice and now you feeling foolish
But ask me how I feel
I don't give a mass of two shits (Ha!)

La la la
La la la

La la la (Now you're living with a broken heart)

Now you're living, now you're living, now you're living with a broken heart
Now you're living, now you're living, now you're living with a broken heart
Now you're living, now you're living
Played with love got you broke, brokenhearted
