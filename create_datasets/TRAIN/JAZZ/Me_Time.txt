All things being equal
I always put you first
You know that I've been down for you
Through better and through worse
All things being equal
Boy, I've been more than cool
So it seems only natural
To expect the same of you
Now, I'm not trying to start nothing
I like things drama free
But there won't be nothing to stop
If you keep sweatin' me
Sometimes a girl just needs her space
No different than her man
If I don't care that you do you
Why can't you deal with this?

I need some me time
Not some you and some I
Just some me time, oh
I need some she time
Not some him and some her
Just some free time, oh
I wanna run with my girls
Hit the club, hit the mall
Get my nails and hair done
Spend a day at the spa
Boy, you ain't gotta worry
There ain't nothin' goin' on
I need some me time
That's all, and that's all

All things being equal
You're not the only one
If I wanted to roll like that
I could have anyone I want
All things being equal
I got a right to choose
The only thing you need to know
My choice is always you
Now, I'm not tryin' to flip on you
Or make a mess of things
But if I put trust in you
Then you should do the same
I'm not goin' anyplace
I'm not goin' anywhere
So you gotta' be actin' all scared

I need some me time
Not some you and some I
Just some me time, oh
I need some she time
Not some him and some her
Just some free time, oh
I wanna run with my girls
Hit the club, hit the mall
Get my nails and hair done
Spend a day at the spa
Boy, you ain't gotta worry
There ain't nothin' goin' on
I need some me time
That's all, and that's all

(Bridge)
You're the most important thing in the world to me
Can't you get it through your head?
I ain't never gonna leave you, I ain't about to
Baby, don't you understand how much I love you?
I'm not deserving of your doubt and lack of trust for me
Boy, it's disturbing you would ever think that low of me
I've told you everything and anything that's going on
That's why I want you to know

I need some me time
Not some you and some I
Just some me time, oh
I need some she time
Not some him and some her
Just some free time, oh
I wanna run with my girls
Hit the club, hit the mall
Get my nails and hair done
Spend a day at the spa
Boy, you ain't gotta worry
There ain't nothin' goin' on
I need some me time
That's all, and that's all
