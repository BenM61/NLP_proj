High on a windy hill
I feel my heart stand still
Oh, I can hear you calling my name.

Into a misty blue
I go in search of you
There in the shadows calling in vain.

Why are you just beyond me?
When will I see your face?
Why do you just elude me
And leave me in this lonely space?

Oh, into eternity
Your love will beckon me.
I can't forget your voice
That calls my name.
Orchestra interlude. then;
Into eternity
Your love will beckon me.
I can't forget your voice
That calls my name.
