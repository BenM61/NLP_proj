What is that sound
Ringing in my ears?
The strangest sound
I've heard for years and years
The sound of two hearts
Beating side by side
The sound of one love
That neither one can hide

The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round

What is that sound
Running round my head?
Funny, I thought
That part was long since dead
But now there's new life
Coursing through my veins
Because there's someone
To make it beat again

The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round

What is that sound
Ringing in my ears?
The strangest sound
I've heard for years and years
The sound of two hearts
Beating side by side
The sound of one love
That neither one can hide
