Hey mister can you tell me
What this world's about
It might just help me out
I used to be a dreamer
But my dreams have burned
You know how luck can turn

Sometimes it's hard to find a friendly face
Feel like a stranger to the human race
It's such a lonely, lonely place

I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'Cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger, a stranger in this town

Everybody loves a winner
Till the winners lose
And then it's front page news
Nobody loves a loser
When you're down and out
You know there ain't no doubt

I'm just a victim of circumstance
Please mister give me a helping hand
Brother won't you understand

I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'Cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger, a stranger in this town

I'm just a victim of circumstance
Please mister give me a helping hand
Brother won't you understand

I walk alone in the darkness of the city
Got no place to call home
I might be dyin'
But you can't hear a sound
'Cause midnight rain is comin' down
I'm just a stranger, a stranger in this town
I mean no danger, I'm a stranger, I'm a stranger
I'm a stranger in this town
I mean no danger, I'm a stranger

I'm just a stranger in this town
