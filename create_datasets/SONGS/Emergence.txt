Gotta make out things they said
Spent too many nights getting out of my head
They must be mad, must be blind
Driving me crazy right out of my mind

Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency
Oh no!
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency Emergency Emergency

Can't seem to think, can't decide
Times running out on the other side
Where to run, what to do
Better not hide so I can't find you

Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency
Oh no!
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine Emergency Emergency Emergency
