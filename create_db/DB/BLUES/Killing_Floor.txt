I should have quit you, a long time ago
I should have quit you, babe, long time ago
I should have quit you, and went on to Mexico
If I had-a followed my first mind
If I had-a followed my first mind
I'd been gone, since my second time

I shoulda went on, when my friend come from Mexico at me
I shoulda went on, when my friend come from Mexico at me
But no, I was foolin' with ya, baby, I let ya put me on the killin' floor
Lord knows, I shoulda been gone
Lord knows, I shoulda been gone
And I wouldn't have been here, down on the killin' floor
Yeah
