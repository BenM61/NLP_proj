It was one hundred degrees as we sat beneath a willow tree
Whose tears didn't care they just hung in the air
And refused to fall, to fall

I knew I'd made a horrible call
And now the state line felt like the Berlin wall
And there was no doubt about which side I was on

'Cause I built you a home in my heart 
With rotten wood that decayed from the start
'Cause you can't find nothing at all 
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can't find nothing at all 
If there was nothing there all along

I braved treacherous streets
And kids strung out on homemade speed
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all

'Cause at night, the sun in retreat
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth
In the mouth of a man who was devouring us both

You're so cute when you're slurring your speech
But they're closing the bar 
And they want us to leave

And you can't find nothing at all 
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can't find nothing at all 
If there was nothing there all along

I'm the war of head versus heart
And it's always this way
My head is weak, my heart always speaks
Before I know what it will say

And you can't find nothing at all 
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can't find nothing at all 
If there was nothing there all along

And you can't find nothing at all 
If there was nothing there all along
There were churches, theme parks and malls
There was nothing there all along
