I close my eyes and dream about a sunny holiday
I wish that I was beachin' down on Saint Tropez
Or sitting in the lobby at the fabulous Pierre
With diamonds on my fingers and not a single care

Instead I'm on the Avenue where nobody goes
With fields of green that wilted like a last summer rose
Some people call it paradise, but I call it pain
Baby take me anywhere, but not here again

Why am I sitting in the middle of nowhere
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you, oh oh
I guess that I do
Why am I sitting in the middle of nowhere
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you, oh oh
I guess that I do

You promised me a motorcade and endless perfume
A palace in Geneva with a perfect view
And dreams painted yellow like the colour of gold
And dine with kings and queens until the food gets cold

Instead I'm on the edge of all I thought I would be
This dream is now a comedy I don't wanna see
Some people call it laughter but I call it pain
Baby take me anywhere but not here again

Why am I sitting in the middle of nowhere
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you, oh oh
I guess that I do
Why am I sitting in the middle of nowhere
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you, oh oh
I guess that I do

Oh I do

I know we have a chemistry
This combination's heavenly
But don't forget you promised me
Everything, everything
I know we have a chemistry
This combination's heavenly
But don't forget that you promised me
Everything

Why am I sitting in the middle of nowhere
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you, oh oh
I guess that I do
Why am I sitting in the middle of nowhere
Standing here with nothing to do
Wondering if I really love you, oh oh
I guess that I do
