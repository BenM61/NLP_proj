If I could have my way
I'd be sleeping in the alley
On a couch with a friend and a bottle of gin
If I could have my way
I'd be runnin' with the circus
I would be taming all the lions
There'd be no denying I was brave and crazy
If I could have my way
I wouldn't be dreaming, scheming, screaming
Oh, what am I gonna do
About you

I wishes were horses
This beggar would ride
I'd have my cake and eat it
With a little on the side
I'd never want for money
I'd never want for friends
I wouldn't have to make excuses for the shape that I'm in
Shaking and crazy
Before I saw your eyes
I was in control of my soul on the whole
Oh, what am I gonna do
About you

Cool as a rule
I wouldn't play nobody's fool
But I keep on talking
Made in the shade
I had a perfect cue to fade
But I keep on walking

If I could have my way
I'd check out right now
I'd say out to lunch honey thanks a bunch
It wouldn't work out anyhow
But this desire's too much
It's rented out my brain
It's showing previews of your body
Driving me insane
And that's crazy
So all that I can do
Is to beg, plead, won't you tell me please
What am I gonna do
About you
