Clothes must play a part 
To light an eye, to win a heart; 
They say a gown can almost speak, 
If it is chic. 
Should you select the right effect, 
You cannot miss, 
You may be sure, 
He will tell you this. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss. 
A combination like this, 
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true, 
Imagine finding a dream like you! 
You're lovely to look at, 
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight! 

What appeals to me 
Is just your charm and dignity,
Not what you wear, 
But just an air, of great repose. 
You are quite perfect from your head down to your toes 
Both night and day, 
I am moved to say. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss. 
A combination like this, 
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true, 
Imagine finding a dream like you! 
You're lovely to look at, 
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight!
