You, you're givin' me life
Givin' me all of you, mmm
Oh, it's true
Losin' myself
I found me right next you, oh yeah

You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making it still look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, oh yeah

Whoa, oh I, I never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa, oh I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I found you, now that I found you
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do if I was without you
Now, hold me down
Babe, it's all true
Now that I found you
It's my ritual

So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do, if I was without you
Now, help me now
Babe, it's all true
Now that I found you
My ritual

You
First thing on my mind when I'm waking up is you, oh yeah
When I'm blue
You spin me around like color wheel, yes you do
Oh yeah

You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making it still look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, oh yeah

Whoa, oh I, never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa, oh I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I found you, now that I found you
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do, if I was without you
Now, hold me down
Babe, it's all true
Now that I found you
It's my ritual

Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa, oh, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I found you, now that I found you

Say you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm lost without my ritual
