Doctor I've got this feelin'
Deep inside of me, deep inside of me
I just can't control my feet
When I hear the beat, when I hear the beat

Hey Doctor could you give me somethin'
To ease the pain, to ease the pain
'Cause if you don't help me soon
Gonna lose my brain, gonna go insane

I just don't know, don't know
How I'm gonna deal with you
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat
I just don't know, don't know

Won't you help me Doctor Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat
Won't you help me Doctor Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat

Won't you help me Doctor Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat
Won't you help me Doctor Beat?

(Motherfuckers gonna drop the pressure)
(Motherfucker)

You see doctor I got this fever
That I can't control, that I can't control
Music makes me move my body
Makes me move my soul, makes me move my soul

Doctor you got to give me something
'Cause I'm burning up, yes I'm burning up
Doctor you got to find the cure
Or we're gonna die, yes we're gonna die

I just don't know, don't know
How I'm gonna deal with you
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat
I just don't know, don't know

Won't you help me Doctor Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat
Won't you help me Doctor Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat

Won't you help me Doctor Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Doctor Beat
Won't you help me Doctor Beat?
You gotta help me, you gotta help me
