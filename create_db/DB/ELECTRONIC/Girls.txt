Girls, girls, girls, girls
(Haha, it's the call)
Girls, girls, girls, girls
(Marcus and Martinus, yeah)

Well, here we go again
Another perfect ten
Sometimes we gotta let it out (Ah-ooh-uh)
I feel it all the time
They're always on my mind
They bring me up when I am down (Ah-ooh-uh)

With every smile, every look I go crazy
Yeah, every girl in the world mesmerize me

There's a million things I should have done, but I can't help it
Oh-ooh-uh-uh, oh-ooh-uh
Going up and down, and spinning round and round, I love it
Oh-ooh-uh

I've been looking at girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls
I've been looking at girls, girls, girls, girls
Oh-ooh-uh
I've been looking at girls

What would life be without them
High heels, crazy curves, right at the bottom
So I thank God that we got them
Sometimes we try a little too hard, like pardon me
One time for the true treasure
Two times for the one who wanna bring the true pressure
Got my mind on these girls, you're the real gift
Wouldn't be nothing without them, that's some real sh

I love you, I love you, I love you
Yeah, I love everything about you
Oh yeah, I do
'Cause I've been looking at you
The way you move
God damn, you're cute
Girl, I need you

There's a million things I should have done, but I can't help it
Oh-ooh-uh-uh, oh-ooh-uh
Going up and down, and spinning round and round, I love it
Ooh-oh-uh
