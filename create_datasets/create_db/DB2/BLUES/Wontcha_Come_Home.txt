Darling I been waiting
While you gone and done your changing
But you know I don't got much time
Still everywhere I go
I see, people waiting just like me
Waiting for you, to come on home
I love you darling
Don't leave me alone

Come home now
Won't you come home now

Believe my girl
I need your love
And no one else
Will ever take your place

Won't you come home now
Won't you come home 
Won't you come home
Won't you come home
Won't you come home 
Won't you come home now

I know you've got my tricks hiding up your sleeve
But won't you take a ride
And stay with me
We can take a walk underneath the moonlight
Where the guitar strums, to the rhythmn so tight
There's no need for looking when you've found what you need
'Cause I've got you and you've got me
There's no need for looking when you've found what you need
So come on home darlin' set me free

Come home now

Darling I been waiting
While you gone and done your changing
But you know I don't got much time
