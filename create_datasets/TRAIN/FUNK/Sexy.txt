You look so sexy

S-e-x-y sexy
S-e-x-y sexy
Sexy to me

Do your dance you shake that thing
You can drive a horny nigga insane
How'd you get all that ass in them jeans
You can let it all pop out on me
Slidin' down the pole makin' sexy faces
Niggas in the club trickin' off this places
How about takin' me to VIP
Show me what you can do for all this money
I'll make you think about goin' home with me
Pop about 2 or 3 extacies
Take a couple shots of some Hennessey
Now strip for me

You look so sexy
S-e-x-y sexy
Sexy to me

This is what I wanna do
Take you off the club, get you in my coop
Drive you to my house, throw you in my room
Shakin' that thing is what you do
Show me how you do it in the from and the back
Get us all excited, cause you dancin' like that
Show us how u make that big ol' booty go
I love it when your body speaks to me
I like it when your dancing next to me
The way you do your dance keeps me so intrigued
I'm definitely a fan cause your so sexy
Now strip for me

You look so sexy
S-e-x-y sexy
Sexy to me

(Mya:)
When the light come off
You'll be takin' me home
Bouncin' back and fourth yea
Till about 6 in the morn
See I like fast cars
Ill tell you I can ride real star
I never met a brother so S-E-X-Y
Damn your such a star
You look so sexy

You look so sexy
S-e-x-y sexy
Sexy to me
