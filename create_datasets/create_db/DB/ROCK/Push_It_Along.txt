Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby

The desert moon is falling across the sands hoo, hah hoo,hah
I feel the loving touch of invisible hands hoo,hah hoo,hah
And all across the skies I could see his eyes
Lift me up let my soul just fly!

Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby

Through desert wings that know know reason hoo,hah hoo,hah
When the only sound is of the season hoo,hah hoo,hah
The heat of the day the cool of he evening
Are the only measues of what I'm feelin!

Told what to feel, told what to see
Told what to see, told what to feel
I'm used to this I'm used to that
I'll stand in a field in a scarecrows hat!

Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train, ride it baby
Push it along, push it along baby gonna ride the train
