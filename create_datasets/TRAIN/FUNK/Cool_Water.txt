Umm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Umm, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a player no more
I gave that up for you
I know that makes you happy
When I come home at night
Baby, my feelings are true
I'm not gaming on your female sense abilities
Saying things I just don't mean, no, no

(I intend to try) Gonna try to
(Elevate in your life) In your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright
Let me ease your mind
Put serenity in your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright

I'm hoping that
Nothing ever comes between the love we have
(Love we have)
You and I are destined to be sitting back
Growing old together
Talking bout the past
(About the past)
I'll bring you happiness at last

(I intend to try) Gonna try to
(Elevate in your life) In your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright
Let me ease your mind
Put serenity in your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright

Happiness at last
Yours and mine alone
Cant nobody take that from us, no, no, no
So if ever you may thirst
If ever you may hurt
Ill be right there for you baby

(I intend to try) Gonna try to
(Elevate in your life) In your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright
Let me ease your mind
Put serenity in your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright

(Just like cool water) Cold
(Just like cool water) Cold
(Just like cool water) Cold
(Just like cool water) Cold

(I intend to try) Gonna try to
(Elevate in your life) In your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright
Let me ease your mind
Put serenity in your life
Its like cool water when the sun is shining bright

Girl let me be the one
Girl let me be the one
Girl let me be he
I wanna be the one
Girl let me be the one
Just like cool water
