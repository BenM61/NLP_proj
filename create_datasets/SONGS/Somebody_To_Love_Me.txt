I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy, I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my lif

We are wicked men
Looking for our buckles to loosen
By the count of ten
I wanna see somebody human
And I lost what it was, in the teenage dust of a downtown Romeo
In a couple of weeks, you can tell all the freaks, how you carried my body home

But tonight, I crossed the line
Dear Mr Lonely, how much do they know me?
I could find lessons in life
But, once you've earned it, you've already burned it

I don't wanna see you go
I need somebody to love me
(Need somebody, oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I need somebody to love me
(Need somebody, oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy, I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life

Got my ticket man, and I'm looking for somebody to use it
I know we pretend, but one of these days we're gonna lose it
And I once left town, when the leaves turn brown
With a couple of souvenirs
She was in my car, when we hit that wall
Yeah, you could of moved me to tears

But tonight, I crossed the line
I used to know her, when my house was sober
I could find lessons in life
Over and over, is it really over?

I don't wanna see you go
I need somebody to love me
(Need somebody, oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I need somebody to love me
(Need somebody, oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy, I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life

But tonight, I crossed the line
I used to know her, when my house was sober
I could find lessons in life
Over and over, is it really over?

I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody, oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody, oh)
Yeah, I want somebody nice
See the boy, I once was in my eyes
