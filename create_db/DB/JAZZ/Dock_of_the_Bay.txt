Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watchin' the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again
(Yeah,) I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away,
(Ooh, I'm just) sitting on the dock of the bay, wastin'
Time
Left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
I had nothin' to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way
(So,) I'm just gonna sittin'on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away,
Ooh, I'm (just) sitting on the dock of the bay, wastin'
Time
Looks like nothin's gonna change;

Everything, everithing remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same
Looks like nothin's gonna change;
Everything, everithing remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same
I'm sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave my alone
Two thousand miles, I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Now, I'm just gonna sit, on the dock of the bay
Ooh, I watch the tide
No, I'm gonna watch the tide roll away
On the dock of the bay
Ooh wastin', wastin', Ooh no, no no no
