I need you, you need me
We make the perfect kind of misery
I help you, you help me
Become the one I swore I'd never be
The one that I don't ever wanna be

I like the way you won't apologize
I like the way you just demoralize
I like the way you always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you is hard to criticize

Suppress this, this hatred
I stand beside you while you soak it in
Spit on me, I taste it
I love you more and you just fake it
I want you more and you just faked it

I like the way you won't apologize
I like the way you just demoralize
I like the way you always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you is hard to criticize

There's always something wrong
There's something I didn't do
There's always something I'm afraid I'm gonna lose
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do
No matter how hard I try, I wake up next to you

I like the way you won't apologize
I like the way you just demoralize
I like the way you always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you is hard to criticize

I like the way you won't apologize
I like the way you just demoralize
I like the way you always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you is hard to criticize

It's hard to criticize
It's hard to criticize
It's hard to criticize
It's hard to criticize
