Some people, they tease one another
Take pride in themselves, keeping the other one down
Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people, they hurt one another
They love to see hurt in the other one's eyes
Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

Some people, they use one another so aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people they long for each other
They love to talk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

With a word unspoken with a voice unheard
When a word is broken by a tender word
When a heart is moved, when a heart is thrown
The silence tells you, you're not alone

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Holding the other one
Holding each other
