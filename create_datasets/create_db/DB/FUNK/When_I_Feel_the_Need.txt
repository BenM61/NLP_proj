When I feel the need for something
And I don't know what it is
I just think of the first thing
That comes to my mind
It's my baby, it's my baby
Every time

When I get the taste for something
And I don't know what it is
I just think of the one thing
That I'm really missing
It's my baby's kiss, it's my baby's sweet kisses
Every time

For every locked door
My baby has a key
'Cause she can cure everything
That's ever wrong with me

When my arms reach out for something
And I don't know what it is
I just close, close my eyes
And the first thing I visualise
It's my sweet baby, my baby
Every time

When I feel the need for something
My baby, my baby

When I get the taste for something
My baby, my baby

When my arms reach out for something
My baby, my baby

When I get the need for something
My baby, my baby
