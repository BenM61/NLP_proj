I'm late night creeping, I found me a young soul stealer (Stealer)
Keep one on my arm, a queen of the kingdom (Kingdom)
I wanna put her crown on
Spending my cash, she like, "Right on"
She shake like a pom pom
Take one and we take off (Yeah)

Push up if I need to (Woo)
Looking for a carefree diva
Drowning the butterflies inside your stomach
Every time that you drink up

Di-va, diva
Di-va, carefree diva (Yeah)
Looking for a carefree diva
Di-va, diva
Di-va, carefree diva (Woo)
Looking for a carefree diva

I got no rules tonight, boy, I rule your kingdom
Shaking my goods, you enjoy, I feel you linger, yeah
I want ya, I want ya, I want ya
You know that, you know that I love this
Feeling my skills, I let 'em show, li-licking your finger

La isla bonita
Let me be your carefree diva
Drowning all the butterflies inside
Every time that you drink up

Di-va (Diva), diva
Di-va, carefree diva (Yeah)
Looking for a carefree diva
Di-va (Diva), diva
Di-va, carefree diva (Woo)
Looking for a carefree diva

Thanks for never leaving me concerned (No, no)
Low-key, she's hating me, love her (Yeah, yeah)
Good f*ck and I have you covered
Passenger side for your comfort
Marriott, I first had you over
Saw you clear and in color (Hey)

Push up if I need to (Woo)
Looking for a carefree diva
Drowning the butterflies inside your stomach
Every time that you drink up

Di-va (Diva), diva
Di-va, carefree diva (Yeah)
Diva, looking for a carefree diva
Di-va (Diva), diva
Di-va, carefree diva (Woo)
Diva, looking for a carefree diva
