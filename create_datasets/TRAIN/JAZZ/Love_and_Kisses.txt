Love and kisses
Never misses
Making a heaven for two
With a tender
Sweet surrender
Coming from someone like you

Your perfection
To affection
Creates a perfect design
Love has bound us
Joy has found us
Planning a future divine

No indecision
I know that my vision
Is clear
When you are near
No need for sunlight
For you are the one light
I see
So real to me

Love and kisses
That's what bliss is
Lighting whatever you do
Whole completeness
Blessed sweetness
Coming from someone like you
