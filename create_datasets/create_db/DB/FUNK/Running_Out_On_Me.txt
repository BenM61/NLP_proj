It's time to face it, the simple facts are clear
that no amount of lovin' you, could ever keep you here
Packed up to leave, and never lookin' back
and don't try to stop this train, 'cause it's headed down the track
Never a tear across that cheek
No sign of sympathy, for a man who's feeling weak
Walkin's much to slow, so your runnin' out on me

I must admit it, you never lied to me
but somehow you stole my heart, and now I can't be free
So please forgive me, if it's hard to take this in
but I gave you everything, now your tellin' me it's the end
Never a tear across that cheek
No sign of sympathy, for a man who's feeling weak
and walkin's much to slow

So your runnin' out on me
Where did the time go, see how fast it flies
Now it's time to fly away, you can't stand long good-byes
I shouldn't take it so hard it's not that you don't care
but I'm one of many men
The rest are still out there
Never a tear across that cheek
No sign of sympathy, for a man who's weak
and walkin's much to slow
So your runnin' out on me
