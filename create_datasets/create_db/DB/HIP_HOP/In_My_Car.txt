(chorus)
Riding down the street 
And I see a pretty girl
She wants me, I want her
I will take her to my world
I'm in my car 
I'm stunting in my car
You know I'm in my car
I'm stunting in my car 
My car

(verse 1)
Ridin hi than a light pole 
Lookin like a light show 
Paint from the east but 
My pants from tokyo 
Trunk on summer jam 
Yea I'm a stunna man 
So much money I can't fit it 
In a rubberband stupidddd and 
They know I go hard ridin down 
Crack street stuntin in my car 
Tips on the scrape cause they knowin I'm a star 
And I buy my own drink I ain't 
F**kin wit the bar 
See me all through richmond 
Slidin on the sixes 
Paint like frenches poppin at 
The bitches scrape thang scrape thang
Uno got one 2 f*ck wit ya boy 
Girl I bet it be a fun move

Chorus
Riding down the street 
And I see a pretty girl
She wants me, I want her
I will take her to my world
I'm in my car 
I'm stunting in my car
You know I'm in my car
I'm stunting in my car 
My car

On the dance floor I'm the man

Drop the top will make it cassion 
But I'm to cool but my neck 
Like freeza icy whip can skate and I'm

Riding down the street 
And I see a pretty girl
She wants me, I want her

You know I'm in my car

Got them for the pussy boppas 24inch

Tiny ass sweater and my weed from oakland

Bang kuddddang and the rims is broken
Say you wanna be be but you not the 
Ocean like daaaat ya boy is wet

You know I'm in my car
I'm stunting in my car
