Oh, oh
I promise to love you
No matter what you do
I want you, I need you
I love you through and through
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I promise to be true

[CHORUS]
I promise to remember
The meaning of romance
If I've done something wrong
Give me one more chance

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I promise to be true

[VERSE 1]
Oh, oh, my darling
I have promised
To give you my heart
Oh, darling promise me
We will never part
I know I'm not a king
And I'm not very wise
But something that you must realize
