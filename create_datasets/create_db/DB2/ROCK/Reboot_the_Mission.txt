Where you're going has no signs
And you're not going in a straight line
You ought to have me on your mind
I dare you to think otherwise

One day the water, more water
You keep diving and you won't be recovered
You need a clue, I'll come in closer
I want to tell you, you've had it coming

Eyes on the prize, reboot the mission
I've lost the sight, but not the vision
Eyes on the prize, reboot the mission
I lost the sight, but not the vision

Move your body, look alive
Oh, don't you think of what's out some time
It's even better than you've implied
Dice on the table, let it ride

The movie's showing over the building
Midnight shifts just beginning
Oh let your hair down, I watch you singing
I've got to say, you had it coming

Eyes on the prize, reboot the mission
I've lost the sight, but not the vision
Eyes on the prize, reboot the mission
I lost the sight, but not the vision

No matter how you use it, which way you swing
Even the longest day at some point ends
I'll throw your shoes off, hat in the ring
Show me a hookshot, the whole thing

Welcome Jack, the new drummer,
He jammed with the mighty Joe Strummer
I see Rami, Greg and Stewart
I've to say, Jay, we've had it coming

Eyes on the prize, reboot the mission
I've lost the sight, but not the vision
Eyes on the prize, reboot the mission
I lost the sight, but not the vision
