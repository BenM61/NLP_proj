(Yeah) well, I travel at the speed of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand

I sent a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart, baby
Come on along with me today

Well, I am what I am thank god
Some people just don't understand, well help them god
Find yourselef first, and then your tool
Find yourself first, don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chain
Messin' with that fool, baby
Your life is pain
If you wanna be free
Come on along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said, find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So it can come alive
You beter prove to the man
You're as strong as him
'Cause in the eyes of god
You're both children to him

Everybody come alive, everybody love alive
Everybody love alive, everybody hear my message
Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh
Hey, now
