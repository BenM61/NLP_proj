Come on why'all 
Don't stop why'all 
Gotta make why'all rock, why'all
Come on why'all 
Don't stop why'all

Every now and then it invades my mind 
Some have missed a place through the hard times 
From the nine to five or just a world they see 
But get your boogey shoes, there's a remedy

I insist that you relax and let it go 
I insist that you believe it's gonna get better 
I insist you understand right now you can't do nothin' better
So let it go

(1) - Everybody's out on the floor don't you know 
Can't do nothin' better so let it go 
Set your troubles free 
Dance with me 
Loose control
Let it go

Every now and then it seems hard to find 
Some have lost their way of loving, peace of mind 
And if there's any pain or hostility 
Well get down on the floor 'cause there's a remedy

I insist that you be down and ready to party 
I insist that you relax and let it go 
I insist that you believe it's gonna get better 
I insist you understand right now you can't do nothin' better
So let it go

Let it go
Guess it's time to let it go 
Even if your feelings show 
It's O.K. to let it go 
Guess it's time to let it

Let it go
Guess it's time to let it go 
Even if your feelings show 
It's O.K. to let it go 
Guess it's time to let it

A one-two, 
a one-two, 
a one-two

Come on why'all Don't stop why'all
Can't do nothin better so let it go
Come on why'all Don't stop why'all
