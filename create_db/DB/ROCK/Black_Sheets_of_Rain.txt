Checking in every morning
To the sound of steam and caffeine
The sludge in the bottom of the cup
Just like the sludge in the stream
Slag heap keep growing higher
Every morning the sky, it's on fire
And it's only 9 AM again

Is there an upside to every downside?
Keep it inside, it's a downward slide of broken glass
Keeps building in piles

And I don't know
I don't know if the sun ever smiles

It's the black sheets of rain
Following me again
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I've been
Following me again

I feel the toxins fill my blood stream as I'm walking through the parking lot
Over and over and over and over and over and over
The clouds hanging over
Choking the life out of me
The motto seems to be
"We work in order to be free"

It's the black sheets of rain
Following me again
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I've been
Following me again

Over and over and over and over and over and over again

Where were you in my hour of need
(I never see the sun stop shining)
The clouds roll over the sunlight
(Someone stopped the sun from shining)
And I stand here, ready to bleed
(I never see the sun stop shining)
A little rain is all we need
(Someone stopped the sun from shining)
Where will you be in my darkest hour of need?
(I never see the sun stop shining)
Where will you be in my darkest hour of need?
(Someone stopped the sun)
Here it comes again
