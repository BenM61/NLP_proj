The first time I saw you standing in the water 
You must have been all of a thousand feet tall 
Nearly naked, unashamed like Herod's daughter 
Your love was so big it made New York look small 

You've been the subject of so many dreams 
Since I climbed your torso 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
My Statue of Liberty 
Boo boo 
Impaled on your hair 
What do you do do do to me 
Boo boo 

I leaned right over to kiss your stony book 
A little jealous of the ships with whom you flirt 
A billion lovers with their cameras snap, snap to look 
And in my fantasy I sail beneath your skirt

You've been the subject of so many dreams 
Since I climbed your torso 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
My Statue of Liberty 
Boo boo 
Impaled on your hair 
What do you do do do to me 
Boo boo, said, pop me

Oh oh oh oh oh 
My Statue of Liberty 
Boo boo 
Impaled on your hair 
What do you do do do to me
Boo boo, said,

Oh oh oh oh oh 
My Statue of Liberty 
Boo boo 
Impaled on your hair 
What do you do do do to me
Boo boo

Liberty
Liberty
Liberty
