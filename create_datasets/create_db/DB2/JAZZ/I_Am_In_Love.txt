I am dejected, I am depressed
Yet resurrected and sailing the crest
Why this elation mixed with deflation
What explanation 
I am in love

Such conflicting questions rise around my brain
Should I order cyanide or order champagne
Oh, what is this sudden jolt
I feel like a frightened colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt
I am in love

I knew the hours were against me before
I have no flare for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire

So, come and enlighten my days and never depart
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart
But I am only in love with you
And so in need of a stampede of love
I'm so in need of a stampede of love
I'm so in need of a stampede of love
I'm so in need of love
