She left on a Sunday afternoon.
It is the only way for everyone concerned
She said.
And I could only ask her why

But she just smiled and told me
One day I would learn.

Don't you worry
This will all make sense tomorrow.
Don't be sorry
That everything we shared will fade away.
There's so much more to see in each new day.
They'd never understand
I'm not an ordinary girl.

She took nothing but her clothes.
Taking more would just remind her of her past
She said.
I thought I'd never laugh again
On the day I said goodbye to my best friend.

Don't you worry
This will all make sense tomorrow. . . .

Don't you worry
This will all make sense tomorrow.
Don't be sorry
That everything we shared will fade away.
There's so much more to see in each new day.
And now I understand
She's just an ordinary girl.
She's just an ordinary girl.
