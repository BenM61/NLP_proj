Funny how a lonely day, can make a person say 
What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart, can make me start to say
What good is my life
Funny how I often seem, to think I'll find never another dream 
In my life
Till I look around and see, this great big world is part of me 
And my life
This is my life 
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me 
But that's the way that I was born to be 
This is me 
This is me 

This is my life 
And I don't give a damn for lost emotions 
I've such a lot of love I've got to give 
Let me live 
Let me live 

Sometime when I feel afraid, I think of what a mess I've made 
Of my life
Crying over my mistakes, forgetting all the breaks I've had 
In my life
I was put on earth to be, a part of this great world is me 
And my life
Guess I'll just add up the score, and count the things I'm grateful for 
In my life
This Is my life 
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me 
But that's the way that I was born to be 
This is me 
This is me 

This is my life 
And I don't give a damn for lost emotions 
I've such a lot of love I've got to give 
Let me live 
Let me live 

This is my life 
This is my life 
This is my life
