Walking through a wasteland of words and memories
Looking for the person I used to be
Thoughts I don't recognize make me realize that
Times have changed and so have I
And a familiar fear comes back to me

Pale fire
Dry land getting drier
Nothing can grow
In the ashes of desire
Pale fire
Burned on the desire
No one can grow
With nothing to inspire

The bitter harvest of a barren land
I'm painting pictures you don't understand
Dust blinds my eyes, makes me realize
I'm choking life with living lies

Pale fire
Dry land getting drier
Nothing can grow
In the ashes of desire
Pale fire
Burned out on desire
No one can grow
With nothing to inspire

And a familiar fear claims another day
Wondering have I said all I have to say

Pale fire
Dry land getting drier
Nothing can grow
In the ashes of desire
Pale fire
Burned out on desire
No one can grow
With nothing to inspire

Pale fire
Dry land getting drier
Nothing can grow
In the ashes of desire
Pale fire
Burned out on desire
No one can grow
With nothing to inspire
