Ginger Red want you stay with me in bed
Need your body warmth
Ginger Red there's no reason to get mad
Hold you in my arms.
Want you to stay and lay down with me
Don't go 'cause the pourin' rain is wet
Thunder and lightning is not just my plea
So lay down
Don't worry
Stay in bed
Ginger Red there's no reason to get mad
We got time enough
Ginger Red yes I really would be glad
Come on
Don't get tough
Want you to stay and lay down with me
If you leave
I really get upset
Just let it happen
No push naturally
So lay down - so lay down
Don't worry
Stay in bed
Nobody knows that you here now with me
Nobody saw that you came
Don't be afraid of my neighbours you see
Because love
'cause love is not a shame
Ginger Red
Want you stay with me in bed
...
Ginger Red there's no reason to get mad
...
Ginger Red want you stay with me
