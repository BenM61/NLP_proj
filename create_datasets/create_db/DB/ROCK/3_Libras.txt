Threw you the obvious and you flew with it on your back a name
In your recollection down among a million same
Difficult not to feel
a little bit disappointed and passed over
when I've looked right through to see you
naked but oblivious
and you don't see me

But I threw you the obvious just to see
If there's more behind the eyes of a fallen angel
eyes of a tragedy

Here I am expecting just a little bit too much
From the wounded but I see through it all and see you

'Cause I threw you the obvious to see what occurs behind the
eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy
oh well, oh well apparently nothing
apparently nothing at all

You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't see me
You don't see me at all
