When I lift off
When both my feet leave the ground
Will you be there where the skyline ends?
When I take flight
When the blackest night calls me home
Will you be there when the dream begins?

The smallest drop in the ocean
Can start a wave of emotion
My dear, I wish I could hold you safe in my arms
From here to eternity

Alone I'll know you'll be waiting
When the moon beams lean down to kiss me
Cause your beauty burns through the darkness
Crystal and clear
From here to eternity

When I let go
When I release all my cares
Will you be there where the nightmare ends?
When I drift off
When the silver sun calls my name
Will you be there where the light begins?

The smallest drop in the ocean
Can start a wave of emotion
My dear, I wish I could hold you safe in my arms
From here to eternity

Alone I'll know you'll be waiting
When the moon beams lean down to kiss me
Cause your beauty burns through the darkness
Crystal and clear
From here to eternity
