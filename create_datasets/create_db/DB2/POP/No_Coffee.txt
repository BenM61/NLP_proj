The moon illuminates the waves and I'm in love
The glow of a Scorpio sun beats down from high above
I haven't been the same since you went away
I have come undone
I can hardly wait for the end of the day
And when the morning comes

Don't need no coffee, I'm wide awake
I'm not much for sleeping when your love is at stake
I go out walking, I don't know what to do
'Cause I can't think about anything but you, oh

Baby, I need you in a serious way
Can't give you all this love when you push me away
I'm at the mountain and I'm strong enough
I'm gonna run till I fall down in your love

And while I'm underwater, I wonder where you are
And though I know I can't be under long
I can't ignore my heart

I'm gonna get a motorcycle too
I'm gonna learn to ride, ride next to you
Everyone has noticed this courage I've found
'Cause I don't fear a thing when you're around

Baby, I need you in a serious way
Can't give you all this love when you push me away
I'm at the mountain and I'm strong enough
I'm gonna run till I fall down in your love

Wanna be back in your arms, where I belong
But why, why am I here crying on my own tonight?

I'm gonna get a motorcycle too
I'm gonna learn to ride, ride next to you
Keep wondering how long you're gonna make me wait
But hurry back to me before it's too late

Baby, I need you in a serious way
I can't give you all this love when you push me away
I'm at the mountain and I'm strong enough
I'm gonna run till I fall down in your love

Baby, I need you in a serious way
Can't give you all this love when you push me away
And I'm at the mountain and I'm strong enough
I'm gonna run till I fall down in your love
