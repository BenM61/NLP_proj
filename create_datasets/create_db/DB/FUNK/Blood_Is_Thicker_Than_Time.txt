I've been to the mountain top 
I've been to the valley low 
The one thing that never stopped 
Was the love that my family showed 
When my mama she passed away 
My papa he gave us hope 
He said there won't ever come a day 
When your family won't help you cope 

As sure as Moses' staff parted the water 
As sure as Cain had to pay four his crime 
As sure as no one wants to be brokenhearted 
That's how sure I am that blood is thicker than time 

Well 
We went to church on Sunday mornin' (Oh yeah) 
All dressed up lookin' mighty fine 
The spirit came without a warning 
Intoxicated us all like wine 
Don't it make you stop and wonder 
Why we kill our own kind every day? 
Why can't we get along with each other 
When we damn well know it's the only way? 

As sure as Moses' staff parted the water 
As sure as Cain had to pay four his crime 
As sure as no one wants to be brokenhearted 
That's how sure I am that blood is thicker than time 
(That's how sure I am, oh yeah, blood is thicker than time) 

Don't it make you stop and wonder 
Why we kill our own kind every day? 
Why can't we get along with each other 
When we damn well know it's the only way? 

As sure as Moses' staff parted the water 
As sure as Cain had to pay four his crime (Uh-huh) 
As sure as no one wants to be brokenhearted 
That's how sure I am that blood is thicker than time 

That's how sure I am blood is thicker than time
