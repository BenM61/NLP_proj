Love doesn't die
It just stops talkin'
There's no good-bye
You just start walkin'
Out into the chill of the night
Wonderin' if your timin' was right
But you still can't deny

It was good while it lasted
We had it all for a minute or two
And there's no other place
Where the best that two dreamers can do
Turns out too good to be true

We really did it this time
There's no returning
We lit up the sky
And went down burnin'
If we're burned a little too bright
You showed me what beautiful light
You still can't deny

It was good while it lasted
We had it all for a minute or two
And there's no other place where the best of two dreamers can do
Turns out too good to be true

There's a star (up above the world so bright)
Fallin' fast (will we ever get it right)
Make a wish (wish I may I wish I might)
Have you back again for one more night

It was good while it lasted
We had it all for a minute or two
And there's no other place where the best of two dreamers can do 
Turns out too good to be true
Too good to be true
