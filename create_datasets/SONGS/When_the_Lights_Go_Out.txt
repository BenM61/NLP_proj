Susie doesn't go out very much
She likes to stay in bed at night
It seems that everything is all too much
But she just lays in bed at night

The day's all right but then

When the lights go out
She calls your name
When the lights go out
Always the same
Always someone left out in the rain
Always the same

She's the kind who needs the tender touch
She never wants to compromise
What you thought you'd never have gets up
And disappears before your eyes

The day's all right but then

When the lights go out
She calls your name
When the lights go out
Always the same
Always someone left out in the rain
Always the same
Always the same
Always the same
