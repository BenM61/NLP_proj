Get me get me a little closer
Let me see the phantom view
Take me right into the center
Of the nine eleven news

Get me get me my voyeur fetish
Keep me shackled all day through
Electronic world transmission
Everything I see is true

give me give me observation
Let me have the on-site feel
Give me give me the true sensation
For I need a touch of real

Show me show me what is happening
In the world beyond my door
And in time I'll be forgetting
What I have been living for

Help me help me I'm too frightened
To fulfill my hardest task
Will I ever find the answers
To the things I dare not ask
