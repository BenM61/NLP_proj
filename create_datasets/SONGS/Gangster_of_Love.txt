Jesse James and Frank James
Billy Kid, all the rest
Supposed to be some bad cats
Out in the West
But when they dug me
And my gangster ways
They hung up their guns
And made it to the grave

Cause I'm a gangster of love
Say I'm a gangster of love
Well now
When I walk down the street
All the girls that I meet
Say he's a gangster of love
Yeah

I robbed the local beauty contest
For their first place winner
They found her with me out in Hollywood
Eating a big steak dinner
They tried to get her to go back
To pick up her prize
She stood up and told them
You just don't realize

That he's a gangster of love
Early in the morning, gangster of love
Ooh yeah, now
When I walk in a bar
Girls from, from near and far
Say he's a gangster of love
Oh let me invade a little

I jump on my white horse, Cadillac
I ride across the border line
I rope sixty five girls
I kiss them all the same time
I take twenty five or thirty
I'd put them all on a freight
A million dollar reward for me
Each and every state
The Sheriff says, is you Guitar Watson?
In a very deep voice
I say, yes sir, brother Sheriff, and that's your wife on the back of my horse

Cause I'm a gangster of love
Yeah, I'm a gangster of love
Hey, yeah
When I walk down the street
All the girls that I meet
Say he's a gangster of love
