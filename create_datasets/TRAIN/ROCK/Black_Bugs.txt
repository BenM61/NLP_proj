i got killed by black bugs on video game
and then although to myself it doesn't mean too much
i keep dying and dying over and over again
and now i think i'm alive so i'll just pretend

what's at the end? (x2)
what's at the end of satan's rainbow?

what's at the end? (x2)
what's at the end of satan's rainbow?

stared at the tv too long now and i'm not the same
i've got to remind myself that it's just a game
it's getting harder and harder to get to sleep at night
i think i'll let them shoot me so that i can die

what's at the end? (x2)
what's at the end of satan's rainbow?

what's at the end? (x2)
