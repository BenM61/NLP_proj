Oh that's right, baby bubba
We gon' talk about this girl named Suzy, bubba
She ain't no floosey, though
She's a doosey
Speaking about that girl named Suzy cause she's groovy, baby bubba
Ah, we funky down here, y'all
Come here, Suzy baby
Let me rub you down, Suzy baby
Ah, you fat bubba-mubba-wabba

( Daddy-O )
Speaking of a girl named Suzy
Said she'd do anything to soothe me
Take off clothes or put em back on
Ain't that right, Wise? (Word is bond)

( Wise )
Comin from the show she was always there
It's like we couldn't get her out of our hair
She would even follow us late at night
Right, Delite? (Yo, believe the hype)

( Delite )
Suzy was a girl we couldn't get enough of
Can't say it was love, cause I don't know what it was
Homeboys said she was a real loose cutie
So I tapped the Dad and said, "Yo, we got a Suzy"

( Daddy-O )
Speakin of a girl named Suzy
Yeah, yeah
(Suzy)				(4x)

( Daddy-O )
Do you remember that day, we was on the tour bus
Listened to a tape, I think it was the Cold Crush
Suzy heard the tape and said, "Who's that?"
Delite said (Shhh, just sit on my lap)
She said, "Okay, whatever you say"
I saw the game and asked: "Can I play?"
She said, "Sure," I said, "Really?
And what about the rest of the Stet posse?"
She just smiled and I just grinned
And the band, they got ready to win
Or should I say start, or should I say begin
Anyway you put it, she was all in

( Wise )
Started on the tour bus, she was in a rush
(Rush to do what?!) You know what's up
The bus had three rooms, she started in the first
And it was pretty bad, but the second got worse
And in the third I had to tip my hat
(You mean it was like that, hops?) Yo, it was like that
Suzy had a thing for the boys in the band
And the band bein Stet, be assured, my man
Everything that glitters ain't always gold
But for all the groups, yo, she broke the mold

( Daddy-O )
Speakin of a girl named Suzy
Yeah, yeah
(Suzy)				(4x)

( Delite )
Right before a show ???? D.C.
I looked at Wise, the Dad looked at me
We slapped five while the band got ready
Then we all glanced around for Suzy
Had a monogramm top with our names of each
A two-piece bikini like you wear on a beach
A shape no man could bever forget
And on the back of her shorts - mh, take me to the bridge

(Do it now)

(Suzy)

(Uno, dos, tres, quattro)

( all )
Then one day, it was in the winter
Snow was on the ground, we were leavin Philly
I was in my bunk, geared to my radio
Wrapped in his blanket, cause it was kinda chilly
Not too long after, we all fell asleep
And the snow storm got a lot worse
Our bus driver started dozin off
The bus started driftin, Suzy noticed first
She awoke the crew, and the driver, no doubt
Saved our lives, and that's a fact
And one thing about Suzy, you all should know
She may be a groupie, but we love her to the max, Jack

( 'Suzy' )
Ah, Oran Juice Jones
Don't be 'yo baby-in' me, I am not Suzy
Everybody, let me tell you:
Suzy is a DOG
A REAL DOG
You know, she's a real dog
A German Sheperd dog with a leash and a flea collar
And a tail and fur and everything?
She's a real dog and she's following em
Because they draggin her on a leash with a can of Alpo in they pockets!
Let me tell y'all every-
Ah, Wise
Wise...

Daddy-O - will you stop spittin on me

Ha-ha...
Child, you been walkin down the street, guys be tryin to rap to you?
This one guy was playin the Africa stuff
He said, "Yo baby, you know somethin?
If we was back in Africa I would marry you
I would give you 26 or 27 babies
And I will buy your mother a cow"
I said, "Honey, if I have 26 or 27 babies
I'ma need 13 titties and I'ma BE A COW
What is your problem?"
Then this other guy walked up to me, he says
"Ooh baby, you know somethin, when I think of you?
Won't you just come over here and let me be your peppermint paddy"
I said, "When I bite into YOUR peppermint paddy
Honey, I'll give you the feeling, the sensation
Of bein in a sewer barefooted
Now get out my face!"
These guys are so stupid, child
