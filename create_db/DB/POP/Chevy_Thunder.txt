Not coming back but I can't stop waiting
Give me a minute while my heart stops breaking
Give me a minute while I fix my tie
Give me a minute while I take my life

Back into my own hands,
There's a Chevy Thunder on the drive tonight
I'll take your father's car,
And I'm not coming back alive

You know you could've been here, honey
Sitting by my right-hand side, tonight
I'll take your father's car, and
Drive, drive, drive!

And whatever I never could ever let you go
I'm a lover and probably beat at heart but low
I'm riding, I'm riding as fast as this car goes
Chevy Thunder, Chevy, Chevy Thunder!

Once in a while not twice in a while
When heaven breaks, I see you smile
I know it hurts, I know it hurts,
I know (whoa-oh whoa-oh)

I'm not what you want
You fell in love with an idea
And I was never never never never never enough
Tonight I'm riding out of here

You know you could've been here, honey
Sitting by my right-hand side, tonight
I'll take your father's car, and
Drive, drive, drive!

And whatever I never could ever let you go
I'm a lover and probably beat at heart but low
I'm riding, I'm riding as fast as this car goes
Chevy Thunder, Chevy, Chevy Thunder!

And whatever I never could ever let you go
I'm a lover and probably beat at heart but low
I'm riding, I'm riding as fast as this car goes
Chevy Thunder, Chevy, Chevy Thunder!

There's only so many ways to wake up,
To wake up, next to you
But every single time feels like
I'm waking up anew
Just give me one little piece of your heart
And I swear I will be true
Just give me one little piece of your heart
And I'll break my own in two, for you

And whatever I never could ever let you go
I'm a lover and probably beat at heart but low
I'm riding, I'm riding as fast as this car goes
Chevy Thunder, Chevy, Chevy Thunder!

And whatever I never could ever let you go
I'm a lover and probably beat at heart but low
I'm riding, I'm riding as fast as this car goes
Chevy Thunder, Chevy, Chevy Thunder!
