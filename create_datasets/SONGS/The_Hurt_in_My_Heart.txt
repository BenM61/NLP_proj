I just got the goodbye news
Handed me, down by Travis Shoes
Yes, our love was just a lie
Don't want you to see me cry
But those are hurts, the hurt in my heart.

Cause, you always loved me so
Guess a fool's the last to know
Even fools must have their pride
So the pain, I try to hide
But oh the hurt, the hurt in my heart.

Well all, alone with these lies too
Now that I, I have known the feeling of loving you
So I find, try to find a way
To bring you back to me some day.

When I dream of your embrace
There is a smile upon my face
But oh, the hurt, the hurt in my heart.
Oh, oh, this hurt, yes, this hurt in my heart
