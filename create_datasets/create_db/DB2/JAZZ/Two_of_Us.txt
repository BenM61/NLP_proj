Some would rather go it all alone
And never spend time finding where their heart belongs
Some prefer to love and leave not wanting to reveal
A feeling deep inside, a love that could be real

For some this is okay but I can't sleep one night
Without your precious love around me

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever in love

Many say that love's a silly game
But when I'm playing love with you it never ends
And when I'm feeling all my days aren't going right
You shine your light of love and brighten all my nights

And that's why I love you 'cause I can't sleep one night
Without your precious love around me

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever

Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yes, the two of us keeping faith in love
And never letting go of what we're dreaming
Yes, the two of us together forever

I'm glad we have the right to choose
(Win or lose)
I'll take the blame for my mistakes
I'm never letting go of what we're dreaming

The time has come
(Time has come)
For us to share our love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
