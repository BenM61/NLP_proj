As the rain comes down, upon this sad sweet earth
I lie awake at nights and, think about me
All those usual things like what a fool I've been
I curse the awful way, that I let you slip away
For what was forged in love, is now cooling down
With only myself to blame for playing that stupid game
I thought I need only call and you would run
But that day you never showed honey, well I sure learnt

That it seems I need you more each day
Heaven knows why that it goes that way,
Now it's far too late, an' I've lost this time,
Like the Boy who cried Wolf

An' yes, I know it's far too late
To ever win you back,
No tale of nightmare's at my gate,
Could make you turn,
My lost concern

And now the night falls down, upon my selfish soul
I sit alone and wonder, where did I go wrong?
It always worked before you kept the wolf from my door
But one day you never showed and honey, Now I'm not so sure,

That is seems I need you more each day
Heaven knows why that it goes that way,
Now it's far too late, an' I've lost this time,
Like the Boy who cried Wolf
