Ooh, I got a letter, came to me by mail
My baby's comin' home
And I hope that he won't fail

But I feel so good, ooh, I feel so good
Yes, I feel so good, I feel just like ballin' the jack

Got down by the station, suitcase in his hand
My, my baby's comin' home
Lord, don't he look grand?

Well, I feel so good, ooh, I feel so good
Yes, I feel so good, I feel just like ballin' the jack

I feel so good, you know I always will
Lord, I feel just like a Jack out with a Jenny
Way down behind the hill

I feel so good, ooh, I feel so good
I feel so good, I feel just like ballin' the jack

Ooh, I got a letter, came to me by mail
My, my baby's comin' home
I hope that he don't fail

I feel so good, ooh, I feel so good, yeah
Yeah, I feel so good, I feel just like ballin' the jack, yeah
