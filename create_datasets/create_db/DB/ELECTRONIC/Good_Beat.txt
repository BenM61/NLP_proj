Depending on you see a thing
The ship is free, or is it sinking?
Depending on how you see it
You cage your mind, or you free it.
Depending on how you see the times
The world divides or it closely binds

But I just wanna hear a good beat
I jus wanna I jus wanna
But I just wanna hear a good beat
I jus wanna hear a good beat.
Oooahh

Depending on you see a thing
The ship is free, or is it sinking?
Depending on how you see it
The song is over or you keep it
Depending on how you see the times
We're wasting time or in a moving line

But I just wanna hear a good beat
Oh oh oh a
I jus wanna hear a good beat
Just piano and bass

Everything will be alright
When you feel it tonight
Zu zu zu wah zu wah
I just wanna hear a good beat
