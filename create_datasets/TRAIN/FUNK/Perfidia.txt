To you
My heart cries out "Perfidia"
For I find you, the love of my life 
In somebody else's arms

Your eyes are echoing "Perfidia"
Forgetful of the promise of love
You're sharing another's charms

With a sad lament my dreams are faded like a broken melody
While the gods of love look down and laugh 
At what romantic fools we mortals be

And now, I know* my love was not for you
And so I take it back with a sigh
Perfidious one, Goodbye

With a sad lament my dreams are faded like a broken melody
While the gods of love look down and laugh 
At what romantic fools we mortals be

And now, I know* my love was not for you
And so I take it back with a sigh
Perfidious one, goodbye
Goodbye
