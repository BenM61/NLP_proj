I don't want to say "I love you" 
That would give away too much. 
It's hip to be detached and precious, 
The only thing you feel is vicious. 

I don't want to say "I want you" 
Even though I want you so much. 
It's wrapped up in conversation, 
It's whispered in a hush. 

Though I'm frightened by the word, 
Think it's time I made it heard. 

No more empty self possession, 
Visions swept under the mat. 
It's no New Years resolution, 
It's more than that. 

Now I wake up happy 
Warm in lovers embrace. 
No one else can touch us 
While we're in this place. 

So I'll sing it to the world 
This simple message to my girl. 

No more empty self possession, 
Visions swept under the mat. 
It's no New Years resolution, 
It's more than that. 

Though I'm frightened by the word, 
Think it's time I made it heard. 

So I'll sing it to the world 
This simple message to my girl. 

No more empty self possession, 
Visions swept under the mat. 
It's no New Years resolution, 
It's more than that. 

Oh there's nothing quite as real 
As the touch of your sweet hands. 
I can't spend the rest of my life 
Buried in the sand
