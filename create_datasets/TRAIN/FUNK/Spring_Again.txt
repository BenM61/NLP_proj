It's Spring again
I can hear the birds sing again
See the flowers start to bud
See young people fall in love

Well, it's Spring again
Thunder showers, they are here again
An extra hour for me and you
To spend together

Pretty colours are everywhere
Mother Nature, she still cares

Well, it's Spring again
The grass is turning green again
The warm air feels so good
Summer's not too far away

Pretty colours, they are everywhere
Mother Nature, she still cares

I said it's Spring again
I can hear the birds sing again
See the flowers start to bud
And I see young people fall in love

I said it's Spring again
And the grass is turning green again
The warm air feels so good
Summer's not too far away

And I said it's Spring again
Time for us to do all the things again
That we love to do in Spring again
Uh-ah-hah, uh-ah-hah, uu-ah-hah

I said it's Spring again
Time to hear the birds sing again
See the flowers bud again
Uh-ah-hah

It's Spring again
Spring again, Spring again, Spring again
I said it's Spring again

Another hour for us, yeah
To do all the things we love
Walking through a park
Holding hands under the moonlight

And I said it's Spring again
Aahhh, I said it's Spring again
Don't it make you feel good
When you can take off your Winter clothes
