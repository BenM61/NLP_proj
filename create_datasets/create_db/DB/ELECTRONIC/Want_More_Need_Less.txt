I want to know fun and feeling
Before I die
I don't want to spend time with people
Who don't like me
I'd rather walk on by

And let them get on get on get on
With what they're doing
Just let them get on get on get on
With what they're doing

They'll want it more
They'll need it less
They'll want it more
They'll need it less

I want to be good and gracious
With my life
I don't want to see the strangers
Who surround me
And there's a reason why

They just go on and on and on
With what they're doing
They just go on and on and on
With what they're doing

They'll want it more
They'll need it less
They'll want it more
They'll need it less

They just go on and on and on and on
They just go on and on and on and on
They just go on and on and on
With what they're doing

I want it more
I need it less
I want it more
I need it less

I want it more
I need it less
I want it more
I need it less

I want it more
I need it less
I want it more
I need it less

I want fun and feeling
Let them get on get on get on get on
I want good and gracious
Let them get on get on get on get on
