Can you still see the dreams we shared so long ago?
Lost in the clouds of time, while we took time to grow
Can you still see the days we stayed and played ourselves?
In promises of gold for things we did not know

Forever young the dreams we share
Into the night we say a prayer
You are the hand inside my glove
We make our dream in the name of 

Love
Love is all we need
In the name of love
We fight, we cry, we pray
In the name of love

Do you believe that love has brought us back around?
Can you believe the time we've lost has now been found?
Will you believe that I'll take care of you right now?
Three words we used to say, no need to make a sound

Forever young the dreams we share
Into the night we say a prayer
You are the hand inside my glove
We make our dream in the name of

Love
Love is all we need
In the name of love
We fight, we cry, we pray
In the name of love

Will you believe me in my name?
We are so young, we have no shame
So we pray, in the name of

Love
Love is all we need
In the name of love
We fight, we cry, we pray
In the name of love

Love is all we need
In the name of love
We fight, we cry, we pray

In the name of love
