VAUGHN MONROE AND HIS ORCHESTRA
VOCAL BY VAUGHN MONROE
ORCHESTRA PLAYS THE SONG. THEN;
THIS ROAD LEADS TO RAINBOWVILLE,
GOING MY WAY?
UP AHEAD IS BLUEBIRD HILL,
GOING MY WAY?
JUST PACK A BASKET FULL OF WISHES
AND OFF YOU START,
WITH SUNDAY MORNING IN YOUR HEART.
ROUND THE BEND YOU'LL SEE A SIGN,
'DREAMER'S HIGHWAY'.
HAPPINESS IS DOWN THE LINE,
GOING MY WAY?
THE SMILES YOU GATHER WILL
LOOK WELL ON YOU,
OH I HOPE YOU'RE GOING MY WAY TOO.
