But I love you more than I ever love anyone
Baby
Ooh, oh oh ooh, oh ooh

He says the same things you used to say
He does the same things you used to do
(Sometimes I miss you)
Sometimes I find myself wishing he was you
'Cause I still miss you
Ooh, oh yeah

And I love you more than I ever love anyone
Ooh, ooh
Yes, I love you more than I ever love anyone

Thoughts of you still burn in my mind
Nut my new love takes all my time
(Even though I miss you)
With him, I can get away cheating yesterday
'Cause he makes me forget you sometimes
Ooh yeah

But I love you more than I ever love anyone
Ooh, ooh
Yes, I love you more than I ever love anyone
Whoa, oh

If you'll never left me lonely,
You still love me
But he satisfy max that hunger for you
Though I try not to love him
For feeling just groove, oh oh ooh

And I love you more than I ever love anyone
Ooh, ooh
Yes, I love you more than I ever love anyone
Yes' I love you more than I ever love anyone
Ooh (yes, I love you more)
I love you more (than I ever love)
Anyone (anyone)
Yes, I love you more (I love you more)
Than I ever love than anyone (anyone)
Yes, I love you more
