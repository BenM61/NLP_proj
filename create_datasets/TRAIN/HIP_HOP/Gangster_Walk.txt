It's ya boy, David Banner
I'ma see if I can bring the gangsta walk back
Memphis, Mississipi, everybody from the South
Let's walk!

Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch

Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch

We represent Memphis, 'Sippi
And I don't think y'all really wanna get wit me
We started gangsta walkin', nigga, now no MC Hammer
Just a really dealy, get you hyper than hype
No cut or no arm 'n' hammer

Slam a hater to the flo', stomp 'em all on in dat hole
Mean as hell on dat liquor, meaner than dat on that blow
So don't push me, motherfucker, push me motherfucker, push
I'm affiliated wit more terrorists than G Bush, bitch!

We got them niggaz gettin' wild, gettin' buck, havin' fist
Put a bottle in their hand, put a blunt to their lips
Gangsta walkin' in da club, err'body gon' piss
And da hoes on the corner workin' graveyard shift

Yeah, they call me the juice from that north north set
Where they rob for the folks and they divvy up the net
Ain't no talkin', f*ck some talkin', we gon' shoot 'em in they chest
If a coward wanna jump, it's gon' be a bloody mess, bitch!

Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker

Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch

Now we can get it buck in da club
With niggaz I suggest you tuck yo' chain
F*ck security, find out they can't do a thang
Out the frame pussy nigga, you too soft, push you off me
Stompin' hoes to the flo' and never scared to pop heat

Ah, hammer on your bird, on the chest, don't talk shit tonight
Ain't no thang to bust yo' head and start a fight
Like bitch, what's up now? North Mississippi in this bastard
F*ck around my nizzle and get your whole body plastered

I remember the wall trick, if you got some manner
Gangsta walk yo' ass over here pumpin' to Banner
Yeah! It'll be fabulous if you leave
'cause I'm tryin' to stomp your body till yo' ass can't breathe

Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch

Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch

Left foot, right foot, swingin' both from yo' fist
You better keep it movin' yo' weak ass might get hit
Kids don't count when you buck back too hard
Get ready to finish anything that you start

Straight from the mound, boys, better not clown
I got eighty-five niggaz wit me represent the town
Two hundred automatic Uzi's wit atomic armed clips
Make you boys take them paper pep poppers of your hip

Young pimp smoke weed, don't stoke, might sip
Four-fifths with a bunch of hollow tips in the whip
I'm pimp tight MGJ, you can look at my resume
Never been a trick, neva eva played

Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
Buck jump, motherfucker, buck jump, ya bitch

Gon' gangsta walk, gon' do it, motherfucker
