Verse 1
I don?t want tragedy to be the only 
Thing that leads me to your throne 
With every moment of my life 
With pain or joy I will cry 
You are God alone 
You?ve given me the choice to kneel or walk away 
I?ve struggled with surrender long enough to say 

I choose now 
To be humbled in your presence 
I choose now 
To fall on my face 
Cause one day 
Every knee will bow but Jesus 
I choose now. 

Verse 2
I have the scars I can?t deny from 
Thoughtless words and foolish times 
But you still forgave 
I wondered down a thousand roads 
Lost my way but you led me home 
Where I was safe 
I know heaven is a gift of your grace 
But until I see your face 

I choose now 
To be humbled in your presence 
I choose now 
To fall on my face 
Cause one day 
Every knee will bow but Jesus 
I choose 

Bridge
To glorify your name 
That?s why I was made 
To worship and obey 
I won?t wait

I choose now 
To be humbled in your presence 
I choose now 
To fall on my face 
Cause one day 
Every knee will bow but Jesus 
I choose now. 

I choose now
To be humble in Your presence
I choose now 
To fall on my face
Cause one day
Every knee will bow but Jesus
I choose now

Jesus I choose now.
