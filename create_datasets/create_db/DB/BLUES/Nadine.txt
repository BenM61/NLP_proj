As I got on a city bus and found my vacant seat
I thought, I saw my future bride strolling up the street
I shouted to the driver, "Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think, I see her, please let me off this bus"

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, baby where are you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you're up to something new

Well, I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walking toward a coffee colored Cadillac
Pushing through the crowd trying to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, darling where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new

Well, downtown searching for her, looking all around
I saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
Caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him, "Catch that yellow cab"

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, baby where are you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you've got something else to do

Well, downtown searching for her, looking all around
I saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
Caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty-dollar bill, told him, "Catch that yellow cab"

Nadine, baby is that you?
Oh, Nadine, darling where are you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you've got something else to do

Oh, Nadine, baby is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new

Well now, she moves around like a wayward summer breeze
Go, go driver catch upon me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted Cavalier
I'm leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

Nadine, baby is that you?
Oh, Nadine, where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new
