The world going by my window 
Doesn't mean nothing to me,
Why do I feel the way I do, 
Why am I still so lost in you,
I wonder

Watching you sleep each morning, 
Brushing the hair from your eyes,
Why do we give ourselves away, 
'Til only emptiness remains 

Was there a reason you came 
And changed my life 
'Cause it won't change back,
I'm trying to forget, but I can't act 
As if we never met

Oh, the world going by my window 
Doesn't mean nothing to me,
Why do I feel the way I do, darlin' 
I'm still so lost in you

Was there a reason you came 
And changed my life 
'Cause it won't change back,
I'm trying to forget, but I can't act 
As if we never met
