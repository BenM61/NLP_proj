Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered
You can still see the picture upon the wall
One eye staring at nothing at all
The other one trying to focus through all your tears
You can try and try but there's nothing to hide
You can't run from yourself and what's inside
You got to find the answers to the questions that you most fear

So over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside says tonight the truth will be told

You surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
Spending your time in all the wrong places
Putting your faith in things that only make you cry
People say they love you when they want to help
But how can they when you can't help yourself?
The more they say they love you, the more you just want to die
So here we go again, the self analysis
Have another glass of Port and uh, forget this
The band's playing at the club tonight and they're bound to groove

There you are, you think you're high
You can't ask yourself 'cause you'd only lie
If you had a dollar for every time you tried

You can't call nobody cause they'll tell you straight up
Come and make love when you really hate 'em
Relationships based on the physical are over and done
They're over and done (They're over and done)
You'd rather have fun
With only one, with only one
Only one, one (one)

And then it hit you like a fist on a wall
Who gave you life when there was none at all?
Who gave the sun permission to rise up everyday? (Ooh, oh yes)
Let me tell it (Go on)
If you ask God to love you longer
Every breath you take will make you stronger
Keeping you happy (happy) and proud to call His name (Go on and say it)
Jesus (Jesus)

And over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside said tonight the truth will be told
And this time I was listening, hear me

Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered (Yes we will)
If we don't then we'll never see the light (No)
If you die before you try
You'll have to come back and face the light (Oh yes)
When you believe it, you got a good reason to cry (Oh my, my)

So I went on down to the holy river
I called my girl and told her I had something to give her
I asked her to marry me and she said yes, I cried
Oh, that night I drowned in her tears and mine
And.. and instead of a glass of sorrow and wine
Looking back y'all, I don't miss nothing except the time
And when I see that picture upon the wall
The one eye staring at nothing at all
My eyes trying to focus but these are much different tears
Oh, yes they are
Let's go down to the holy river
