I'm a sweet, little love maker
Finding time, to make my words better (I)

Lately I
Not so present now
Not in love
For your constant fun

I've got time, but you're tired of waiting
You only want me in other spaces
Come fill your gaps with people
I know no one

So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more

You forgot
How we fell in love
I'm your sweet
Little love maker

You're younger than I am broken
I dance feelings like that sparkle
Summer conversations, not enough

So lonely trying to be yours
What a forsaken cause
So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more

(So lonely trying)
How does it feel to have me thinking about you?
Wishing the words were enough to consume you
So lonely trying to be yours
How does it feel to have me thinking about you?

So lonely trying to be yours
What a forsaken cause
So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more
