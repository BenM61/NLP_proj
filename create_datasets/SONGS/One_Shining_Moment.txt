Tell me who, what, when,
Where did it start? 
Tell me when, where
How did you get in my heart? 
I feel your love washing over me
In waves of emotion so strong
I want to say while I've got the chance
In the words of this song

You're my one shining moment
You are all my dreams come true
Honey, you're my one shining moment
And if I never have another
I'm glad that I've known you

You fill up for me all the empty spaces
All the pain I ever felt, you've erased it
Is it any wonder? no way
That I'm growing fonder every day
There's a freedom that I never knew
And it's all because of you, honey

You're my one shining moment
You are all my dreams come true
Honey, you're my one shining moment
And if I never have another
I'm glad that I've known you

I wake up with you on my mind
You light up my day
There is nothing better I can find
Oh, my love, I'm so proud
That I can say, hey
All my dreams wrapped
Into one under the sun, honey

Honey, you're my one shining moment
And if I never have another
I'm glad that I've known you
If I never have another
I'm glad that I've known you

Shining moment
