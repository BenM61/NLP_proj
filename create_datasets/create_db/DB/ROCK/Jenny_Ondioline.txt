Life on earth is a bloody
As in the city the public wears,
I think the brilliant cast for insane realities to come
And that's a decisive battle that we, haven't we lost

I don't care if the fascists have to win
I don't care democracy's being sucked
I don't care socialism's full of sin  (Or, I don't care socialism's collapsing)
The unbeatable system engenders rot
That what is exciting
Is a challenge as the new nation
But the tensions have to be creative with some time

The innocent suffer from the transformation in the (their)country
They balance asylum...down and they run you
Obviously once more it could be culture
I bet a lot oh don't you get to

I don't care if the fascists have to win
I don't care democracy's being sucked
I don't care socialism's collapsing
The indubitable the system is so corrupt  
(This sounds like immutable on the album version)
That what is exciting
Is a challenge as the new nation
But the tensions happy but 
(That the tensions happy but creative are so tight)

Life on earth is a bloody,
In place of the,
The horrors of the war are keeping me free to,
It was like taking candy from a baby.
