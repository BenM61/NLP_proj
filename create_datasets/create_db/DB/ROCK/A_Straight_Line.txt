Yeah we're just watching history
Now that the dogs are barking
Take a picture for your children
Make it real in FujiColor
Life in the junkyard's hard
Even when the dogs are sleeping
But if you win you lose the next spin
Madame, monsieur's, rien ne va plus

I watch the black and white bleeding
Don't you know the pain I'm in
I've been working all week
I've been thinking on my feet
And I've come to the end of my losing streak

Take a straight line
Take a straight line
Take a straight line
Take a straight line

Wave goodbye to your innocence
Sell it to the highest bidder
In a tight spot call for assistance
Is that American Express?
Get me out of here

I watch the black and white bleeding
Don't you know the pain I'm in
I've been working all week
I've been thinking on my feet
And I've come to the end of my losing streak

Take a straight line
Take a straight line
Take a straight line
Take a straight line

I'm up the top, looking down
Everybody looks just like ants
It would be so easy
