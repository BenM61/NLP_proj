Let's come on and get together
Like the sky gets to the sea
Just taking some time on
Let's come on and make it better
Let's make everybody see
Just taking some time on
For those who feel inclined
To talk about the hideen feelings of their mind
Let's come on and get together
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky with the sea
Like the sky with the sea
Just taking some time on

Let's come on and tell the story
Of the way it used to be
Just taking some time on
Let's come on and sing a song now
Of the days when we were free
Just taking some time on
For those who feel inclined
To talk about the hideen feelings of their mind
Let's come on and get together
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky with the sea
Like the sky with the sea
Just taking some time on

Let's come on the feeling's right now
We want everyone to be
Just taking some time on
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky gets to the sea
Just taking some time on
For those who feel inclined
To talk about the hideen feelings of their mind
Let's come on and get together
Let's come on and get together
Like the sky with the sea
Like the sky with the sea
Just taking some time on
