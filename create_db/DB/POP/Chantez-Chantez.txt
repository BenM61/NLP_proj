Tell me that it's true, Tell me you agree,
I was meant for you, You were meant for me.

Dearly beloved, how clearly I see,
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me,
Angel eyes knew you, angel voices led me to you;
Nothing could save me, fate gave me a sign;
I know that I'll be yours come shower or shine;
So I say merely, dearly beloved be mine.
