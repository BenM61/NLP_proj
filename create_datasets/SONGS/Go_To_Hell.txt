Ya told me that ya wanted it
I knew it wasn't true
Turned out to be the truth, babe
You know what you can do

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
Goodbye for you

Wrapped around your little finger
Under your thumb too
You know that I'm a singer
I'm singin' just for you

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
So much for you

Hope ya got my little message
I hope you hear me
I thought ya might've been the answer
Obviously crazy

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
Until your face is blue

I guess I betta get movin'
Lotta things I gotta do
I realize it was a waste of time
Talkin' sense to you

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
Poison not me
