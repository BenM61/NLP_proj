In light just bleed, Angelica
Don't say the lights would not change cause I've seen the gray
Our lives, untouchable
When you see your epic is all in flames

Such coy and winsome lies
Aloft she cries, so high
Thick lovers carry on a passive song
The angel lilts in vain

"We are the ill-advised," she said through a disguise
Fancy and short

Fall asleep with all the things you said to me
Running out of time

I'm not crawling

So hide behind what's weak and point the freaks
To a place that lights your name
So here's some alcohol to shake the fall
A drink that frames the need

And if you run for fame and hold such disdain
Everlong

So walk along the lines
And what you know is everything you had in store
And what you thought that you'd adore

You can't hold all you left behind

In light just bleed, Angelica
Don't say the lights could not change cause I've seen the gray
Our lives, untouchable
When you see your epic is all in vain

The spotlight burns inside of me
Cause Bravery is holding my two hands so high in the air
With each breath Angelica sighs
