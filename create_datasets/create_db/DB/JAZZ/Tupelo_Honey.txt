You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail right around the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee

You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor bent on chivalry
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee

You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't stop us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor intent on chivalry
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee

You know he's alright
You know he's alright with me
He's alright, he's alright (he's an angel)

You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail it right around the seven oceans
Drop it smack dab in the middle of the deep blue sea
Because he's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee

He's as sweet as tupelo honey
He's an angel of the first degree
He's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like the honey, baby, from the bee
He's my baby, you know he's alright
