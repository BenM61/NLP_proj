You make me wanna throw my pager out the window 
Tell MCI to cut the phone calls 
Break my lease so I can move 
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo 
I wanna put your number on the call block 
Have AOL make my email stop 
Cause you a bug a boo 
You buggin' what? You buggin' who? You buggin' me! 
And don't you see it ain't cool 

It's not hot that you be callin' me 
Stressin' me pagin' my beeper 
You're just non-stop 
And it's not hot 
That you be leavin' me messages 
Every 10 minutes and then you stop by 
When I first met you, you were cool 
But it was game you had me fooled 
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number 
You already had my mailbox full 

(So what you bought a pair of shoes) 
(What now I guess you think I owe you) 
(You don't have to call as much as you do) 
(I'd give em back to be through with you) 
(And so what my momma likes you) 
(What now I guess you think I will too) 
(Even if the pope he said he liked you too) 
I don't really care cause you're a bug a boo 

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window 
Tell MCI to cut the phone calls 
Break my lease so I can move 
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo 
I wanna put your number on the call block 
Have AOL make my email stop 
'Cause you a bug a boo 
You buggin' what? You buggin' who? You buggin' me! 
And don't you see it ain't cool

It's not hot 
That when I'm blockin' your phone number 
You call me from over your best friends house 
And it's not hot
That I can't even go out with my girlfriends 
Without you trackin' me down 
You need to chill out with that mess 
'Cause you can't keep havin' me stressed 
'Cause every time my phone rings it seems to be you 
And I'm prayin' that it is someone else 

(So what you bought a pair of shoes) 
(What now I guess you think I owe you) 
(You don't have to call as much as you do) 
(I'd give em back to be through with you) 
(And so what my momma likes you) 
(What now I guess you think I will too) 
(Even if the pope he said he liked you too) 
I don't give a damn 'cause you're a bug a boo

When you call me on the phone you're buggin' me 
When you follow me around you're buggin' me 
Everything you do be buggin' me 
You buggin' me, you buggin' me 
When you show up at my door you buggin' me 
When you open up your mouth you buggin' me 
Every time i see your face you're buggin' me 
You're buggin' me, you're buggin' me
