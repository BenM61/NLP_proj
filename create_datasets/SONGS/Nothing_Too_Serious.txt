Twenty story buildings coming down on me
Mountain ranges sliding into the sea
Rivers of blood, running red
I got a broken heart and a broken head

I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place, take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We could do it again some other day
Nothing too serious

Well, I shook myself and I fell out of bed
I can't remember a thing, oh, was it something I said
Well, I don't know my name and I don't know my place
There's a crack in the mirror, cracking my face

(Baby is blue) she had a heavy night
(Baby is blue) she's gonna be alright
(Baby is blue) she'll never the same
You better take her home

I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place, take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We could do it again some other day
Nothing too serious
