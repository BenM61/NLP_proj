I cannot sleep tonight, I have you on my mind,
Even the wind is calling your name,
Though you are far away, I feel that you are near,
Whispering words from over the sea,
And if you wake in your night, remember that I will be here;

And like the same sun that's rising on the valley with the dawn,
I will walk with your shadow and keep you warm,
And like the same moon that's shining through my window here tonight,
I will watch in your darkness, and bring you safely to the morning light;

Where there is love like this, forever, for all time,
I will be there wherever you are,
And where there are hearts that live together in one soul,
Nothing on earth will keep us apart,
And if you're crying inside, remember that I will be here;

And like the same sun that's rising on the valley with the dawn,
I will walk with your shadow and keep you warm,
And like the same moon that's shining through my window here tonight,
I will watch in your darkness, and bring you safely to the morning light,
I love you, I love you, I love you;

And if you're crying inside, remember that I will be here;
And like the same sun that's rising on the valley with the dawn,
I will walk with your shadow and keep you warm,
And like the same moon that's shining through my window here tonight,
I will watch in your darkness, and bring you safely to the morning light;

Same sun, same moon,
Same sun, same moon,
Same soul, same heart,
Same world, same stars, you will be forever in my world;

Same sun, same moon,
Same sun, same moon,
Same soul, same heart, oh, I love, I love you, I love you,
Same world, same stars, you will be forever in my heart.
