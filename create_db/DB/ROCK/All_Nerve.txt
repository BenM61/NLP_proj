I wanna see you
Especially you
You don't know how much I miss you
I may be high, I may hide and run out at you
You don't know how much I miss you

I won't stop
I'll run you down
I won't stop
I will run you down
I'm all nerve
I'm all nerve

I hit the hall (oh God)
Oh god, I hit them all
You don't know how far I'd go
I may hide and jump out at you
You don't know how far I'd go

I won't stop
I won't stop
I will run you down
I'm all nerve
I'm all nerve
