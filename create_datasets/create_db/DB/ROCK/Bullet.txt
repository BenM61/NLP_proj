While I'm away
You can let the mouse go down on you
Let the mouse do what I'd do
If I was there
But you'd better explain
That I have a vendetta in my narrow bones
And a vindictive eye
Of my jealousy I have no control
No control

I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind
I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind
How can I get your bullet out of my head now
I have no control
But I try
Yeah I try

I'd better explain that I have a
Red vendetta in my narrow bones
And a wicked indicative eye
Of my yellow jealousy I have no control
No control
No control

I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind
I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind

Get out of my head
Get out of my head now
Get out of my head
Get out of my head now
Get out of my head
Get out of my head now
Get out of my mind
