I'm a thousand miles away from home, sleeping in the rain
A thousand miles away from home, waiting for a train

Nobody seems to want me or give me a helping hand
I nevermore will roam again if I ever get home again

Nobody seems to want me or give me a helping hand
I nevermore will roam again if I ever get home again
