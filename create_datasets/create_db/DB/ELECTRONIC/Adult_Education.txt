Adult, adult, adult education

Afternoon in the homeroom, they're about to let you go
And the locker slam on the plan you had tonight
You've been messing around with your boyfriend, maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And the long halls and the gray walls are gonna split apart
Believe it or not there's life after high school
And that's why

The student body's got a bad reputation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
go back to school, it's a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult education
Oh yeah

The teacher don't know about how to deal with the student body
And the underclassmen are flashing hot and cool
but your girlfriends care about the watch you wear and talkin' about it
Believe it or not there's life after high school
That's why

The student body's got a bad reputation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
go back to school, it's a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult education
Oh yeah

They're calling it a preparation
You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but a number, number
Memories that you won't remember

So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it will rub off on you

The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

The senior with the junior Miss
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Adult education, adult education
Adult education, is a bad situation
Adult education

the high point of high school is getting out there
the low point of high school is what you wear, oh

(Adult, adult, adult educate, educate, education
Adult, adult)
