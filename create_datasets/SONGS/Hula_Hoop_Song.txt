
Hula hoop, hula hoop
Anyone can play the hula hoop
Hula hoop, hula hoop
Anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten

(Hula, hula, hula)

From LA to New York, from Georgia to Duluth (Hula hoop)
Everyone is playing with the hula hoop (Hula hoop)
A-red ones and the green ones, yellow, white, and blue (Hula hoop)
Young and old, rich or poor, are spinning them too

(Hula, hula, hula)

Hula hoop, hula hoop
Everyone is playing with the hula hoop
Look at them spin, tryin' to win
Anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten

(Hula, hula, hula)

Oh, what fun to see them run
And to see them sway (Hula hoop)
Trying to keep the hula hoop
From, ah, slippin' away (Hula hoop)

Now if they rock when they should sway,
It would fall to the ground (Hula hoop)
Then again, once again
The hoop spins around and 'round

(Hula, hula, hula)

Hula hoop, hula hoop
Everyone is playing with the hula hoop
Look at them spin, tryin' to win
Anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten

(Hula, hula, hula)

moon and stars have hula hoops
way up in the sky
there goes venus with a hoop
sailing on by
tots and teens and in-betweens
grandma and grampa too
family fun for everyone
spinning a hoop

Hula hoop, hula hoop
Everyone is playing with the hula hoop
Look at them spin, tryin' to win
Anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten
