Feels so good
When you slip and do it
Feels so good
When you slip and do it

Girl, don't you blame me for what I'm doin'
It's your man, he won't leave me alone
Now if you were takin' care of you J-O-B
I wouldn't be wreckin' your happy home
I know it means
A doggone lot to you
But hey, now baby
Don't you know I dig him too, oh

And it feels so good
When you slip and do it
And if I can satisfy his needs
More power to it

Now I don't mind bein' the other woman
'Cause he runs to me when trouble brings him to his troubled knees
I know he gives you most of his money
But it's me he tries twice as hard to please

The more you chastise him
The more that you're helpin' me
And I'm gonna get his love
Just you wait and see
I said just you wait and see, oh

And it feels so good
When you slip and do it
And if I can satisfy his needs
More power to it

It just feels so good, yeah
When you slip and do it
And if I could satisfy his needs
More power to it

Now I never meant for it to go on so long
But girl, he just keeps on thrillin' me
He rides me in his car even though we can't go far
'Cause he cares enough to be discreet

Although he makes no promises to stay
All I want from him is lovin' each and every day
Said lovin' each and every day, ow

And it feels so good, mmm
When you slip and do it
And if I can satisfy his needs
More power to it

It just feels so good, yes, it does
When you slip and do it
So if I can satisfy his needs
More power to it

I don't want his money
What I want is his honey
'Cause it feels so good
Oh, it feels so good, yeah

I said it feels so good
When you slip and do it
Just feels so good
When you slip and do it

Oh, it feels so good, yeah
Oh, good now
Just feels so good
Oh, it feels so good, yeah

When you slip and do it
When you slip and do it
You ought to try one time, girl
There ain't nothin' to it

Just feels so good
Oh, yes, it does
Just feels so good, oh, yeah
Said it feels good, it's all good
