Well you can bump and grind
And it's good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out

But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, no, no!

Well you can terraplane
In the fallin' rain
I drive a Rolls Royce
Cause it's good for my voice

But you won't fool the children of the revolution...
