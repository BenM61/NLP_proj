Steppin' out of my mind rejuvenating
It's time to unwind, no more waiting
Steppin' out of my mind rejuvenating
It's time to unwind, no more waiting

Tonight's the soundtrack to my soul
I've left the drama of day behind
Let the rhythm break the mold
And this is the soundtrack to my soul

Steppin' out of my mind rejuvenating
It's time to unwind, no more waiting
Steppin' out of my mind rejuvenating
It's time to unwind, no more waiting

Make me crazy and make me move
It's burning up inside the groove
Deep within, feel it pull
That's the soundtrack to your soul

Steppin' out of my mind
Steppin' out of my mind
It's time to unwind

Steppin' out of my mind rejuvenating
It's time to unwind, no more waiting
Steppin' out of my mind rejuvenating
It's time to unwind, no more waiting
