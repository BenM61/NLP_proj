Speed along the highway, honey I want it my way
But listen to her daddy's song, don't stay out to long
Were just busy hidin', sitting the back seat of my car
(Looking for a ride and all about)
(Looking for a ride in and out of town)
(Strolling around and all about)
(Looking for a ride in and out of)

The laser lights are pretty
We may end up in Mexico city
But listen to her daddy's song
Making love is wrong
Ooh, we're just busy riding
Sitting in the back seat of my car

Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh

For we was only hiding
Sitting in the back seat of my car, yeah
And when we finished driving
We can say we were late in arriving
And listen to her daddy's song
We believe that we can't be wrong, yeah

Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
We can make it to Mexico city
Sitting in the back seat of my car, oh oh

Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong

Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oh oh, we believe that we can't be wrong

No, no, no
We believe we can't be wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh, oh oh, yeah, oh, yeah
