I'm all alone and fancy free
But that ain't the way I wanna be
Now girls get your game up tight
Were gonna have a wing, ding doodle tonight
But right now

I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
(howl)

Tonight the skys the limit
I got some money and I wanna spend it
Its Saturday night and I wanna play
I'm gonna groove til the break of day
Now look a here

Im looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
(howl)

Got a brand new pin stripe suit of clothes
Big wide polka-dot tie
Cuff links as big as j-bird eggs
And look at that shoes made out of alligator hide
Well say something else here
I'm ripe and ready and hot to trot
(boy you on fire)
Girl you can get everything I got
(hell take it too)
I got got the money if got the time
(we open all night)
All you gotta do is gimme a sign
Lookee hear

I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
(howl)

I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
(howl)

I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
(howl)

You know something mac? you can sing man

Lookin' for a fox
Lookin' for a fox (I'm on fire)
Lookin' for a fox (call out the dogs)
Lookin' for a fox (I hope you find one)
