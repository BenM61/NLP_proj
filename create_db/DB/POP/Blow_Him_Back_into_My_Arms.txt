Am I supposed to let it go?
It's been dark and empty since I don't know
On my way downstairs I turned back, home
I didn't dare leaving the telephone

I pray the rain won't fall
Oh lord don't let it fall

Keep my brother safe from harm
I pray the wind will blow
Oh lord just let it blow
Blow him back into my arms

Your mother called me up, said your car was found
It was parked unlocked, but you weren't around
She was crying saying that there's still hope
I said, yeah for sure, but lord, I felt none

At night when there's a sound on my windowpane
I just can't go back to sleep again
Still half dreaming a tought that's you
Returning without a clue of what you put me through
