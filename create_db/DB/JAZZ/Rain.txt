Rain falling from the skies
Like lonely tears through misty eyes
Rain streaming down my face
Brings memories my heart cannot erase

Here alone in all my sorrows
Waiting for the clouds to hurry by
Praying that a new tomorrow
Will put the sun back in the sky

Rain wash away my tears
So when that sun appears
I'll see my love again

Here alone in all my sorrows
Waiting for the clouds to hurry by
Praying that a new tomorrow
Will put the sun back in the sky

Please, rain wash away my tears
So when that sun appears
I'll see my love again
