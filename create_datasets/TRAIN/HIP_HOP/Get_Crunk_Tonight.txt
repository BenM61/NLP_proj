Girl you know I meant to call you that night
Don't talk about that
I'm callin' you now 
I'm feeling horny
And I want you so bad
I'm picturing that
I'm seeing your mouth
I remember what you said you'd do wit yo lips
Said you know all types of tricks
Are you ready for a taste of this
Yeah I hope so
I'm ready to be exposed
To every single little detail that you told me

Yeah I know that you talk a good game
But tonight you'll say my name
I wanna kiss you on your private spot
And I hope you'll do the same
And when I'm done
Don't be telling your friends
Our relationship will end
So keep it on the low
I wanna do ya slow for sho
You're not my girl
 So keep your mouth closed

I've been hearin' that you're freaky
And you've been tryin'
To get at me
Come over have a drink
Cause I wanna get crunk tonight
Leave all your worries at the front door
Oh don't be scared get what you came for
I ain't trying to play around
I just wanna get done tonight

How long it's gonna take for you
To get here
It shouldn't be long
You said you lived near
I'm looking forward to this
Late meeting
Massaging your skin
Then breaking you in
I remember what you said about the tub
Yeah, you know I filled it up
I wanna cut it up in the suds, yeah
Let's get to it
Stop frontin let's just do it
I'm tired of all your talking girl it's time to prove it

Yeah I know that you talk a good game
But tonight you'll say my name
I wanna kiss you on your private spot
And I hope you'll do the same
And when I'm done
Don't be telling your friends
Our relationship will end
So keep it on the low
I wanna do ya slow for sho
You're not my girl
So keep your mouth closed

I've been hearin' that you're freaky
And you've been tryin
To get at me
Come over have a drink
Cause I wanna get crunk tonight
Leave all your worries at the front door
Oh don't be scared get what you came for
I ain't trying to play around
I just wanna get done tonight

Let me see ya nod nod nod your head
When you get in my bed bed bed bed bed
Just go below the sheets
So satisfying
And I'm gonna moan for you in harmony
Then I'm gonna kiss kiss kiss your lips
The ones below you hips hips hips hips hips
And then you're gonna moan for me
In ecstasy
