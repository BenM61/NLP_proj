Can't take my back is ill tack what I know sky is the limit
But this world is full of envy hold me back I've been done it
Shit what you thought see-Bo wasn't down
It's just hella hard to get up when the hoe get to the ground
Get cha realla can't take it so they gave me a case
I got skills but I can't make it being Enemy of the State
I close my eyes pray to GOD guess this will remember me
Just like 'Pac "Against the World" but it's the world against me
Scared to see me in much you wills flossin a whip
Tossing a your bitch you slip we hit now we tossing a clips
Bossing and shit next thing I'm bubling and cavi

All the dubs on my navi holla at me shit fans want to see me in action
Heard they mac what they make in a year I pay in taxes
I'ma ball like the Jackson's and I won't stop till my casket
Or I hurta them bastards

They thought it was over but it just started
And some of the hardest artists in the world
Freedom of speech got me preaching to every G on the street
We got to eat so f*ck the P.D. three striking me
Not liking me want to strike me like Rodney King
But I am a home run hitter so I swing batter batter swing
Got to scheme to get away and I'm gonna scream yes yes y'all
As I put the beam to his fuckin face and a new case is a hurt ya
As I point the seven inch flame in about the HK
Hit the gas and get further
And hit the white boy in the head wit a birck and started dancin
F*ck parole and Pete Wilson I'm so fresh out the pen hoe holdin heat
Like Billy the Kid quick to split a nigga's wig I'm the type of nigga pop you
out till you lend me a cape

See me in traffic grab your automatic and bust bitch you violated my freedom

F*ck parloe f*ck prison f*ck those that don't want to listen
