Dear friend, there's a story goin' 'round
That says you're gonna be married soon
But you've been sayin' that for years
There can be no wedding without a groom

You said, he went away
To make a place for you and Him
Oh, you know He's gonna come back
But you just don't know when

Dear friends, He is not slow in keeping His promises
As some understand slowness to be
Keep a watch out, don't lose faith, He said, He would come for you
He's gonna come for you, you wait and see, just wait and see

Dear friend, people joke
They laugh and they make fun
When they hear talkin' all about
The groom who's gonna come

He's been gone a long, long time
Are there any doubts to confess?
Do you wonder if you will
Ever wear that wedding dress?

As some understand slowness to be

He's gonna come for you, you wait and see
