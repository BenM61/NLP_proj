Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Make me shine just a little bit, just a little bit
It's in my mind just a little bit, just a little bit
Keep me high, baby just a little bit, just a little bit
Can we spend some time?
(Can we spend some time?)

Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Just a touch of love, just a touch of love
Just a touch of love, just a touch of
Just a touch of love, just a touch of love
Just a touch of love, just a touch of

Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Need it now just a little bit, just a little bit
Send fire through my spine just a little bit
Just a little bit

Just a little touch of love is what I need
Your love for me vice versa you'll see
Can I spend a day or two with you
So we can chill for one second rendezvous

I don't wanna rush you, let's take it slow
So we can get to know, so that we can grow
Relax by the fire with a bottle of wine
Yeah, let it flow with time

Just a touch of love, just a touch of love
Just a touch of love, just a touch of
Just a touch of love, just a touch of love
Just a touch of love, just a touch of

Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Make me shine just a little bit, just a little bit
It's in my mind just a little bit, just a little bit

Just a little touch of love is what I need
Your love for me, vice versa you'll see
Can I spend a day or two with you
So we can chill for one second rendezvous

I don't wanna rush you, let's take it slow
So we can get to know, so that we can grow
Relax by the fire with a bottle of wine
Yeah, let it flow with time

Just a little touch of love is what I need
Your love for me, vice versa you'll see
Can I spend a day or two with you
So we can chill for one second rendezvous

I don't wanna rush you, let's take it slow
So we can get to know, so that we can grow
Relax by the fire with a bottle of wine
Yeah, and once again it will flow with time

Can we spend some time?

Just a little touch of love is what I need
Your love for me, vice versa you'll see
Can I spend a day or two with you
So we can chill for one second rendezvous

I don't wanna rush you, let's take it slow
So we can get to know, so that we can grow
Relax by the fire with me girl
Yeah, and it will be our world

Can we spend some time?

Can can
Can can
Can can

Can we spend some time?
