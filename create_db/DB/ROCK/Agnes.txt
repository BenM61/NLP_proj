We were standing on the corner one night
Me and Agnes
She had these tight jeans on
And these high shoes
Bad

It was a warm September night
Wind was blowin' through the trees
This dude Louie was looking for a fight

He knocked me down with all his might

He put a gun up to my head
Stay away from her or you'll be dead
Don't you ever see that girl he said

Agnes was a waitress at our bar
Louie said she'd never go too far
Louie didn't see her in my car
Louie didn't see her in my car
After that fight at Louie's bar

Yeah Agnes 
Caused you all this sadness
(He didn't know that you were out of your mind)
What you did was madness
(He didn't know it was the end of the line)
Someday we're gonna pay
(He had it coming to him)
We gotta watch out
(Watch out)
There's been talk about
(I didn't know that you were out of your mind)
Soon they're gonna find out
(I didn't know it was the end of the line)
What we did that day
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

She got off work at 2 o'clock
We drove away so we could talk
We didn't see Louie in the dark

Louie pulled me out onto the ground
Then I saw Louie start to run
He didn't know she had his gun
(He didn't know she had his gun)
I didn't know she had his gun

Oh-oh Agnes
He caused you all this sadness
(He didn't know that you were out of your mind)
It was madness
(He didn't know it was the end of the line)
We're gonna pay
(He had it coming to him)
Oh oh we have to watch out
(Watch out)
You know there's been alotta talk about
(I didn't know that you were out of your mind)
Someday soon they're gonna find out
(I didn't know it was the end of the line)
You better never look back
(He had it coming to him)
Baby don't look back
We got to run now
Baby throw away the gun now
(He didn't know that you were out of your mind)
Baby baby baby it's tough now
Someday we're gonna pay
