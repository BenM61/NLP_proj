Well, the fields belong to the farmers
And the forests belong to the king
These days our pleasures are all behind fences
We have to pay for everything

So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free

Well, the cities are teeming with people
And the highway is jammed up with cars
And the airport is a nightmare in season
But you don't have to go that far

Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free

Well, they take all the flags down in the evening
And the soldiers stand guard at the keep
But the beaches are always open
'cause the ocean, she never sleeps

So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free

So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
