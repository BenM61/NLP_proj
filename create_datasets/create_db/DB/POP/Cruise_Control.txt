It's been a long time coming, this feeling I've got
That things'll always go your way, such a long shot
Been so deep in the hole, never thought i'd come out
Anything can happen, I know that now

One slip, one fall
A turn of the head can change it all
A step ahead, a step behind
A blink of an eye at the wrong time

North, South, East and West
Spin the wheel and hope for the best
No regrets and it's on we roll
Put it in drive and set the cruise control

Walk tall and away you go
Wheels roll and the whistle will blow
Many miles oh I may roam
Put it in drive and set the cruise control

He was holding on, he trusted me, then he slipped away
He fell hard and now I've just got myself to blame
When he smiled at me finally I came around
you can't worry, you never know so don't beat yourself down

One slip, one fall
A turn of the head can change it all
A step ahead, a step behind
A blink of an eye at the wrong time

North, South, East and West
Spin the wheel and hope for the best
No regrets and it's on we roll
Put it in drive and set the cruise control

Walk tall and away you go
Wheels roll and the whistle will blow
Many miles oh I may roam
Put it in drive and set the cruise control

In my darkest hour, my longest day
Oh my mind was a prison
I could feel it taking me down to stay
Then I said "Forget this", it's out of your hands anyway

North, South, East and West
Spin the wheel and hope for the best
Many miles oh I may roam
Put it in drive and set the cruise control

Wheels roll and the whistle will blow
Walk tall and away you go
No regrets and it's on we roll
Put it in drive and set the cruise control

Put it in drive and set the cruise control
Oh where I go I'll go I just don't know
Pick myself up and roll, roll
Up ahead can't see it all
Take it slow, let the cards fall
