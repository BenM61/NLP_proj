Love shine a light in every corner of my heart 
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry 
Light up the magic in every little part let our love 
Shine a light in every corner of our hearts 

Love shine a light in every corner of my dream 
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry 
Like the mighty river flowing from the stream 
Let our love shine a light in every comer of our dreams 

[Chorus:] 
And we're all gonna shine a light together 
All shine a light to light the way 
Brothers and sisters in every little part 
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts 

Love shine a light in every corner of the world 
Let the love light carry let the love light carry 
Light up the magic for every boy and girl 
Let our love shine a light in every corner of the world 

[Chorus] 
And we're all gonna shine a light together 
All shine a light to light the way 
Brothers and sisters in every little part 
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts
