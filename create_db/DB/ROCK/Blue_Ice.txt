It hurts when I breathe
It hurts when I speak
You want everything I own
Everything you wanted

I keep running away, running away, running away
You keep fading away, fading away, fading away

It always ends in the same way
The sun gets in your eyes
I won't be surprised that next time

These blue eyes came out of the blue
Out of the blue, blue, blue

It never gets old
It never changes
Does it
Airport to city
The moment is breaking my promise
So I keep drifting away, drifting away, drifting away
And you keep fading away, fading away, fading away
It always ends the same way
The sun gets in your eyes
I won't be surprised the next time

But these blue eyes came out of the blue
Blue, blue, blue

It hurts when I breath
It hurts when I speak
Still want it
Everything I own
Everything you wanted

I keep running away, running away, running away
You keep fading away, fading away, fading away

It always ends the same way
The sun gets in your eyes
I won't be surprised the next time

But these blue eyes
It always ends in the same way
The sun gets in your eyes

But these blue eyes came out of the blue

Out of the blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
