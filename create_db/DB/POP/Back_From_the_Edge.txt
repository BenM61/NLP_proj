Back from the edge, back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start, back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Oh, he would reach for the stars, yeah

You can take my home, you can take my clothes
You can take the drugs I have that nobody knows
You can take my watch, you can take my phone
You can take all I've got 'til I'm skin and bone
I don't want control, I can dig my own hole
I can make my bed and I can lie in it cold

'Cause I don't need heat, I've been burnin' in hell
But now I'm back with my own story to tell

Back from the edge, back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start, back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Back from the edge, back from the dead
Back from the tears that were too easily shed
Back to the start, back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Oh, who would reach for the stars, yeah

They don't like my lines, they don't like my songs
Except in karaoke when they're singing along
Did you see them build me up? Well I just tear myself down
With a smile on my face, I dug my grave in the ground
We all make mistakes, we're so quick to judge
It's hard to forgive when we hold onto a grudge

So turn down the heat, I've been burnin' in hell
But now I'm back with my own story to tell

Back from the edge, back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start, back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Back from the edge, back from the dead
Back from the tears that were too easily shed
Back to the start, back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Who would reach for the stars

I don't want control, I can dig my own hole
I can make my bed and I can lie in it cold
'Cause I don't need heat, I've been burnin' in hell
But now I'm back with my own story to tell

Back from the edge, back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start, back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Back from the edge, back from the dead
Back from the tears that were too easily shed
Back to the start, back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Who would reach for the stars
