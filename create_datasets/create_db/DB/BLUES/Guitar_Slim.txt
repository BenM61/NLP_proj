Now they call me Guitar Slim, baby
Now I'm come to play in your town
Now they call me Guitar Slim, baby
Now I'm come to play in your town

Now if you don't like my music
Baby, I will not hang around

I like my pocket full of money, baby
And my whiskey, gin and wine
I like my pocket full of money, baby
And my whiskey, gin and wine

I like to eat a country dinner, baby
And I like to get my loving all the time

Now they call me Guitar Slim, baby
Now I'm come to play in your town
Now they call me Guitar Slim, baby
Now I'm come to play in your town

Now if I can't my guitar, baby
