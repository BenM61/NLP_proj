Pretty little girl on the side of the road
Yellow hair in a yellow bow
Little thumb sticking in the exit lane
Two packs of smokes and a candy cane

With women hips and baby lips
A hallelujah book in the back of a pillow-slip
If she gets out of here too soon
She'll run fast by the shy of the moon

If she's been havin' the same old dreams
Of lullabies and pale blue skies
Fallen asleep beneath the stars
Orion aims and shoots his arrows oh so far

Aims 'em hard
He shoots the moon and takes her as his own reward
If she's gonna see those stars too soon
She'll run fast by the shy of the moon

If she found out so long ago
That she wants more than all she knows
The river ends right as she goes
Water breaks and she's gone down in the undertow

She's below, but i'll stand tall and hold up high my mistletoe
She's gonna shine just like brand new
She'll take my hand and we'll run by the shy of the moon
