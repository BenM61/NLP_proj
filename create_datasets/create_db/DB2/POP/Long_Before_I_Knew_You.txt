Long before I knew you
Long before I met you
I was sure I'd find you someday, somehow

I pictured someone who'd walk and talk
And smile as you do
And make me feel as you do right now

All that was long before I held you
Long before I kissed you
Long before I touched you and felt this glow

But now you really are here
And now at last I know
That long before I knew you I loved you so
