Baby's on the lamb tonight
Her skies all full of stars
And love's just something that always goes wrong
That looks and smokes like Ava Gardner

Baby's gonna blow your lights
Adjust your back - lit charm
And if she deems to touch your heart
You can tune into your senses

Baby's coming alive to her wild side
She can burn down the lie to the dream

Baby trades you blow for blow
Crowns you like a queen
But if you stroke her long enough
Baby turns to cream

Baby's neptune's in your moon
Venus in your third
She's in bloom from June through June
Says, "love's no noun. love's a reverb"

Baby's coming alive to her wild side
She can burn down the lie to the dream
