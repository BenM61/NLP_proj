There's only one way to my galaxy
Hop on your moon soon
Don't separate from me
Your feet won't touch the ground
'Cause there's no gravity
Experiencing my trilogy

It seems like you're ready to go
Got your bags packed up
And your mind is set on touching the stars
Can't you tell I'm ready to leave?
So I can meet you wherever you are, baby

Something 'bout the sky
Something 'bout tonight
Something 'bout the way you look
Something 'bout your eyes
Something 'bout that flight
That makes me wanna ride in outer space with you all night

There's only one way to my galaxy
Hop on your moon soon
Don't separate from me
Your feet won't touch the ground
'Cause there's no gravity
Experiencing my trilogy

We can start the countdown now
Got my rockets turned on
So we can blast off straight to the moon
You can take that Jacob off
'Cause we won't be coming back no time soon, oh no, we won't

Something 'bout the sky
Something 'bout tonight
Something 'bout the way you look
Something 'bout your eyes
Something 'bout that flight
That makes me wanna ride in outer space with you all night

There's only one way to my galaxy
Hop on your moon soon
Don't separate from me
Your feet won't touch the ground
'Cause there's no gravity
Experiencing my

We can reach the sun by dawn
Feel the heat that's pulling on me
NASA should call off the search
?Cause the Earth has nothing for me

There's only one way to my galaxy
Hop on your moon soon
Don't separate from me
Your feet won't touch the ground
'Cause there's no gravity
Experiencing my trilogy

There's only one way to my galaxy
Hop on your moon soon
Don't separate from me
Your feet won't touch the ground
'Cause there's no gravity
Experiencing my trilogy

Buckle up your seatbelts
We're about to land in 20 seconds
Oh, oh, thank you, you
Thank you for continuing to fly with me
Throughout this whole ride, ride
Thank you, you, oh, thank you, you
