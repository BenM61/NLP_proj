(Hold me, 'till the end)

Voiceless whispers, running through my head
Haunting Vespers, press from the dead

There are lights on the path is clear ahead
I was certain you'd be there 'till the end

Oh, oh, hold me 'till the end, oh, oh

Shine a light on, show the lighted path
Feel them rising, reaching from the path

Stars cascading, light beyond the clouds
Empty rivers, flowing empty now

Oh, oh, hold me 'till the end
Oh, oh, I'll take you to the end

Oh, oh, hold me 'till the end
Oh, oh, I'll take you to the end

Hold me 'till the end
Hold me 'till the end
I'll take you to the end 

Oh, oh, hold me 'till the end
