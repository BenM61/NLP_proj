Mmm, yeah, yeah

No more
(No more)
No more, no more
(No more)
No more

No more trouble in my life
No more tears over you to cry
(No more)
No more breaking me inside
No more hurting me, no more lies

I'll walk away with my dignity
(Aah)
You can't take that away from me
(Aah)

No more
(No more)
No more
(No more)

No more
(No more)
No more
(No)

No more waiting up all night
No more secrets you tried to hide
(No more)
No more covering your crimes
No more you, I've made up my mind
(Oh yeah)

I'll walk away with my dignity
(Aah)
Oh yeah, you can't take that away from me
(Aah)

All the good love that I have wasted
(Aah)
(I wasted so much of my love)
All this pain I can't take it

No more
(Oh no)
No more
(Oh no)

No more
(Oh no)
No more
(No)

Someday you'll be back
(Oh yes, you will)
Wanting more of what we had
(Ain't gonna give you none)

I walk away with my dignity
(Aah)
Oh yeah, and you can't take that away from me
(Aah)

All the good love that I have wasted
(Aah)
(So much love, so much love)
All this pain I can't take it
(Aah)
Oh no

No more
(No more)
No more
(No more)

No more
(No more)
No more
(No more)

No more
(No more)
No more
(No more)

No more
(No more)
No more
(No more)
