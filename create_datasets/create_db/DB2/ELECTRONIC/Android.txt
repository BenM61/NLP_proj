Changing sides, follow lines
Frequencies decide
Who designed me this way
And who's around to play?

Adjust my gain
Replace my fear with pain
I'm on a wave
Select any game to save

Will we fight it?
Will we play?
Will we start all over again?
Well we better do something
I'm losing this game again
The same old game

Time to change, I'm corrupted
Change my disk
Erase me, re-boot, delete
I've had enough, my trash bin is full
Now empty my head, please give me the chance

new start, re-start
Empty pages
Make some changes
Install everything new

I'm sick of you, hunting my thoughts
I don't wanna be your android anymore

New start, re-start
Install everything new
Erase me, re-boot, delete

Will we fight it?
Will we play?
Will we start all over again?
Well we better do something
I'm losing this game again
The same old game

Adjust my gain
Replace my fear with pain
I'm on a wave
Select any game to save
