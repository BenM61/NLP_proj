She hung the phone and I said f*ck you it's over
Sorry but this is the end
I said don't trip it was just a harmless sleepover
See, we're just was making friends
She said "then what were you doing there in four in the morning?
You told me you were at home"
I started with "darling please listen"
And then I picked up my phone, yeah

I told my story in reverse 'cause it hurts
Girl it hurts too much to bare
But I'm tantalized by their legs and long hair
But if I could do it again
I would do it again!
If I could do it again
I would do it again!
If I could do it again
Probably do it again!
Could I get a do-over?
Baby, ooh oh
Hey! Ooh oh

I plugged my phone in as I backed out the driveway
Then I started my car
Slipped out the door after I crept through her hallway
She left it slightly ajar, yeah
Threw on my kicks my socks my jeans and my t-shirt
Then threw my hat on my head
I did it quiet so that I wouldn't wake her
Woke up in another girl's bed, yoo

I tell my story in reverse 'cause it hurts
Girl it hurts too much to bare
But I'm tantalized by their legs and long hair
But if I could do it again
I would do it again!
If I could do it again
I would do it again!
If I could do it again
Probably do it again!
Could I get a do-over? Over!
