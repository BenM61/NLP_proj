Every show must have a song
Most everyone agrees
For what else could the ingenue
And the juvenile reprise
And so I wrote a random note

A harmony or two
And when it came to add the words
I tried describing you
A very precious love
Is what you are to me
A stairway to a star

A night in Shangril of ecstasy
Lanterns of gold
Lanterns of blue
Twinkle in the shadows
While I dance with you
An echo in the wind

Across the summer lake
Is sayin' you should know
That lanterns lose their glow

And hearts can break
So hold me close my darling
Then kiss me tenderly
And give your precious love
Your very precious love to me
