God only knows how far you've come
It must be light years from here
Some distant star you call "the sun."
Does someone miss you back there?

Another world is calling you.
Another world is coming through.

You look like me, you talk like me
I could believe you're human!
But, late at night, I catch your eye
And I know what you're thinking:

Another world is calling you.
Another world is coming through.
Calling you to come home.

You can't escape from gravity,
For you, this earth's a prison.
What I would call "human" in me
For you would be "perversion".

Another world is calling you.
