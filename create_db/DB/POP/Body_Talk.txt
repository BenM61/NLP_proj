Days like these
I just want you back
I can't breathe
I can't even speak
No La la la la la, la la

Gotta rise
Gotta fight
'Cause it's something I wanted
Oh, he's got to go
I can see in the light
It's not right
Now I know
I don't need him

Oh, let your body talk
Even when you feel so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go

La la la la la

Oh, let your body talk
Even when you feel so lost
Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go

Spinning when the tears
They fall, you gotta just let it go
