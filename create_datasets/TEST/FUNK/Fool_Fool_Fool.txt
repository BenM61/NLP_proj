Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you.
Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you
Oh what a fool I was, to think you could love me too.

Well, the first time that I saw you, you looked so doggone sweet
When you walked down the street, I said 'There goes my meat.'
(Needless to say, Kay Starr's version didn't have this line.)

Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you
Oh what a fool I was, to think you could love me too.

I can't forget you darlin', though I'm left out in the cold.
I guess I still love you, and will always feel the same. (I know it doesn't
rhyme!)

Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you
Oh what a fool I was, to think you could love me too.
