A moment ago it seemed
It was yesterday
You were here with me
And everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do with all these empty rooms?
Sit here in solitude with the smell of your perfume

You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me, yeah
'Cause loving you is all I ever had
Said loving you is all I ever had

This wasn't what I wanted to be
A man in misery
Girl, I look back a thousand times
And can't believe that you left me (Why you leave me, baby?)
Why can't you understand my pain?
How can I explain?
Girl, I don't know what I'm doing wrong
I can't believe your love is gone

'Cause you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand (oh, yeah)
You never took the time to know me, yeah
(said you never took the time to know me)
See, loving you is all I ever had
Baby, loving you is all I ever had

You're all I need
You're all I see
I wish that we could do it again

'Cause you never took the time to know me
(Baby, you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand (oh, yeah)
Said you never took the time to know me, yeah
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man
