Automatic, automatic

You give me that
Special feeling boy
I've been awake all night
There's a beat
Inside my heart again
It's workin' overtime

No one's moved me
In this way before
It's all so brand new
You got me so
I don't know where I am
Or what I'm gonna do

But I'm ready, anytime

Automatic High

And I'm walking over cloud nine

Automatic High

When I hear you
Calling out to me
Its make me come alive

And all the fears now
Seem to fade away
I've kissed the past goodbye

And I'm ready anytime

Automatic High

I got one thing on my mind

Automatic High

Every step, every breath
Every breath of my heart
Comin' on like a new sensation

It's just so easy

It's automatic, automatic
Automatic high, high, high
High, high, high
High, high, high
High, high, high

Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic

But I'm ready any time

Automatic high

And I'm walking over cloud nine

Automatic high

Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic
