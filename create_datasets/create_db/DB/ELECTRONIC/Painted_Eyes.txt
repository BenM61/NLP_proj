Elegant, you were born at night
Sewn by soft hands
Oh the softest hands
Born in solitude
Born of painted eyes
Painted Eyes
That always looked to the sky
Oh those eyes
Oh those eyes
They saw forever

How do you make forever
How can you know always
The value of your treasure
How can you see always

How do you make forever
How can you know always
The value of your treasure
How can you see always

Forever

Elegance made you live forever
May your renegade heart never fade
Your silhouette and the rest of your treasures
May your free spirit last, never fade
Oh those eyes
Oh those eyes
They saw forever
Forever

How do you make forever
How can you know always
The value of your treasure
How can you see always

How do you make forever
How can you know always
The value of your treasure
How can you see always

Forever
