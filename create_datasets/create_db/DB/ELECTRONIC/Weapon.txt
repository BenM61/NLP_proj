I'll do anything
I'll do anything for you
Compromise myself in a victim's solitude
Being flexible was supposed to prove that I love you

You take advantage of every chance you get
You break my heart at every chance you get
You let me know that every chance you get
You will protect me
But you're lying

'Cause, you're using my love
You're using my love as a weapon
You're using my love
You're using my love as a weapon towards me

You're using my love
You're using my love as a weapon
You're using my love
You're using my love as a weapon towards me

You're using my love

I'll do anything
I'll do anything for you
Compromise myself in a victim's solitude
Being flexible was supposed to prove that I love you

You take advantage of every chance you get
You break my heart at every chance you get
You let me know that every chance you get
You will protect me
But you're lying

'Cause, you're using my love
You're using my love as a weapon
You're using my love (my love)
You're using my love as a weapon towards me

You're using my love (towards me)
You're using my love as a weapon
You're using my love
You're using my love as a weapon towards me
Towards me

You're using my love

Run, jump, get out your guns
Go find yourself
Run, jump, get out your guns
Lying, never did you no good
