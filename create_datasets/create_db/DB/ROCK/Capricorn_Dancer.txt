Gypsies ride from wonderla-and
I took my horse down to the sa-and
Underneath a thousand miles of sky-why

I watch the waves come tumblin' dow-own
And heard so many different sou-ounds
Cleared my head and eased my worried mi-ind

Capricorn dancer
I'm ridin' to shelter
Show me a si-ign
Lead me on to the tropical zo-one

Diamonds scattered out to sea
The sun keeps laughin' down on me
This crazy horse is tryin' to chase the wi-ind

Watch the waves come tumblin' dow-own
Hearin' all those different sou-ounds
Just clears my head and ease my worried mi-ind

Capricorn dancer
I'm ridin' to shelter
Show me a si-ign
Lead me on to the tropical zone

Capricorn dancer
I'm ridin' to shelter
Show me a si-ign
Lead me on to the tropical zo-one

Ah-ah-lah-lah-lah-lah
Ah, I see the water flow-ow-ow
Woh-oh-woh-oh-oh
Can you see-ee-ee that water flow-ow-ow
Ah-lah-lah-lah-lah-lah
Woh-oh-oh-oh
