You swore you'd never again, let yourself be tempted,
Too many times in the past when you've opened up your heart --
You've had it broken in pieces, by too many lies,
Still it's hard to acknowledge the past --
When she flashes those eyes,
Over and over the song skips,
Just as the final refrain fades away --
Like fools we are caught in the game

Caught in the game,
Caught in the game again --
Caught in the game,
Caught in the game

I swore I'd never again catch myself believin'
Too many times I've been hurt -- and it makes you hard inside
But when I saw you in the city tonight --
Was it just imagination --
Or did your eyes burn a little too bright,
For purely conversation --
Over and over the lights flash down at the corner arcade
Swept away --
Like fools we are caught in the game

Caught in the game,
Caught in the game again --
Caught in the game,
Caught in the game

Over and over the song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away.
Like fools we are caught in the game

Caught in the game,
Caught in the game again --
Caught in the game,
Caught in the game
