One two button your shoe
Put on your coat and hat
I'll play a game like that
While I'm waiting for you
Three tour open the door
Hurry for heaven's sake
I count each step you take
While I'm waiting for you
Five six my eyes are fixed
On that picture of your charm
Seven eight you're at the gate
And you walk into my arms
None ten kiss me again
Tell me you get a thrill
Just as I hope you will
While I'm waiting for you
