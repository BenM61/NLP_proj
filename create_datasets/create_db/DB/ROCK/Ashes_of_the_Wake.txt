We killed a lot of innocent civilians in Baghdad
To us every civilian was a terrorist in Baghdad
That makes everybody free game
But if they came in our paremeter, we lit'em up
When we would search the corpse, we would find nothing
This took place
Time and time again, but that's okay, don't worry about it, because this
Is a new type of war, this is an eradication

Personally I believe we're committing genocide over here, I don't
Believe in killing civilians, and I'm not going to kill civilians for
