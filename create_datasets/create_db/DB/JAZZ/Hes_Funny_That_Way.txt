I'm not much to look at
Nothing to see
Just glad I'm living
And lucky to be
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can't save a dollar
Ain't worth a cent
He doesn't hollar
He'd live in a tent
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way

Though he loves to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away
But why should I leave him?
Why should I go?
He'd be unhappy without me, I know
I've got that man mad about me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way
And no better plan
End it all and let him go
To some other girl
But I'm only human
A coward at best
I'm more than certain
He'd follow me West
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way
