You don't have to be grateful
For all the world's ills
There's plenty of people
Never seen the white cliffs of Dover

So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
A is for astronaut
E is for everything
So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
A is for astronaut
E is for everything

Got caught in the headlights
Saying something special
There's never a moment
When the beat stops long enough to hear the message

So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
A is for astronaut
E is for everything
So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
A is for astronaut
E is for everything

We all get stuck and we don't know why
We think there's no place we can go to
We need to trip on to

So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
A is for astronaut
E is for everything
So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
A is for astronaut
E is for everything
So come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
A is for astronaut
E is for everything
