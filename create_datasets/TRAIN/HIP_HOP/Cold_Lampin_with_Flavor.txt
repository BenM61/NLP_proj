Um lampin', um lampin', um cole cole lampin'
I got loowies boy, um not trampin
I just came from da-crib ya know
Um on da go-throw ya tank into metro
Live lyrics from the bank of reality
I kick da fliest dope maneuver technicality
To a dope track, you wanna hike git out ya backpack
Um in my flav-mobile cole lampin
I took dis g upstate cole lampin
Ta da poke-a-nose, we call da hide-a-ways
A pack of franks and a big bag of Frito Lays

Flavor-flav on a hype tip
Um ya hype drink, come take a big sip
Um in position, you can't play me out da pocket
I'll take da dopest beat you got and I'll rock-it
Like chocolate, even vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, saperella
Flavors are electric, try me, get a shock-a
Didn't I tell you to leave flavor flav alone knock-a
A clock on my chest proves I don't fess
I'm a clock-a, rock-a rockin' wit-da-rest
Flavor in da house by chuck-d's side
Chuck got da flavor-flav don't hide
P.e. crazy, crazy p.e., makin' crazy loowies for the shoppin' spree

Ya eatin' death 'cause ya like gettin' dirt from da graveyard, 
Ya put gravy on it
Den ya pick ya teeth with tomb stone chips
And casket cover clips, dead women hips ya do da bump with, bones
Nutin but love bones
Life styles of the live-en-dead
First ya live den ya dead, died trying ta clock what I said
Now I got a murder rap 'cause I bust ya cap with flavor, pure
Flavor

We got magnum brown, shoothki, valoothki
Super-calafraga-hestik-alagoothki
You could put dat in ya don't know what I said book
Took-look-yuk-duk-wuk
Shinavative ill factors by da flavor flav
Come an ride da flavor wave
In any year on any givin' day
What a brova know, what do flavor say
Why do dis record play dat way
Prime time merrily in da day
Right now dis radio station is busy, brain knowledgeably wizzy
Honey drippers, you say you got it
You ain't got no flavor and I can prove it
Flavor flav the flav all of flavors
Onion an garlic french fried potatas
Make ya breath stink, breath fire
Makes any onion da best crier

I know it sounds crazy but it fits perfect
Peter perfect pimped a perfect peter
Honey dripper, sucker sipper, big dipper, sucker dipper
Drippin' suckers like it's goin' out-a-style
Creatin' flavors for da flavor flav pile
Lampin' booyee madina style

Kickin' da flavor gittin' busy
Ya goin' out, I think ya dizzy
I think ya hungry, 'cause ya starvin' fa flavor
Flavor most, put it on toast
Eat it-en taste it en swallow it down
Imperial flavor gives you da crown
Of the king called flavor, da king of all flavors
Rolls an rolls an rolls life savers
Flavor flav is in everything ya eat 'cause everything ya eat got
Flavor
Flavor flav is da first taste ya git in da mornin, 
Ya breakfast is da flavor
In between dat ta lunch, in between dat dinner, 
In between dat ta midnight flavor
Yeah, das right I got somethin fa all da fandangoes of damangoes of
Da fandangoes of da mangoes
