Let's break our dreams and run away 
To a land without rainy day 
Let's take our hope and rise up high 
Follow me, follow me 
Let's find a land for you and me 
A land with peace and unity 
Let's get together here and now 
Follow me, follow me 

It's my holiday 
I'll tell you where I'm going to 
Land of love 
It's my holiday 
I'll tell you where I'm going to 
Land of love 
Follow me, follow me 
To the land of love, land of love 
Follow me, follow me 
To the land of love, land of love

Go anywhere that you want me to 
And never will I love back 
I trust in you when holiday 
Come on come on this is our journey
Come on come on this is our journey
Come on come on to the land of love 
Back your dreams get ready 
Take off and rise up high 
The land of love is in the sky 
Somewhere beyond control 
We move to the rhythm to free our souls 
Just take me take me take me anywhere
Just take me take me take me anywhere
Just take me take me to the land of love if you're there 

It is in close or far away 
Only love can find a way 
As ever when you are there 
You get staying and you blessed there 
Come on come on this is our passion
Come on come on this is our passion
Come on come on to a higher love 
Take your time and joy 
And now there we are here 
Just close your eyes and have no fear 
Forever eternally 
To find a true love fantasy 
Just take me take me take me anywhere
Just take me take me take me anywhere
Just take me take me to the land of love if you're there
