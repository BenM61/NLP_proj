There's someone out there waiting for me
High, mini, fat, skinny, just wait and see
Don't call me lonely if you are too
In a big city, take pity, won't make the news
I'm advancing, nothing to lose
Go-getter, do better, the right attitude
Do as I say, not as I do
Got no money, nobody, to tell you the truth

When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See this song but as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch

Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I know I'mma live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I know I'mma live without it

So come on, surprise me, I don't care who
Your step missing, time's ticking, ain't got a clue
Something I said, the way that I move
Strong passion, hot passion, too much for you
Don't complicate this, simple to me
I've got it, you want it, but it might not come free
The sun falls slowly, shadows of love
Get together, now or never, can't wait till dawn

When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See this song but as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch

Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I know I'mma live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Time's up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I know I'mma live without it
