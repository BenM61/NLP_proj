Dear sister poet, dear brother poet too
These tears that words are
Make me want to be with you 
But I need to spend my body
I'm a music makin' man
And no page can release it like this amplifier can

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Gonna sign it, gonna seal it, gonna mail it away
Gonna mail it today

God I must be crazy to express myself this way
But there ain't much romance livin' in the U.S.A.
This guitar is a blessing, This piano is a muse
And electricity's a devil with a twenty amp fuse

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you 
Gonna sign it, gonna seal it, gonna mail it away
Gonna mail it to, gonna mail it today

Dear mama, papa hey your boy is doin' fine
And this energy, you gave him 
Keeps on tryin' to unwind
Cause I see an ancient rhythm 
In a man's genetic code
Gonna keep on rock and rollin'
Fill my genes explode

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you 
Gonna rock it, gonna seal it, gonna slake it away
Send me back one, send me back on someday
