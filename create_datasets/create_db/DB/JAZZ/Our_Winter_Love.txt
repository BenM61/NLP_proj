Love warm, in winter time, warms, 
  this heart of mine with dancing fire of
  sweet desire..we've found our winter love.

Eyes cold, as fallen tears, grow,
  bechilling fears, of loneliness,
  how could I guess..we've found our winter love.

Now armed, the world is warm, warm, 
  through cold and storm, we've found a fire, 
  of sweet desire..we've found our winter love.

We've found our winter love,
We've found our winter love.
