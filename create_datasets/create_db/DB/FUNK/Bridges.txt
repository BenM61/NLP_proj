I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountain tops
Together we'll walk over the bridge

There's a place where you can go
Lay your head down comfortable
And it's always there for sure
Don't you know
And it comes as no surprise
The mountains that you must climb
Sit back don't run away have no shame
There's no wrong (there's no wrong)
There's no right (no right)
It's only you and how you your treat life
See baby if the road you choose
Don't work out for you
You know (you know) I'll be your rescue,
Suger suger

I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And baby I will pick you up
Over mountain tops (over mountain tops)
Together we'll walk over the bridge

Like a diamond shining bright
See you are young and flying high
Big dreams of having thangs
In your eyes (do dop do dop hey)
You thought it all makin' cash
But that's no mean, never last
How'd ya throw it all away
Hear me say

Let me take you far away
Be sure to find your destiny
And you know without a doubt
That I would be your bridge out

I'll be the
And I will

I'll be the bridge you can use to (whenever you use to)
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way (get over problems in your way)
And I will pick you up
Over mountain tops (over mountain tops)
Together we'll walk over the bridge

I'll be the bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to (whenever you need to)
Get over problems in your way (I'll be your bridge)
And I will pick you up (I'll be pick you up)
Over mountain tops (over mountain tops)
Together we'll walk over the bridge
