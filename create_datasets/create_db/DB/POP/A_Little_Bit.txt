I know tomorrow's coming
I know the sun will shine and
Everything will be alright
Can we spend time here on this island?
I don't know where the wind is changing
Don't know all the things it knows
But I know that in this moment
I want you to hold me close

Tomorrow, will you be the one I know?
Tomorrow, will you be the hand I hold?

So hold me now
A little bit of love, little bit of love never hurt nobody
Little bit of love, little bit of love never hurt nobody
I could be the one in it for the fun
Little bit of love for you and love for me
A little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love
Love for you and love for me
A little bit of love

We're here to dim the light and
Just chill with me tonight
I feel it within your eyes
I ricochet back into mine

Tomorrow, will you be the one I know?
Tomorrow, will you be the hand I hold?

So hold me now
A little bit of love, little bit of love never hurt nobody
Little bit of love, little bit of love never hurt nobody
I could be the one in it for the fun
Little bit of love for you and love for me
A little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love
Love for you and love for me
A little bit of love

Wake up in the morning and you'll still be here too
What if I wanna go from day to night with you?
So hold me close, hold me close
A little bit of love, little bit of love never hurt nobody
Little bit of love, little bit of love never hurt nobody
I could be the one in it for the fun
Little bit of love for you and love for me

A little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love
Love for you and love for me
A little bit of love
