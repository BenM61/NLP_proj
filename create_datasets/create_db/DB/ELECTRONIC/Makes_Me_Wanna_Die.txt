Follow where Mary goes
Cherish the things she knows
Says if I change my stride
Then I'll fly
She makes me want to die
Change my stride
Then I'll fly
Look to the sun
See me in psychic pollution
Walking on the moon
How could you dare?
Who do you think you are?
You're insignificant
A small piece, an ism
No more no less

You try to learn the universe
Can't even converse in human verse
You know its ironic smoking hydroponic
She makes me want to die
Change my stride
Then I'll fly
She makes me want to die

Can't even converse in universe
(but leave out fifth line: She makes me want to die)
