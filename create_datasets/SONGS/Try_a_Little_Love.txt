Be nice to her whenever you can
And when you cross the street
Always, always hold her hand
You'll find out, oh just a little love
Goes a long way

So, smile at her
When she does something wrong
Always be there to pick her up
And to make her strong
You'll find out a little love

If you be kind, sometimes she'll be blind
To the wrong things that you might do
If you treat her good
The way that you should
She'll see the goodness in you

So, be sweet to her and gentle too
Then you will find out what
Just a little, a little love can do
You'll find out that a little love goes a long way

If you treat her kind, sometimes she'll be blind
To the wrong things
The wrong things you might do
If you treat her good
The way that you should
She'll see the goodness in you

So, be sweet to her and gentle too
And you'll find out what
A little love can go
You'll find out, find out, find out
A little love can go a long, long way
