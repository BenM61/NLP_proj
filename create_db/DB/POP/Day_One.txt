I put my head back where it belongs 
Up there in the clouds 
I'm spreading love like a terrorist now 

And oh what a morning 
Oh what a day to be alive 
Sweet hope is glowing in your glorious eyes 

Pushing, baby real enough 
I bet you think that you're so tough 
But all you'll beat won't be nothing at all 

Day One! Day One! 
Day One! Day One! 

After Boy Wonder, 
After the dream came out of the minds 
Busboys and bankers wiping their eyes 

Be still my lion heart! 
A revolution ready to pounce 
The passioneers up and out of the house 

Beauty faked a heart attack 
Now I feel it coming back 
But all you'll beat won't be nothing at all 

Day One! Day One! 
Day One! Day One!
