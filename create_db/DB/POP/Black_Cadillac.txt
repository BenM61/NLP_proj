It was a black Cadillac drove you away
Everybody's talkin'
But they don't have much to say
There was a black sky of rain
None of it fell
One of us gets to go to heaven
One has to stay here in hell

[Chorus]
Now it's a lonely world
Guess it always was
Minus you and minus blood
My blood

It was a black Cadillac

Like one you used to drive
Now you were always rollin'
But those wheels burn up your life
Oh, it's a black heart of pain that I'm wearin'
Suits me just fine
Oh, there was nothin' I could do for you
When you were still alive

Yeah, it's a lonely world
Just a numbers game
Well, a hundred years
Will find me feelin' just the same

[Chorus]
