Wash your face in the morning sun 
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing 
Touch down bass living on the run 
Make no sweat of the hole that you're digging 
Wrap up cold when it's warm outside 
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's 
Be my magic carpet ride 
Fly me down to capitol city in the sun 
Kickin' up a storm from the day that I was born 
Sing a song for me from let it be 
Open up yer eyes  get a grip of yerself inside 
You betcha!
