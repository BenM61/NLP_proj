I tried so hard, my dear, to show 
That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do 
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past 
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time 
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now 
For things I didnt do
In anger unkind words are said 
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts 
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

There was a time when I believed 
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart
