Elevate a little higher
Let's throw a party in the sky
And celebrate
Elevate until we're flying
Move, move your feet
Until you levitate
Come on let's elevate

Forget about your day
Under the milky way
I know a place where we can go

No need to be afraid
Come on, I'll demonstrate
Take you to outer space
Here we go, here we go

Oh oh oh
If you wanna party
Oh oh oh
And I know you're down
Oh oh oh
If you wanna party
If you wanna party

Elevate a little higher
Let's throw a party in the sky
And celebrate
Elevate until we're flying
Move, move your feet
Until you levitate
Come on let's elevate

Elevate
Elevate

We're floating in the air
Look at the view from here
Show you what world you've never seen before

We're dancing in the stars
No matter where we are
You better buckle up
Here we go, here we go

Oh oh oh
If you wanna party
Oh oh oh
And I know you're down
Oh oh oh
If you wanna party
If you wanna party

Elevate a little higher
Let's throw a party in the sky
And celebrate
Elevate until we're flying
Move, move your feet
Until you levitate
Come on let's elevate

Elevate
Elevate

Don't even hesitate
Just let it escalate
I wanna see you go
Whoa

Break through the ceiling now
It's time to hit the clouds
And, no, we ain't coming down

Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Oh oh oh
Whoa whoa

Elevate a little higher
Let's throw a party in the sky
And celebrate
Elevate until we're flying
Move, move you're feet
Until you levitate
Come on let's elevate

Elevate
Elevate

We're on another level tonight
Let's, let's, let's celebrate

Elevate
