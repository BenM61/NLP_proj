( VERSE 1 )
Sunrise, darkness fades to light
Illuminatin the sky, as well as the insight 
To see a new beginning, and resurrect
Reminiscent of the Phoenix, and recollect
Thoughts from the universe of ideas
Select lyrics to illustrate the obvious
Image, project it, so everybody sees it 
Off the soul, take the body, and freeze it
Suspended animation
To the 10th degree of virtuosity 
Mind is free
Risen from the prison of humanism
To reflect on innervision
And be enlightened
State of awareness heightened
To a level above and beyond
That of intelligent life
Devine, eternal as space and time
Able to transform shape and design
From liquid to gas, light to sound
To each new substance
Matter is constant
Not created or destroyed 
Merely deployed
As words in a radio void

( VERSE 2 )
Words manifested disintegrate
Particles drift into atoms and separate
Developing movement known as soundwaves
That travel at mach one via the airspace
Hittin the microphone, makin it vibrate
Electrical impulses start to migrate
Along the wire 
To enter the next phase of audio sequence
The infamous noisegate lifts 
Over the threshold
And into the system goes matter
Now converted to data
Knowledge is primary
Communication is digital
Language is binary
From the bit to the megabyte
Math is the mode to educate the neophyte
Science is the road to greater understandin
A complex network, always expandin
Growin by the minute
The realm of broadcast, borders are infinite
Signals energized and ready for transmit
Workin its way up the tower
Several times an hour
Gettin power rotation, zero static on the air
Receivers are fine tuned, reception is clear
Courtesy of fiber optics
The highs are bright, the lows kick

( VERSE 3 )
(Radio)
Active in the form of sonic energy
Same identity
Temporarily materializin through the speaker
Comin to the surface - eureka
The final stage of a cycle movin at such high speed
That by the time it's perceived
It's already happened again
Now is then
The future's ever-present
Time is of the essence
Coming in for a landin
On the FM band
With liquid crystal display
Lighting the runway
88 to 108 
Megahertz pushin solid state 
State of the art
Climbin the chart
With a bullet
Radioactive to the fullest
Extent of a wavelength 
Jammin the frequency
Relentlessly to break through
And reach the world on the other side
So they can learn from errors that nullified
The last hit by the blast
Now all that remains, is a shadow of the past
