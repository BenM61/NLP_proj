Is it a kind of a dream 
Floating out on the tide 
Following the river of death downstream 
Oh, is it a dream? 
There's a fog along the horizon 
A strange glow in the sky 
And nobody seems to know where it goes 
And what does it mean? 
Oh, is it a dream?

Bright eyes, burning like fire 
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail? 
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale? 
Bright eyes

Is it a kind of a shadow 
Reaching into the night 
Wandering over the hills unseen 
Or is it a dream? 
There's a high wind in the trees 
A cold sound in the air 
And nobody ever knows when you go 
And where do you start? 
Oh, into the dark

Bright eyes, burning like fire 
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail? 
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale? 
Bright eyes

Bright eyes, burning like fire 
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail? 
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale? 
Bright eyes
