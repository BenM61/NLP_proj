Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah

Johnny don't like the teacher
Johnny don't like the school
One day Johnny is going to do somethin'
Show 'em he's nobody's fool
Oh yeah

Sisters brothers make better lovers
Family affairs down under the covers...
Trailer parks the broken hearts
Won't let you leave until you're bleeding

Sally don't like her daddy
Sally don't like her friends
Sally and Johnny watchin' TV
Waitin' for it to end
Oh yeah

Sisters brothers make better lovers
Family affairs down under the covers...
Trailer parks the broken hearts
Won't let you leave until you're bleeding

Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah
