He let you fly across the floor
No need to break up we'll show you out the door
You want to try some different scene
Well count your blessings, don't get caught between

Can you deny that what you found
Is just a suspect and you're trying to play it down
Need some changes in the plans you make
You've got new arrangements for the sounds you make
New attractions from the satisfactions
Too much thinking about your government 
Alright, all wrong, alright
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground

He let her fly a new regime
Become a lecturist and venture towards extreme

But you need some changes in the plans you make
You've got no arrangements for the sounds you make
There is no attraction from your satisfaction
Don't you catch the (something)

Alright, all wrong, alright

Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Come on, dance to the underground
Get up, dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Come on, dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
Dance to the underground
