It's been a long time coming, coming, coming
Feeling your presence hovering, hovering, hovering
Time that I finally say something, something, something
You're not gonna take this one lie down

But the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth I've been waiting, I'm waiting
And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant to be alone, alone, alone
We were meant to be alone, alone, laying low

It's been a long time honey, honey, honey
You shouldn't laugh, it's not funny, funny, funny
After I'm done I feel nothing, nothing, nothing
Although I feel naked, certain, certain, babe

And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant to be alone, alone, alone
We were meant to be alone

But the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is I've waited too long
And the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is I've waited forever

And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant
But the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is I've waited forever
And the cold hard truth is I can make it without you
And the cold hard truth is we were meant to be alone
We were meant to be alone, alone laying low
We were meant to be alone, alone, alone
We were meant to be alone, alone, laying low
