Joe fell in love with a canvas queen
He dreamed of her night and day
She had a crush on a record machine
And when he tried to kiss her she'd say.

Drop it Joe (drop a dime in the jukebox Joe)
Drop it Joe( drop a dime in the jukebox Joe)
Come on and play this tune for me so I can twist all night.

He bought her a big box of caramel
And a dozen roses too
But when it comes to soda Joe he heard her yet
Hey Joe, I been lookin' for you.

Drop it Joe (drop a dime in the jukebox Joe)
Drop it Joe( drop a dime in the jukebox Joe)
Come on and play this tune for me so I can twist all
night.

The poor guy was caught in the middle
It made him feel mighty low
'Cause he was playing second fiddle
To a hi-fi stereo.

But Joe wouldn't quit and he finally won
At least that's the way it seemed
He married the chick and it really was fun
Till she made him buy a record machine.

Drop it Joe (drop a dime in the jukebox Joe)
Drop it Joe( drop a dime in the jukebox Joe)
Come on and play this tune for me so I can twist all night.
