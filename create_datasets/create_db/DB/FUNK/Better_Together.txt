You and I are the perfect combination
Until this day I've never known more
Here we are in a new situation
So wonderful like never before

Oh, there's something
About the magic we share
That stays in my memory forever

We're so much better together
Nothing could ever compare
We're so much better together
Let's cherish the love that we share

Separately we have traveled many roads
But never thought our two roads would cross
Unpredictable, no one could have told me
If never this moment, it would have been such a loss

'Cause there's something
About the magic we share
That stays in my memory forever

We're so much better together
Nothing could ever compare
We're so much better together
Let's cherish the love that we share

Nothing could ever compare

Our two hearts together
Pulsating as one
Our love has only begun

We're so much better together
Nothing could ever compare
We're so much better together
Let's cherish the love that we share

We're so much better
You and me, can't you see
Nothing can come between
What we've discovered?

Nothing could ever compare

We're so much better
We're so much better together
We'll always be friends and lovers
Let's cherish the love that we share

We're so much better together
Nothing could ever compare
We're so much better together
Let's cherish the love that we share
