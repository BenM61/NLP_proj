I get the feeling that we are being lied to,
There's a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I'm half awake in paisley print.
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint.
I am a supersonic specimen.
A minor miracle of medicine
I'm at the mercy of unwanted emotions.
Where nothing matters, beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens.
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements, replace me
Was it a positive experiment?
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I'm at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I'm not like these people
And these people are not like me
Super heavy elements, upgrade me
Supersonic elements amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now
Feeling happy now

I haven't scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams, I'm a frequent flier
Super heavy elements, embrace me
Super heavy elements,

I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I feel myself falling
I'm feeling happy now,
I'm feeling immortal
We'll live forever now
We'll live forever now
