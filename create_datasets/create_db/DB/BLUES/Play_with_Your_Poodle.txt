Now lend an ear folks while I sing this song,
Don't get mad, I don't mean no harm!
I want to play with your poodle,
I want to play with your poodle,
I want to play with your poodle,
I mean your little poodle dog!

Yes, that little poodle got a long shaggy tail,
Well I tried to buy him but he wasn't for sale!
Can I play with your poodle?
Can I play with your poodle?
Can I play with your poodle?
I mean your little poodle dog!

Oh, when I went down to town with my hat in my hand,
I was lookin' for a woman, didn't have no man!
I want to play with your poodle,
I want to play with your poodle,
I want to play with your poodle,
I mean your little poodle dog!

Yes, two old maids that were layin' in a bed,
Well, one turned over, this is what she said;
"Can I play with your poodle?
Can I play with your poodle?
Can I play with your poodle?
I mean your little poodle dog!".

Now Lily ol' woman, what you tryin' to do?
Tryin' to lower my brother and lower me too!
Wanna play with your poodle,
I wanna play with your poodle,
I wanna play with your poodle,
I mean your little poodle dog!
Play it loud!
