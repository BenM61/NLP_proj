You told me I'd never leave you baby
But I don't believe this is happening all over again

I was such a fool
To think that you would ever change your ways
Even put your hand upon your heart
And said that no-one else can take my place
How was I so blind
I trusted every single word you said
I know I should have seen the light
But I just let your love go to my head

Ive taken you back before 'cause you told me you've changed
Looked in my eyes and said

Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me
But its happening all over again (no, no, no)

I promised to myself
I'd never make the same mistakes again (same  mistakes)
And though I looked for someone else
I never really want to walk away

It seems that your just the same, I forgot all the pain
Look in your eyes, you said

Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me 
But its happening all over again
But its happening all over again
(You said believe me)
But its happening all over again
(Deceived me)
But its happening all over again
(Believe me)
But its happening all over again
But its happening all over again

Ive taken you back before 'cause you told me you've changed
Looked in my eyes and said

(Repeat till fade)
Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me 
But its happening all over again
