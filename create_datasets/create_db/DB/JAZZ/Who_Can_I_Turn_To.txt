Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
And so I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
That darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
They're still borrow
My share of laughter

With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away

With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
