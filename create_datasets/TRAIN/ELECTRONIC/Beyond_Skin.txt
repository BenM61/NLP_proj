The gadget turned the pre-dawned sky as bright as the sun
As the first atomic mushroom cloud rose above the horizon.

We knew the world would not be the same...
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.
I remembered the lines from the hindu scripture, the bhagavad gita
Vishnu was trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,
"now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.
I remembered the lines from the hindu scripture, the bhagavad gita.
"now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
