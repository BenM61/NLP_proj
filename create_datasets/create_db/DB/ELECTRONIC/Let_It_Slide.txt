I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
 Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye 
 New day same shit occurred in this time 
 I was asked what I was looking at not knowing he was grassed 
 This spark the beef and 
 I was gonna finish it off but turns out 
 This nigga was soft he got 
 Afraid from the way about the stance glancing to my left and right 
 Put a basket a man insight 
 He'll see the whole thing if I decide to do a buckwild move 
 So what I turn it in shall I choose, ha! 
 Fire my steel and take the chance 
 Of being bagged and ship up north for a long long ? 
 I ain't for it so I flash the cloud 
 He saw the nickle plate 
 Almost having a day to die 
 I wonder why 
 Chumps want to pick on I 
 They be like setting it off 
 And I be letting it slide 
 I don't know what they be seeing 
 But one time in a conflict 
 I flip, turn into an unstable human being 
 I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
 Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye 
 When I'm flowing with my girl I feel it the most 
 Beef coming so close like a champagne toast 
 On the train, in the city, down the way 
 Down her way, I take it upon myself and say niggas is gay 
 What you trying to prove? 
 Can't move him out and with a stare 
 But when a brother pull a trunk and sink it ain't fair 
 Two wrongs don't make a right 
 But the philosophy of a fight, fella 
 Used to prolong you life, I 
 Rolled like it was enemy 
 Why would you pretend to be 
 Some motherfucker men is to fight to kill Kenney, I 
 Be rappin' son's trying flamboyant and 
 Put on a smurf 'cause you staring is annoying and 
 No matter how much I try to avoid noise from feeling in with bad day 
 Starring in my grill again 
 Or try to hypnotize with the eye starring 
 Retinified be tearsful, to your family lives a day 
 No fronting because you couldn't stop my glock so 
 Time ran out 'cause you punch your own glock 
 I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
 Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye
