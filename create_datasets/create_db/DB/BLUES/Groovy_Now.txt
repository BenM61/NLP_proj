Free your mind for the journey
Close your eyes
Got me burnin'
I want to give you good love
Lay you down
Sexy young thing
Are we groovy now

[Chorus:]
And I want your body
Groovy now
Want to freak that body
Groovy now
Want to sex your body
Groovy now
Gonna rock that body
Groovy now

Take you time
Don't look back baby
Sweet desire
Heart attack mama
I want to give you good love
Get it on
Freaky young thing
And we're groovin' on

[Chorus]

Free your mind we're gonna take a journey
Close you eyes mama
'Cause you got me burnin'
I want to give you good love
Lay you down
Sexy young thing
Groovy now

[Chorus]
