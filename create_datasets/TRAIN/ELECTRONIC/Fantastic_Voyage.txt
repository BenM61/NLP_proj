Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
'Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip

Grab your strap with the extra clip and,
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
Kick it, kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin', ain't no cripin'
Ain't no punk-ass nigga's set trippin'
Everybody's got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black, I
Want to take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can't take the heat get yo' ass out the kitchen
We on a mission, so come on

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
I'm hittin' switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
Ain't no valley low enough or a mountain high

I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice, a
Place where my kids can play outside
Without livin' in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about them jealous niggas
I keep on searching and I keep on looking
But fools are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be acting like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
'Cause you don't gang bang, and
You don't have to stand on the corner and slang
'Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
I'm hittin' switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
Ain't no valley low enough or a mountain high

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still tryin' to get a peace of the apple pie
Every game ain't the same but the game still remains
Don't it seem kinda strange, ain't a damn thing change
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down-ass brothers can ride with me
Hop-hop-hop the five quickly down the block
Stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have herrt son, if you want to go,
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody cryin' ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worried, everybody's tryin'
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you want to have something then you better start frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 roll by
You better be ready, so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
I'm hittin' switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
Ain't no valley low enough or a mountain high

Just roll along
Just roll along
Just roll along
Just roll along

To the hood of funk
To the hood of funk
To the hood of funk

To the hood of funk
To the hood of funk

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage

Just roll along
Just roll along
Just roll along
