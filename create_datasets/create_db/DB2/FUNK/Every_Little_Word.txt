Trois, deux, un
(Hah, you f*ck to this shit?)
(You f*ck to this shit?)
(Hah, you f*ck to this shit?)

I'm hanging onto every fire
I'm hanging onto every dream
I'm hanging onto everything that I want
Just so I know what I mean
I'm hanging onto every mirror
And your reflection still remains
I'm hanging onto every word you say now
Every little word you say, you say

(Hah, you f*ck to this shit?) Every little word you say
(Hah, you f*ck to this shit?) Every little word you say

Waiting on a resolution
As we (?) at moonshine
Take me to that place of serenity
Somewhere I can kill the time
So when my patience treads on thin ice
When my heart gives up on faith
Yeah, I'll be still hanging onto every word you say now
Every little word you say, you say

Every little word you say seems to make it all ok
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say makes me wanna seize the day
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say

(Only you and I)

So should my grip ever get looser
Please make sure I never stray
Cause I'm still hanging onto every word you say now
Every little word you say (every little word you say)

Every little word you say seems to make it all ok
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say makes me wanna seize the day
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say
Every little word you say, you say
