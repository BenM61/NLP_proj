Snoopy, its what they say as if they knew me
Groupie on my head like a cufi
My nigga kid cudi thats my little buddy
Calls some hos up and get some cudi cudi
Whats your life like
Mines is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin' a china white
My people love the fans love me come all go
If you aint showin love than what you call for
I don't need it in my life
My kids pay the price
Sorta like the need of my wife
Smoke til I'm gone dog on the throne
I'm worldwide known I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it cause I can
I earn my spot, you see the plan
I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man
Important to life you understand while I'm puffin on this gram

Everythin' I'm havin'
No they ain't necessity
Though I'm shinin' keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
Its so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam' and I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

I got my fam' dog, I got my niggas,
Got little money dog but I ain't tripping,
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated,
Steady wanting freaky hoes, then I want a lady,
Holdin' the fam down and the clothes on me,
The people who were there, stupid sucka left me lonely,
Phony, when you see me nigga, don't approach me,
Made it to the top baby, that's on me,
Cops trying to claim that they made me,
I want you to feel another real for gaizing,
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need me,
I'm in the zone, no place for pussy my nigga,
Cool yo that niggas don't know, loco how a nigga like me postpone,
The one fans loved, who was always approachable yo,
And I rep the double O, smoking, eating Cheerios

Everythin' I'm havin'
No they ain't necessity
Though I'm shinin' keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
Its so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam' and I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king,
And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it, all out in public,
The people want to touch it, I need a blunt with the stuffin',
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out and post up at the house,
With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies,
Hollywood nice now,
Everyone want me and on the blogs they talk shit like they know me,
Fool, I'll take you niggas to school, "How to get rich and stay cool",
Snoopy D O Dub show you homie, even with the critics and feds on me,
I was tappin' all the Choanies,
Dog, but my folks call me snoopy, boss dogg nigga sue me,
Pony tail swinging as I lay in the jacuzzi,
Love of my life while I'm puffing on the good weed

Everythin' I'm havin'
No they ain't necessity
Though I'm shinin' keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
Its so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam' and I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
