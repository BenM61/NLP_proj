Three A.M. I'm awakened
By a sweet summer rain
Distant howling of a passing Southbound coal train
Was I dreaming
Or was there someone just lying here Beside me in this bed?
Am I hearing things?
Or in the next room
Did a long forgotten music box just start playing?

And I know (it's a sin putting words in the mouths of the dead)
And I know (it's a crime to weave your wishes into what they said)
And I know (only fools venture where them spirits tread)
Cause I know (every word, every sound bouncing 'round my head)

Is just static on the radio
(Everything I think I know is just static on the radio)

Now there's a church house
About a stone's throw down
From this place where I been staying
It's Sunday morning
And I'm sittin' in my truck
Listening to my neighbor sing
Ten years ago I might have joined in
But don't time change those inclined
To think less of what is written
Than what's wrote between the lines?

Cause I know (dreams are for those who are asleep in bed)
And I know (it's a sin putting words in the mouths of the dead)
Cause I know (for all my ruminations I can't change a thing
Still I hope (there's others out there who are listening)

To the static on the radio
(Everything I think I know is just static on the radio
Static on the radio
(Ain't praying for miracles, I'm just down on my knees)
Static on the radio
(Listening for the song behind everything I think I know)
Static on the radio
(Everything I think I know is just static on the radio)
