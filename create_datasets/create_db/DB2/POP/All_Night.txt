My heart beats a little faster
When our eyes meet in the middle of a crowded room
In knee deep, testin' waters
I've got a feelin' and I don't know what to do

You got me paralyzed and I think I like it
Caught me by surprise, I'm not usually like this, no
Got me paralyzed, don't think I can help it
Why does it feel so right?

Let's keep this goin' all night
Goin' all night
Goin' all night
Goin' all night

The crowd fades, tunnel vision
In a maze, and the only thing I feel is you
Imperfect, single passion
Face to face, tell me do you feel it too? 

You got me paralyzed and I think I like it
Caught me by surprise, I'm not usually like this, no
Got me paralyzed, I don't think I can fight it
Why does it feel so right?

Let's keep this goin' all night
Goin' all night
Goin' all night
Goin' all night

But maybe I should wait
Let it fall into place
'Cause I keep goin' over the things
That could come from me feelin' this way
And I don't wanna (I don't wanna play)
These emotional games (emotional games)
Only you bring me closer
I cannot deny that I want you to stay, woah, yeah
You got me
You got me, got me, paralyzed (woah)

Got me paralyzed (got me paralyzed)
And I think I like it 
Caught me by surprise
I cannot deny this, no
Got me paralyzed (yeah)
Don't think I can fight it (woah)
Why does it feel so right?
Let's keep this goin' all night
