A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend

I am calling you
I know you hear me
I am calling you

A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know a change is coming
It's coming closer, sweet release

I am calling you
I know you hear me
I, I am calling you
Oh yes baby I do

Can't you hear me now?
I am calling you
I know you hear me
I, I'm calling you

A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs a little fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend

Oh, I, I am calling you, yeah, yeah
I, I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
Can't you hear me here baby, now?
