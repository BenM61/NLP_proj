I see houses burning, I'm ashamed
Before you close your eyes denying me
You'd better ask yourself
Did I choose something I could regret?

Did I do something I should regret?
Is this the place I used to call fatherland?
Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
I should regret

Is this the place I used to call fatherland?
Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
The silence is illusion, stay awake
I hear children cry in fear and hate

Do cowards ask themselves?
Did I choose something I could regret?
Did I do something I should regret?
Is this the place I used to call fatherland?

Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
Did I choose something I could regret?
Did I do something I should regret?
Is this the place I used to call fatherland?

Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
Is this the place I used to call fatherland?
Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
Is this the place I used to call fatherland?

Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
Is this the place I used to call fatherland?
Is this the place I used to know--
I should regret

Is this the place I used to call fatherland?
Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
Is this the place I used to call fatherland?
Is this the place I used to know as fatherland?
