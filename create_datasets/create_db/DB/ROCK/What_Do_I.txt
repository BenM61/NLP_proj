Here I go again
I pretend I don't know about the complications
Here I go again
I pretend I don't remember all the frustration
Here I go again
Even though I know how scared it makes you
Here I go again
Here I go again

What do I get
Out of this
Out of this I wish I knew
What do I get

Out of this
Out of this
Out of this

here I go again
I break my back
To see this work
Here I go again
I still come out feeling like such a jerk
Here I go again
Even though I know how scared it makes you
Here I go again
Here I go again

What do I get
Out of this
Out of this I wish I knew
What do I get
