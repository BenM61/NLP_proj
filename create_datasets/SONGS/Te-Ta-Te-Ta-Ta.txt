Every time I call your name
I get such a thrill I can't explain
Whoa-oh I'm so glad
A-honey that I'm your man
We fell in love on a Wednesday mornin'
With all-a our heart and soul
And people
I know you should have been there
To see my girl rock and roll

And she said
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time you cha-cha-cha
She said
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time she cha-cha-cha
Her love for me is wider than the ocean
More deeper than the sea
Whoa-oh she make me feel so good
And she rock and roll for me

She said
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time she cha-cha-cha
She said
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time she cha-cha-cha

Every time I call your name
I get such a thrill I can't explain
Whoa-oh I'm so glad
A-honey that I'm your man (ah)
We fell in love on a Wednesday mornin'
With all-a our heart and soul
And people
I know you should have been there
To see my girl rock and roll

And she said
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time she cha-cha-cha
She said
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time you cha-cha-cha
You're lookin' good honey
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time you cha-cha-cha
My my my my my my my my my my my my baby
Yes she did
Let's do it one more time honey
Ah-ah-ah a-tay-te-tee-ta-ta
Every time you cha-cha-cha
