Hey, I'm in love,
My fingers keep on clicking to the beating of my heart.
Hey, I can't stop my feet,
Ebony and ivory and dancing in the street.
Hey, it's 'cause of you,
The world is in a crazy, hazy hue.

My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle drum

Man, you got me burning,
I'm the moment between the striking and the fire.
Hey, read my lips,
Cause all they say is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
No, it'll never stop,
My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love.

My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle drum

My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
My heart is beating like a jungle
