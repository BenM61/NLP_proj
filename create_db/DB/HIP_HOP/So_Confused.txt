Oh
Ooh

Well, I know we just met yesterday
But things feel oh so right
'Cause you always know just what to say
Or what is on my mind

Well, I feel I'll need a special way
To ask you to be mine
But I don't know when's the perfect day
What's the perfect time

Babe, you leave me confused
Don't know if I should let you know
Or wait it out girl
Wish I knew just what to do
I'm so confused

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl

Well, I know that it maybe too soon
To know just what you'd like
But I wanna know what you've been through
What you want from life

It's so real the way I feel
So true, it's been so hard to find
Wanna know how you feel for me to
So I'll make up my mind

Babe, you leave me confused
Don't know if I should let you know
Or wait it out girl
Wish I knew just what to do
I'm so confused

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl

Well, someone once told me
That you'll end up lonely
Don't let love ever pass you by
'Cause I've seen it happen to

People that matter to me
With my very own eyes
Maybe they were mistaken
And I should be waiting

For you to show me a sign
Or should I just let you know
That if I let you go
I'd wonder the rest of my life

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl

So girl, what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me beggin' baby please
Wanna feel me crying for mercy

Oh, girl
I wish, I knew your world
I think I'm losing my head
Over you girl
