Your lips are beggin' for more girl
And it's tearing me all up inside
Because I like what you're doing
And it's something I've never tried
I know we both oughta stop here
You're tempting me to come on strong
And when I look in your eyes girl
There's no way to tell right from wrong

So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
I don't think I can ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve

You make me reach out for more girl
I'm really coming alive
But you better think what you're doing
Before you get us both satisfied

So pass the apple and give me a bite
My resistance is low and I just can't fight it
Now I know I can't ask you to leave
So pass the apple Eve

Come on girl
You're coming on too strong
I can't leave you alone
Come on girl
Give it to me
Give me a bite
I just can't fight it
