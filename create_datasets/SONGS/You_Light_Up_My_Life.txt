You light up my life 
like sunrise in the morning
You make me believe anything is possible
I didn't have a dream to my name
Darkness was mine, it was such a shame
But you came to light up my life
You brought me faith, and hope, 
and love, and light

With your tender smile 
you brought me top the promise
Of life outside a world of nine to five
and Sunday
I didn't know how rich I could be
Until you gave your love to me
Don't you see, you light up my life
You give me faith, and hope, 
and love, and light

You brought your sweet understanding
Like sun rays in my hazy sky
If you hadn't opened up my eyes
Love would have passed me right on by

I never knew how good I could feel
Loving you's left me with nothing to conceal
Yeah.you really light up my life
You give me faith, and hope,
and love, and light
