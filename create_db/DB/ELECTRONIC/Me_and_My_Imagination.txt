We're gonna play a game
Just you and me
You never should be won
So easily
Your eyes are on the prize
I'm worth the wait
Don't need to know the end
'Cause darling

Magic stays when myth remains
I'm under your spell
Don't release me
Never give the game away
Try to keep me entertained
Baby
Don't make
It too easy
Leave something
For me and my imagination

We're a possibility
When you make it hard for me
Baby
I'm not in a hurry

Leave something
For me and my imagination

I don't need to know
Your every trick
So keep me guessing just
A little bit
'Cause hidden in your eyes
There's mystery
I want to get inside
To where the

Magic stays and myth remains
I'm under your spell
Don't release me

[Chorus]

Never give the game away
Try to keep me entertained
Baby
Don't make it too easy
Leave something...

[Chorus]

Never give the game away
Try to keep me entertained
Don't make it too easy, baby

For me and my imagination

We're a possibility
You make it hard for me
I'm not in a hurry baby
For me and my imagination
