We've been hanging around
We've been hanging around
So many times before
So many times before
We've been falling
In love, we've been
Falling in love
We're gonna miss it all
We're gonna miss it all

We didn't hit
Every note
We didn't know every rule
We did it anyway
We did it anyway

We didn't do all the do's
I guess we did all the don'ts
We're gonna miss this place
We're gonna miss this place

Do what you do and
Do it all the way
Go where you go
It's gonna be okay!
