my mother told me off
she said i had done wrong 
she said id been a bad bad boy
she said i make her sad
she said i drive her mad
and now she's taking all my toys

oh,I've been a bad bad boy
oh,I've been bad
oh,I've been a bad bad boy
oh,I've been bad

and now she keeps me in
I'm payin for my sin
the door is locked i can't go out
i have apologized
oh,how I've really tried
not to be a bad boy

oh,I've been a bad bad boy
oh,I've been bad
oh,I've been a bad bad boy
oh,I've been bad

you tried to help me out
but all we do is shout

my love for you is strong
but i keep doing wrong
ill always be a bad bad boy

oh,I've been a bad bad boy
(bad bad boy)
oh,I've been bad
