Silver was the color
Winter was a snowbell
Mother of the wind boys
Livin' off the lovewell

With Lu
And everybody's callin' Luie
Luie, Luie
You got a thing about you
Keep the light goin' for Luie
And Luie keeps on pushin' through
Through
Keeps on pushin'

Amber was the color
Summer was a flameride
Cookin' up the noon roads
Walkin' on god's good side
I was walkin' on god's good side
God's good side

With Lu
And everybody's callin' Luie
Luie, Luie
You got a thing about you
Keep the light goin' for Luie
And Luie keeps on pushin' through
Through
Keeps on pushin'

Through
He keeps on pushin'

I will always be fair
Be there for Lu
Forever and ever more
Everybody
Everybody everybody
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

And everybody's callin' Luie
Callin' Luie
Everybody's callin' Luie callin'
My man
My man Luie

Callin' Luie
My man Luie
