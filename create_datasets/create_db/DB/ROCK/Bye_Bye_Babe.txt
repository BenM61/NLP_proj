Bye bye, bye bye babe
Bye bye, bye bye babe
Bye bye, bye bye babe
Bye bye, bye bye babe

If the local rock scene has gotten you down
You got nowhere to go
You better get up on a Greyhound bus
Head down the road to T.O.

Bye bye, bye bye babe
Bye bye, bye bye babe

She got to take another chance
Her last rock and roll chance

If your whole life has gotten you down
You got nowhere to turn
There's a correspondence course in the book
Still things a young girl can learn

Bye bye, bye bye babe

You'd better trade in your box, sell your rod now, baby
But I'm singing to you
Bye bye, bye bye babe

Have a look in your comic book
Have another look, you're sinking
Bye bye, bye bye babe

Head down the road, look for a slimy toad
Nothing in your head you woman
Bye bye, bye bye babe

Oh, bye bye, bye bye babe
