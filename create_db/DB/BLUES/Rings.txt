Ring, ring, telephone ring, somebody said
Baby, what ya doin', I've been wonderin' where you been
Now and then I think about you and me
No use fightin' 'bout things we can't recall
It don't matter now at all
Just come on home, baby, we'll laugh and sing
We'll make love, let the telephone ring
Ring, ring, doorbell ring, baby, come on in
Got James Taylor on the stereo
I'm glad you come around, I've been feelin' down
Just talkin' to Tony and Mario
You know they make good conversation
Still it ain't no consolation
Cause I got love, baby
I'll give you some and if somebody comes
We'll let the doorbell ring
Said, ring, ring, golden ring around the sun
Around your pretty finger
Ring, ring voices ring with a happy tune
Anybody can be a singer
The sun come up across the city
I swear you never looked so doggone pretty
Hand in hand we'll stand upon the sand with the preacher man
Let the weddin' bells ring
Hand in hand we'll stand upon the sand with the preacher man
Let the weddin' bells ring
Hand in hand we'll stand upon the sand with the preacher man
Let the weddin' bells ring
