Press play, fast forward
Non stop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine
We will never get back to
To the old school
To the old rounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the one (...)
(We are here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

We've come a long way since that day
And when you never look back
(Never look (2x))
