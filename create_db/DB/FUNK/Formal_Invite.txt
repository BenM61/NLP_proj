Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Neptunes

We got dirty in the brand new mattress
I had you walk around with your thong on back with
I know you feel surprise just how long I last it
Telling on yo freeze and I'm a nasty basty
Yo, you know what I like? models and actresses
You know the wind just scream "He loves you not"
You know the wind just scream "Tire ass pass"
When I see ya at the beach and I be like "She hot"
Baby pause let me freeze the frame
Cause slide down my pour let me ease the pain
With the roll on the dubbies in the greasy Range
And don't a eight rex cox and play a range
And with that body ain't no telling what I do to ya
I have your money while I'm growinin'
With that body I can hell but to do ya
In the morning we be telephoning me
Show me the ruling me in the warming me
Wile I show you the upper side where lonely brings
The ice rup on my neck make my body bling
Flipping how why you doing things
So tell me what you doing tonight 
Cause we can do it again yo you with it alright
Be, I know you like it when I'm feeling alright
And tonight I'ma make you feel aiight

[Chorus: Ray J]
Girl, what you doing tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come on to me, girl
Girl, what you doing tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come on to me, girl

It's been a long time since I put Kelis out
I made a VA put it on a honey gran B-side
Pen for the O, glass for the beach house
And you can see me getting head in the house of B-south
Ex-time a man can say they feel a man again
Ask to me do I want to send again so woman hood
They's growing me on watching hills girls 
Don't scratch my lou and 
I deep dog yo, all day a man and when a man
I touch your girls can yelled again
She said she feel for live so she can breathe
But don't smoke but girl I keep bump man's weed
I chains closes same hoes and Chapman goes
Gotta pull on my chains low cause man a thing goes
My house no they can't see their look vacancy
But drink is my home of my niggas my ADT
See my too dog nears and they do like knees
And you've never seen a diamond like this
I don't visit Jacob my stuff is male enough
So what you think you tell enough
Man my long is enough so he can Beverly nears
I shop in Beverly Hills so we can dress and we kill
Why he see channel and see how a rockstar live
Who's the next girl that want to see a rockstar crave
Come on

[Chorus: x2]

Girl I don't need for you to be chichi
You need to leave ya man alone cause is broken wimpy
You need to be with somebody like me
You can't keep married but I can should pinky
You know, you know hang up with you
You know, you know lay down with you
You know, you know stay down with you
You can show a model girls with classy get ya, aiight
