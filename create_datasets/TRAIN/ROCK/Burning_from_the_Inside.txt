Running without aim 
Through the razor weeds 
That only reach my knees 
And when I'm lying in the grey sleep 
I don't know how to walk the boards 
I open my eyes, and look at the floor 
And now I don't see you anymore 

There is no choice, we make the point 
To counteract a threatening hand 
Close my hold 
As we near the atmosphere
