What if God fell from the sky 
Would you notice, or just walk by 
What if Christ took your hand 
And you just ran 

What if I couldn't see 
I was twelve, so trusting 
You take hands, put on me 
You had needs 

So don't tell me 'bout nothin' 
'Cause I don't want to know it 
I don't want to know it 
Don't talk about your morals 
If you ain't gonna show it 
You ain't gonna show it 
Don't tell me 'bout religion 
If you ain't gonna live it 
And you sure ain't living it 
And don't talk about love 
If you ain't gonna give it 

What if God fell from the sky 
Would you notice, or just walk by 
What if Christ took your hand 
And you just ran 
Would you be damned 

Don't tell me 'bout nothing 
'Cause uh, I don't want to know it 
I don't want to know it 
Don't talk about your morals 
If you ain't gonna show it 
And you ain't gonna show it 
Don't tell me 'bout religion 
If you ain't gonna live it 
And you sure ain't living it 
And don't talk about love (more on that later) 
If you ain't gonna give it 

What if God fell from the sky 
Would you notice, or just walk by 
What if Christ took your hand 
And you just ran 
Would you be damned 
Mmm hmm 
So take my hand
