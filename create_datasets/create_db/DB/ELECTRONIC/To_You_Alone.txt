 If you could look at me from above my feet
I'll have you back in time for me, don't look back for me
There's not a lottery for you in there
Guitar in hand, hold it like a song man

You do not realise the line that runs from me
Too glad to visualise the lie line that runs from me

I'm sending out, I'm sadder now
Before the sky will fall on yer, who's calling yer
A black box inside my mind
Records the time we spent together

You do not realise the line that runs from me
Across the universe to you alone
The universe, are you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
I'm a-singin like a fool
I'm a-singin like a fool
I'm a-singin like a fool
I'm a-singin like a fool

She's like the snow-capped trees in my jigsaw
Lose at the seams within fear of your dreams
She's like a fool you meet at the hot store
Hand in the pale, and the blacker the veil
The blacker the veil

I'm a-singin like a fool
I'm a-singin like a fool
I'm a-singin like a fool
I'm a-singin like a fool

I'm sending out, I'm sadder now
Before the sky will fall on yer, who's calling yer
A black box inside my mind
Records the time we spent together

You do not realise the line that runs from me
Across the universe to you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
Are you alone
I'm a-singin like a fool
