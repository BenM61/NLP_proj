When trouble fills my world
You bring me peace
You calm me down
You're my release
When walls come crashing around my feet
You light my way
You're my release

So say you'll watch over me
When I'm in too deep
Tell me you'll always be
There to pull me free

When the sun is beating down upon my brow
You are my shade
You cool me down
Every time I tried to turn away
You brought me 'round
Your humble way

So say you'll watch over me
When I'm in too deep
Tell me you'll always be
There to pull me free
There to rescue me

For every time you sheltered me from harm
You showed me truth
Kept me warm
Every time you left me on the street
I found my way
I found my feet

So say you'll watch over me
When I'm in too deep
Tell me you'll always be
There to pull me free
There to rescue me
There to pull me free
There to rescue me
