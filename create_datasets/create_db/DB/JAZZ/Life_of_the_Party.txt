I don't wanna believe that it's over
I don't wanna believe that it's over

I gotta take my time with this one

You might see me smilin'
But inside I'm dying
Too proud to let it show
I ain't the one
You won't see me crying
But it's hard to let it go
All my time on the tour bus
Wasn't good for us
And then you throw it all
Started gettin' around with a few choice chicks
But we had something special
Plus the sex was sick

[Bridge:]
Do you remember
From the bed to the wall
On the floor by the fireplace?
I know you remember
On the truck, couldn't wait
So we got off on the garden state
Somehow we must of got all turned around on last freeway
Now I can't find my way home to you
Oh girl

[Chorus:]
Still
I get love in the hood
Still arguin'
Acting like my life is all good
Still
Putting up a false bravado
When I lost you, I lost my winning ticket to lotto
Still
Every time I raise my glass
I try to drink away my past
To the world I might appear to be the life of the party
But they don't see me

Oh, I never thought I'd be the one missing
Oh, I can't take this emptiness
And I can't keep going on like this
And I can't keep pretending that this don't hurt like a mother, babe
I know that it's crazy for me to come over
I had to see you
I know I got to change, girl
I'll do that quick
You need to take me back 'cause the sex was sick

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Oh, baby
Remember when we used to ride the bus
Girl, how we came up
Fine Korean chicks and all that
I'd give it up just to have you back
'Cause money's only paper, girl
And this house don't feel like home when I'm alone
Whenever you see me
Baby, remember

[Chorus]

Y'all don't see
You only see what you see on the TV
This is my reality
You got to get to know me
(Every time I raise my glass)
Every time I raise my glass
(I try to raise my glass)
(To the world I might appear to be the life of the party)
