There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd
I used to pull away when she would kiss my face
And touch my hair
She didn't care who saw

[Chorus]
She was all over me
And i used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that i love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me

The sky is blue
But from where i stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What i wouldn't give if i could feel
The familiar touch of her love holding me again

[Chorus: x2]
