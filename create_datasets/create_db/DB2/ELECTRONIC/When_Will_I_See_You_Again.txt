Precious moments

When will I see you again?
When will we share precious moments?
Will I have to wait forever? Will I have to suffer
And cry the whole night trough?

When will I see you again?
When will our hearts beat together?
Are we in love or just friends?
Is this my beginning or is this the end?

When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?

Precious moments

Are we in love or just friends?
Is this my beginning or is this the end?
When will I see you again?

When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?

When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
