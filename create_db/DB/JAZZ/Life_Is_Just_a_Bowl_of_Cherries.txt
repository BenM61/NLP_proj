Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious
Life's too mysterious

You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough
When you go, go, go

Keep repeating, it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The best things in life to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you never owned

Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh at it all

Keep repeating, it's the berries
You know the strongest oak has got to fall
The sweet things in life to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you never owned

Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live it, love it, wriggle your ears
And think nothing of it, you can't do without it
There's no two ways about it
You live and you laugh at it all
