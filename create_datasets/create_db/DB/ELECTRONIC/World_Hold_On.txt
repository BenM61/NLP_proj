Open up your heart
What do you feel?
Open up your heart
What do you feel is real?

The big bang may be a million years away
But I can't think of a better time to say

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future
Open up inside
World, hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future
Tell me no more lies
World, hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Children of the sky...
Children of the sky...

Look inside
You'll find a deeper love
The kind that only comes from high above

If you ever meet your inner child
Don't cry
Tell them everything is gonna be all right

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future
Open up inside
World, hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky

World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Children of the sky
Open up your heart
Tell me, how do you feel?

Listen now, tell them everything
Right here, right now
All right, everybody, here in the world
You are all the children

Together now, unite, and fight, oh
Open up your heart, now
Peace, love for everyone

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, all right
To the four corners of the world
Sing it loud, sing it loud, sing it loud, loud, loud
World hold on, on

Sing it loud, sing it proud
Everybody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Don't take no for an answer
No, no, not today

Right here, spread love
Everybody join together now
One, one heart, love and unity, everybody sing
Yeah!

World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky

World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky
