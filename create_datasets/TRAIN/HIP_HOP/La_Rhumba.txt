(Ndira)
Here we are...
Bobby, I was just wondering, you know
About me and you, tonight
If we could go to a little Rhumba
Dance, you just think about it and let me know

Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba

(RZA)
Rhumba? What's Rhumba?
I'm sayin though, what?
I'm sayin...

Yo, what up Butter Pec'? Girl, you got me shy to speak
You the same dime piece that I saw last week
On the dancefloor, yo, the way you bligh
Make a club of thugs do the Electric Slide
Pretty in pink, come here, let me buy you a drink
Armaretta sour orders put us both in sync'
My name is Bobby and I don't usually dance that much
I play the wall, but girl, you got that magic touch
That lured me in like a fly into the spider's web
Not these everyday hoes sweatin ghetto celebs
Powerule, I heard you got the good Power-you
Let's slip to my crib for an hour or two

Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba

(Method Man)
Hey, hey, hey...
Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Eh eh eh eh eh...
Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin?
It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True)
I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in
Your popi two-way beefin, let him know that you cheatin
Runnin 'round indecent exposed without no clothes
There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows
You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose
We can play doctor soon as I drop out ya bows

(Killa Sin)
I don't want to dance baby girl, it's like my legs is on strike
Boogie that ass to the bar, snatch a Remi, no ice
I'm in the corner, we can vibe all night
Polite, I need a bag of that grass
To blast me out of sight like a satellite
Bigga what up? Yo, long time, good to see you
Look at shorty ass shakin like the system in my vehicle
Clubbin, 20 deep, buggin, all types of funny freaks
Mouths wide shut, we let our love for the money speak

Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba

(Beretta 9)
Yo
Open season, open fire, Beretta barbed wire
First platoon strike soon, scud-missile on the whistle
Up in the club with the pistol
This chick bumped into me like, "You Dig', you ain't official"
Indeed, so? Blow out your back, yo
She was like, "Yo, nigro, nigro"
Puffin all that trash, you best to see so (so so)
So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, "I like that"
Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that
Flow and a half, blow at her back
I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back
She was like say her name
I was like, "Say mine back"
She was like, "Yo, daddy, daddy, daddy"
I love it like that, Beretta stay givin it
Power-you so good, I just might have to jizz in it

Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba

Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba

Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
