Quick fix and heart beats gets me...so easily
Now you got me on my knees
This will be the death of me
Tick-tock, time goes by

Hit me... so suddenly
How you knock me off my feet
I'm the Queen of Apologies

And I'm fighting this feeling
But it never stops, never stops
I'm still waiting
And I'm stuck with this feeling
Will it ever stop, ever stop
I keep trying

I blame no one but myself so honestly
Is this how its gonna be
Tell me, who's the enemy
Monkey on my back, keeps me...so desperately
How you got me on my knees
This will be the death of me

So sick of this feeling
But it never stops, never stops
I'm still waiting
And I'm stuck with this feeling
Will it ever stop, ever stop
You see I'm still shaking
And I'm fighting this feeling

This will be the death of me
I'm the Queen of Apologies

And I'm fighting this feeling
But it never stops, never stops
I'm still waiting
And I'm stuck with this feeling

Will it ever stop, ever stop
I keep trying
And I'm fighting this feeling
And I'm stuck with this feeling

Will it ever stop, ever stop
I keep trying

This will be the death of me
This will be the death of me
I'm the Queen of Apologies
This will be the death of me
