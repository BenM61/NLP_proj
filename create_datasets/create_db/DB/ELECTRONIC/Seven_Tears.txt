Seven tears have flown into the river

Seven tears are runnin' to the sea.
If one day they reach some distant waters

Then you'll know
it's sent with love from me.
Here I stand
head in hand
Lonely like a stranger on the shore.
I can't stand this feeling anymore.
Day by day
this world's all grey
And if dreams were eagles I would fly

But they ain't
and that's the reason why.
Seven tears have flown into the river
. . .

Oh
my darling
oh
my pretty lady

Golden star that leads to paradise.
Like a river's running to the ocean
I'll come back to you fourthousand miles.
Here I stand
head in hand . . .
Seven tears have flown into the river
. . .
Oh
my darling
oh
my pretty lady
. . .
Seven tears have flown into the river
. . .
Oh
my darling
oh
my pretty lady
. . .
