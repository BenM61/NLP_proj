We're just a bunch of buffalo's
Getting slaughtered
We're all Red Indians
We love firewater

You can call me Fred Flintstone
Tarzan King of the jungle
I guess I was a little prehistoric pumpkin
At your place this afternoon
I guess you just weren't interested
In getting drunk and trying to start a baby boom

No one said it's gonna be hard
It won't get better
