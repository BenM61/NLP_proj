I love your ass for bad or worse 
I love your nasty way you curse 
When you sit down, it's wild how you sit 
Grind your heel in the ground,
the groovy way you spit. 

Oh you look good, oh, you smell good 
Oh you taste good, like a bad girl should 

When I need love, I love how you feel 
When I need dough, I love how you steal 
I love your sick way you think 
The way your perfume makes you stink 

Oh you look good, oh, you smell good 
Oh you taste good, like a bad girl should

I love your boots your fancy clothes 
Your bouffant hair, your pantyhose 
I blow a gasket for your pink jellybean 
Your picnic basket splits my spleen
