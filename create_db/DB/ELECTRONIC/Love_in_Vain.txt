For quite a long time
I was making hard what's easy
I was running 'round in circles
When I bumped into you
Don't tell me that my love's in vain

I've had a second chance
And there's still a million others
Have I been fooling myself
To think that I could fool you
Don't tell me that my love's in vain

Oh worries all around
It's getting dark there's no denying
But just above the clouds
The sky is blue the sun's shining

I've had to much of dreamin'
I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Better not believin'
Than believe what's not true
Don't tell me that my love's in vain

If you make up your mind
Would I change so I would notice
Oh won't you tell me
What I ought to do
Don't tell me that my love's in vain

Oh worries all around
It's getting dark there's no denying
But just above the clouds
The sky is blue the sun's shining

Don't tell me that my love's in vain

You've had a second chance
And there's still a million others
You may be fooling youself
But you don't fool me too
Don't tell me that my love's in vain

Don't tell me that my love's in vain
Don't tell me that my love's in vain
Don't tell me that my love's in vain
Don't tell me that my love's in vain
Don't tell me that my love's in vain
