Lessons to be learnt but who's going to teach
Who's writing the rules, well I decree
A day of tragedy when love is lost
When a friend, when a friend is pissed off

Misunderstandings are so unfair
Psychoanalyse me please oh my friend
Let's begin, let confusion unravel around me

And, and if I give the pieces together
The way they make sense to me I'll do my best
But I can use only what I've seen from where I've been
And the lives that have lived before me
Who's going to look, who's going to cheek
No one can really say 'cause they're all dead
But we can try and only try to live with integrity

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here and

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Script you write and forces you fight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek

Oh no there's will and there's fate
Or random explosions everyday
Or is the world an orchestrated play
Or a clock, tick-tock, a clock work game
Us being the cogs and the product is time
Questions to evolve with the answers to find
Like what the hell, what the hell are we doing here anyhow

Yeah a gift it is to have everything
To fill our lines with happiness and what we desire
But only if you want it, only if you need it
Only if you brave it, only if you seek it
So be kind 'cause there's a piece of me in you
I'll be kind 'cause there's a piece of you in me
A piece of everyone somewhere elsewhere lesser and greater

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here and

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Script you write and forces you fight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Oh let's begin tonight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Script you write and forces you fight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek

Oh no there's will and there's fate
Or random explosions everyday
Or is the world an orchestrated play
Or a clock, tick-tock, a clock work game
Us being the cogs and the product is time
Questions to evolve with the answers to find
Like what the hell, what the hell are we doing here anyhow
What are we doing here
