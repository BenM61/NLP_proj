Don't know where you're going
Used to be a star
And everywhere you turn
They're raining on your fire
You're searching for an answer
Your hands and tongue are tied
And everything that you thought you knew
Is buried deep alive

You could take tomorrow
If you wanna
You should take tomorrow
But you gotta wanna

You think you've got it all
The writing is on the wall
You're praying to your Lord
Searching for your soul
Cause you just need to know
The emptiness will go
In a moment

I'm looking in the mirror
I'm talking to myself
Stare at my reflection
And I look like someone else
Ask myself a question
And I face another day
So I look myself out in the eyes
And I tell myself again

You could take tomorrow (all your life live in the moment)
If you wanna (all your life live in the moment)
You should take tomorrow (all your life live in the moment)
But you gotta wanna (all your life live in the moment)

You think you've got it all
The writing is on the wall
You're praying to your Lord
Searching for your soul
Cause you just need to know
The emptiness will go
In a moment

You think you're going to fall
Afraid you'll lose it all
You're praying to your God
Thanking for your love
And you just need to know
The hope is going to flow
In a moment

You think you've got it all
The writing is on the wall
You're praying to your Lord
Searching for your soul
Cause you just need to know
The emptiness will go
In a moment

You think you know it all
(Time is on your side)
Praying to your Lord
(Time will heal your mind)
Your think you're going to fall
(Then you'll learn to fly)

Time is on your side
Time will heal your mind
Then you'll learn to fly
