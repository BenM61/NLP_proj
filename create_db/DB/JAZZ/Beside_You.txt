To be beside you could I ask for more
Each thrill beside you so worth waiting for
Such lips never have been I'm in a spin when we touch lips
I go dancing in the sky
I sigh beside you through winter's storm
For here beside you I'm forever warm
I must be feeling day dreams it isn't any crime
To want to be beside you 'til there's no more time
I sigh beside you through winter's storm
For here beside you I'm forever warm
I must be feeling day dreams it isn't any crime
To want to be beside you 'til there's no more time
I want to be beside you 'til there's no more time
