The sheer sincere rap engineer's here
And wherever I go yo, you know my man Jay's near
More than up to par, styles indicate who we are
Like the gas-filled car, we're gonna go far

Business we've been takin' care of it I'm swearin' it
And we're aware of it cause our bank books are bearin' it
Every theme is extreme and supreme no bluff
And every is slap and oh so tough

But there's a time that I find yeah and it comes like a season
To wind down for no other reason than it's pleasin'
To take a break from employment and let loose
And reduce the pressure for sure pure enjoyment

We got the time so let's make it a good one
Soon we'll say back to the tunes and being top guns
And yet we'll never regret and say this is what we should've done
The clock she runs come on an let's have fun

Let's jump in the rides and cruise
Destination someplace a space anywhere we choose
Laughter food and good times will never fail ya
To hell with intoxicating paraphernalia

Well ya cold want to slap on slow song, square up
Pair up, stare down, hair down, sex long and strong
Keep on and don't quit it if it's F-you-N, hit it
Get it, but don't neglect preventions and limits

We can eve lounge in the crib watch some movies
Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, bum rush the refrigerator
Yo Jay pass the Pringles, I want a bit
(Cake Jaz, cake Jaz, gimme some of it)

Greenbacks every track that's what we're gonna get
Go out and spend a ton of it just for the fun of it
The room's vibratin', cause I can't stop
Yeah the girls are in the back blastin' that good ol hip-hop

Call up some friends disturb the peace
Play a smash by Jaz or Jay-Z's dope release
Like a Dove Bar freshly dipped so you see
