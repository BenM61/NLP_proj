Since you left
Things have changed
I got all the things
I said would come my way
I got paid got accolades
Now you barely recognize the life I've made

I thought you wanted what I wanted
You left me
Left me wanting you

Now I've got nothing
I've got nothing
If I've got everything but you
We had something that I've been missing
Since I've got everything
Everything but you
Everything
Everything but you

You know I got so much
But nothing's worth enough
To put a price on us

I thought you wanted what I wanted
You left me
Left me wanting you

Now I've got nothing
I've got nothing
If I've got everything but you
We had something that I've been missing
Since I've got everything
Everything but you
Everything
Everything but you

You know I got so much
Nothing's worth enough
To put a price on us
