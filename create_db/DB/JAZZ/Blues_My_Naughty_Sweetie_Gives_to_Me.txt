Who walks in when I walk out
Who gives you that 'Hi baby'?
Who's that who got me jealous of you?

Who walks in when I walk out
Don't you know you're my baby?
Who's that who got me worrying too?

When we kiss, I kinda miss
Something that used to be
Everyday, while I'm away

Who walks in when I walk out
Who gives you that 'Hi baby'?
Who's that who got me jealous of you?
