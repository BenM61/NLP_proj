Hypnotic,
Hypnotic,
You get your kick off
With little bit a hip hop
We rock the rooftop
The super sounds that you love
Zap, we back
And pappa's got a brand new bag
Full of tricks, beat the kicks
Rocking and shocking the hops the hips
The funky chicks
We change the riffs
Fashion, passion, misfits
Stand up proud, have no doubt,
Come on, shout it out!
I'm the real deal when I come around,
I freak you out, coming over ground

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic, hypnotic
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)

You get your kick off
With little bit a hip hop
We rock the rooftop
The super sounds that you love

I'm so blinded by the dazzling lights
I'm only guided by rhythms of the night
Hot bodies all around
Make me think I've found, the beat
And a heart synchronized (??) with mine

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)

You get your kick off
With little bit a hip hop
We rock the rooftop
The super sounds that you love
You get your kick off
With little bit a hip hop
We rock the rooftop
The super sounds that you love

Bound, to break
The boundaries, the estimate
The fool's roots
We overtake, we renegades stormin' the place
Breakin' and shakin' and chasing the bass
Bringin' it up on the front page
We're back, on time that is the sound
Come on, freak, sing it out
I'm the real deal when I come around
I freak you out, comin over ground

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)

Thrills, the chills, dominate the sex appeal,
Surreal, with the funk I feel, rebellious rockers acting ill.
Escapades and matinee's the breaks from the rat race,
The sound, the scratch, electroclash, the revelation, kickin' ya ass!!
The new phenomenon taking over town,
Feel the force, coming over ground.

I feel so electric, it really blows my mind
The kind of electric, I just take off and fly
Hot bodies all around
Make me think I've found, the beat
And a heart synchronized (??) with mine

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic, hypnotic
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic, hypnotic

Hypnotic!
