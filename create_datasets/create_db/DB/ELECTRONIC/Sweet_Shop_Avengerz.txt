Got no gaps in your teeth? You must be happy
Cola bottles, sugar coated
We've had sugar to eat, don't try and stop me
Flying saucers filled with sherbet

We want the right to eat sweets without yr frowning
Don't tell us what we can't do now
And we see the powers that be in sugar, drowning
Ten pee mixture for the way home

This is an advertisement
Hey, make way for the sweet shop avengerz
So make the sweet adjustment
A-okay, we're the sweet shop avengerz

Never too old to eat sweets, unless you feel it
Chocolate mice with strawberry center
Reclaim the rights to rot teeth, you know you need it
Candy shrimps, they're foamy inside

It's not a crime to be seen sucking a lolly
Vampire sweets that stick to your teeth
And it's hardly obscene to fill yr trolley
Ten pee mixture for the way home

This is an advertisement
Hey, make way for the sweet shop avengerz
So make the sweet adjustment
A-okay, we're the sweet shop avengerz

Kneejerk, it's a sugar fascination
Kneejerk, that infects the teen-see nation
Kneejerk, but we love the sweet sensation
Kneejerk, as it rots the population
