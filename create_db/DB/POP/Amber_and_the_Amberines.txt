Clearing road and landslide
Children of history
Changing from the inside
Non just because Che Guevara showed the way
Not just to shame the C.I.A.
Everyone needs to feel at home
Nobody wins who fights alone

Here's to the N.J.M.
Planning for the future
Women and men who dared raise our aspirations
Not just because Maurice Bishop told them to
Not just to change the western view
Everyone needs to feel at home
Nobody wins who fights alone

And here's to our friends like Chris
working in the classrooms
London to Mozambique
Nursing wounds of empire
Not just because revolution paved the way
Not just to be there on the day
Everyone needs to feel at home
Nobody wins who fights alone
