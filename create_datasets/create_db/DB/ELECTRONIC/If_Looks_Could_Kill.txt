The relationship between us
She looking so dangerous

She looks so good like that
And I can't do a thing about it

If looks could kill 
I want you to dance with me, dance with me , dance with me girl
If looks could kill 
I want you to dance with me, dance with me , dance with me girl

Baby, baby come look my way
Baby, baby come look my way
Way, way
If looks could kill

I don't know what to do about
When she is not around 

She looks so good like that
And I can't do a thing about it

If looks could kill 
I want you to dance with me, dance with me , dance with me girl
If looks could kill 
I want you to dance with me, dance with me , dance with me girl

Baby, baby come look my way 
Baby, baby come look my way 
Way, way
If looks could kill
