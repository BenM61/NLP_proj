I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going, first take
I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age, "But what about Jermaine?
"F*ck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move
'Til I'm provoked, when I see you, I'm a step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of mini-yous, runnin' round your backyard swimmin' pools
Over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up 
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
We'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry
That could save it when I'm gone and buried
To make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'm a only sting when I cornered
And I'm a only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
'Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give a f*ck
White-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill
Or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer so come along wit us?
Come on

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day
But I handled my business
Cause it' work before play, don't look for trouble
But I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way, you f*ck my night up
I'm a f*ck up your day, bullet with your name
Sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
And you'll die tryin' to violate it
F*ck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone 
And I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad
And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest
And invest in something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best, in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'm a die a sudden death
Five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe, to collect a fuckin' check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
