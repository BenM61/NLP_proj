Uh, uh-uh, nigga what nigga (Grimey)
Uh, uh-uh, part four nigga (Grimey)
Yo, yo, yo

It's like f*ck, it's King Tut jewelry, blind fury nigga
I smoke boogies, conspiracy theory
It's like I'm Malcolm, with just the X
These bitches swear they in love but it's just the X
Niggas act like, my coke ain't long in stress
Like I don't keep two shotguns, under my chest
I flip, obsolete see I'm the king of the streets
And show muh'fuckers how to rhyme on Neptunes' beats
In Miami, Pun shoulda, won the Grammy
This year I'll bring the shit home to his family
Go 'head, and keep hatin, until you receive
Mad volts in your chest plate, hard to breathe
See you a hater like Star & Buc, nigga what
And f*ck Tommy Boy, them niggaz just suck
I'm the ultimate, gun on my dick, hoes swallow my spit
Wanna drink every bottle I sip

Nigga when that heat, is bustin off
And the ambulance come, and rush you off
And the witness like - we don't know dem boys
Me and my niggaz goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey
Then we resume, hangin with stars
Then we live in fat houses and fat ass cars
Then we drive and scream - nigga F*CK the law
Me and my niggaz goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey

Yo, yo
I alternated with the greatest, upgraded my speech
We Violator violatin, y'all niggaz capiche?
It's unsafe like late night on (?) Beach
Drink some river ranches and get slurped at least
Let's have fun wit it, in the Bridge my niggaz dunn wit it
Niggaz had hit records, but we done did it
Pop a collar; see them chicks they like to holla N.O.!
You know them hoes already know they gotta swallow
Money like Nutty Professor - fat as f*ck
Four gold albums; ain't none of it luck
Brad Pitt, Fight Club shit, fuckin you up
Since you, seem so tense release the mutts
I'm connected, the police release my cuffs
Call me Fillmore, naw nigga cause I'ma feel more
Nigga this my year, you gonna feel Nore
Money we got it but still try and feel more

Nigga when that heat, is bustin off
And the ambulance come, and rush you off
And the witness like - we don't know dem boys
Me and my niggaz goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey
Then we resume, hangin with stars
Then we live in fat houses and fat ass cars
Then we drive and scream - nigga F*CK the law
Me and my niggaz goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey

Type of niggarole, we must be dunns (Grimey)
Toothbrush shanks and rusty guns (Grimey)
Nigga get popped can't hush me son (Grimey)
Sellin everything 'til they cuff me dunn (Grimey)
93 Ac' f*ck a Range nigga (Grimey)
Saliva at the mouth of your chain nigga (Grimey)
Reynolds wrap, coke, and doo-rags (Grimey)
Never cleanin up, nigga screw that (Grimey)

You see we unbreakable, y'all niggaz is uncapable
We 2G nigga we use gats that's untraceable
Still smokin, and niggaz know how I do it
Keep big shanks, shit'll cut in half your Buick
Just me and shorty, late night in the park 
And gettin so much brains I'm startin to feel smart
Off Beelzebub, feelin my love with cold heart
See these fake niggaz, my fists'll break niggaz
We switchin labels, now it's time to break niggaz
We switchin labels, now it's time to break niggaz

Hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey

Nigga when that heat, is bustin off
And the ambulance come, and rush you off
And the witness like - we don't know dem boys
Me and my niggaz goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey
Then we resume, hangin with stars
Then we live in fat houses and fat ass cars
Then we drive and scream - nigga F*CK the law
Me and my niggaz goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey

Violator - nigga what nigga (Grimey)
