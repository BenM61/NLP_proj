Another soldier from the Central with the 80 in my pocket
A nigga's knocked it and I fucked him like socket
Cleared his fuckin' ass, 'cause I never play the last place
So now he's walkin' with the muthafuckin' gas face

That's right, I'm burnin' muthafuckas like a arsonist
I have you walkin' like a crippled and retarded bitch
I never f*ck around when I'm with a team of fuckin' gangsters
West coast freestyle bangsters

Kickin' a foot up in yo ass like Pele
And prosecute like the muthafuckin' D.A.
I'm rollin' a small coupe drop through the hood of G's
And hittin' the chips on the undercover P I G's

I'm givin' a f*ck about naythin', muthafucka Satan
'Cause I'm the only nigga crematin'
Fool, the Prod came out heartless
The gang related, don't be another nigga on my shit list

I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin'
I got another gang story to tell, peep
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga
I got another gang story to tell, peep

Back up in the hood I thought you knew, oh punks you didn't know
Though you got a grip you're gettin' dropped like a sixty-fo'
I put my foot up in your ass so far
I'm leavin' prints on your neckline, signed Mr. Bogart

Another victim of society why did you lie to me?
So I gotta use my strap daily and take you muthafuckas out
It coulda been prevented but the niggas was sho' from the sto'
A.K.47 ways to heaven, I took 'em for a 211 and left his ass with 187
Just a another nigga dead and gone
He fell victim to the chrome as I punched in the gold broam

I roll the streets with a murder rep
I'm known for kickin' hoes and niggas' necks
And causin' 'em a instant death
Young niggas goin' in and comin' out winnin'
The gang story that a nigga's tellin'

I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin'
I got another gang story to tell, peep
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga
I got another gang story to tell, peep

I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin'
I got another gang story to tell, peep
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga
I got another gang story to tell, peep

South Central L.A. is the gang capital of the world
Where niggas walk around strapped daily
And won't hesitate to smoke yo ass in a minute
Take it from the Mouthpiece, this is just another gang Story

Back up in the hood, oh yes I'm back
I'm leavin' your fuckin' skull marinated in the heat as I creep
I'm stickin' my shoe up in your ass so far
My shoestring will look like hemorrhoids
As you're lyin' in the fuckin' morgue

I gives a f*ck when I creep
I told you I was evil as a nigga when I'm lyin' by the devil 'sleep
I let the slugs fly quick
The Tec-22 is in your ass like flies on shit

I'm from the depths down below, the ground ward
The graveyard, rockin' you niggas, 'cause I'm that hard
Rhimeson causin' havoc for the underground
You f*ck around, you lie around and yo, you hang around

I'm puttin' niggas on grave shift
The Glock-9 plays connect the dots off in your ass, bitch
The hardest nigga with a G slang
'94, here we go, muthafuckas, it's a G thang

I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin'
I got another gang story to tell, peep
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga
I got another gang story to tell, peep

Just another muthafucka who got tore down
Came home and beat his hoe down
Bust shots at the police and lost the showdown
Low down but now his little brother's stuck on payback

Rollin' through the hood and them little niggas stay strapped
What can I say, black? B.G. is heartless
Usin' one-time as targets, I warned you not to start this
'Cause he's down with some down-ass niggas from around the way
It be that way, they got they nuts off fo' deep and they down to play
Anything you hoes wanna do

We'll bust a right at the light, come back and bomb that corner, fool
Four young niggas ready to f*ck your cap up
Left three niggas dead and you thought they wouldn't act up?
Zip the sack up, and wipe the blood off of the flo'
Started some shit, and now they got everybody at each other's throats
Kinda fucked up but that's the way it be
These niggas don't be playin' on these muthafuckin' streets

I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin'
I got another gang story to tell, peep
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga
I got another gang story to tell, peep

I don't waste a minute, muthafuckas I be smokin'
I got another gang story to tell, peep
Sometimes I walk around strapped, nigga
I got another gang story to tell, peep
