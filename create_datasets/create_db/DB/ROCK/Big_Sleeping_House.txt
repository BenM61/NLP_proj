We went to a cheap hotel,
A no soap no sleep hotel,
The difference and for public scorn.
In the dead town where we were born,
How I hoped you wouldn't change your mind.
But until it was time to find,
She was even crazier than I

[Chorus]
In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
With the ghost to grin at you,
Afternoon,
Now please get out.

This the night before,
We've had a little
And we want some more,
It changed the world
And it makes us sweat,
Make no promises make no threats.

And I gave her what I give you now,
It was weak and it was built on sand.
And she, with both her hands.

[Chorus]

With the ghosts.

I heard you ran off to America,
She has position and possessions now,
And I bet you can't remember how.

In the big sleeping house,
Painted white,
Facing south,
We held my hands
Up to her face
And said damn this place
All

[Chorus]
