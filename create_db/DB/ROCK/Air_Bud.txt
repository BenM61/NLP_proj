Strange, strange days inside
My mind is daily changin
And it's charged by
The shifting tones of time flyin
Just in case you were wondering where I was

Strange, strange days inside
My mind is daily changin
As result of the black cloud comin down
Just in case you were watchin the horizon

(We want out and we want it now)
(We wanna take it outta town)
