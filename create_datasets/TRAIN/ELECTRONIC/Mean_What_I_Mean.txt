I shouldn't have to explain, it's so simple
But I'm doing you a favor
Seems you're lost in your brain, no signal
So I lay it on the table

Not the time, and I'm not playing
I know you've seen the signs, don't wanna read them
It's not fine, it's not okay
Boy all you gotta do right now is listen

I mean what I mean when I say so
Not tryna be mean when I say no
So don't play a fool and twist my rules
I mean what I mean when I say so
Not tryna be mean when I say no
So trust me, I mean what I mean
I mean what I mean
So trust me, I mean what I mean

Give it up, it's annoying (Give it up)
You wanna see me, gotta make an appointment (That's right)
I hit 'em with that "Oh no, I got a boyfriend" (Damn girl)
Yeah, he was acting like he ain't know what no meant (Nah)
I don't care about the paper you're getting
How you spending for my ship and then you still ain't hitting
Only see me sitting pretty so they saying I'm so Diddy
Can't you see me, nobody get me, and I will hurt feelings
Yeah, so keep your hands up off me
I get it if I want it, I don't care what you bought me
I touchdown, now he think he in the endzone
Called him little bird and put him back up in the friendzone
Laced up, all about the pay cut
If I say it then I mean it, ain't nobody made up (What?)
Bitty from the waist up, you can look but you can't touch
High heels and high standards, ain't gotta say much (Nah)

I mean what I mean when I say so
Not tryna be mean when I say no
So don't play a fool and twist my rules
I mean what I mean when I say so
Not tryna be mean when I say no
So trust me, I mean what I mean
I mean what I mean
So trust me, I mean what I mean

Better keep your hands to yourself
If you don't wanna see me get mental
I'm just here to have a good time
I would open that door if I wanted you to come in
See that's your final warning shot now

Uh, take cover, my girls all hover
When we see a creep, we put 'em to sleep, uh
Macaroni Tony in a ditch
'Cause he grabbed my ass and called me a bitch
Aluna shoulda called a lot sooner
Got wolves around the world, coulda sent one of my juniors
But now 47 here
And I brought re-enforcement to make sure we clear

I mean what I mean when I say so
Not tryna be mean when I say no
So don't play a fool and twist my rules
I mean what I mean when I say so
Not tryna be mean when I say no
So trust me, I mean what I mean
I mean what I mean

So trust me, so trust me
