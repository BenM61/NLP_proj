The moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life are free
The stars belong to everyone
They gleam there for you and me

The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine

And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free

Honey, the moon belongs to everyone
You know the best things in life are free
And the stars, they belong to everyone
They're shining up there for you and for me

The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine

And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free

The best things in life are free
