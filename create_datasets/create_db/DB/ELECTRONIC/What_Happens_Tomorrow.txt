Child, don't you worry
It's enough your growing up in such a hurry
Brings you down, the news they sell ya
To put in your mind that all mankind is a failure

But nobody knows
What's gonna happen tomorrow
We try not to show
How frightened we are

If you love me, I'll protect you
However I can
You've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end

Fighting because we're so close
There are times we punish those who we need the most
Though we can't wait for a saviour
Only got ourselves to blame for this behaviour

And nobody knows
What's gonna happen tomorrow
We try not to show
How frightened we are

Would seem lonely
If you were the only
star in the night?

You've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end
You've got to believe
It'll be alright again

Time is a ribbon, a silent icy river (froze us all)
Running deep, deep and fast
Enough to get lost down in the flow
Crashing around
These tiny lives mean everything

And nobody knows
What's gonna happen tomorrow
So don't let go
Now we've come this far

Hold my hand please
Understand me
You're never alone

We've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end
(Nobody knows)
You've got to believe
It'll be alright my friend
Da, da, da, da

And yes we believe
It'll be alright again
(Nobody knows)
