In better days I've been known to listen 
I go to waste all my time is missing 

I'm mapping out my ending, 
It's never gonna happen now 
These things are condescending 
With everybody backing down 

You pray to stars that can help you get by 
And all at once you forget to try 

I'd go there if you let me, 
They're never gonna find me now 
My life is always empty 
And in and out of doubt 

Your not coming back for me, these things they will never be 
I'm so used to being wrong, so put me where I belong 

I get back to you, 
God knows I try, 
But I still lose 
And I get back to you, 
These days run by, 
But I still lose 

Angels say they can make you suffer 
They give and take like a vicious lover 

When all this loses meaning, 
You'll never want it back somehow 
Awake but still I'm dreaming 
And never waking up 

Alone, where I'm not alone
