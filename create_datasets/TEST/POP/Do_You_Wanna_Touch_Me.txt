We've been here too long
Tryin' to get along
Pretendin' that you're oh so shy
I'm a natural ma'am
Doin' all I can
My temperature is runnin' high

Cry at night
No one in sight
An' we got so much to share
Talking's fine
If you got the time
But I ain't got the time to spare
Yeah

Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch me there, where
Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch me there, where
There, yeah

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Every girl an' boy
Needs a little joy
All you do is sit an' stare
Beggin' on my knees
Baby, won't you please
Run your fingers through my hair

My, my, my
Whiskey and rye
Don't it make you feel so fine
Right or wrong
Don't it turn you on
Can't you see we're wastin' time, yeah

Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch me there, where
Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch (Yeah)
Do you want to touch me there, where
There, yeah
