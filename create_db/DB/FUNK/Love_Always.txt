I got a secret for you
Can't believe myself
But ever since you've been gone
I think of no one else
I've even tried to forget
But nothing can make me
I know that it's so hard to be true
Under the summer skies
I'll write your name in my cook
At a thousand times
And every day you're away
It's drivin' me crazy

So I'll write you every night
And I'll sign my name ?Love always?
And even if the sun falls down
I will always be around
Forever and always
Darlin', if we both can wait
We'll have a time to celebrate
For the rest of our lives, love always

And lots of people I know
Try to shake your mind
But that can't happen to me
I'm not the jealous kind
No one can change what I feel
And nothing can make me

Still I'll write to every night
And I'll sign my name, ?Love always?
And even if the sun falls down
I will always be around
Forever and always
Darlin', if we can wait, oh
We'll have a time to celebrate
For the rest of our lives, love always
For the rest of our lives, love always
For the rest of our lives

We'll always be
So faithfully
Just hang on to me forever

So I'll write to every night
And I'll sign my name, ?Love always?
Oh, and if by now you haven't guessed
I will let one more be asked
For the rest of our lives, love always
For the rest of our lives, love always

I'll sign this letter to you ?Love always?
Oh, no
Oh oh oh
Oh, and if I do over and over again
Sign my name over in full
And at the end and rest of our lives, love always
Love always
Ooh
Sounds so good to me, oh
For the rest of our lives love always, oh
For the rest of our lives love always, oh
Oh, I, I gotta sing it for you
I don't wanna stop, sounds so good to me
Always
