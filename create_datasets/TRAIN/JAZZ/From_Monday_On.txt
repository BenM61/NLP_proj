Every day was blue day, 
'Til you loved me true, 
Say, all my cares have run away! 

(Scatting) 
From Monday on 
My cares are over, 
From Monday on 
I'll be in clover; 
We picked on Monday 
Because it's wash day, 
And we'll wash 
Our blues away. 
From Monday on 
The skies'll look bright; 
Don't tell me different, 
I know I'm right! 
I'm gonna start shoutin', "Hey, hey!" 
When he says, "Love, honor and obey;" 
I'll be happy 
From Monday on!
