Gentlefolk of Newport
Or should I say "hats and cats,"
Please lend an ear
That you all may hear
Some shimmering sharps and flats.
For those cosy virtuosi,
known as "hipsters" to the trade,
wish to show you now
Precisely how
Jazz music is made.

Take some skins,
Jazz begins,
Take a bass
Steady pace,
Take a box,
One that rocks,
Take a blue horn New Orleans-born.
Take a stick
With a lick,
Take a bone,
Dixie-grown,
Take a spot,
Cool and hot,
Now you has jazz jazz jazz, jazz, jazz.

Now you has,
Now you has,
Now you has,
Now you has,
Now you has,
Now you has,
Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz,
Now you
Has,
Now you
Has,
Now you
Has,
Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz.

Jazz
Jazz 
Jazz 
Jazz 
Jazz 
Jazz 
Now you has jazz, 
Now you has jazz,
Now you has jazz

If you sail
Over the sea,
Take my tip
They're all molto hip
In Italy.
As for France,
Believe it or not,
Frenchmen all 
prefer what they call
"Le Jazz Hot."
Take a plane
Go to Siam,
In Bangkok
Today, 'round the clock,
They have a jam.
Indians on
the Amazon
Beat one bar
and all of 'em are
gone, man, gone.
From the Equator
Up to the Pole,
Through the air
you hear everywhere
Rock and roll.
From the East
Out to the West,
Jazz is king,
'Cause jazz is the thing
Folks
Dig
Best.
