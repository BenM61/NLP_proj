As soon as I arrive i forget why I even came
And I can feel the pulse take control but it's all still the same
See I get so pushed back when I ran laps inside of my head
Go out and put headphones on and wish you were here

So, pick me up, until now i've been out of my head
Pick me up where I'm found get me outta my head oh oh oh woah
Pick me up, turn around

So write your name on the palm of my hand, let's start again
with the sun in my eyes I can trace your outline

So, pick me up, until now i've been out of my head
Pick me up where I'm found get me outta my head oh oh oh woah
Pick me up, until now i've been out of my head
So pick me up soon enough we'll forget everything
Pick me up, turn around

Why can't I read your mind like you do mine all of the time

Pick me up, until now i've been out of my head
Pick me up where I'm found get me outta my head
Oh pick me up, until now i've been out of my head
With the sun in my eyes I can trace your outline
So pick me up, turn around
