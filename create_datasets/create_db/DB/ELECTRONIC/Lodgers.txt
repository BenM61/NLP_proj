No peace for the wicked, only war on the poor
They're batting on pickets, trying to even the score
It's all inclusive, the dirt comes free
And you can be all that you want to be
Oh an equal chance and an equal pay
But equally there's no equal pay
There's room on top, if you tow the line
And if you believe all this you must be out of your mind

There's only room for those the same
Those who play the leeches game
Don't get settled in this place
The lodger's terms are in disgrace

Get 'cha brains blown out, in a captain's mess
Stand for the queen if you can stand the test
It's all thrown in and the lies come free
And you can be all that they want you to be

Oh if you work hard you can be the boss
But if you don't work at all then that's nobody's loss
There's room on top, if you dig in low
And the idea is what they reap you sow

With an old school tie and a reference
You can cover up crimes in their defense
It's all thrown in and the lies come free
And you can be all that they want you to be
