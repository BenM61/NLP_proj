With the eyes of a child the wonder of it all
I used to search the stars at night and I felt so safe and small
Sweet sounds from a Mercy town and my nursery God

I wanted to ride with Yuri Gagarin as he circled all around my world
Hearthammer and I lose control
Hearthammer

Lying under the covers. Radio on
Settle down with Caroline as she sailed all summer long
Sweetheart of the Rodeo
Mining Hearts of Gold

I think it was somewhere post Rubber Soul
Hearthammer and I lose control
Hearthammer
Hearthammer and I lose control
Hearthammer

There was the first caress
There were the Labour years
There was the man that walked the moon something I never really believed
The Di Stefano twists the Charlton goals

Now I'm still here with the eyes of a child the wonder never grows old
Hearthammer and I lose control
Hearthammer 
Hearthammer and I lose control
Hearthammer
Hearthammer and I lose control
Hearthammer
The wonder never grows old
