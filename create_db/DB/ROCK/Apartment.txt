I've got a new apartment baby,
And it protects me from the lonely whistling streets,
And I've got a new apartment baby,
The interior color is red,
And my only friend is my stereo receiver,
Playing my favorite song all night long,
Ahh 

I've got a new apartment baby,
Interior color of red,
And I see a new appointment maybe,
Advertised for me,
And I've got a new singer and I've got a new song x2
And I whistle along,
All night long,
Is she coming?

I've got a new apartment baby,
And it protects me from the whistling streets,
And I got a new singer and I got a new song,
I did not advertise a singer, I did not advertise this song,
But I whistle along,
Is she coming?

And I've got good accommodation and I stay in all the time.
