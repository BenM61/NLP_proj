Once burned, twice shunned
Too much of your line made me blind.
I'd wait all night
But you left one too many times.

I want to change my orbit
Don't care what you do now.
I want to live in darkness
Don't want to be spun around.

You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you.
Come back round, round, round
You son of a gun.

You go down, down, down.
This time I won't save you
When you drown, drown, drown
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.

Birds sing for you,
You can make the blue sky blush
You've got them all fooled
But I am burned out on this rush.

I want to change my orbit
Don't care what you do now.
I want to live in darkness
Don't want to be spun around.

You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you.
Come back round, round, round
You son of a gun.

You go low, low, low.
This time I won't save you
When you go, go, go
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.

Red sky creepin'
Disappearing
Bye-bye feeling
Heart you're stealing

You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you.
Come back round, round, round
You son of a gun.

You go down, down, down.
This time I won't save you
When you drown, drown, drown
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
