What the f*ck is going on?
Ya got 5-0 knocking at my door six in the morning(six in the morning)
I think ya betta let it go I told you once before that we ain't fucking no more
I reminisce on how I used to trick spent all why money for that roley on ya wrist
But now its not the same 'cause you caught up in the game
Its funny how money change things

Girl you got me up in court now trying to get all of my dough 
Better flip what you been getting 'cause you ain't gon' get no more

I got's the baby mama drama 
Enough to want to make ya scream and holla
She trying to get me for my dollas
Ain't nuthin' but that baby mama drama
Baby mama drama enough to want to make ya scream and holla
She got me reaching for my bottle
Ain't nuthin' but that baby mama drama

That's it I'm sick of your shit
I'm 'bout to bring it to ya 
Got to handle it
I'm bout to flip but I don't want to loose my cool
Believe me ya don't want to see me break fools
Straight wild out, bitch you don't know what I'm about
So go get yo' peoples I'll straight run up in his mouth
See back on black street shit was sweet 
But you want more dough
Try to try me in your jeep

Girl you got me up in court now trying to get all of my dough 
Better flip what you been getting 'cause you ain't gon' get no more

I got's the baby mama drama 
Enough to want to make ya scream and holla
She trying to get me for my dollas
Ain't nuthin' but that baby mama drama
Baby mama drama enough to want to make ya scream and holla
She got me reaching for my bottle
Ain't nuthin' but that baby mama drama
