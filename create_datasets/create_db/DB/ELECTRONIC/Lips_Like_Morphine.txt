I want a girl with lips like morphine,
Knock me out every time they touch me.
I wanna feel a kiss just crush me,
And break me down.

Knock me out (knock me out),
Knock me out (knock me out).
Cause I've waited for all my life,
To be here with you tonight.

I want a girl with lips like morphine,
Blow a kiss that leaves me gasping.
And I wanna feel that lightening strike me,
And burn me down.

Knock me out (knock me out),
Knock me out (knock me out).
Cause I've waited for all my life,
To be here with you tonight.
Just put me on my back,
Knock me out again.

I want a girl with lips like morphine,
Knock me out every time they touch me.
I want a girl with lips like morphine,
To knock me out.

See I've waited for all my life,
To be here with you tonight.
Just put me on my back,
Knock me out again.
