I hate the neighbours, they hate me too
The fear and the fury make me feel good
So don't have a meltdown, it's only a dream
How did we get here? And how do we leave?

Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now

Be honest
You want it
Be honest
You want it

Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
Lord, I see a fever dream before me now
