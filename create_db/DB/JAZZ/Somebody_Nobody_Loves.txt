I'm somebody nobody loves
Oh me oh my my my
I'm somebody nobody loves
I wonder why why why

Although I know it sounds alarming
I've prayed on bended knee
For that certain gay Prince Charming
Who was meant for me

I've got to find me a somebody soon
Or else I'll die die die
I take the man in the moon
If he would give me a try
I'm just a lonely Cinderella
That romance passes by
I'm somebody nobody loves
Oh me oh my

If you feel the fates are against you
'Cause the best things in life pass you by
Look at me
Look at me

I've sent lots of letters to cupid
But he's a hard-to-get guy
Look at me 
Oh, look at me

I'm somebody nobody loves
Oh me oh my my my
I'm somebody nobody loves
I wonder why why why

Although I know it sounds alarming
I've prayed on bended knee
For that certain gay Prince Charming
Who was meant for me

I've got to find me a somebody soon
Or else I'll die die die
I take the man in the moon
If he would give me a try
I'm just a lonely Cinderella
That romance passes by
I'm somebody nobody loves
Oh me oh my
