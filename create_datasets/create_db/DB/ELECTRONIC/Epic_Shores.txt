Though I'm falling apart it seems
You're giving me all I need
To weather the storm
Hold tight, I'll be along in dreams
Life is about to be
Like never before

When you breathe
You put me on my knees
And you hold my gaze
When I close my eyes
I'm closer than ever
It took me forever
To feel this way

When you speak
The pain is a pleasure
It only gets better
A fever that burns me slow
And now I've seen your face
You're part of a life that I want
And I won't let go

Long nights guarding a broken dream
Looking to days gone by
Instead of the future
Whole lives lost in the dark it seems
You give me what we all need
A reason to be here

When you breathe
The welcome warmth I feel
Your welcome voice I hear
And when I close my eyes
I'm closer than ever
The pain is a pleasure
If I feel this way
When you speak

I swallow what you say
I feed on what you are
And now I've seen your face
You know I can't be close
But I'm not so far
