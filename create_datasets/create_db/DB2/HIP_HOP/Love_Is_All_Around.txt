Hey, glad to see you
You, what a pleasure to meet you
From where I am, you're looking good to me
From where I am, is where you ought to be
You feel it, every day
Something's in the air, whenever we get it together

Love is all around
And when you feel it all around

Hey, glad to see you
You, looking very familiar
From where I am is where you ought to be
From where I am is where we need to be
You feel it, every day
Picks you up and on your way

Love is all around
And when you feel it all around
I know, I know, I know
Love is all round
And when you feel it all around
I know, I know, I know
Love is all around
All around
All around
All around
