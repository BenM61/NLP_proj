When I feel like
They're closing in on me
I can't take any more,
I walk away
And find an open door
When it seems like
I've got my
Back against the wall
You look my way
I know I'm not alone
Call it misbehaviour
Call it what you like
But all this misbehaving
Is just what I need tonight
Oh, you're not alone
When you feel like
There's no reason
No rhyme at all,
Look my way
It's not the end of the world
Call it misbehaviour
Call it what you like
But all this misbehaving
Is just what you need tonight
Call it misbehaviour
Call it what you like
But is it misbehaving
If you get what you want tonight?
So if it feels like
You're losing it
Don't let go
Don't hold it back
You've got to let me know
And when it seems like
They're closing in on you
Unlock that door
Look around
Can't you see that there's got to be more
Let it all go
We'll go all the way tonight
Call it misbehaviour
Call it what you like
But all this misbehaving
Is just what we need tonight
Call it misbehaviour
They can call it what they like
But is it misbehaving
If we get what we want tonight?
Call it misbehaviour
Call it what you like
But all this misbehaving
Is what we need tonight
Call it misbehaviour
Call it what you like
But are we misbehaving
If we get what we want tonight
