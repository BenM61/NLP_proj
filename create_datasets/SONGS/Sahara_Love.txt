When I see your face I feel the sun inside me rise
And everything awakens in this sweet paradise
If there's anything I can do for you (Let me know)
When your bones are cold and you're blue

And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love
And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love
And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love
And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love

When I see you face I feel the edges start to thaw
And the seas give up their treasure to the shore
If you need me oh, I'll be there for you (Let me know)
When your bones are cold and you're blue

I hope my love will warm you through
And be the city lights coming into view
I'll put my arms all the way around you
And forever peace will surround you

Forever
Forever
Forever, peace will surround you
'Cause the arms of the sun have found you

And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love
And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love
And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love
And I will be sending you all of my Sahara love
