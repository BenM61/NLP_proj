We pulled out of Charlotte
The snow is fallin' down
We make our way in a one eagle sleigh
'Til we reach another town
Our name is in lights on the billboard sign
In every town we play
But if you may, all it really need say
Are gypsies, gypsies on parade

We pull in to a diner
Folks just stop and stare
You here 'em say man
It's a rock 'n' roll band
By the look and the clothes they wear
Then you telephone home
'Cause you're feelin' alone
And try to think of somethin' to say
Seems all you get
Are tears of regret
For being gypsies, gypsies on parade

Gypsies on parade
Vagabonds that got it made
