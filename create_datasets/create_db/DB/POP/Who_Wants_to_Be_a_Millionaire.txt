Who wants to be a millionaire?
I don't
Have flashy flunkies everywhere?
I don't
Who wants the bother of a country estate?
A country estate is something I'd hate
Who wants to wallow in champagne?
I don't
Who wants a supersonic plane?
I don't
And I don't, 'cause all I want is you

Who wants to be a millionaire?
I don't
Who wants uranium to spare?
I don't
Who wants to journey on a gigantic yacht?
Do I want a yacht?
Oh, how I do not
Who wants a fancy foreign car?
I don't
Who wants to tire of caviar?
I don't
Who wants a marble swimming pool too?
I don't
And I don't 'cause all I want is you

Who wants to be a millionaire?
I don't
And go to every swell affair?
I don't
Who wants to ride behind a liveried chauffeur?
A liveried chauffeur, do I want?
No sir!

Who wants an opera box, I'll bet?
I don't
And sleep through Wagner at the Met
I don't
Who wants to corner Cartiers too?
I don't
And I don't 'cause all I want is you
