Show me love, better love)
Show me love, better love)

I cried myself to sleep again
You lie right there, but I've learned nothing
I do my best to ease your pain
And here we are, but we've learned nothing

And it's killing me
When I'm in your arms
I forget the darker days
And it's haunting me
These feet of mine
Won't let me march away

Don't ask me how
But I always thought that we could have a better love
When you lay me down
I forget that all I want is a better love

Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love

I hurt myself again today
You lie right there and you say nothing
I do my best to leave this pain
But here we are and we've learned nothing

And it's killing me
When I'm in your arms
I forget the darker days
And it's haunting me
These feet of mine
Won't let me march away

Don't ask me how
But I always thought that we could have a better love
When you lay me down
I forget that all I want is a better love

Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love
Show me a better love
Show me a better, better love

Show me love, better love
Show me love, better love

And it's killing me
When I'm in your arms
I forget the darker days
And it's haunting me
These feet of mine
Won't let me march away

Show me a better, a better love (show me a better love)
A better love (show me a better love)
Show me a better love, a better love, better love (show me a better love)
Show me a better love
