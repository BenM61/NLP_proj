I heard a train whistle blowin', people was a yellin'
There's a man on the railroad track
By the river, brown sack on his back

Well, don't look now, honey, no, no
You'll see what they'll see right now
They see a fool blind by love and you see me

I heard a truck horn blowin', dogs just a barkin'
There's a man in the middle of the street
Against the red light, sittin' there rubbin' his feet

Well, don't look now, honey, no, no
You'll see what they'll see right now
They see a fool blind by love and you see me

I heard a boat whistle blowin', people was a yellin'
There's a man on the dock of the bay
About to jump and want (Incomprehensible) to back him up

Well, don't you look now, honey, no, no
You'll see what they'll see right now
They'll see a fool blind by love and you'll see me

I heard a train whistle blowin', people was a yellin'
There's a man on the railroad track
By the river, brown sack on his back

Well, don't look now, honey, no, no
You'll see what they'll see right now
They see a fool blind by love and you'll see me
They'll see a fool blind by love and you'll see me
Baby, baby, fool blind by love and you'll see me

Fool blind by love, fool blind by love
Fool blind by love, fool blind by love
