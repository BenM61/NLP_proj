Yea we've been strangers living in a wonderland
Seems you've been busy building castles in the sand
I heard the word you said inside my loving bed
And I've seen the scars I left inside your loving head
Oh, oh, let it be
Inside my head I'm not the one you see

I gotta dance, dance, dance
Gotta get on up, gotta get on down
Dance, dance, dance
Gotta make 'em laugh, gotta make 'em frown
Dance, dance, dance,
Dance, dance, dance
And if you think you can make it just remember to beware
That all in love is fair

The situation vacant now has got the blues
The obituary column's making front page news
Infatuation's got the better of you
And if you wanna know then what you gotta do
Is oh, oh save your soul
Inside my head I'm not the one you know

I gotta dance, dance, dance
Gotta get on up, gotta get on down
Dance, dance, dance
Gotta make 'em laugh, gotta make 'em frown
Dance, dance, dance,
Dance, dance, dance
And if you think you can make it just remember to beware

Oh, oh, save your soul
Inside my head I'm not the one you know

I gotta dance, dance, dance
Gotta get on up, gotta get on down
Dance, dance, dance
Gotta make 'em laugh, gotta make 'em frown
Dance, dance, dance,
Dance, dance, dance
And if you think you can make it just remember to beware
That all in love is fair
