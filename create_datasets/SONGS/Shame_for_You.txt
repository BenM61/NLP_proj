I've been thinking that you've crossed the line
If you disagree, well, that will be just fine
'Cause you waste my time and waste my money
And you'r not too cool and your not so funny!
Spreading your seed all over the town
Getting too greedy and messing around
Oh my gosh, you must be joking me
If you think that you'll be poking me

Don't take me on, no, no
Don't take me on, no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn, I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame for you

Please don't come around and knock on my door
'Cause I don't want to have to pick you up of the floor
When you ask if we can still be lovers
I'll have to introduce my brothers
I think that they could teach you a lesson or two,
By the time they've finished you'll be black and blue
You'll be crying like a baby,
A sea of tears they'll call the navy in

Don't take me on, no, no
Don't take me on, no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn, I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame for you

No, no, no, no, no, no

Don't take me on, no, no
Don't take me on, no, no
Don't take me on
Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny cos my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn, I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame for you
Shame, shame, shame, shame for you
