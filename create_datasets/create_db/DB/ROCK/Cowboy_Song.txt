I am just a cowboy, lonesome in the trail.
Starry night, campfire light, and the coyote calls where the howlin' winds will.
So I ride out to the ol' sundown. I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.
Lord I'm just thinking about a certain female.
And the nights we spent together, riding on the range.
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.

Roll me over and turn me around. Let me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.

I was took in Texas, I did not know her name.
But Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.
But down below the border, in a town in Mexico,
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.

Roll me over ans turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.

Roll me over, and I'll turn around.
And I'll move my fingers up and down.
Up and down.

It's ok amigo, just let me go.
Riding in the rodeo.

Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinning till I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.
Roll me over and set me free, the cowboy's life is the life for me.
