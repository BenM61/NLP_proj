It started out today
I feel alive and the air has changed
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
It's taken an age just to
Find a way but I made it through
I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone

These are the days, this is the place where I belong
Lost in another world, I believe our time will come
We shift and we change, I took a long time coming round
But I'm standing here, still standing here
I await for a breath, I'm coming up for air

One look away
The lost chance and the plans I've made
They come and go, they come and go
Took off on the silver years
The fault lines and the cracks appear
They come and go, they come and go

These are the days, this is the place where I belong
Lost in another world, I believe our time will come
We shift and we change, I took a long time coming round
But I'm standing here, still standing here
I await for a breath, I'm coming up for air
