Well I'm just waiting for my chance to come,
Just a silhouette against the rising sun,
Watch the water, watch the sky,
Count the days as they go by,
I'm just waiting for my chance to come,

Well it takes real guts to be alone,
Going head to head with the great unknown,
But there is no sweeter sound, on the kings round I'm bound,
And just waiting for your chance to come,

'Cause it's hard to feel like, you're worth something in this life,
When you're walking next to me, I can hear my body speak,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,

Your immortal smile is burned in me,
When I close my eyes its all see,
Among the canyons and the stars,
You're the guide inside my heart,
I'm just waiting for my chance to come,

And you're just looking for a way outta here,
Yeah, a way to see this old life all disappear,
Take a gamble on your heart, it will lead you through the dark,
You're just waiting for your chance to come,

'Cause it's hard to feel like, you're worth something in this life,
When you're walking next to me, I can hear my body speak,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,

And no one's gonna get in my way,
Gonna figure it out for myself,
Yeah no one's gonna make me stay,
Gonna figure it out for myself,

'Cause I don't need nothing,
I'm just waiting for my chance to come.
