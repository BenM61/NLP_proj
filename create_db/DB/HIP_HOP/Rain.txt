Sometimes it's soft as a misting rain
That gently touches my soul
It cools the fire that burns in me
And I simply lose control
So just

Rain down (on) on me
Let you're love just fall like rain drops
Rain on me
Just
Rain down (on) on me
Let you're love just shower me
Just rain on me

Full as a dam at capacity
My passion's about to explode, yeah
I can't escape, it's surrounding me
I'm caught in a storm
That I don't need no shelter from

Rain down (on) on me
Let you're love just fall like rain drops
Rain on me
Just
Rain down (on) on me
Let you're love just shower me
Just rain on me

Shower me
Sprinkle me
Fall down on me
(You're love just fall on me)

Fall down, fall down on me
Let it
Fall down, fall on me
Just

Rain down (on) on me
Let you're love just fall like rain drops
Rain on me
Just
Rain down (on) on me
Let you're love just shower me
Just rain on me
