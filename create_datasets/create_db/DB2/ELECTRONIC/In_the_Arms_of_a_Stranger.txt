Bam bam bam bam, bam bam bam bam bam
Bam bam bam bam, bam bam bam bam bam
Bam bam bam bam, bam bam bam bam bam (ooh ooh)
Bam bam bam bam, bam bam bam bam bam
I was sixteen with a rocket
And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Little flame that we pretend doesn't glow

You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remember your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

Ah ooh, ooh ooh
Ah ooh, ooh ooh
There were times I think about us
Overcome by the nostalgias
I am on call when you need me, let me know
But we're drifting in a strange way
I'm aware that it's a mistake if I love you
It's a mistake if I don't

You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remember your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

Ah ooh, ooh ooh
Ah ooh, ooh ooh
And she smelled like Michigan
And it felt like lust
And the nostalgia's killing me
And it's all because

Oh
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, rememberin' your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, stranger, stranger
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, rememberin' your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm knocked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Woo
