I don't want you to give it all up
And leave your own life collecting dust
And I don't want you to feel sorry for me
You never gave us a chance to be

And I don't need you to be by my side
And tell me that everything's all right
I just wanted you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?

I did enough to show you that I
Was willing to give and sacrifice
And I was the one who was lifting you up
When you thought your life had had enough
And when I get close you turn away,
There's nothing that I can do or say
So now I need you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?

Is it me? Is it you?
Nothing that I can do
To make you change your mind

Is it me? Is it you?
Nothing that I can do
Is it a waste of time?

Is it me? Is it you?
Nothing that I can do
To make you change your mind

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
(what is it I have to say?)
So why are you running away?
(to make you admit you're afraid)
Why are you running away?
