All dressed up you're good to go
Checkin' your style from head to toe
Hooked up and natural
You're feeling beautiful
9 times out of 10 you know
Late night club like a video with the
Hot stuff top stuff we got stuff oh

What a night so far
Pulling up curb side in your car
What a sight you are
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

Girl it's time to let you know
I'm down if you want to go
We can take it nice and slow
We got until tomorrow
UK style UK flow
We got you hot like whoa
With the hot stuff top stuff we got stuff

What a night so far
Pulling up curb side in your car
What a sight you are
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

I'll tell you this for a fact fact
A lot of ladies step up on a fat track
Leave your fella in the corner
With his starter cap
Show me how to act
Show me love where you at

What a night so far
Pulling up curb side in your car
What a sight you are
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by
