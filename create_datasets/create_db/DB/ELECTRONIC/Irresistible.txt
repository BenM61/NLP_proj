Irresistible baby you are
Irresistible baby you are

I lay awake at night, you're on my mind
I know the things I said were far from being kind
Sometimes the hurt inside can cloud the dream
And now I've hurt you saying things I didn't mean
The downright power of emotion
Will not threaten my devotion
I'm forever waiting for you
Irresistible baby you are
You are you are
You're so adorable baby you are
You are you are

You got a part of me inside your soul
I need you here with me in order to be whole
They say a broken heart will mend in time
But don't you realise forever isn't mine
How come often things that we do
Seem so meaningless without you
Believe me baby when I tell you

Irresistible baby you are
You are you are
You're so adorable baby you are
You are you are

Oooh ooh ooh and if I turned you away
I know there'd never be another
And for the rest of my life
I know I never would recover
Oh, oh, oh

Irresistible baby you are
You are you are
You're so adorable baby you are
You are you are

Irresistible baby you are
You are you are
You're so adorable baby you are
You are you are

Irresistible
Irresistible
Irresistible
Baby

Irresistible
Irresistible
Irresistible
Yeah baby

Irresistible
Irresistible
Irresistible
Baby

Irresistible
Irresistible
Irresistible
