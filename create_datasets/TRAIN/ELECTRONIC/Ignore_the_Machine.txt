Sun arise come every morning
Sun arise come every morning
Bringing back the warmth to the ground!
I live in Siberia,

Through no fault of my own.
We're a blank generation,
In the danger zone
Paracidal slumbers from 7 to 23...
Only the blind follow me.

Abyssinia in the morning,
Breakfast in Berlin.
Oh!
You leave me dying...

'Cause everybody wants what everybody's got
And everybody's got what everybody wants
Soldier lies bleeding where a church once stood
Ignore the machine
Ignore the machine.

Couldn't get to sleep this morning
I watched the sky
I couldn't see
There weren't no warning
I watched you burn last night.

'Cause everybody's got what everybody wants
Everybody wants what everybody's got
Soldier lies bleeding where a church once stood
Ignore the machine
Ignore.

Everybody wants what everybody's got
And everybody's got what everybody needs
Soldier lies bleeding
Oh you leave me dying.

Everybody's got what everybody wants
Everybody wants what everybody's got
Everybody wants what everybody's got
And everybody needs.
