I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

My design one of a kind, yeah I'm on my grind 
Got a shorty that still trip, but I ain't lost my mind 
I just party and bullshit, my attitude, I'm good ma 
They say I'm hood rich because I drive big cars 
Getting guac 
Middle finger to cops 
They say when you meet the one, all the thug should stop 
I met this shorty the other morning, on my way in y'all 
She was bad, I didn't call, I'm a day in y'all 
But, that's the rules, we don't make em, we don't break em 
I don't sweat em, I forget em and find a way to shack em 
But, I put a holla to her, I spit some lava at her 
She from the burbs, I'm from the jecks, trust that don't matter 
She into books too, I'm off the books for the things I do 
But that's between me and you 
And I don't really full tag it a lot, I'm in the wagon a lot 
With different dimes on the passenger side 
I'm like

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

Everyday I'm on my mind, but my minds on you (on you) 
All the time (all the time) 
And I scoop you like a solja' would 
I'm in the woods, top down, like I don't got a hood 
They say opposites attract, and it's true 
Cause girl I'm from the gutter, where the bundles will move 
And you, is from where its cool and quiet at night 
And ain't no young'ns supplying the white, right 
But that's a different story, lets get back to the night 
And you've got a body, I can handle it right?, right 
And I know you heard about me, beyond the rumors about me 
I'm the fliest a little youngin' could be, be 
And you'll see with us together, its money, diamonds, whatever 
Little momma is you riding with me?, me 
And I love the thing you do, so baby girl never change 
And forever we can do that thing 
Cause

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Give me your number I'm gonna call you lady 
And maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

Now you know my stees' 
Cause I ain't gotta smooth that to do that thing 
And it only took a night to get it right, grip it right, hit it right 
Figure out that you a rider for life, down for whatever 
We go through it together 
You know the boys style, way beyond all the regular 
I need a switch, like a fein need a fix 
Every g, need a down ass chick, to click 
That's sick

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster 

I love, love that thing you do 
And I, I can't get my eyes, my mind off you 
I'm infatuated 
And your my baby, and you complete me 
Your number, I'll call, and maybe we can hook up later 
And keep it gangster
