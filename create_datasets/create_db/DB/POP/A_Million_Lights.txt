A million lights
Hanging on the world tonight
I see 'em reaching down
Dancing on the evening tide

For You
All the stars are singing
With You
Every day I'm feeling
Alive

A million days
In everyone, I've seen Your face
I know I'll never be alone
Even darkness comes awake

For You
All the stars are singing
With You
Every day I'm feeling
Alive

For You
All the stars are singing
And You
I can feel You reaching
For You
All the stars are singing
With You
Every day I'm feeling
Alive

All the stars are singing (all the stars are singing)
Every day I'm feeling
Alive

All the stars are singing (a million lights)
All the stars are singing (a million lights)
All the stars are singing, singing, singing, singing (a million lights)
