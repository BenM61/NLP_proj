Blacker days can misbehave
Read my thoughts, rip off a page
Count me out, count me in

Blacker days can misbehave
Heading for an early grave
That's the place, that's the face
I recall
I close the case

Now I can breathe the air
Release the weight
But I can't escape
From myself

Race the race
Face to face
Touch and embrace
It's down this ugly town
Downtown
I feel slowed down

Were my eyes open wide
When you turned into a part of me?
Guess we both took it well
Can I keep it all inside?
Slowed down, gone wide
