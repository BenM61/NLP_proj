Moonlight I see millions of twinkling stars
Ev'ning when a breeze becomes a sigh
Music I hear millions of soft guitars
Underneath the Pampas moon
Where you hum a happy tune
And you kiss your cares goodbye

You'll find your life will begin
the very moment you're in Argentina
If you're romantic Senor 
then you will surely adore Argentina
You'll be as gay as can be
If you will learn to 'Si Si' like a Latin
For mister soon as you learn  
then you will never return to Manhattan
When you hear 'yo te amo' 
you'll still a kiss and then
If she should say Manana
It's just to let you know
you're gonna meet again

I'll bet an old castanet that
you will never forget Argentina
Where there are rhumbas and tangos
to tickle your spine
Moonlight and music and orchids and wine
You'll want to stay down Argentina Way
You'll find your way
