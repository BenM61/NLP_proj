I know you're out to fry me, but before I go down
I'll let you bitter shovels dig my grave
I know you're out to try me, but remember this now
I'm not the one to life who stays a slave

Into this operation, into this operation
Into this operation I built my world
Push all this dirt beside me, I'm keeping it real
So don't be too surprised if I stay clean

Affected by the way things seem, never by what you dream
You're such a disbeliever, a bitter shovel

Into this operation, into this operation
Into this operation I built my world
Into this operation, into this operation
Into this operation I built my world
