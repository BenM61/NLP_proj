I'm lost in a dream
I nearly lost my mind
Well, I'm lost in my dream
I can't keep from cryin'

I'm lost in a dream
All because of you
And I'm lost in my dream
Don't know what to do

Well, sittin' down by the window
Watchin' the raindrops fall
Yeah, I'm thinkin' 'bout you darlin'
Well, I'm a hopin that you might call

Lord, tell me please
I nearly lost my mind
And I'm lost in my dream
Well, all the time

Well, a-sittin' down by the window
Just like we used to do
Well, I'm thinkin' of you darlin'
Oh, but baby I missed you

Lord, tell me please
I nearly lost my mind 
And I'm lost in my dream
All the time.
