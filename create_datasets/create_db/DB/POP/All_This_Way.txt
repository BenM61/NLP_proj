We made it through storms, made it through rain
It's been a long way and now I'm here
Trying to get back what you gave me
you don't need to save me, you broke my fears

So baby hold on
now that we come so far
just listen to your heart

You don't have to save me
just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
I won't ever give up
of something that's so strong
Yeah, we made it all this way

Like the moon causes the tide
Give me wings so I can fly
You'll already saved me
I need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way

We made it this far gotta hold on
It's a part of this road and we make it through
I open my eyes and it feels right
I just need to know I'm here with you, oh

So baby hold on
now that we come so far
just listen to your heart

You don't have to save me
just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
I won't ever give up
of something that's so strong
Yeah, we made it all this way

Like the moon causes the tide
Give me wings so I can fly
You'll already saved me
Just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
