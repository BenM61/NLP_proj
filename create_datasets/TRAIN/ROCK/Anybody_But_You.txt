Soul, everybody thinks they own mine
Yeah, seems like they think it?s a goldmine
But I don't wanna make a head line
I just thought this was supposed to be my time

I don't care what they do
I'm never gonna give myself up
To anybody but you

My hands are tied to a devils tail
He?ll give me what I want to the last detail
But I'm sure I wanna make that sale
Stand in line and sell your sorry tail

I don't care what they do
I'm never gonna give myself up
To anybody but you

I?ll never give myself up
To anybody but you
I?ll never give myself up
To anybody but you

Soul, somebody thinks they own mine
Yeah, seems like they tryin' to make a deadline
Please can you tell me what is my crime?
I spend my time tryin' to make these words rhyme

I don't care what they do
I'm never gonna give myself up
To anybody but you

I?ll never give myself up
To anybody but you
I?ll never give myself up
To anybody but you
I?ll never give myself up
To anybody but you
