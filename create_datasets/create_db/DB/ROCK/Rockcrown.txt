Well I haven't seen a doctor
Since I can't remember when
But she tells me I've been a talker since 1976
We went up to the lake and I, I remember this: my family secret

Pits in my skin where I let you in
This Rock Crown never let you down

I'm a season in Hell, twenty years
From showing up, down on your scene
Without a semblance of what I've seen
Tell me what I've seen
Tell me what I've seen
Enough to make this young man
Filthy. Filthy. Clean

Pits in my skin where I let you in
This Rock Crown never let you down
