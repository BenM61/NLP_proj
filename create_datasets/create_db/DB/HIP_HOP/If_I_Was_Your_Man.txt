If I was your man, girl

Girl, I'm so tired of things
I just wanna settle down
I swear to you I've changed
Baby, I ain't buggin' out

I know that I put you through hell
And you deserve to be with someone else
But I gotta be straight up
Girl, I just wanna kiss and make up

Ooh, we've been through a lot of things
How do you throw that away?
You were the heart in me
Can't believe you let it break

Tell me why you won't let him go
You can say what you want but I know
Baby, no more lies, I'ma keep it real this time

Help me understand what I'm saying
And getting through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you?

Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man, if I was your man
If I was your man

Got rid of everything
That I knew was hurting you
My hustling the streets
Gave that up for you too

Don't want nothing else in the way
I just wanna make sure that you'll stay
Baby, no more lies, I'ma do it right this time

Help me understand what I'm saying
And getting through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you?

Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man, if I was your man
If I was your man

Can't live without you anymore
Baby, I know that you're worth fighting for
Baby, say that you're still in love with me
In my arms is where you need to be

Can't live without you anymore
Baby, I know that you're worth fighting for
Baby, say that you're still in love with me
In my arms is where you need to be

If I was your man
If I was your man

Help me understand what I'm saying
And getting through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you?

Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man
If I was your man

Help me understand what I'm saying
And getting through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you?

Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man
If I was your man
