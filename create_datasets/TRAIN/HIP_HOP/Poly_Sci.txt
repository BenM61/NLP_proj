(Forte'   Speaking) 

Political science... 
The study of politics  mixed with science... 
Speak on it  baby... 

(Jeni Fujita   Singing Chorus) 

As I look in your eyes 
I see the sunrise 
I see the moonshine! 

(20 Grand Pikasoe   1st Verse) 

I'm from the days of the Colt 45's and gang bangers 
Cocaine slangers who sliced doors  no time to cook up 
Them niggas like raw 
It's all about the dollar now, white powder now 
He owed us money so I watched my niggas tie him down 
The conflict is crucial, police is neutral in this battlefield 
Where the battles grill, like cattles grill for a platter mil 
I even watched little Darryl deal 
I love the ghetto, hate the ghetto 
Must've been a genius who helped make the ghetto 
So I sit back and taste the 'retto 
I got beef, how can you misplace my metal? 
It's a sob story, it's bad the way they robbed Tory 
Of course, must've been religious 
'Cause they took a small tainin' across 
Wrong game to play, boss 
Every night's a bug out 
They shot up every corner where I hung out 
Some nights I cry to this 
Even though it's posi-flip (?) 

(Jeni Fujita - Singing chorus) 

It's like the sunrise 
Just like the moonshine! 

The rain stops, and your girl smiles...just for you (Yeah) 
For you don't know, the love I have for you! 

(Forte' - 2nd Verse) 

Mommy, I keep my name on your brain like Missy 
With The Rain, I'm from the school of stolen sneakers 
Speakers and heavy chains, no lie 
To the knowlie, why? 
God see I , learned the ways of the street, degrees in Poly Sci 
Many days under heat 
It pays for sticking him 
Watch him beast on the lean, routine curriculum 
Black vans, maybe a TransAm, exams get done 
Pop Quiz, figure out them niggas who hit son 
God give, God take away 
And it's easy to see 
Spell 'til, the lord kill indiscriminately 
We infinitely excel, keep the fans compelled 
The bigger picture, watch the ones who're wit' ya 
I clean the pie, and seen 'em die 
Travel life more than once 
Maybe, me and I...had been greeted by, so many conceded eyes 
That'd be wise, when I met too many girls around the world 
And delete the lies 

(Jeni Fujita - Singing Chorus) 

It's like my music, a new tune you never heard 
Hear, your heart beat 
The bass hits! And you feel it 
It's real it's not a sample! I saw you playing my piano! 
Unh-Huh! 

(Forte - 3rd Verse) 

Now I, rock jew-els now and then 
A little lights - n - platinum 
A little beef on the street, no harm in clappin' them 
Savage nations, ghetto life no ramifications 
Dead debating, keeping every crackhead basing 
My auntie steady saying that we wasting, money 
I like tasting, the finer things in life, like a mason 
Police, plague - hatin' 
Everything that the court own 
Brownsville would pry, classified as a warzone 
The Brook god, so trife 
Originale low-life 
To sport it, boost it, the ghetto can't afford it 
Trade it, sort it, stress, new port it 
No tags never ordered 
You broke it, you bought it 
A twenty five - to life, my little son-son caught it 
'Til this day, we admit it, that we did it, he 'gon bid it 
Kept his mouth shut, and never shitted 
On who his murder flirted with death 
Like every team, aiight! You know the verdict! 

(Forte - Speaking) 

Want me to say it one more time Ma, is that what you want?... 

(Jeni Singing) 

Say one more time! 

(Forte - Continues) 

For every city blocker, glock rocker 
Cats who get they weight off, for every kid who had a parent laid off 
No healthcare, had us co-dependents out on welfare 
Speak amongst yourself, 'cause in the streets, no one else care 
The powers that be, I see you knelt there 
Them jealous cats who slang crack, I'm glad to send you back, 
'cause you dealt there 
We all want to shine for basis, 'til we easy 
LG for GP, only the realest niggas meet me 
Conversing through the wee-wee hours of the morning, sleepy 
Always stay alert, 'cause the pain hurt too deeply 
Ain't nothing changed, I'm stuck on myself 
'Cause you mundane 
You wonder while you're just gold? 
You're stuck on one plain 
Now we must hold, very fueled make it through the threshold 
I'm blessed though, the head distincts before I let go 
A major death toll 
It's all about the babies, f*ck the best coast 
I keep my family eating, 'til I'm done breathing 

(Jeni Fujita - Singing Chorus) 

Hear, your heart beat! (Forte' - You heard?! ...Nutzbaby) 
The bass hits, and you feel it 
It's real, it's not a sample! I saw you playing my piano! 
Unh- Huh! 

All you had to do, was make a record! Yeah 
All you had to do, was make a record! Say one more time! 
All I want to do, is hold you! 
Forever, Forever and ever, if you need to lean on me! 
Don't run, I'm here for you, 
Just like the sunrise! 
Just like the moonshine!
