The Leicester YOP, TEP, instructor
Emerged from corridor
His state-subsidized cannabis haze
Moved reptilian in its all-levelling routine
I said to him
It's about time you started thinking
About the black dog on your back
Said it's about time you started thinking
About the rerun which is your life
Moveable backdrop
The backdrop shifted and changed
The Manchester regiment of the Stuarts
Would not tread on your patch
Got nearly down to Derby you know
Was stopped by stinking Billy
And rode a racing horse which I had liberated
From a Tyneside lord
I said to the men
It's about time you started thinking
About the black dog on your back
It's about time you started thinking
About the void in your life
A military prison or worse
The backdrop shifted and changed
The (semite) man's home is full of sperm
And pulled down
His (masiso) was kicked around
As I did it I said to them
The backdrop shifted and changed
So did not even know what song it was
What it was
Who put the yellow pills in the Gordon's gin?
The backdrop shifted and changed
Until did not even know
When the lot come up
Bomb-hole in our schedule
Who put the yellow pills in the Gordon's gin?
The backdrop shifted and changed
Till the reptillian TEP instructor merged
With stinking Billy's morass of flesh
And the Yorkies drifted
1902 Metropole
The Yorkies (ripley yorks) shifted and drifted
I said to them
The backdrop shifted and changed
And this was The Fall
Goodnight
