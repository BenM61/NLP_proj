Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity

Oh, my god, now take a look at me
My lifeline's run by AT&T
They got their wires all up in me
Is push and pull the way it's got to be?

Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity

Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me

You know, I wish that there was some way
That I could be outside playing basketball 
In the rain and not get wet now wouldn't that be great, hmm?
