Time, you've found time enough to love, 
I've found Love enough to hold you, tonight
I'll stir the fire you feel inside, until the flames of love enfold you.
Laying beside you, lost in the feeling-
So glad you opened my door

Come with me,
Somewhere in the 
Night we will know,
Everything lovers can know
You're my Song

Music too magic to end, 
I'll play you over and over again

Loving so warm, 
Moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling the light
We'll just go on burning bright, 
Somewhere in the Night

You'll sleep, when the morning comes
And I lie and watch you sleeping and you'll smile
When you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping

Laying beside you , lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me 
Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know 
You're my song
Music too magic to end,
I'll play you over and over again

Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling the light
We'll just go on burning bright

Somewhere in the Night
