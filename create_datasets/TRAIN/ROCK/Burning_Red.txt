I see the sun begin to rise 
And I'm wounded I've seen the world from painted eyes 
That I'm crying through I watch the darkness hit the tides 
And confide in hold on 

I'm falling 
Can't breathe anymore 
The ocean has opened 
These scars need to heal 
Caress the needle prick in my eye 
The tears fell like rain 
I've rode the phoenix as she glides 
And I've gone insane I've seen the light of suicide 
And I'm dying hold on, 

I'm falling 
Can't breathe anymore 
And the ocean has opened 
These scars need to heal 
Hold on I'm falling, can't reach, reach, 
Colder and colder just hold onto me
