This seaside is our home, babe
Keeping us in pace
With all that has a cool way
Of handling our age in every way

Knowing that this feeling will never change
Knowing that this feeling will never change
It's changing me, cool tide

This seaside is our home , babe
A shelter from a world
That's harboring a rough trade
Of martyrs and of girls in every way

Knowing that this feeling will never change
Knowing that this feeling will never change
It's changing me, cool tide

Children's stories, little worries
You bring home from work
To spend the night with all but hurry
We take time to love in a better way

Goes a story, talk from the village
All's been said and done
Wanting more than grace and glory
Is shooting at the sun

This seaside is our home, babe
This seaside is our home, babe

Knowing that this feeling will never change
Knowing that this feeling will never change
It's changing me, cool tide
