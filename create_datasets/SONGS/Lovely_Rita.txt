Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita meter maid
May I ask discreetly
When do you free
To have a drink with me
 
(Lovely Rita meter maid)
(Lovely Rita meter maid)

Lovely Rita meter maid 
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh Lovely Rita meter maid
Where will I be without you
Give me a wink and make me think of you

(Lovely Rita meter maid)
(Lovely Rita meter maid)
 
Please love me Rita 
I love nobody but you Rita
Oh Rita...
