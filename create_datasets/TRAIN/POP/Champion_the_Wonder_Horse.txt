Champion the wonder horse
Champion the wonder horse

Like a streak of lightning flashing cross the sky
Like the swiftest arrow 
Whizzin' from a bow

Like a mighty cannonball he seems to fly
You'll hear about him everywhere you go
The time will come when everyone will know the name of Champion the wonder horse
Champion the wonder horse

If you hear a clap of thunder
But there is no sign of rain
Then you know it must be Champion
Gallopin' across the plain

If you feel the wind arisin'
Then it's like a hurricane
Then you know it must be Champion
Gallopin' gallopin' 
Gallopin across the plains 

Champion the wonder horse
Champion the wonder horse

Like a streak of lightning flashing cross the sky
Like the swiftest arrow 
Whizzin' from a bow

Like a mighty cannonball he seems to fly
You'll hear about him everywhere you go
The time will come when everyone will know the name of Champion the wonder horse
Champion the wonder horse
