He used to send her flowers
To apologise, to apologise
He used to say how sorry he was
And flash his smile; he'd flash his smile
And always she'd forgive him
'Cause he'd mean it for a while
And then he'd send her flowers
To apologise, to apologise

It wasn't that he meant her harm
I realise, I realise
It's just that life had taken him
By surprise, by surprise
At times he knew he'd failed her
At times he really tried
When times were worst, he did his best
To compromise, to compromise

I told her once he'd break her heart
But that wasn't true, wasn't true
'Cause broken things can be repaired
And held onto, held onto
But her heart had been shattered
The pieces lay inside
In fragments much too tiny
To recognise, to recognise

I look now at the weariness
That lies in his eyes, in his eyes
And who am I to lay the blame
Or criticize, or criticize?
He's sorry that he's living
He's sorry he's alive
He's sorry of the need
To apologise, to apologise

He's sorry of the need
To apologise, to apologise
