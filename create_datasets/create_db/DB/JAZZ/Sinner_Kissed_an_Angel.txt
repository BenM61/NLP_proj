Stars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

Yes, miracles can happen,
I know 'cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel,
That was the night I fell in love.
