You can say you love me
And I'll believe that's true
Trusting you is easy
'cause I believe in you
There is nothing I would miss
As long as we're in love like this

All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms

I feel like I've known you forever and ever
Baby that's how close we are
Right here with you is where my life has come together
And where love has filled my heart
You know I'd go anywhere
As long as I have you to care

All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms

Ooh-and with the love you bring
I never want for anything
I found what I've been searching for in you

All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms
