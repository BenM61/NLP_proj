If you're a red hot fire cracker
I will light your fuse
If you cry like a little girl
I'll dry your baby blues
When you need a man of action
I'm ready to make my move
Like a shotgun shot, Johnny on the spot
There's nothing I can't do

Everything you're looking for
You can find in me
I'll be anything you want
Anyone you need
I'll be your daddy, your brother, your lover and 
your little boy.

When your body needs salvation
I'll be your tender touch
I'll take all the love you give me
And give you twice as much
When we get undercover
And do the horizontal mile
I'm in the mood to answer to your call of the wild

Everything you're looking for
You can find in me
I'll be anything you want
Anyone you need
Everything you're looking for
Anything that you want and more
I'll be your daddy, you brother, your lover and
your little boy
