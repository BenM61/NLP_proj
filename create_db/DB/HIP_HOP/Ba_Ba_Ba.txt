Ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba.
Ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba.
You can talk all night.
Why not let it die?
You want to be right.
I don't want to fight.
Please just let me sleep I'm very tired.
And we can talk about it when I'm feeling more alive.

Ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba.
Ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba.
I dream you are blind.
I stare into your eyes.
You see only white.
Or is it black, I can't decide?
You say are you there and I just smile.
I just sit in silence -- let you wonder for a while.

Ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba.
Ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba
