We shall overcome someday

We're on to victory, we're on to victory
We're on to victory someday

We're on to victory someday

We'll walk hand-in-hand, we'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand-in-hand someday
Oh, deep in my heart I do believe
We'll walk hand-in-hand someday

We are not afraid, we are not afraid
We are not afraid today
Oh, deep in my heart I do believe
We are not afraid today

The truth shall make us free, the truth shall make us free
The truth shall make us free someday
Oh, deep in my heart I do believe
The truth shall make us free someday

We shall live in peace, we shall live in peace
We shall live in peace someday
Oh, deep in my heart I do believe
