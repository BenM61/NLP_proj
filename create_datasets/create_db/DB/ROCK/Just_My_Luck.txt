You and I have got alot in common
We share all the same problems
Luck, love and life aren't on our side
I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time
Always the last one in a long line
Waiting for something to turn out right, right

I'm starting to fall in love
Its getting too much
Not often that I slip up
Its just my luck, yeah, yeah

Rain clouds are gathering in numbers
Just when I put away my jumper
Luck and love still aren't on my side
And I still refuse to be a skeptic
Cause I know how you could still correct this
Maybe this will be my lucky night, night

I'm starting to fall in love
Its getting too much
Its not often that I slip up
Its just my luck

Just my luck
Just my luck
Just my luck
Yeah, its just my luck
Just my luck
Just my luck
Just my luck
Something to turn out right
Just my luck
Just my luck
Just my luck
Waiting for something
Just my luck
Waiting for something to turn out right, yeah!

I'm starting to fall in love
Its getting too much
Not often that I slip up
Its just my luck

Its just my luck
Luck
