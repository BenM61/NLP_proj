D.A.N.G E.R.O.U.S yes I must confess him can't 
Tolerate the dibby who a big up the chest 
Dark night rider come in like a sniper him a watch 
Over you him could'a bite like a viper 
Pupil small boom that no good at all 
Fly down pan you catch you before you fall 

Watch out him a come criminal better run 
Like Robin Hood not the Sherriff of Nottingham 
Dumb diddy dumb dumb run come get some 
There's enough in the bag for everyone 
Superman batman Spiderman sarf 
Come in the way dem head will get like arf 
Don't bother worry cause him always de'bout

Boyfriend a beat you den call for the rider 
Police attack you just to bark for the rider 
Terror come you just to holla for the rider 
Beat down the door an the man come inside 
Wicked him wicked him wicked him na joke 
Him just come pan the scene when a man a provoke 
Wicked him wicked me bark him a controller
