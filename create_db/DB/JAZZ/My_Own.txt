MY OWN
Tommy Dorsey

My own let me call you my own
Let me make you a part of the song in my heart
Alone I'm just living in vain
Ev'rything that I do is depending on you

Show me a sign of your longing for me
Say you are mine and forever that you will be my own
Ev'ry dream I have known has been built of but one desire
Just to call you my own
