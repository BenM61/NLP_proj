One is better with two
Check the babyz
There's nothing we can't do
We're so in the groove, that's the truth
We've got it goin' on now
Push it to the limit
Give it all that we can give it
All the crew, you know we're so much more

When we're all together
We can do anyting
(All together, all together now)
When we're all together
What ya get is what ya see
(All together, all together now)
When we're all together
Yeah, we're unstopable
(All together, all together now)
When we're all together
Nothin's impossible
(All together, all together now)

All together
All, you know
All together
Everybody knows

Push it to the limit
Give it all that we can give it
We know how to make it happen
'Cause we got the understandin'
One is good
Two is better
Three is more, join together
All the world let me hear you scream!

When we're all together
We can do anything
(All together, all the babyz now)
When we're all together
What ya get is what ya see
(All together, all the babyz now)
When we're all together
Yeah, we're unstopable
(All together, all the babyz now)
When we're all together
Nothin's impossible
