Songs of life, they ring
From quiet steeples to distant valleys
Along the hillsides of lovers' hearts
Of lovers' hearts

Come sing you songs of life
And they will keep you
From ever wanting, from ever needing
For ever more, for ever more

Oh, and when the moment's true
It sings so softly to me and you
You know it's true

So I sing my songs of life
That I will hold you inside forever
And you will know me
And I'll be yours and you'll be mine

Oh, and when the moments true
They sing so softly to me and you
You know they do, you know they do

And I'll sing my songs life
That I may hold you, inside forever
And you will know me,
And I'll be yours and you'll be mine
