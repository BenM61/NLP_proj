One two, one two three four

You could be my best friend
Sitting on the book ends
Look guy, you're just a king
You know you're missing something

I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head

I've read about you in books
Your kingdom's always full
And if you did know the truth
You wouldn't promise to tell

I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
And I'm pulling out all of your mind

I waited for you to say
All the things that you think
And now that we're here alone
You can remember to blink

I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
And I'm pulling out all of your mind

You could be my best friend
Sitting on the book ends
Look guy, you're just a king
You know you're missing something

I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
I've got my hand in your head
And I'm pulling out all of your mind

And I'm pulling out all of your mind
And I'm pulling out all of your mind
And I'm pulling out all of your mind
And I'm pulling out all of your mind
