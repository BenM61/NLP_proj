Am I seeing double, am I withdrawn
Depositing lyrics into a love song
Spider weaving webs for a catch that won't come
Am I pulling roses from a dead bush
A soldier running late for the ambush
Ready in the depth for a stone that's long gone

Is it too late?
It's never ending but nevertheless
I'm the first one to second my guess
And the fire in my heart came from ash and ember

And every I step I take, got the devil to repay
I'll never make it out alive, but I won't surrender
Had to take it day by day, had to learn the hard way
Like a phoenix rising up from ash and ember
Ash and ember

Am I reaching out for something that I can't grab
Something infinitely splitting into two halves
Is there something I forgot that I can't remember
Am I swimming in a river that was manmade
Demolishing a road that was just paved
It's like trying to catch a junebug in late December

Is it too late?
It's never ending but nevertheless
I'm the first one to second my guess
And the fire in my heart came from ash and ember

And every I step I take, got the devil to repay
I'll never make it out alive, but I won't surrender
Had to take it day by day, had to learn the hard way
Like a phoenix rising up from ash and ember
Ash and ember
Ash and ember

Have I climbed the ladder to the last rung
Am I simply gonna finish where I started from
Is the future just the past that I'll never outrun

And every I step I take, got the devil to repay
I'll never make it out alive, but I won't surrender
Had to take it day by day, had to feel the heartbreak
Like a phoenix I was born from ash and ember
Ash and ember
Ash and ember

Am I stealing something I could borrow
Is yesterday just waiting for tomorrow
