Special, you think you're special, you do
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me and walk around on me

Just one more fight about your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
'Cause I've had enough of this
And now I'm pissed, yeah

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

Just one more fight about a lot of things
And I will give up everything
To be on my own again
Free again, yeah

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

Some day you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no you never know when you're gonna go
Some day you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no you never know when you're gonna go

Just one more fight and I'll be history
Yes, I will straight up leave your shit
And you'll be the one who's left
Missing me, yeah
