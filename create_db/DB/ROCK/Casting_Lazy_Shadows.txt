Looking through my window,
I can see a thin glow,
I don't get depressed though,
I'm casting lazy shadows,
It's all I need to stop me thinking,

Every single day though,
I throw myself away though,
It's all I need to stop me thinking,

Get my head-straight, get my head-straight, get it straight,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't, don't you ever let go,
You take it all back, take it back, take your money back,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't, don't you ever let go,
All I need's to stop me thinking,

Looking through this window,
I need a change of view though,
Looking through last year though,
But all I saw was you, though,
You're all I need to stop me thinking,

Get my head-straight, get my head-straight, get it straight,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't, don't you ever let go,
You take it all back, take it back, take your money back,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't, don't you ever let go,

All I wanted was to chicken out,
And simmer down,
You've got your head gear on again,
And you feel like you've been left out,

Don't you ever, don't you, don't you ever, don't you,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't you ever, don't you,

I've gotta get my head-straight, get my head-straight, get it straight,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't you never, don't, let go,
And that is all right,
Get my head-straight, get my head-straight, get my head,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't, don't you ever let go,
And that is all right,
Get my head-straight, get my head-straight, get my head,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't, don't you ever let go,
And that is all right,
You take it all back, take it back, take your money back,
Don't you ever, don't you, don't, don't you ever let go,

All it need's to stop me thinking.
