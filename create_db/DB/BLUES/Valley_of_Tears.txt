I want you to take me where I belong
Where hearts have been broken with a kiss and a song
Spend the rest of my days without any cares
Ev'ry one understands me in the valley of tears.
Soft words have been 
Ev'ry one understands me in the valley of tears.

I want you to spoken so sweet and low
But my mind is made up love has got to go
Spend the rest of my days without any cares
Ev'ry one understands me in the valley of tears.
Soft words have been 
Ev'ry one understands me in the valley of tears.
