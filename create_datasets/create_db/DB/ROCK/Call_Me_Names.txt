I just wanna see you at night
Don't come 'round my house in the day
I love it when we start up a fight
And I love it when the fight ends your way

I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names

I can't wait to see you again
I know you're gonna slap my face
You beat me up then beat me again
And over and over and over and over and over and over

I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names

Big woman and a short, short man
And he loves it when she beats his brains out
He's pecked to death but he loves the pain
And he loves it when she calls him names

Big woman and a short, short man
And he loves it when she beats his brains out
He's pecked to death but he loves the pain
And he loves it when she calls him names

I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names

She's wearing heavy leather with lace
He dresses up in cowboy taste
They punish then they think up a crime
It's their way of loving, not mine

I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names

Big woman and a short, short man
And he loves it when she beats his brains out
He's pecked to death but he loves the pain
And he loves it when she calls him names

Big woman and a short, short man
And he loves it when she beats his brains out
He's pecked to death but he loves the pain
And he loves it when she calls him names

I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names
I love it when you call me names
