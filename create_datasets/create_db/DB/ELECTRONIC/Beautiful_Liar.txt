(Ay)
(Ay, nobody likes being played)

Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce
Oh, Shakira, Shakira (hey)

He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about that him you wouldn't want to read about
He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about

You'll never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it?
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
I didn't know about you then till I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene
Slow dancing
You stole everything, how could you say I did you wrong?

We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
Have to let go
The innocence is gone

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it?
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

Tell me how to forgive you (ooh)
When it's me who's ashamed (oh)
And I wish I could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame (hey)

Ay, Beyonce, Beyonce
Ay, Shakira, Shakira
Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce
Oh, Shakira, Shakira

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Can't we laugh about it?
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
