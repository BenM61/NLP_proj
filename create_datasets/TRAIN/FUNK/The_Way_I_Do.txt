(Mr. Cheeks)
Special kinda friend, lemme clown with ya
Get to know you little better, spend some time with ya
Hit the town with ya, spend every dime with you
no matter what you want to do as long as i'm with you
get your picture painted, place it on my wall
and as long as i want I'm giving you my all 
but when the night falls, we hold eachother all night 
Play some B. Knight, He'll make it all right

(Brian)
I can see it in your eyes, your looking at a real man 
I don't wear a disguise, gonna make you understand
I know you heard a lot of lies
I won't beat around the bush
I know I'm gonna make ya mine
But I'm not gonna push

Girl I don't mean to come off
As cocky, or concieted
But I believe that you were meant
Just for me, There should be nothing
But love coming betweens us
And we will be together always, baby yeah

Baby I don't mean come on strong
But you should be with somebody
Who understands you like I do
I'll be right here
If ever you need a hand or 2
To help you get where you going to
Lemme show you the way I do

(Brian)
I would never do you wrong
Like some other fella did
It only matters where you going
Don't matter where you been
I calculated all the costs
Measured what your worth
And right after God
Girl I'm puttin you first

Girl I don't mean to come off
As cocky, or concieted
But I believe that you were meant
Just for me, There should be nothing
But love coming betweens us
And we will be together always

Baby I don't mean come on strong
But you should be with somebody
Who understands yo
