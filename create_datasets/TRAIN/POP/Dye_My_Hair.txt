I'm not that kinda girl
To keep my voice unheard
To carefully pick words, oh no
I'm not that kinda girl
To easily get hurt
No bullets pierce my eyes shut

But there's something in the way I act around you
Tryna turn your head
Laugh at jokes that I don't get
There is something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do oh

Don't buy me fancy things
Don't buy me any drinks
I pay for my own self, oh yeah
I was raised to be free
Got my independency
Why do I get so weak?

'Cause there's something in the way I act around you
Tryna turn your head
Laugh at jokes that I don't get
There is something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
And you won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
And you won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do oh

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
So how I could I refuse
There's nothing that I wouldn't do oh

But there's something in the way I act around you
Around you, around you
But there's something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do oh

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
So how could I refuse?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do oh
I will dye my hair blonde for you
