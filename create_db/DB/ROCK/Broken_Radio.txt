I was thinking about another time still in my mind
When I used to know a little girl high on this world

Your baby loves you more than you know
Raised on rivalry and rock 'n' roll
Moving to the Motor City soul 
She lets go
On the radio

Well we never had a lot of cash
But we loved those kids
Some say that she missed the boat
But she just burned the bridge

The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock 'n' roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
She takes hold
On the radio

Stomach ache Sundays
And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again

She used to talk about astrology
She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon

I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned

The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock' n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
Moving to the Motor City soul
Sometimes I see her face
When there's no place to go
On the radio
On the radio
On the radio
Broken radio
