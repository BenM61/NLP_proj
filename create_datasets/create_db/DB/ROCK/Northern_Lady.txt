Lady face the morning sun
The sunlight in your hair
Northern Lady, you're the one

Why do you mean so much to me
I need you every night
Northern Lady, you're the one

If you need me, I'll be there
I'll fly right back to you
Northern Lady, you're the one

Will you use your head tonight
And come into my room
Northern Lady, you're the one
You're the one

Lady face the morning sun
The sunlight in your hair
Northern Lady, you're the one
