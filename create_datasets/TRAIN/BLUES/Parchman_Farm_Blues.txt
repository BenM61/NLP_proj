Judge gimme me life this morn'in
Down on Parchman Farm
Judge gimme me life this morn'in
Down on Parchman Farm
I wouldn't hate it so bad
But I left my wife in mournin'

Four years, goodbye wife
Oh you have done gone
Ooh, goodbye wife
Oh you have done gone
But I hope someday
You will hear my lonesome song, yeah

Oh you, listen you men
I don't mean no harm
Oh-oh listen you men
I don't mean no harm
If you wanna do good
You better stay off old Parchman Farm, yeah

We go to work in the mo'nin
Just a-dawn of day
We go to work in the mo'nin
Just a-dawn of day
Just at the settin' of the sun
That's when da work is done, yeah

Ooh, I'm down on old Parchman Farm
I sho' wanna go back home, yeah
I'm down on the old Parchman Farm
But I sho' wanna go back home, yeah
But I hope someday I will over come.
