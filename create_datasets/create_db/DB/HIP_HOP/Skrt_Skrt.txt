I think it's time we made
Time to f*ck around off this Patron
If you got time, I'll wait
Just give it to me any way you want
'Cause you and me don't need anybody else
Just you on me
'Cause I don't need no help, no

'Cause I like freaking
You like sex on the weekend
Me, too, me, too
'Cause I like drinking
You looking at me winking
Me, too, me, too
So give me the work
So give me the work
You gon' make me skrt skrt
You gon' make me stop stop
So give me the work
So give me the work
You gon' make me skrt skrt
You gon' make me stop stop

If I take my time
Tell me will you wait, wait on, yeah
'Cause every sip I take
Feels like it's about to get me gone
'Cause you and me don't need anybody else
Just you on me
'Cause I don't need no help, no

'Cause I like freaking
You like sex on the weekend
Me, too, me, too
'Cause I like drinking
You looking at me winking
Me, too, me, too
So give me the work
So give me the work
You gon' make me skrt skrt
You gon' make me stop stop
So give me the work
So give me the work
You gon' make me skrt skrt
You gon' make me stop stop

If you down I'm down
You gon' know I'm down
To love you, baby
If you down, I'm down
You gon' know I'm down
To love you, baby
