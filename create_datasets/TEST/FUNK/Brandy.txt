Sittin' by the open fire place in my favorite dungarees
Played a few balls of a melody and it sounded sweet to me
I thought I get up and take a look around but my feet got in the way
Stumbled to the floor she was right in the door, I could see her face

But how could it be, she ran away from me
My best friend's gone, I'm so all alone

I kinda miss you Brandy, I'm so all alone
When are you coming back home?
I really miss you Brandy, missing you everyday
Are you coming home to stay?
Cause I love you Brandy, oh yeah yeah yeah

Sippin' on a cherry soda pop, building houses made of sand
Like a little child with a fantasy, just a fraction of a man
But I was in love when they put it down
Oh, my doorstep in the rain
I could feel the love coming to my heart, through my window pane

But how could I know, she was just up and gone
My best friend gone, I'm so all alone

I really miss you Brandy, I'm so all alone
When are you coming back home?
I really miss you Brandy, missing you everyday
Are you coming home to stay?

I kinda miss you Brandy
When are you coming back home? I'm so all alone
I really miss you Brandy, missing you everyday
Are you coming home to stay?

Oh, I really miss you Brandy, I'm so all alone
When are you coming back home?
Oh, I really miss you Brandy, missing you everyday
Are you coming home to stay?

I really miss you Brandy
When are you coming back home? I'm so all alone
I really miss you
