If I could cheat 
I would skip to the end 
Decide if it's worth going through with 
Skip to the last paragraph 
Before we start 
Is it a happy ending or a broken heart 

If I could cheat 
I would skip to the end 
Decide if it's worth going through with 
Skip to the last paragraph 
Before we start 
Is it a happy ending or a broken heart 
Happy ending or a broken heart 

There's nothing to rely on 
C'mon skip to the end 
There's nothing to fall back on 
C'mon skip to the end 

When I could teeth 
I cut to the root 
Then the end is absolute 
When she makes sense 
I go through the roof 
Then the end has living proof 

If I could cheat 
I would skip to the end 
Decide if it's worth going through with it 
Last paragraph 
Before we start 
Is it a happy ending or a broken heart 
Happy ending or a broken heart 

There's nothing to rely on 
C'mon skip to the end 
There's nothing to fall back on 
C'mon skip to the end 

There's nothing to rely on 
C'mon skip to the end 
There's nothing to fall back on 
C'mon skip to the end
