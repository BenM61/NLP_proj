What's goin' on down on the planet
What's goin' on inside your pretty head
What's life without a Mercedes
And the need to feel adrenaline rush 

Is it better than moonlight on water
Is it better than sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us, it's not out of reach

I'm here for you no matter where you go
No matter what you do
I'm here for you when there's a lonely night 
Who can you hold on to 
I'm here for you, want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am, but don't you worry ?bout the wrong things

Who's gonna be the competition
Who's next in line for promotion baby
Everyday the real world is fading
Spinning out on the wheel of fortune but

Is it better than moonlight on water
Is it better than sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us, it's not out of reach babe

I'm here for you no matter where you go
No matter what you do
I'm here for you when there's a lonely night 
Who can you hold on to 
I'm here for you, want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am, but don't you worry ?bout the wrong things

You've been working so hard, don't you know it baby
You don't understand what I want from you
Instead of dreamin ?bout all that money
We got much simpler things to do 

Moonlight on water
Sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us, it's not out of reach babe

I'm here for you
No matter where you go, no matter what you do 
I'm here for you
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to 
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am, but don't you worry ?bout the wrong things

I'm here for you no matter where you go
No matter what you do
I'm here for you when there's a lonely night 
Who can you hold on to 
I'm here for you, want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am, but don't you worry ?bout the wrong things
