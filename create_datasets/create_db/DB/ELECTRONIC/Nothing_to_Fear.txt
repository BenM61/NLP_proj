Come to me and I'll light your darkness
Baby breathe me deep, and I'll make you conscious
Cause I can give you peace and I can make it right 

So close your eyes, everything will be alright
Nothing to fear as long as I'm here
Close your eyes now 

Close your eyes and feel me around you
And baby let me show that I'm all you need to know
Just ease your mind there's nothing to fear now
Cause I can give you love and I can make it grow 

So close your eyes, everything will be alright
Nothing to fear as long as I'm here
Close your eyes now

Let me show you love can be beautiful
Let me show you love can be wonderful
i know you have a wounded heart
But I can make it heal
And I will never turn away cause myt love is real 

So close your eyes, everything will be alright
Nothing to fear as long as I'm here
Close your eyes now
