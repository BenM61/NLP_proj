You have the right to get down on your kness
You have the right to make yourself believe
You don't know my name
But I don't care

You can do it
Cause you have the right
To shake the loneliness and shine the light
Take all your tears save 'em for a rainy night

Go and wish on every star that's fallen
Shake your head and wonder when it's all to good to be true
Like a whole new you
So don't lose the way

You can do no wrong
And don't spend your days just trying to be strong
When you don't know your name
You know it's okay, you can do it

Cause you have the right
To shake the loneliness and shine the light
Take all your tears save 'em for a rainy night
Go and wish on every star that's fallen

Shake your head and wonder when it's all to good to be true
Like a whole new you
It's too good to be true
Like a whole new you

Shake the loneliness and shine the light
Take all your tears save 'em for a rainy night
Go and wish on every star that's fallen
Shake your head and wonder

Shake your head and wonder baby
Go and wish on every star that's fallen
Shake your head and wonder when it's all to good to be true
Like a whole new you

It's to good to be true
Like a whole new you
