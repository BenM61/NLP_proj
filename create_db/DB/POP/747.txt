I could hear it through the line
I could tell from the crack in her voice
The static, the noise
It's leaving on the nine
But when it comes to you
I'll do whatever I gotta do

I'm looking out from my window seat
Halfway back, aisle twenty three
Man I wish that I could fly this thing
Give a little more gas, a little more speed

This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
Every minute is wasted time
She gets a little bit closer to saying goodbye
This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough

I could use a drink right now
I've got my head in the clouds, thinking about
Second that the wheels touch down
And my feet hit the ground, I run to your house
I knock on the door, kiss you right on the mouth

This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
Every minute is wasted time
She gets a little bit closer to saying goodbye
This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough

I'm looking out from my window seat
Halfway back, aisle twenty three
Man I wish that I could fly this thing
Give a little more gas, just a little more speed

This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
This seven-forty-seven can't go fast enough, fast enough
Every minute is wasted time
She gets a little bit closer to saying goodbye
This seven-forty-seven, seven-forty-seven, this seven-forty-seven
Can't go fast enough, fast enough
