I guess I'd better lay down for awhile
Until I'm in the ground or 'till some god says go
Oh the time goes fast and I'm going down - oh
So I stand as a the clown with all my heads down

I'm lost in all of them ways to dance
And the more I caress the less I'm confident
Well I don't care if I look fake or not
I'm just longing for someone to take me on

Could it be I should restart myself somewhere?
To be sharp and easy - oh I'd like that
But I go back and forth 'cause I'm lost in town
I just stand on one spot like a sad clown

I'm lost in all of them ways to dance
And the more I caress the less I'm confident
I don't care if I look fake or not
I'm just longing for someone to come and take me on

I'm lost in all of them ways to dance
And the more I caress the less I'm confident
I don't care if I look fake or not
I'm just longing for someone to take me on
