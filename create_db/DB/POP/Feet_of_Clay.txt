Her eyes were softer than the night, her lips were honey and wine
And oh I love her more than life, I worship this love of mine.

I worshipped her so blindly till I was told one day,
For love of gold, my true love sold, sold her heart away.

The love that I had idolized has sold her heart away,
Too late, too late, I realized my idol had feet of clay.
