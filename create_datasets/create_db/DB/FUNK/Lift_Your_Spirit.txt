Come on lift your spirit
And toast a cheer
To all the good times
Throughout the years
And just remember
It ain't where you're from
It's where you're at
It ain't who you know
It's who's got your back
Who's got your back

Times have changed
Everything's strange
Nothing's what it seems
Is a friend someone who drops in
Or a face on a telephone screen
When my chips are down
And I'm feeling low who I'm 'pposed to call
Who gonna help me stand on my feet after I fall

So ladies and gentlemen,
And boys and girls
This one goes out to the people
Who help me most in the world

So lift your spirit
And toast a cheer
To all the good times
Throughout the years
And just remember
It ain't where you're from
It's where you're at
It ain't who you know
It's who's got your back
Who's got your back
Who's got your back
It ain't where you're from
It's where you're at
Who's got your back
Who's got your back
Who's got your back
It ain't who you know
But who knows who
And who's got your back

I told my secret to a friend
I thought I could trust
He swore he'd keep it
Only his momma and the Lord above
All the time I've come to find
My business all in his tree
I'm still trying to forgive that low down,
Double crossing, murder, cheat

So ladies and gentlemen,
And boys and girls
This one goes out to the people
Who help me most in the world
Hey brothers and sisters
Hey women and men
I dedicate this to people
Who were down since way back when

So lift your spirit
And toast a cheer
To all the good times
Throughout the years
And just remember
It ain't where you're from
It's where you're at
It ain't who you know
It's who's got your back
Who's got your back
Who's got your back
It ain't where you're from
It's where you're at
And who's got your back
Who's got your back
Who's got your back
It ain't who you know
But who knows you
And who's got your back

Who's got your back
It ain't where you're from
It's where you're at
And who's got your back
Who's got your back
Who's got your back
It ain't who you know
But who knows you
And who's got your back
