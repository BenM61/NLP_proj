Every night, I wonder where we are
What you're thinking of, is it even love?
Close your eyes, let me show you now
What we're fighting for, you were never sure, no

Does it have to be perfect?
What the hell are we doing?
Maybe we can get through this

Cause on the darkest night
We're turning, the world is turning around
And at the lowest tide
We're turning, the world is turning around
You know I'm on your side
Gonna hold you up when the waves collide
Cause on the darkest night
We're turning, yeah, we can turn it around

Yeah, we can turn it around
Cause on the darkest night
We're turning, yeah, we can turn it around

Is the love lost between the sheets
With the memory of what used to be?
Take me now, take me all the way to the highest heights
We can make it right now

Does it have to be perfect?
What the hell are we doing?
Maybe we can get through this

Cause on the darkest night
We're turning, the world is turning around
And at the lowest tide
We're turning, the world is turning around
You know I'm on your side
Gonna hold you up when the waves collide
Cause on the darkest night
We're turning, yeah, we can turn it around

Yeah, we can turn it around
Yeah, we can turn it around
Yeah, we can turn it around
Cause on the darkest night
We're turning, yeah, we can turn it around
