Wake up on the ceilin' like I'm spinnin'
But I'm feeling alright, alright
Addicted to the magic, I don't wanna keep ahead
But can't lie, I'm alright

Is it you? Is it me?
Is the City takin' over?
Would you trade all your dreams
For that New York Narcotic
I can't go to sleep, I want it

I want it
New York Narcotic
I can't go to sleep, I want it
I want it
New York Narcotic
I can't go to sleep, I want it

Here we go again
Here we, here we go again
Summertime house, smoking smoking with the friends
Here we go again
Here we, here we go again
Summertime house, smoking smoking with the friends

step across the water
I'm a technicolor soldier tonight, tonight
Check out of the garden, burn the rubber
Up above the skyline, all night

Is it you? Is it me?
Is the City takin' over?
Would you trade all your dreams
For that New York Narcotic
I can't go to sleep, I want it

I want it
New York Narcotic
I can't go to sleep, I want it
I want it
New York Narcotic
I can't go to sleep, I want it

Here we go again
Here we, here we go again
Summertime house, smoking smoking with the friends
Here we go again
Here we, here we go again
Summertime house, smoking smoking with the friends

Is it you? Is it me?
Is the City takin' over?
Would you trade all your dreams
