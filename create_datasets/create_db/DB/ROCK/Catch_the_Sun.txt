Every day it comes to this 
Catch the things you might have missed 
You say, get back to yesterday 
I ain't ever going back 
Back to the place that I can't stand 
But I, I miss the way you lie
'Cause I've always been misunderstood
Pulled apart and ripped in two 
But I, I miss the way you lie

Catch the sun, before it's gone 
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone 
Catch the sun, it never comes 
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire 

I never really understood 
Why I did not feel so good 
But I, I miss the way you lie
'Cause I've always been up and down 
Never wanted to hit the ground 
But I, I miss the way you lie

Catch the sun, before it's gone 
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone 
Catch the sun, it never comes 
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire
