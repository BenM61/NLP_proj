Boredom always lurks within strange places
But still I find a way to feed my mind
The worlds colide beyond those spaces
I'm never sure of what goes on inside

If I apologize for every crutch I've used
I guess I never would have walked inside those shoes

Be hold the world that I've been shaping
I never said that I'd belong
In other words have I been flaking
Don't you know what I would have done

If I apologize for every crutch I've used
I guess I never would have worked inside those shoes
So Let me down, down, down
Let it bubble all around me
Always something else to do
Let me down, down, down
Let the shallowness surround me, let me drown in it

From the tint of my eyes
I can see the world
Spinning like a girl
never satisfied
And though it's plain to see
You don't exist for me
Don't believe every word that they say

So Let me down, down, down
Let it bubble all around me
Always something else to prove
Let me down, down, down
Let the shallowness surround me, let me drown in it

A part of my mind
Never wonders still
Why it's close at hand?
It's never out of sight
And though it's part of me
You're never going to see

Don't believe every word that they say
Don't believe every word that they say
