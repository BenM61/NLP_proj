Pull me close look into my eyes
Smile at me when you stick in the knife
We're bleeding into a cup when we've got enough
We'll just paint the walls
And we don't care how much it hurts
You think you're cursed it's what you deserve

'Cause you're talking rock and roll
Walking karaoke soul
I can see you desperate to please
Let me treat you for your disease

Between angels and ropes babe what would you chose?
As you kick the dust from your perfect shoes
Your wolf suit is wearing thin and your real skin looks like it never bleeds
And you're playing to the crowd as the ship goes down comforting me

'Cause you're talking rock and roll
Walking karaoke soul
If you see me falling sleep
Please don't wake me from this dream

Yeah you're talking rock and roll
Walking karaoke soul
If you see me falling sleep
Please don't wake me from this dream

Yeah you're talking rock and roll
Walking karaoke soul
I can see you desperate to please
Let me treat you for your disease

Faith is gone and love is gone
Your disease
And fear is stronger now
Your disease...
