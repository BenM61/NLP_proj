Jesus, Jesus, I love calling Your name. 
Jesus, Jesus, everyday Your name is the same.

When the troubles surround me,
and I didn't have to despair
Lord, You told me that You'd be right there.
Seems like all my problems, they have just begun
but I'm not gonna worry about it no more, You've already won.

Jesus, Jesus, I love calling Your name.
Jesus, Jesus, everyday Your name is the same.

I remember the time when I felt so all alone,
when I needed You, Jesus, all I had to do was call.
I called You in the morning,
I called You late at night,
but when I went on my knees and called You, Lord, 
You made everything alright.

Jesus, Jesus, I love calling Your name.
Jesus, Jesus, everyday Your name is the same.
