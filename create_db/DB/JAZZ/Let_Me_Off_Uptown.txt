Hey Joe
What d'ya mean Joe, My name's Roy
Well come here Roy and get groovy
You bin uptown?
No I ain't bin uptown but I've bin around
You mean to say you ain't bin uptown?
No I ain't bin uptown, what's uptown?

If it's pleasure you're about
And you feel like steppin' out
All you've got to shout is
Let me off uptown

If it's rhythm that you feel
Then it's nothing to conceal
Oh, you've got to spiel it
Let me off uptown

Rib joints, juke joints, hep joints
Where could a fella go to top it

If you want to pitch a ball
And you can't afford a hall
All you've got to call is
Let me off uptown

Anita, oh Anita, say I feel somethin'
Whatcha feel Roy? The heat?
No it must be that uptown rhythm
I feel like blowin'
Well blow Roy, blow.
