A sucker for your loving, a sucker for your kissing
It's like a heatwave in July, every time we're eye to eye
A sucker for your rubbing, sucker for your twisting
You take me to the danger zone but leave me shaking to the bone

Sweet like honey, banging like a bomb
Turning me on, you're turning me on, you're turning me on

Can I have it? Can I touch it?
Now, you really gotta let it show
'Cause I feel like I'm about to blow
When you act like that I can't fight the feeling

Grab it? Can I love it?
Now, you really gotta let me know
'Cause I don't know how to take it slow
When you act like that I can't fight the feeling

A sucker for your touching, a sucker for your teasing
But I'm not out to sneak a feel, I wanna get to freak for real
A sucker for your hugging, a sucker for your squeezing
I bet you feel it all inside, so, let me know I'm qualified

Sweet like honey, banging like a bomb
Turning me on, you're turning me on, you're turning me on

Can I have it? Can I touch it?
Now, you really gotta let it show
'Cause I feel like I'm about to blow
When you act like that I can't fight the feeling

Grab it? Can I love it?
Now, you really gotta let me know
'Cause I don't know how to take it slow
When you act like that, I can't fight the feeling

Baby, I'm excited, gotta have it
I can't deny it, gotta have it
I don't know how to fight it, gotta have it
Turning me on, you're turning me on

Love the way you flaunt it, gotta have it
Girl, I really want it, gotta have it
'Cause you're turning me on
You're turning me on, you're turning me on
