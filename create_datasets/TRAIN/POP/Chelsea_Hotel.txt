I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so free
Giving me head on the unmade bed 
While the limousines wait in the street 
And those were the reasons and that was New York 
I was running for the money and the flesh 
That was called love for the workers in song
It still is for those of us left. 
But you got away, didn't you, baby? 
You just threw it all to the crowd
You got away, they can't pay you now 
For making your sweet little song
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, 
In the winter of 67
My friends of that year they were all trying to go queer 
And me I was just getting even 
And those were the reasons and that was New York
I was running for the money and the flesh 
That was called love for the workers in song
It still is for those of us left
But you got away, didn't you, baby? 
You just threw it all to the crowd 
You got away, they can't pay you now 
For making your sweet little song
