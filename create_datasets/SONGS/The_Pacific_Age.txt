The Pacific Age
Is growing strong
It's arm's embrace witth a killing grace
It shakes your hand as it takes your place

The modern age
Like a slow revenge
A wave that breaks over distant shores
It begs for mercy
And it take some more and more and more

The Pacific Age
Comes down like rain
Washing over us again and again
It's spreading west
Like a speeding train
As the wheels slow down and we lose the game

The Pacific Age
Tells no lies
A dream that calls like an open door
It keeps you hoping 
And it takes some more and more and more

The Pacific Age
Comes down like rain
Washing over us again and again
It's spreading west
Like a speeding train
As the wheels slow down and we lose the game

The Pacific Age
Comes down like rain
Washing over us again and again
It's spreading west 
like a speeding train
As the wheels slow down and we lose the game

The Pacific Age
Has no regrets
It feeds on dreams
It wins its bets
A new dawn breaks from east to west
And the plans we made stop making sense

The Pacific Age
It calls your name
It bites you hand, you feel no pain
And racing home. you run in vane
As your heart slows down and you lose the game
