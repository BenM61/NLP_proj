I look at you and suddenly something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and your glance make this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazing their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide on a magic carpet ride

Full of butterflies inside
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love
