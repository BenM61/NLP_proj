Frankly Dear, your modesty reveals to me 
Self-appraisal often makes me sad 
And if I add your funny face appeals to me 
Please don't think I've suddenly gone mad 

You've got all the qualities of Peter Pan 
I'd look far before I'd find a sweeter pan 

I love your funny face 
Your sunny, funny face 
Though you're a cutie 
With more than beauty 
You've got a lot of 
Personal-I-ty for me 

You fill the air with smiles 
For miles and miles and miles 
Though you're no Mona Lisa 
For world's I'd not replace 
Your sunny-- funny face 

I love your funny face 
Your sunny-- funny face 
You're not exotic 
But so hypnotic 
You're much-- too much 
If you can cook 
The way you look 

I'd swim the ocean wide 
Just to have you by my side 
Though you're no Queen of Sheeba 
For world's I'd not replace 
Your sunny-- funny face.
