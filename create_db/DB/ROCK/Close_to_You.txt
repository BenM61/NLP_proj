I got to get away man, 
Got to clear my mind, mind, mind
Out of this mundane god-forsaken 9-5 waste of my time.
I'm gonna tell the boss man 
I'm never coming back, back, back
I'm just a one way crazy locomotive jumpin' off of my tracks.
'Cause I'm jacked up, sucked up, cut down,
Thrown around, discarded like a cigarette butt
I'm just a no good excuse for a man.
Yes you know I got to pick myself up out of this rut,
But I want to be close to you, I want to be close to you, you. 
I want to be close to you, I want to be close to you.

I don't know why we've never been told
That the life we're living it is made from gold
Work our whole damn lives just to make "it", it's sold
So boy don't worry don't worry don't worry

I got to get away man this moment it won't last, last, last
I got a chained up brumby in my head and it's kicking my ass
I'm roaming like a dog yeah
Looking for my bone, bone, bone
I got to hijack my body just to make it my own, my own, my own, my own
Because I'm jacked up, sucked up, cut down, 
Thrown around, discarded like a cigarette butt
I'm just a no good excuse for a man yes you know 
I've got to pick myself up out of this rut.
But I want to be close to you, I want to be close to you, you. 
I want to be close to you, I want to be close to you, you.

I don't know why we've never been told
That the life we're living it is made from gold
Work our whole damn lives just to make "it", it's sold
So boy don't worry, don't worry, don't worry now

Don't worry.
