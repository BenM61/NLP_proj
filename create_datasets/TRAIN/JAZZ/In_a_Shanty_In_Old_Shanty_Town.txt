I'm up in the world, 
But I'd give the world to be where I used to be,
A heavenly nest, 
Where I rest the best, 
Means more than the world to me.

It's only a shanty 
In old Shanty Town 
The roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track, 
Like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

I'd give up a palace if I were a king. 
It's more than a palace, it's my everything.
There's a queen waiting there with a silvery crown 
In a shanty in old Shanty Town.
