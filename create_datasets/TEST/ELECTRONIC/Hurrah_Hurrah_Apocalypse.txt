I am the Amazon
A warrior in shades
I rule my dynasty
Your holiday in Hades

I am the Amazon
The zombie femme from hell
I walk where money talks
My army dies to tell

Cry baby, cry
See Emily play
Kiss earth goodbye
Hello, judgment day

Boom, boom, bye-bye
The demons be gone
Bomb 'til you drop
A space marathon

The vultures feed
We're selling our souls
Big Money talks
Big Money controls

Enola Gay
Launch massive attack
Hurrah, hurrah
The army strikes back

Behold United Nations
Come hear my prophecy
Destroy civilization
Come join the mutiny

The gods of earth and heaven
The rich and infamous
The world implodes forever
Collapse the universe

Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah
Nothing's gonna save us this time
We are going down

Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah

Godzilla roars
Nations on parade
War end all wars
A nuclear cascade

Hailstorm immense
A crash and a bang
Nature's revenge
The last tiger fang

The vultures feed
We're selling our souls
Big Money talks
Big Money controls

Enola Gay
Launch massive attack
Hurrah, hurrah
The army strikes back

The hungry beast of horror
Six hundred sixty six
Let rockets build a cover
On my plutonium whigs

One hundred fallen angels
One thousand Babylons
The sound of bomb, alarm bells
And screaming electrons

Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah
Nothing's gonna save us this time
We are going down

Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah

I am the Amazon
A warrior in shades
I rule my dynasty
Your holiday in Hades

I am the Amazon
The zombie femme from hell
I walk where money talks
My army dies to tell
My army dies to tell

Hurrah
Hurrah, hurrah
Hurrah, hurrah

Cry baby, cry
See Emily play
Kiss earth goodbye
Hello, judgment day

Boom, boom, bye-bye
The demons be gone
Bomb 'til you drop
A space marathon

The vultures feed
We're selling our souls
Big Money talks
Big Money controls

Enola Gay
Launch massive attack
Hurrah, hurrah
The army strikes back

Destroy, destroy destruction
Until the bitter end
The final satisfaction
Construction time again

Beyond the war and sorrow
We break the holy seal
A brand new world tomorrow
A world of make believe

Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah, hurrah, apocalypse
Hurrah
Nothing's gonna save us this time
We are going down

Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah
(Apocalypse)
Hurrah
