You and I
Tempted by the promise of a different life
Time has fled
There's a constant battle running through my head

I don't know what to do
'Cause I still believe
After all the foolish things that we've been through
I will always be a man who's open to...

Persuasion
Blind romance
There'll be no half measures given half the chance
But we never learn

Trusting in the fire while the cruel flame burns
And we need to rebuild
What was never there
What got left behind

After all the foolish things that we've been through
I can always make a start on something new
And I'll always be a man who's open to...
Persuasion

And it's written in my heart
So that everybody could see it
And it's written in my soul
After all I still believe it

I still believe it
I still believe it yeah
I still believe
I don't know what to do, 'cause I still believe

After all the foolish things you put me through
I can always make a start on someting new
And I'll always be a man who's open to...
Persuasion, persuasion
