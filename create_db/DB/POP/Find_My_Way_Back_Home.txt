Went see my honey today
At the Hideaway
Found her with another guy
Thought I would die
And I'm trying to find
My way back home
I'm trying to find
My way back home

Yeah, yeah

But did I tell about him
Didn't hit me right
Now I find him with my girl
Gettin' her uptight
And I'm trying to find
My way back home
I'm trying to find
My way back home

Then things happen to me now
Thought she loved me so
Why'd she try so hard to fool me
Then let me know
Didn't think she'd ever do that
Never put me down (??)
Now I find she's (??)
She's a-running around
Oww!

Yeah, yeah

Gotta get away from here now
Gotta turn and run
Now I find she's been cheatin'
And I'm the lonely one
I'm trying to find
My way back home
I'm trying to find
My way back home

My way back home

My way back home

Yeah, yeah
