When you're alone with me 
I know that this could be

I can't help myself baby although I try
You're the flame that turned into a fire
And baby there's someone else in my life
But what you got, it keeps on callin'

When you're alone with me 
I know that this could be

Trouble
But I'm down to take a chance
Trouble
Cause I kinda got a man
Trouble
And I don't know what to do
Trouble
Cause I'm really feeling you

When you're alone with me 
I know that this could be

You don't know if he finds just what he?Ll do
So I'm telling you that there's a lot to lose
If he knew what we did, he'd act a fool
So lets be smart about this baby 

When you're alone with me 
I know that this could be

Trouble
But I'm down to take a chance
Trouble
Cause I kinda got a man
Trouble
And I don't know what to do
Trouble
Cause I'm really feeling you

When you're alone with me 
I know that this could be

As we proceed 
(Tell me if you're really sure)
I'm what you need 
(Can you handle what's in store)
I know it?S wrong 
(But the way I feel for you is strong)
If this keeps going on this could be dangerous

When you're alone with me 
I know that this could be

Trouble 
Trouble

When you're alone with me 
I know that this could be trouble
