Sorry for party rocking
I'll be up in the bar, looking for a hottie to bone
I gotta drink in my hand, and a 
Popping bottles in the house and models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see
Let's go! People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking! 

Leave those complaints, and turn it down
Sorry for party rocking! 
Haters don't like, we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking! 
When they talk shit, we just pick a line
Sorry for party rocking!
