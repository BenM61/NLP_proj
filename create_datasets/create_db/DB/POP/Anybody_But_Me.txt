I wish I could be
Anybody but me
I wish I could be
Anybody but me
Lonely, lonely as I can be

Well I had a true love
Had the world in my hands
Now I got a hurt
I can't hardly stand
A little bit of loving would be so grand

I'm not the same old me
That I use to be
I want to be somebody
Just anybody but me
I got the blues on my mind
Blues won't let me be

Now I want to be free
From what's holding me
Take away these tears
Take away these tears
And let me see
'Cause I want to be back
Like I use to be

I said I wish I could be
Yeah, anybody but me
Yeah, now I want to be
Just, any old body but me
Because I'm lonely
Lonely as I can be
