There's a place for us, somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air, wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us, someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare, time to learn, time to care

Someday, somewhere, we'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving, somewhere

There's a place for us, a time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half-way there, hold my hand and I'll take you there

Somehow, someday, somewhere
