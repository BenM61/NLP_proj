I'm sitting here on the phone
Blackberry to my head
Repeating all the words you just said
You said it's getting real
And you don't know how I feel

You're falling in love
And now you're getting scared
(You wanna know)
Do I feel the same
I'll be lying if I said yeah

Something we need to address
Before you hear me say yes
I've been down this road a time or two
So it's gotta be right for me and you

(So if I fall in love)
You gotta ride for me, like I'ma ride for you
(If I fall in love)
You gotta fight for me the way I fight for you

(If I fall in love)
Fall in love
You gotta hold it down even when I'm not around
(If I fall in love, in love, in love, in love)

It's been 3 months, 4 days, 5 seconds till the minute
But who's counting?
And I ain't never ever, not once thought about bouncing

They say you shouldn't ask questions
You don't wanna know the answer to
But I'm gon' answer you, see, I could be in love with you

But you would not believe it
And I could say I love you
When you say it to make things easy
But, I've been down this road a time or two
That's why I only say what I feel for you

(So if I fall in love)
You gotta ride for me, like I'ma ride for you
(If I fall in love)
You gotta fight for me the way I fight for you

(If I fall in love)
Fall in love
You gotta hold it down even when I'm not around
(If I fall in love, in love, in love, in love)

Girl, it's not that I don't want to be in love
But my love is stronger than you ever dreamed of
Have you ever had a hundred percent ?
A hundred percent of anything

When you look in my eyes and I don't reply
I don't want you to think that I
I don't love you 'cause I do
You're just not ready for me to show you, Girl

(So if I fall in love)
C'mon, baby
(If I fall in love)
I'll fight for you and you'll fight for me

(If I fall in love)
If I were to fall in love
I'll hold it down with you and me, girl
(If I fall in love, in love, in love, in love)
Love

(So if I fall in love)
If I fall in love
Baby, tell me
(If I fall in love)
Would you be there?
Would you be there, baby? Hey

(If I fall in love)
If I fall in love again
This time it's gonna be right
(If I fall in love, in love, in love, in love)
All Right
