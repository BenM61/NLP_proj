So I hope this finds you well 
Sun is shining down eastern valley ways 
There's some news I need to tell you 
Give my Mother a kiss 

Tell her I'm ok 
I recall her words 
"If it's too easy 
It never lasts 

I have compromised 
But I'm finally free of the past 
Now I can dance 
Clouds have all disappeared 

Freedom 
I hold so dear 
'Cause nobody knows me here 
Though I can only imagine the sadness 

In your eyes 
Please understand 
Now I can dance 
All alone the other night 

I came to realise we'd be friends for life 
It was always meant to be 
For some people the heavens can get it so right 
Like an angel you see 

You have graciously offered a hand 
You'd be so proud of me 
Now I'm finally taking a stand 
Now I can dance 

Clouds have all disappeared 
Freedom 
I hope so dear 
Cause nobody knows me here 

Though I can only imagine the sadness 
In your eyes 
Please understand 
Now I can dance 

Now I can dance 
Now I can dance 
Clouds have all disappeared 
Freedom 

I hope so dear 
'Cause nobody knows me here 
Though I can only imagine the sadness 
In you eyes 

Please understand 
Now I can dance 
Though I can only imagine the sadness 
In your eyes 

Please understand 
Now I can dance 
So I hope this finds you well 
Sun is shining down eastern valley ways 

So good 
Be free 
Can dance and laugh and just be me 
So good 

Be free 
The clouds above have disappeared
