I got a little girl
An' when she hold me in her arms
I'm out of this world
And she help keep that world

She's gotten me cryin', a valley of tears
You know baby, yearnin'
Because you know how I feel
You've gotten me cryin'
Oh yeah, you know there ain't no more

Now you know darlin' that you thrill me so
Tellin' you honey, you don't have to go
You've gotten me cryin' a valley of tears
You know baby, oh, because you know how I feel
You've gotten me cryin'
Whoa yeah, you know there ain't no more
