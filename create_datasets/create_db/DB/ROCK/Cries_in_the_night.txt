Oh, I'm sitting down, thinking about losing my mind 
'Cause I keep telling myself I'm only one of a kind 
My life is broke and my dreams were shattered 
For so very long nothing else mattered 

[Chorus:]
I'm hearing cries in the night; I can't wait another day 
No, no, no, tell me no lies; I'm standing cold in the light 
I lose the dream and I go crazy; I'm hearing cries in the night 

Yeah, they pull at my hair, and call out my name 
They think I'm cool and got worries with fame 
But I'm living to lose and dying to win 
With those people around here, my patience wears thin 

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'm trying to get away, get away from it all 
I stand and scream; I'm not gonna crawl 
The dream never dies 
That's why I sing the song 
Like my maddening world, it turns on and on 

[Chorus]
