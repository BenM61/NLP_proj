[Chorus x 2]
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware

This ain't no love song
More like a cut song
You say your day was long, well, tell daddy what's wrong
I'm a tell you one time, just relax and unwind
Whisper sweet nothings, now you blushing, chills down your spine
Oh yeah, you hot and tempted
Oh no, not Pretty Ricky
But when you grind on me
I'm a leave you hot and drippin'
Slip in those satin sheets
Now go and roll over
Oh yeah, it's up and down motions like a roller coaster
I see she up on top
You all on my jock
I'm a do it nonstop until your cherry pop
I'm a keep going and going, the energizer bunny
Mr Long John all in your tummy

[Chorus x 2]

Won't you let me introduce ya to thug Kamasutra?
This ain't no lovey dovey (nah), but watch how I seduce ya
Girl, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
I push the right buttons and the sex on demand
Oh yeah, I like it slow
Baby, be easy
Ooo, watch ya teeth
Baby, be easy
Tell me your Vicky secrets
Tell me all the dirt
You smell like peaches
Must bath and body works
Love the way your body work
I'm a make your body rock
Once you climax, you feel the aftershock
(I know I got you hooked on this lovin'
Don't get it twisted; we just cutin', baby)

[Chorus x 2]

Yeah, I know, I know I still ain't went soft
But I gotta go
Let's hit the shower, baby
It's time to rinse off
I'll wash yours, you wash mine
I adore it the first time
I blew yours, you blew mines
Sometimes I'll drop you a line
But, look, don't tell nobody
Just keep it on the low
Not your best friend, not your cousin
Nobody's gotta know
I know it sounds crazy, but that's just how it is
Yung J-O-C, long live, long live

[Chorus x 2]
