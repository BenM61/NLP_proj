Long ago, I had a special friend
Someone I gave my heart and trusted till the end
But then things went down, he really did me wrong
And left me feeling so confused abandoned and alone

But then you came alone like a breath of air
Uplifting me, you showed me how much you care
So here we are, together you and me

Hey baby, let's share that beat of love
(Share the beat of love, share that beat of love)
Let's share that beat of love
(Share the beat of love, share that beat of love)

I wanna thank you for what you've done for me
How you helped me to express the love I have inside of me
I must confess, I held it deep inside
Until you came along and showed me how to let my feelings fly

So here I am so in love with you
Together we can feel very special groove
We've got the champagne, darlin'
Tonight's the night

Hey baby, let's share that beat of love
(Share the beat of love, share that beat of love)
Let's share that beat of love
(Share the beat of love, share that beat of love)

Let's share that beat of love
(Share that beat of love, share that beat of love)
Let's share that, let's share that beat of love
(Share that beat of love, share that beat of love)
Hey baby, let's share this beat of love

Funny how life can turn you around
One day you're lost, next day you're found
I'm so glad that we happen to find each other
The things that you do show me that you love me
And you know I love you too

So let's take this time to discover
All the possibilities love has got for you and me
I know the deal, this love's for real, yeah

Let's share that beat of love
(Share that beat of love, share that beat of love)
(Share that beat of love, share that beat of love)
This love's for real, 'cause I know the deal
