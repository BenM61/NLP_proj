Just think about it
Just think about it

Lately I've been skeptical, silent when I would used to speak
Distant from all around me who witness we feel and become weak
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand, when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go

Of you and me, we're through an' rearranged

It seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind
So you leave and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to, disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go

Of you and me, we're through and rearranged
You and me, we're through and rearranged
You're no good for me, thank God its over

You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin'
And you make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin'

You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin', cryin' on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin', dyin' on me

You think that everybody is the same
I don't think that anybody is like you
You think everybody is the same
I don't think that anybody is like you

Just think about it
You'll get it
