Sure look good tonight
Underneath the lights I see ya
Set the night on fire
Smells so good like sweet magnolia

That look in your eyes, well, well
There's no denyin'
Oh, you got me hypnotized

Doesn't matter what you do
I'll keep comin' back to you
Do whatever you want to
I'll keep comin' back

You're such a lovely sight
We here together, dancin', movin'
Movin' right in style, yeah
Listen while the guitar takes a ride
Feelin' your vibe, baby, no denyin'
Oh, you got me hypnotized

Doesn't matter what you do
I'll keep comin' back to you
Do whatever you want to
I'll keep comin' back

Doesn't matter who you are
Get yourself down on the floor
Givin' time you'll realize
I keep comin' back

Everybody
(Everybody unwind)
Do you feel it?
(If you feel it, feel the vibe)
Say you're gonna lose control
(Don't you wanna lose control)
Everybody
(Everybody)
C'mon
(C'mon everyone)

Doesn't matter what you do
I'll keep comin' back to you
Do whatever you want to
I'll keep comin' back

Doesn't matter who you are
Get yourself down on the floor
Givin' time you'll realize
I keep comin' back

Doesn't matter what you do
I'll keep comin' back to you
Do whatever you want to
I'll keep comin' back

Doesn't matter who you are
Get yourself down on the floor
Givin' time you'll realize
I keep comin' back
