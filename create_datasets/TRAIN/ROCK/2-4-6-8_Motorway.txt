Drive my truck midway to the motorway station
Fair-lane cruiser coming up on the left hand side
Headlights shining, driving rain on the window frame
Little young lady stardust hitching a ride

And it's two, four, six, eight, never too late
Me and my radio trucking on through the night
Three, five, seven, nine, on a little white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light

Whizz-kid sitting pretty on your two wheels stallion
This old ten ton lorry got a bead on you
Ain't no use setting up with a bad companion
Ain't nobody got the better of you know who

Two, four, six, eight, never too late
Me and my radio trucking on through the night
Three, five, seven, nine, on a little white line
Single motorway sun coming up with the morning light

Well, there ain't no route you can choose to lose the two of us
Ain't nobody know when you're acting right or wrong
No one knows if a roadway's leading nowhere
Gonna keep on driving on the road I'm on

And it's two, four, six, eight, never too late
Just me and my radio trucking on through the night
Three, five, seven, nine, on a little white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light

Two, four, six, eight, never too late
Me and my radio trucking on through the night
Three, five, seven, nine, on a little white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light
That same old motorway sun coming up with the morning light

Yeah, yeah, yeah, say, two, four, six, eight, never too late
Just me and my radio trucking on through the night
Three, five, seven, nine, on a little white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light

And two, four, six, eight, never too late
Me and my radio trucking on through the night
