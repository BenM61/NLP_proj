Everybody plays a game, 
We don't have to save a name, 
Every day come sun array, 
I say good's just playing for safe. 
I don't have to say no more, 
You've got more time waiting for, 
Don't care if I break the law, 
I want more and more and more. 
Everybody plays a game, 
Voice inscription play for safe, 
You've got more time waiting for, 
I want more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And more and more and more and more 
And.
