Written about to death
Around for another breath
The cops will run
The masses will flow
Killed by consolidation
Killed by saturation
The underground will correct
With reaction rebellion

Rock and roll around my head
Alive and kicking
Rock and roll around my head
Fifty watts happening
Rock and roll around my head
Like a six string belief

The declaration framed the states
Revolution sets the course straight
It was necessary then
And it's necessary now
Corruption in the system
A grass roots insurrection
Could bring them down
Will bring them down

Rock and roll around my head
Alive and kicking
Rock and roll around my head
Fifty watts happening
Rock and roll around my head
Like a six string belief
