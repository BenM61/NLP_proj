I remembered you older and taller
But you're younger and smaller
So who's gonna call her and say
That you're back again?

And all the lies, they were wiser
And wise were the lies
And the lies were on fire
And the fires were put out just to be lit again

You're alone 'til you're not alone
And that's all you need to know
Every time you decide to stay
Then the world will make you go
And that's all you need to know

All the debts, they got settled
And the settlers got cattle
But the cattle was rattled by the snakes
That were guarding the garden gates

And you retired just in time
You were about to be fired
For being so tired from hiring the ones
Who will take your place

All the lies on your resume
Have become the truth by now
And the things that you never did
Have become your youth, somehow
You know everything by now

Enjoy your youth
Sounds like a threat
Enjoy your youth
Sounds like a threat
But I will anyway

I remembered you older and taller
But you're younger and smaller
So who's gonna call her and say
That you're here at last?

And all the days, they were longer
And the drinks, they were stronger
The words, we sang wrong
But the songs were remembered
And time just passed

You're around 'til you're not around
And that's all I need to know
Every time you decide to stay
Then the world will make you go
And that's all you need to know

Enjoy your youth
Sounds like a threat
Enjoy your youth
Sounds like a threat
But I will anyway
