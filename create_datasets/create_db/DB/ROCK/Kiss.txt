Oh, you know just how to get to me
My heart's so lonely
You live inside my head
And I cry too much you said
Well you're the fashion right now, the fashion right
You know I want you tonight
Why most nights do you wanna live inside my head?

You're a wave of a dream
Your love is clean
You're a wave of a dream
Your love is clean

Oh, you know just what to say
You show love in a different way
And you smelled of smoke
We don't know where heaven is
And I'm feeling cold
But I guess we're different

You're a wave of a dream
Your love is clean
You're a wave of a dream
Your love is clean
Just kiss me hard like you did at the start
Kiss me hard just like I'm breaking your heart

Kiss me hard just like you did at the start
Kiss me hard just like I'm breaking your heart

You're a wave of a dream
Your love is clean
You're a wave of a dream
Your love is clean
Just kiss me hard like you did at the start
Kiss me hard just like I'm breaking your heart
