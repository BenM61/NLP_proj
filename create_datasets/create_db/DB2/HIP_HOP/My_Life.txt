If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...

Life can be only what you make it
When you're feelin down
You should never fake it
Say what's on your mind
And you'll find in time
That all the negative energy
It would all cease

And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
Except for the man up above
Because He'll give you love

If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...

Take your time
Baby don't you rush a thing
Don't you know, I know
We all are struggling
I know it is hard
But we will get by
And if you don't believe in me
Just believe in "He"

Cause He'll give you peace of mind
Yes He will
And you'll see the sunshine
For real, yes you would
And you'll get to free your mind
And things will turn out fine
Oh, I know that things will turn out fine
Yes they would, yes they would

If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...
If you looked in my life
And see what I've seen...

All you gotta do is take your time,
One day at a time
It's all on you
what you gonna do?

Oh you will see I'm so down and out
Cryin' every day
Don't know what to do or to say
