I still dream of yesterday, when it almost all came true
We were living in a world with no goodbyes
And as your laughter fades away, I still reach out for you
How I'd ever let your love just slip right by

After you, there's too many hours in the day
Too many minutes I get lost in your memory
After you, there's too much silence in the night
Too much staying up alone, after you

Must be something I can say to find a way to change your mind
Though we really need to give it one more try
Guess I just got lazy in love, you gotta keep that spark alive
I can't believe I let that fire die

After you, there's too many hours in the day
Too many minutes I get lost in your memory
After you, there's too much silence in the night
Too much staying up alone, after you

You know I watch the blue light of every dawn
The day begins but the night lives on

After you, there's too many hours in the day
Too many minutes I get lost in your memory
After you, there's too much silence in the night
Too much staying up alone, after you
