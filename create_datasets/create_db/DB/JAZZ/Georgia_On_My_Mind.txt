Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Oh, I say, Georgia, Georgia, ooh yeah
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

Ooh, ooh, other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

I said now, Georgia, oh Georgia
No peace I find
It's just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

I say, Georgia, ooh, Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh-yeah
