Think
Of the days when I had too much
Of the things we found
Resistance died down
Fell on frozen soil

Bleed a little for a different day
Going deeper to come away

On the concrete sky
I saw the buildings rise
But keep our lights in shadow still
In the wind's eye
Where our reflection dies
Glass shrines of muted will

Dead
Is the time that I see from here on out
This burial ground
One more down
And buildings recoil
