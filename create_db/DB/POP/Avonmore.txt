As it was
In the beginning
Before the darkness
And the fall
I lay my head
On your heartbeat
Cloaking the dagger
Of your soul

I want a love that’s never ending
Through all the thunder and the rain
But there’s no sense in pretending
I know I’ll never fall in love again

What if you wake up
One morning
And you’re living in a world
That’s hard to face
What if the good times
Turn to sorrow
What if a stranger
Takes your place

I want a love that’s never ending
Through all the thunder and the rain
But there’s no sense in pretending
I know I’ll never fall in love again

I want a love that’s never ending
Through all the thunder and the rain
But there’s no sense in pretending
I know I’ll never fall in love again

We’ll cling
Together
In the moonlight
Burning the river
Into gold
Count all the minutes
Then the hours
Until your heart turns cold

I want a love that’s never ending
Through all the thunder and the rain
But there’s no sense in pretending
I know I’ll never fall in love again
