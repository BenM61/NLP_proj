Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I owe you for this one

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend

Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above

They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the f*ck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker).

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
