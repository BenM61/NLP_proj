I see the world through bloodshot eyes
Streets filled with blood from distant lies.
The dogs of war never compromise,
No real time for rearranging.

"Help me Jesus, Help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind.
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind.
He said it happens every time
Lock and load,
Lock and load,
That's how the story goes
In the Land of 1000 No's.
I'm all over you
In time my mind is changing.
Lock and load.

Black on black gives me a heart attack
And the silence makes it deadly.
Some choose to kill with simple will.
I've seen them fall fast and steady.

"Help me Jesus, Help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind.
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind.
He said it happens every time
Lock and load,
Lock and load,
That's how the story goes
In the Land of 1000 No's.
I'm all over you
In time my mind is changing.

Twist of fate won't give me a break
And myself, I'm slow and tired.
I've got to rise with these bloodshot eyes
But I keep falling when I'm higher.

"Help me Jesus, Help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind.
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind.
He said it happens every time
Lock and load,
Lock and load,
That's how the story goes
In the Land of 1000 No's.
We are bleeding sins but our sins 
Are always fading

Lock and load,
Lock and load.
