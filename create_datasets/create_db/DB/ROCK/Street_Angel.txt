I've been walking under rainbows too long to tell
You keep walking down mean streets 
My street angel
I try to bring you in out of the cold
But street angels live on the street 
And they always will

Street angels aren't like anyone you know
They do what they want and they go where they go
They may tell you
That you hold the world in your hands
But they always give it back 
They always give it back

No amount of crying changes your mind
No amount of praying brings you inside
I know that you love me 
And that you always will
You just stand outside and call to me 
My sweet street angel

A Charles Dickens character,
With your top hat and your scarf
When you pull me through the rainbow 
I thought you'd stop
But you didn't you turned around 
You went back to the children and your music 
And the people that you love

I can't help but wonder if 
Every one in a while you remember the girl
When you were a homeless angel 
That drove you wild
Strange and elusive 

No amount of crying changes your mind
No amount of praying brings you inside
I know that you love me and that you always will
You just stand outside and call to me 
My sweet street angel

So I ended it all for the both of us
I fell down the stairs a broken rag doll
But you never knew you just thought I went away
With nothing more to hope for 
But you don't hear voices anymore
No my sweet street angel
