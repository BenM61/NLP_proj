Well, you're the cutest thing that I did ever see
I really love you, baby, won't you come with me?

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind, oh, no

Every time you kiss me you just thrill me so
Never, never, never, never let me go

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time, uh uh
Ooh, baby, I can't get you, out of my mind, oh, no

I cry with feeling when you're near me
I'm high as a ceiling, oh, baby, hear me

'Cause I'm thinking I love
Place none above you
Come here, pretty baby

I can't wait because my love is coming down
I feel the mood for you for you, pretty babe
I'd break mama's rule

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time, oh, yeah
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

I never knew the thrill or ecstacy
So tell me that it's gonna be just you and me

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time, uh huh
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, no, no, no
