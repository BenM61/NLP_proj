You got what you wanted
Now you dont want what you got
Once I was a thrill to you, 'till suddenly I'm not
Was it my mistake
To give you everything I got?
You got what you wanted
Now you dont want what you got
(You got it, now you don't want me)

You (you) used to whisper in my ear, "baby, it's you"
Now you're laughing in my face
Say it with me

You got what you wanted
Now you don't want what you got
I wish I could do something
Lord knows, I don't know what
I guess you thought I'd be something I'm not
You got what you wanted
Now you don't want what you got (you don't want me)

I wish I still had what you wanted
I wish I could take back what you got
I said I gave you everything that you wanted
How come you don't want what you got?
I wish you still had what you wanted
I wish I could take back what you got
