I'm just a gigolo
Everywhere I go
People know the part
I'm playing

Paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Oh what their saying

There will come a day
And youth will pass away
What will they say about me

When the end comes I know
They'll say just a gigolo
Life goes on without me

I'm just a gigolo, everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance
Starting each romance
Oh what their saying

And there will come a day
And youth will pass away
What will they say about me

When the end comes I know
They'll say just a gigolo
Life goes on without me

'Cause I ain't got nobody
Oh and there's nobody cares for me
There's nobody cares for me

I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mamma
Come and take a chance with me
'Cause I ain't so bad

And I'll sing out, sweet love songs
All of the time
She will only be, only be
Bip bozadee bodzee bop le bop

I ain't got nobody
Oh and there's nobody cares for me
There's nobody cares for me

Hummala bebhuhla zeebuhla boobuhla
Hummala bebhuhla zeebuhla bop

I ain't got nobody, nobody
Nobody cares for me
Nobody , there's nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely,
Oh lonely, oh lonely, lonely lonely

Won't some sweet mama come and rescue me 
'Cause I ain't so bad

And I'll sing out
Sweet love songs
All of the time
She will only be, only, only, only only be
Baby, sugar darling

I ain't got nobody baby
And there's nobody, there's nobody
There's nobody, there's nobody...
