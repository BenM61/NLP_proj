We were born without time
Nameless in the arms of a mother, a father and a God
When the world waits for us a thousand years in the crush
Of our eyes fearless in awe
Quietly we'd fade in to sleep
With nothing on our minds

Then we love to be loved
In the rush we become
Some things we thought we'd never be
We were surprised by our how hard
Left weary and scared
By the nights, spent feeling incomplete
And all those evenings swearing at the sky
Wishing for one more time
All the promises we broke when we tried
Just wasting all our time

We get old all at once
And it comes like a punch
In the gut, in the back, in the face
When it seems someones lied
And our parents have died
Then we hold to each other in their place
And I feel the water rising around us
Maybe that's okay
Yeah I feel the world changing, all at once
I guess it will be okay

When we all had one hope
There was someone looking down
To return our bodies to each other
And the ground
