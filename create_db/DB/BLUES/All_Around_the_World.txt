Well, if I don't love you baby
Grits ain't groceries, eggs ain't poultry
And Mona Lisa was a man

All around the world I'd-a rather be a fly
I'll lite on my baby n' stay with her 'till I die
With a toothpick in my hand, I'd dig a ten foot ditch
And run through the jungle fighting lions with a switch

'Cause you know I love you, baby 
Yes, you know I love you, baby
Well, if I don't love you, baby
Grits ain't groceries, eggs ain't poultry
And Mona Lisa was a man

All around the world I got blisters on my feet
Trying to find my baby n' bring her home with me
You better run into me baby and be convinced
If you don't run into me, woman, you ain't got no sense

'Cause you know I love you, baby 
Well, you know I love you, baby
Well, if I don't love you, baby
Grits ain't groceries, eggs ain't poultry
And Mona Lisa was a man

All around the world, I never will forget
Lost all my money, my woman and my pet
I got to have you baby, settle for nothing less
Give up all my good time girls an' set for happiness

'Cause you know I love you, baby
Well, you know I love you, baby
Well, you know I want you, baby
Yes, your smiling face is my heaven in life

Well, you know I love you, baby 
Yes, you know I love you, baby
Ooh-ooh, you know I love you, baby
Yeah, you know I love you, baby

Well, if I don't love you, baby
Grits ain't groceries
Eggs ain't poultry
Mona Lisa was a man.
