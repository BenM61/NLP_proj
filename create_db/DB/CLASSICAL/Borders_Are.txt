Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go

Borders are, the gallows
Of our collective national egos
Subjective, lines in sand
In the water separating everything

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

Here's my song, for the free
No, it's not about praise and publicity
Corprotocracy, what a hypocrisy
Aristocracy versus democracy

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

The king is dead and now
We're dancing in the streets
As the waters rise we're
Merely covering our feet

I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

The kind is dead and now
We're dancing in the streets
As the waters rise we're
Merely covering our feet

Your gods are dead and now
We're dancing in the streets
As the waters rise we're
Merely cowering in defeat

I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
Never let you go

I never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go

I never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
