These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days

When the morning sun promises another wonderful day
And good fortune is all along the way
When your heart is filled with gladness
'Cause true love has come to stay

These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days

Every kiss will take us to a new world to explore
Bringing thrills that we never knew before
When the one you love can show you what's behind that magic door

These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days
These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days

Look around you - there's a rainbow in that watermelon sky
And twinkling of millions bye and bye
When your heart keeps taking pictures that we'll share as years go by

These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days
These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days

Look around you - there's a rainbow in that watermelon sky
And twinkling of millions bye and bye
Let your heart keep taking pictures that we'll share as years go by

These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days
These are happy, happy, happy summer days, summer days
