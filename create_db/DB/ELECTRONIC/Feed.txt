I saw her face in a magazine
She was there smiling back at me
It was a spark to the fire and I flew higher
Her hair as black as coal
Her eyes we're slightly blue
Am I imagining the beauty reflecting

Will she ever know my name
I'm dreaming
That someday she'll be mine

It's love that feeds the fire
In for desire I dive endlessly
I can't stop believing
Love will be there

I know you're out there somewhere
My dreams are all about you
Baby we could walk through fire
Your power I desire
Loving from a distance
Ain't got no resistance
Behind your made up face
Your secrets embrace

Will she ever know my name
I'm dreaming
Someday she'll be mine

It's love that feeds the fire
In for desire I dive endlessly
And I can't stop believing
Love will be there
Love will feed the fire
In for desire I dive endlessly
I can't stop believing
Love will be there.be there some day
