Well
Yeah
Oh
What do you do when you love somebody
And everything is goin' wrong, oh, no
Nobody knows the way you feel about it
'Cause only you know, you can't leave it alone
Oh, here we go again
Oh, here we go again
I thought what we had was over
Here we go again, ooh, hoo
Oh, here we go again
What do you do when you love somebody
And you decide to go it alone, oh, no, no
It never pays to give up on someone
When on the inside the feelin' is strong
Oh, here we go again
Oh, here we go again
I thought what we had was over now
(Here we go again) Ooh, baby
Oh, here we go again, ah
After all we've been through, baby, yeah
I keep comin' back to you now
Out of all the women in the world
I keep comin' back to you, yeah, baby
What do you do when you love somebody
And realize you're walkin' away, oh, no, no
You hesitate when it's time for leavin'
You and I know it's never too late
Oh, here we go again
Here we go again
Don't ever say it's over now
(Here we go again) Ooh, baby
Here we go again, oh
After all we've been through, baby, well
I keep comin' back to you now
Out of all the sweet women of the world
I keep comin' back to you, yeah, baby
Oh
After all we've been through, baby, yeah
I keep comin' back to you now
Out of all the sweet women of the world
I keep comin' back to you, yeah, baby
