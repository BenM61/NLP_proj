You grew wings on your heart
But you let it out your ribcage
And it flew into the dark

Like a ghost just like a ghost
And it flutters by my window
When I need my sleep the most

So choose my weapon and choose my way
It's easy saying nothing when there's nothing to say
Thinking about it every day, and starting to notice you're fading away

Fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade
Fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow

You want eyes in your hands
And power in your pocket
As I stop to watch you dance

With your hips swinging they shake hips swinging, got your
Hips swinging they shake hips swinging, got your
Hips swinging they shake hips swinging, again

Got your hips swinging they shake hips swinging, got your
Hips swinging they shake hips swinging, got your
Hips swinging they shake hips swinging again, and again, and again

So choose my weapon and choose my way
It's easy saying nothing when there's nothing to say
And thinking about you every day, and starting to notice

That it's two steps forward and one step back
Make up in love what you think I lack
You've got a vampire on your neck
Everybody knows what happens next

You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade
Fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow

So choose my weapon and choose my way
It's easy saying nothing when there's nothing to say
And thinking about you every day, and starting to notice

(Fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade)
(You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow)
