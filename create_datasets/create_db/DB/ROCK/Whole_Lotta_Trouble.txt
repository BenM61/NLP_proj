Would you change your mind, at the very last moment
Would you say stop for a second I'll bet you could think for a minute
In the morning light he says when will I see you
She says I don't think tomorrow, baby
Sometimes I wonder if things would change if we stayed together
Would you change your mind, at the very last minute
I think you should stop for a second Think for a moment

This could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble for you
Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble for you

And the angel said well you must have had a dream 
And you remember it 'till the dream followed through 
Till the end of the dream and the dream came true
When I want something I get it
You'd better go he says yes I think I better
Stop for a moment I think you should think for a minute
Would you change your mind, at the very last minute
When I want something I get it

Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble for you
Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble, baby
Whole lotta trouble for you

Oh yeah, oh yeah not guilty have mercy!
Oh he says you could be my prisoner 
Well you're not living in the real world 
You're not living in the real world

You're not my friend you're not my love
And this is something that we really don't discuss
Where are you sometimes I hear you crying 
And I wake up and I get through it

Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble for you 
Well this could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble, baby
A whole lotta trouble for you
