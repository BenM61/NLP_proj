The moon and you appear to be so near and yet so far from me,
And here am I, on a night in June, reaching for the moon and you.
I wonder if we'll ever meet, my song of love is incomplete,
I'm just the words, looking for the tune, reaching for the moon and you.

(musical interlude)

I wonder if we'll ever meet, my song of love is incomplete,
I'm just the words, looking for the tune, reaching for the moon and you.
