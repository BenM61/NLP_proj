Back to square one, and the old school backfire
It's just begun, let's watch the blind eyes turning
Stains on the wall, been waiting far too long now
Nice day, blue sky, I watch them shrug their shoulders
Tighten the grip (getting tighter)
Now see the ball is rolling
We take delight, it's been a long wait for this moment.

Back to square one, another empire backfire
Back to square one, another empire backfire

SIgn of the time, blood pressure running high now
Nowhere to dance, which channel can you turn to?
We take delight, we watch them shrug their shoulders
Let's take delight, it's been a long wait for this moment.

Back to square one (now it's my turn)
Another Empire backfire
Back to square one (now it's your turn)
And the old school backfire...
