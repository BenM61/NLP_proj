When the night
Is wrapped around us
And the dawn might come too soon
When the only light
That's found us
Is the solitary moon

When the songbird in the willow
Sings a soft and soulful tune
Once again
You share my pillow
Making love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share
The silent moon

As it slowly sails above us
In it's solitary flight
Seems the moon
Must surely love us
As it bathes us in it's light

Say that we can spent the day
Through a sunlit afternoon
Let your kisses say 
You'll stay here
And make love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share
The silent moon.

Say that we can spent the day here
Through a sunlit afternoon
Let your kisses say 
You'll stay here
And make love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share
The silent moon
The solitary moon
Tender loving moon
The sedentary moon
