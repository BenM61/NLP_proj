Whoa!
They say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby
Call me the big pill
Dr Funkenstein
The disco fiend with the monster sound
The cool ghoul with the bump transplant

Hip bone connected to my thigh bone
My thigh bone connected to my leg bone
My leg bone connected to my ankle bone
I get so hung up on bones
Dr Funkenstein here
Preoccupied and dedicated 
To the preservation of the motion of hips

We love to funk you, Funkenstein
Your funk is the best (talk!)
Take my body, give it the mind
To funk with the rest (kiss me on my ego)
Hit me with the one and then
If you like, hit me again
We love to Funk-a-stein (ohhh, over!)

Dr. Funkenstein, King of the Funk, yeah!
Swift lippin', ego trippin' and body snatchin'
I'll blow your mind
Comin' to you directly from the Mothership
Pulling up the last leg (ah, ah, ah)
Of the P.Funk
Well, alright

Dr. Funkenstein, yeah
He'll funk with your mind (ooover)

We love to funk you, Funkenstein
Your funk is the best (let me hear it for me)
Take my body, give it the mind 
To funk with the rest (ha!)
Hit me with the one and then
If you like, hit me again
We love to Funk-a-stein (alright!)

Microbiologically speaking,
When I start churnin', burnin' and turnin'
I'll make your atoms move so fast
Expandin' your molecules
Causing a friction fire
Burnin' you on your neutron
Causing you to scream
"Hit me in the proton, BABY!"

(I don't know what I'm talking about)
Hit me with the one and then
If you like, hit me again
We love you, Funkenstein (oh yeah, let's do it one more time)
Ohhhh, over!
Hoo-wee!
(you're really out of sight)
I hope you all got your sunglass on out there

Ho!
It's really gonna blow your mind

We love to funk you, Funkenstein
Your funk is the best (talk!)
Take my body, give it the mind 
To funk with the rest (kiss me on my ego) 
Hit me with the one and then
If you like, hit me again
We love to Funk-a-stein 

We love to funk you, Funkenstein
Your funk is the best (over!)
Take my body, give it the mind 
To funk with the rest 
Hit me with the one and then
If you like, hit me again
We love to Funk-a-stein 

Ain't nothing but a party, baby!
Swift lippin', and ego trippin' and body snatchin'
Dr. Funkenstein, you are really out of sight
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill
They call me the big pill
Hit me with the one and then
If you like, hit me again
We love to, Funk-a-stein 
(Yeah, hit me one time, one time!)
(Hey man, you make me feel so bad)

We love to funk you, Funkenstein
Your funk is the best (it is so funky around here)
Take my body, give it the mind 
To funk with the rest (I'm just funkin' and jumpin')
Hit me with the one and then (ooooover!)
If you like, hit me again
We love to Funk-a-stein (Yeah, we love you Dr. Funkenstein)

We love to funk you, Funkenstein
Your funk is the best 
Take my body, give it the mind (yeah, take it!) 
To funk with the rest (take it!)
Hit me with the one and then
If you like, hit me again
We love to Funk-a-stein
