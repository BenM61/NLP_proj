It takes time, to heal the wound I've
Made along the way
If I'm blind, open my eyes, 'cause
I need to see again

[Chorus]
If I can feel again
Will you tell me now or wait till I'm broken
Down again
Save me now, I'm broken

If I bleed, my lies won't fill the
Emptiness inside
I just need, for something real to
Open up my mind

[Chorus: x2]

Breaking down, I'm breaking down
It takes time

[Chorus]

It takes time
Breaking down I'm breaking down
If I can feel again
