I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I get a lot of pleasure
With a spano' keys
Underneath my finger tips
Tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah
I love to have a supple melody
Just tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before
I repeat what I said before

I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I know I'll always be the top banana
With a handful of keys
