I had a baby named Jane
She could shake that thing
Said her Daddy used to hang
With Johnny Coltrane
She sang a soul train
With her friend named Jen
Her booty was bigger than a Mercedes Benz
Jen was a herdy-gerdy-dirty little girly
I heard it from a birdy
She could cook a mean turkey
With gravy, baby, baby, baby
Baby was Jen's best friend, and maybe
If you were lucky
Licky, licky, sucky, sucky
Mickey, Mickey, f*ck me, f*ck me
More junk in the trunk than a Honda
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda

One, two, three, four
Get your booty on the dance floor
Work it out, shake it, little mama
Let me see you do the Jane Fonda
Five, six, seven now
If you don't know, let me show you how
To work it out; work it, little mama
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda

I had a princess, queen of incest
She was in bred Jean had big breasts?
And big eyes and a big ass to match
Jean wasn't fast, she was easy to catch
Then came Molly Hood from Hollywood highs
So fly she was Trans-Atlantic
She was a manic depressive (manic depressive)
Which was impressive
Very impressive, I had to test it
Tasted like chicken and was lemon scented
She took me home to her mama
I taught them both how to Jane Fonda

One, two, three, four
Get your booty on the dance floor
Work it out, shake it, little mama
Let me see you do the Jane Fonda
Five, six, seven now
If you don't know, let me show you how
To work it out; work it, little mama
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda

I had a girl named Dana 
From Santa Anna
She was a waitress at the Copa Cabana
She was slammin', and her ass was jammin'
Like Janet Jackson in Rhythm Nation
Her brother Jason had a girl named Grace
You could see her ass from outer space
So I landed on a planet
And planted a Mickey A flag, dammit

One, two, three, four
Get your booty on the dance floor
Work it out, shake it, little mama
Let me see you do the Jane Fonda
Five, six, seven now
If you don't know, let me show you how
To work it out; work it, little mama
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda
