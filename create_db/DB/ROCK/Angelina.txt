Angelina, though your eyes have been closed all your life
Angelina, let my love be their light
Though I'm a painter you can't see my pictures
But you know the colors I use
They flash in your mind still you don't know their meaning
But I'll teach their meaning to you

Angelina, though your eyes have been closed all your life
Angelina, let my love be their light
You never looked at the face that I cherish
Or seen the sun in your hair
I will speak softly and touch you and kiss you to prove I'm there

Angelina mm hm
Angelina let my love be your light
Angelina, just like the night is a part of the day
You're part of me

Angelina, though your eyes have been closed all your life
Angelina, let my love be your light
Angelina mm hm
Can you see Angelina mm hm
Can you see me Angelina
