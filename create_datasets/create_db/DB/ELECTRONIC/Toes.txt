If you are a cliffhanger ending
I'm the one that doesn't know anything
Like a magpie and a ring,
I'm always going to be looking right to you

Oh, you capture my attention
Carefully listening,
Don't wanna miss a thing,
Keeping my eyes on you
Got me on my toes

If I were to hide out on the sea,
You'd be whispering from the westerlies
In any book I'll ever read,
You'd be the line that sticks out to me,
Out to me

Oh, you capture my attention
Carefully listening,
Don't wanna miss a thing,
Keeping my eyes on you

Oh, you capture my attention
I'm anticipating,
I'm watching, I'm waiting
For you to make your move
Got me on my toes
Got me on my toes
Got me on my toes

Got me on my toes
Got me on my toes

Oh, you capture my attention
Carefully listening,
Don't wanna miss a thing,
Keeping my eyes on you

Oh, you capture my attention
I'm anticipating,
I'm watching, I'm waiting
For you to make your move
Got me on my toes
Got me on my toes
Got me on my toes
