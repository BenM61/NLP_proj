All through the night he is lying awake
Wond'ring how much more can he take
Watching the walls where the shadows dance
Drifting away into a trance
And his eyes are blazing with fire

Dreams burnt to ashes so many times
Highest of mountains, still he climbs
Ready to fly, cause he just can't stay
Flame burning brighter with every day
And his eyes are blazing with fire
Longing for the deepest desire

Heart of an eagle
He flies through the rainbow
Into a new world and finds the sun
Spreading his wings
Above all the sorrows
The glory of Eagleheart

Fever is burning in his veins
Determined with courage, breaking the chains
Back against the wall under blood red skies
Prepared to fight until he dies
And his eyes are blazing with fire
Longing for the deepest desire

Heart of an eagle
He flies through the rainbow
Into a new world and finds the sun
Spreading his wings
Above all the sorrows
The glory of Eagleheart

Heart of an eagle
He flies through the rainbow
Into a new world and finds the sun
Spreading his wings
Above all the sorrows
The glory of Eagleheart
