I've been searching
Didn't know what I was searching for
But I knew there had to be more
I've been waiting
For the day you'd come knocking at my door
And if you come knocking at my door

When it comes to love
I don't mess around
When it comes to love
I stand my ground

If you love me the way I want to be loved
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before
And if you treat me with respect and tenderness
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before
You're gonna beg for more

When you taste it
When it tastes so good you can't resist
You've got to have just one more kiss
I'm not gonna waste it
Gonna save on every single kiss
It don't get much better than this

When it comes to love
You don't mess around
When it comes to love
You know I'm down

If you love me the way I want to be loved
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before
And if you treat me with respect and tenderness
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before
You're gonna beg for more

And if you love me the way I want to be loved
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before
And if you treat me with respect and tenderness
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before

And if you love me the way I want to be loved
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before
And if you treat me with respect and tenderness
I'm gonna love you like you've never been loved before
You're gonna beg for more
