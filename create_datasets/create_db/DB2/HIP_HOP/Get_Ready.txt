Come on, get ready
This is the spring of our love
Come on, get ready
Feels like it's ordained from above

We have the power
To do what we came to do
This is the hour
The sun is shining on you

The future is now
The past is gone forever
We can come together
The light is our way

The future is now
The past is gone forever
We belong together
Get ready

Come on, get ready
The beach is washing away
Come on, get ready
The high tide of our love is here to stay

We will have the power
To do the good and the true
This is the hour
The whole world is waiting for you

The future is now
The past is gone forever
We can come together
The light is our way

The future is now
The past is gone forever
We belong together
Get ready
Get ready
Get ready

The future is now
The past is gone forever
We can come together
The light is our way

The future is now
The past is gone forever
We can come together
The light is our way

The future is now
The past is gone forever
We belong together

Get ready
Get ready
Get ready
Get ready
