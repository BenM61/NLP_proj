You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
And if I cause a commotion
I only end up losing you and that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone?
You shouldn't have fallen in love with

I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out now just what's to blame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we both the same, that's what I'm saying

Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone?
You shouldn't have fallen in love with

You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
And if I cause a commotion
I only end up losing you and that's worse, my pride

Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love, in love with someone?
You shouldn't have fallen in love with

Did you ever fall in love? Did you ever fall in love?
Did you ever, did you ever, did you ever?
Did you ever, ever fall in love? Did you ever, ever fall in love?
Did you ever, did you ever, did you ever?
