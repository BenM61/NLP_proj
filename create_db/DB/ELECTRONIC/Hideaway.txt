Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more

You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning
Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, it's going home

But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more!

Uh, you send me the shiver and the spine might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge, I'm letting go
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning

Pulling my head into the clouds I'm floating off
When you can be going I can't find a way to stop
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
Hide away with me some more

Taking me high up where I've never been before
I'm holding it back, just one sec, I won't be long

You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning
Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, whats going on?

You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
Hide away with me some more
