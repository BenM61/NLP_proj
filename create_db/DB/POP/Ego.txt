Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego, oh, oh

And I'm missing my miss of roses
Holding my head high up and
My head high up and
I know that she is stronger
'Cause she can break the silence, break the silence
So meet me by sea, you see it's ours
And our place to be somewhere else

Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away
Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away

Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego

When I'm seeing my miss of roses
The world is turning slower
Turning slower
And I guess that she's the strongest
That I have ever seen yet
Ever seen yet
And all along the way she'll need our love
Got to take care of her now
Care of her now
So meet us by the sea, you see it's ours
And our place to be somewhere else

Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away
Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away

Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Just too far away
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Just too far away
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
