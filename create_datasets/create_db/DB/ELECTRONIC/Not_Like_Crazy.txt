When we first met
I was surprised to get
That feeling,
That feeling
The kind that don't wash away with soap
So sweet to me,
Oohh
The kind of feeling I need
To get me through the darkest days
For you I prayed

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe,
Like the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
Like the rain falling from the sky
Like the trees growing from the ground
I'm astounded babe
By your love for me
And your touching me
And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo

Even now I still feel that feeling
Although we've grown
We're still on the same side
Of the proverbial road
Heading in the same direction
I'm so glad to know
With you I spend my time

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe,
Like the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
Like the rain falling from the sky
Like the trees growing from the ground
I'm astounded babe
By your love for me
And your touching me
And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo

And your trust in me
Like you do whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo

What you do is crazy babe
Not like you belong in an asylum
Crazy babe,
Like the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
