Forty days you've been tired and tempted,
Forty nights you've been out in the cold,
Every phone line conversation's been intercepted,
And you can't reconnect 'cos the frequency is closed.

So many miles you've been out of direction,
So many signs but you ain't got nowhere to go.
Your Cadillac's got it's lights disconnected,
Rolling your wheels down the wrong side of the road.

Can you see them now
Can you see them now
Can you see the sisters swinging?

Let's go back to church,
Let's go back to church,
So damn long since we sung the song,
Let's go back to church.

Let's go back to church,
Let's go back to church,
Anyday now, anyway anyhow,
Let's go back to church.

You drank the wine but it tastes like water.
You broke the bread but it had turned to stone.
Your sacrament it lay scattered on the pavement
The covenants you kept have all been stolen and sold.

But you can see them now
You can see them now
You can see the sisters swinging.
You can hear them now
You can hear them now
You can hear the brothers singing
