Sleigh bells ring, are you list'nin'?
In the lane, snow is glist'nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In a meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "no, man
But you can do the job when you're in town"

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose get a little chillin'?
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way, walkin' in a winter wonderland

In a meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "no, man
But you can do the job when you in town, brother"

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Oh, walk on, mm-hmm
Let's frolic and play the Eskimo way, walkin' in a winter wonderland
Come on, walk it, hmm, get on
