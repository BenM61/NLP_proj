Perdido
I look for my heart
It's perdido
I lost it way down in Torito
The day the fiesta started

Bolero
I sway that they play the Bolero
I kissed me the listing sombrero
And that's when my heart departed

High was the sun when I held her close
Low was the moon when we said, "Adios"

Perdido
My heart ever since is Perdido
I know I must go to Torito
To find what I lost Perdido

High was the sun when I held her close
Low was the moon when we said, "Adios"

Perdido
Goodnight perdido
I lost perdido
