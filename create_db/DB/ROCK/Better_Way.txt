I'm a living sunset
Lightning in my bones
Push me to the edge
But my will is stone
'Cause I believe in a better way

Fools will be fools
And wise will be wise
But I will look this world
Straight in the eyes
I believe in a better way
I believe in a better way

What good is a man
Who won't take a stand
What good is a cynic
With no better plan
I believe in a better way
I believe in a better way

(Hope these words feel pleasant as they rest upon your ears)
(Hope these words feel pleasant as they rest upon your ears)
(Upon your ears, upon your ears, upon your ears, upon your ears)

Reality is sharp
It cuts at me like a knife
Everyone I know
Is in the fight of their life
And I believe in a better way

Take your face out of your hands
And clear your eyes
You have a right to your dreams
And don't be denied
I believe in a better way
I believe in a better way
I believe in a better way
