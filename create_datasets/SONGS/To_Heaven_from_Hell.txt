Lonely moor, sky is grey
Moon acroos the waves
See the steely shafts of light reflect across the bay
Towards the tower
The coach prepares
To shed its load of life
I'm prepared for what they see
For what they meet tonight

To Heaven form Hell
I've been there before
To Heaven from Hell
Sweet I'm Sure
To Heaven form Hell
I've been there before
To Heaven from Hell
Lock my door

On we go, up to the castle
Death waits for our call
left unkempt, but quietly praying
Remembers when to call
Alone for now
But soon not so
As we return to reclaim
The home of my generations

lost but now remain
To Heaven form Hell
I've been there before
To Heaven from Hell
Sweet I'm Sure
To Heaven form Hell
I've been there before
To Heaven from Hell
Lock my door

Oh Lord now help
Its entrance falling down
The madness of our fathers law
The pain of retribution
The house brought down to ground
Sins of my ancestors
The judgement day's at hand
Yeah
The creeping voice of fire
Screams out for bloody war
Send out the grave
