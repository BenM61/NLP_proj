Can't believe what I just heard on the radio
Has music really come to this?
Can't believe what I just saw on the video
Kids watching 2 girls kiss

Now I ain't hatin? on nobody?s hustle
'cause I know that the root is greed
Labels keep on manufacturing
While they procreate immorality
Everybody don't wanna hear this mess now

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
Whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat

Now it?s time to get back to the music now
It?s a gift from God so be careful how you use it now
Get high off of creativity
Flaunt your craft not your sexuality

Artists in this industry
Have a responsibility
To make songs that inspire
Human morality

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
Whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
Whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat

Breathe
Check

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
Whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
Whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
Whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
And whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat
