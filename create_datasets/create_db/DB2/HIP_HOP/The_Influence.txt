(Zaakir)
Yo, I create off drum drops and ate away blacktops
Grab the mic so you don't react
The double X Polo shirt with the hat to match
In fact, we verbally vibrate your track

(Marc 7even)
Then crush your confidence like plastic condiments
Build you up to break you down like forgotten monuments
The question is this: will they return with the hot shit?
Or keep it on the low flow

(Charli 2na)
Yo, and for you confused bastards, Tuna the blues master
Quick to grib the mic, crews fast and sound clashing
Critical mass, pinnacle blast have been deflected
Hypodermic vocals I flash get you infected

(Akil)
I don't sip on brew, so this Bud's for you
Speak when spoken to whenever you come through
My vibes fill you, Internal Revenue
You rhyme prostitute
