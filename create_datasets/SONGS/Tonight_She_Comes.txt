I know tonight she comes
She's taken a swipe at fun
She gives me a reason
The sight in my sights
Well I know tonight she comes

She channels me up
She does it with ease
And sometimes she passes through me
Just like a breeze
She gives me a reason
For feeling alright, oh well
(Know tonight) (I know tonight) I know tonight
(Know tonight) (I know tonight) I know tonight
(Know tonight) (I know tonight) she comes

I know she's gonna to stay implanted
In my mind
Why does she keep me hanging
On the line

I know she going to do it to me
One more time (one more time)
I know she gonna to stay implanted
In my mind
Oh, why does she keep me hanging
On the line, oh yeah

I know the way that she feels
And all of the hearts that she steals
She tells me it's easy
When you do it right, oh well
I know tonight she comes

She tells me it's easy
When you do it right
(Know tonight) (I know tonight) I know tonight
(Know tonight) (I know tonight) I know tonight
(Know tonight) (I know tonight) she comes

I know tonight (I know tonight)
Oh yeah (I know tonight)
Well, I know tonight
(Know tonight) (I know tonight) tonight she comes
