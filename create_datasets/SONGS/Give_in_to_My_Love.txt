Have you heard the news of my love?
Did they send a message down
That' I'm on the march with my love?
And I'm death or glory bound
From the mountains to the marshes
My love is gaining ground
Give in to my love, give in to my love 

Well I want to show you my love
It's bigger than a Cadillac
But you keep up your resistance
And you try to drive me back
I want to show you all my love
It's bigger than a Cadillac
Give in to my love, give in to my love 

My love is like a drunkard
Holding up the bar
And he'll say the same thing over
And he'll fix you with his stare
You try and change the subject
But you won't escape the war
Give in to my love, give in to my love
Give in to my love, give in to my love
