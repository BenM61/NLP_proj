Shoo do, shoo

Oh, many say 
That I'm too young 
To let you know just 
Where I come from 

Oh, but you will see 
That it's just a 
Matter of time 
My love will surely 
Make you mine 

Ooh, living in a 
World of ghetto life 
Everybody around 
Seems so uptight 

Nothing's wrong 
It's alright with 
My man, my man 

I like the kinds of 
Ways we have our fun 
His loving ways 
Send me on and on 

Yeah, hey, with my man 
People out there 
Can understand 

I'm giving him 
Something he can feel 
Ah ha ha, to let you know 
My love is real 

So much love for us to feel 
So much hope for material things 
Are they only in my dreams 

So I write this song for you 
To prove that real things 
Do come true 

Ooh, living in a 
World of ghetto life 
Everybody around 
Seems so uptight 

Nothing's wrong 
It's alright with 
My man, my man 

I like the kinds of 
Ways we have our fun 
His loving ways 
Send me on and on 

Ooo hoo, with my man 
People out there 
Can you understand 

Giving him 
Something he can feel 
I sure want you to have it babe 
My love, my love is real 

Giving him 
Something he can feel 
I want you to know my love 

Giving him 
Something he can feel 
Gonna give you whatcha, whatcha really need babe
