I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel don came to me
And kissed me in my sleep,
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep

I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
I set my mind a wandering and I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try,
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died

I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell

You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took that tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love across the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die

I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell

I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you and me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie

I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
