Take me lightly, I am not the way I ought to be
I'm just the way I got to be
Take me slowly, or else you may come by injury
I'll hurt you emotionally

Rock me baby, until my eyes are closed and I'm asleep
And then it's it for you to leave.
Call me lazy, for I have yet to let my soul free
It's still very much in my reach, oh

I just wanted to unfold
Simply simple
I do everything I'm told
Keep it simple

You want babies, well here I am so why not aren't you pleased
With a big baby like me
I throw a fit, and to pick up after it
Domesticated bliss

I just wanted to unfold
Simply simple
I do everything I'm told
Keep it simple

Simple simple
(Yeah yeah)
I do everything I'm told
I just wanted to unfold
Simply simple
