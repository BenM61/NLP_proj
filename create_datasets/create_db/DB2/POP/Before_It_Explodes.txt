It's not a question of love
'Cause our love has never changed
But all the little things keep piling up
And life keeps getting in the way

Don't make this harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

Somethings we won't understand
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood
So let's just turn and walk away
And hold on to what was good

Before it explodes, before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes
