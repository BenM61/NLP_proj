Hold me down, 'cause I don't want to wait
I've been blackmailed by myself into this state
Shut it up, 'cause I don't want to hear
These old boring ethics must end right here

Hold me down, 'cause I don't want to be
Another victim of salvation that's choking me
Set it off, 'cause I've had enough
So please please please yeah baby shut up

Consider me consider this
Empty phrases kissing on emptiness
Hold me down, 'cause I don't want to wait
For some lame unemployment plan to set it straight

Shut it up, cause I don't want to hear
About prospects of redemption by the things we fear
Hold me down, cause I don't want to go
Things are moving backwards baby or not at all

Set it off, 'cause this is killing me
Just waiting for something that will set us free for real
Consider me consider this
Empty phrases kissing on emptiness

You see now baby this fire turns to flames
And I kept hoping that things they would change
But now I see what they are offering me
Are just bigger cages and longer chains
