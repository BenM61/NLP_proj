I'm just a little "Jackie Horner"
Since I met my sugar cane.
That gang of mine has been revealin'
That they're feelin' sore.
I left the lamp light on the corner,
For the moon in lover's lane.
I'm doing things I never did before. 

When I take my sugar to tea, all the
Boys are jealous of me, 'cause I
Never take her where the gang goes, 
When I take my sugar to tea. 

I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me, 
She's a high hat baby, that's she, 
So I never take her where the gang goes, 
When I take my sugar to tea.

Ev'ry Sunday afternoon,
We forget about our cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz,
With those millionaires. 

When I take my sugar to tea, 
I'm as Ritzy as can be, 
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes, 
When I take my sugar to tea.
