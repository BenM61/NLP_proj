I don't think I've ever told you
How much I believe in you
And every time I touch you
This feeling comes through

Oh! the mornings
Oh! the soul love
Can't forget it
How you look when I look at you

I never could be so happy
All over the world with you
So here I go trying to tell you
How much I love you

Don't ever begin to doubt this
No matter how had the breaks
My body 'n' soul forever
Whatever it takes

Oh! so magical
Oh! so mystical
When you're in my arms
Loving me when I'm loving you

I know this love was blessed in heaven
Believe me when I say it's true
No other could begin to give me
What's coming through

I'm wanting to always tell you
How much I believe in you
So if I don't seem to say it. Believe me it's true

Yeah! believe me it's true. Yeah! Yeah!
Believe me it's true

I don't think I've ever told you
How much I believe in you
And every time I touch you
This feeling comes through

Oh! the mornings
Oh! the soul love
Can't forget it
How you look when I look at you
