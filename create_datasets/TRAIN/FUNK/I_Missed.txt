I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

I saw you standin all alone
And suddenly this thought crossed my mind
You and I
Sharing love we've never known
This feeling is oh so good to me
Baby

And when I said hello
You looked at me
Oh so sweet
It's you I'd like to know
But when you turned away and walked out the door

I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

Tell me what can I do
To make you see the way I feel is real
If only I
Could talk to you
Girl I know
You'd realize that I am the one for you

Can't get you off my mind
You totally
Stole my heart
Girl it's worth a try
To find out if there's a chance

I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

Give me one minute of your time
And I'll make it worth your while
It seems to me that you've been hurt by other guys
Cuz when I say hello you say goodbye

I missed
I must admit

But girl you're much too much for me to quit
I missed
I must admit

But girl you're much too much for me to quit
I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

My baby
My baby

The girl the girl the girl is fine
Wish that you were mine
Oh girl

I missed
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit

And when I said hello you looked at me, oh so sweet
It's you I'd like to know
Girl you're much too much for me to quit
But then you turned away and walked out the door

I missed
Girl you're much too much for me to quit

I missed
I must admit
But girl you're much too much for me to quit
