So sweet-you're my desier
Dig deep and feel the fire
You can use me my love for hire
I can't sleep-you got me wired

When you get close to me
My temperature's up-I feel the heat
And then you get close to me-
Do me anyway you wanna

Throw down-see it growin'
My heart's poundin' keep it goin'
Readaday, ready, ready, when you gonna
Do me anyway you wanna
