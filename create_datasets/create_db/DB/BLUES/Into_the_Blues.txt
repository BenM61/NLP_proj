My baby likes this music good and loud
With words coming straight from the heart
Man woman or child can tell this story
Just as long as it's a soulful start
All the better to make you glad
That your life has taken a different path
At the same time wondering
How you can get on a train 
To this town

My baby don't like rock and roll
Not hip hop or pop
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues

God bless the blues
God bless the blues 
Hey Yea
Are you are mannish boy 
Just like the might mud
Blues are here to make you glad
That your life has taken a different path
At the same time wondering
How you can get on a train 
To this town

My baby don't like rock and roll
Not hip hop or pop
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues

My baby don't like rock and roll
Not hip hop or pop
Dance might be real cool
And country's just for fools
Baroque is just for the old
For the tired and the restless souls 
Lost in the darkness
Lost in the darkness

My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
