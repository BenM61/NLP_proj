It's a lonely night
Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing
No eyes, no eyes on me

So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men

So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men

It's a lonely night
Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing
No eyes
No eyes on me 

No eyes on me

Can you see me lying?
Can you see why I contained?
Can you feel me thinking?
Would you save me if I fail

I would love to love you
I would love to be your man
But in loneliness, please leave me

No eyes
No eyes (No eyes)
No eyes
No eyes on me

So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men

So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men
