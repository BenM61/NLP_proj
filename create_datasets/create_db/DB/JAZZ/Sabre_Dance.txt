My heart begins to tingle when the bells begin to jingle
Zig-idee, zing, zing, zing, zig-I-dee zing zing
Zig-I-dee zing zing, zig-I-dee zing zing,
Ev'ry time they play the sabre dance,
My heart beats try to capture all the rhythm and the rapture;
Zig-idee, zing, zing, zing, zig-I-dee zing zing
Zig-I-dee zing zing, zig-I-dee zing zing,
Ev'ry time they play the sabre dance.

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
I love the spell I'm under when the drums begin to thunder,
Boom-I-dee boom boom, boom-I-dee boom boom, 
Boom-I-dee boom boom, boom-I-dee boom boom, 
Like the tempo of a tropic rain,
When I hear trumpets blaring I can feel adventure flaring;
Ra-ta-ta tat tat, ra-ta-ta tat tat
Ra-ta-ta tat tat, ra-ta-ta tat tat
I am in a mood I can't explain,
I drift to an isle of perfume where summer roses eternally bloom,
There is a golden gleam waits my one wonderful dream;
Soon in a garden for two,
Lips cling to mine in the shadowy blue;
Arms filled with sweet delight hold me tight all through the night.
Music take me don't forsake me,
Let me be a ship lost at sea that the winds rock and roll;
Whirling, swirling, twirling, out of control, 
That music drives me crazy,
Ev'rything becomes so hazy;
Drums are booming, cellos zooming,
Cymbals crashing, sabres flashing in a willy nilly sort of way,
I seem to hear it night and day;
Blending in romantic fashion, melody, moonlight and passion,
Riding high on heaven's highway,
Purple stars are guiding my way;
I am like a comet whizzing by,
Just when I get the feeling that the universe
Is reeling, suddenly the song is ending;
And I find that I'm descending like a star 
That's falling from the sky,
Toppling! Twisting! Tumbling!
And down and down and down and down and 
Roun' and roun' and roun' and roun' and 
Down and down and down and down, 
And I begin to spin into a trance
Ev'ry time they play that sabre dance
