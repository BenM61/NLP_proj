Where will I be 365 days from now
Tell me
How will I feel 365 nights without you
Oh what would I do?

I remember what you used to say
Things won't tumble down
Now we're here and finally it changed
When I'm standing on solid ground
I don't understand
When did we go wrong?
And I can't imagine

Where will I be 365 days from now
Tell me
How will I feel 365 nights without you
Oh what would I do?

And now it feels like we're drifting apart
Things are not what they used to be
Now I know it's written in your heart
You don't wanna be a part of me
I don't understand
What did I do wrong?
And I can't imagine

Where will I be 365 days from now
Tell me
How will I feel 365 nights without you
Oh what would I do?

Oh what would I do
Tell me

I've been trying so hard
Not to let it show
But deep within my feelings
They glow
Before you leave me and let me go
Something I need to know
Where will I be 365 days from now
Tell me
How will I feel 365 nights without you
Oh what would I do?
365 nights without you
