She put nine hundred dollars on the fifth horse in the sixth race
I think its name is "chips ahoy!"
It came in six lengths ahead, we spent the whole next week getting high
At first I thought that she hit off some tip that she got from some other boy
We were overjoyed

Wo-ah-oh-ee-ah-oh-ee-oh
Wo-ah-oh-a-ee-oh-oh
Wo-ah-oh-ee-ah-oh-ee-oh
Wo-ah-oh-a-ee-oh-oh

I got a girl and she don't have to work
She can tell which horse is gonna finish in first
Some nights the painkillers make the pain even worse

Came in six lengths ahead
We spent the whole next week getting high
I love this girl but I can't tell when she's having a good time

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you? (wo-ah-oh-ee-ah-oh-ee-oh)
How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance? (wo-ah-oh-a-ee-oh-oh)
How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you? (wo-ah-oh-ee-ah-oh-ee-oh)
How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance? (wo-ah-oh-a-ee-oh-oh)

She's hard on the heart and she's soft to the touch
She gets migraine headaches when she does it too much
She always does it too much

How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you? (wo-ah-oh-ee-ah-oh-ee-oh)
How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance? (wo-ah-oh-a-ee-oh-oh)
How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you? (wo-ah-oh-ee-ah-oh-ee-oh)
How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance? (wo-ah-oh-a-ee-oh-oh)
And you won't even dance.
