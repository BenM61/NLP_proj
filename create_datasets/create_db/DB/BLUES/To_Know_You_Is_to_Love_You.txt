To know you, is to love you,but to know me, is not that way you see
'Cause you make me, so happy,that my love for you grows intensely
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
Baby, to know you is to love you,you smile when I see your face
'Cause there is no one on this earth
Baby, could ever, ever take your place
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me
Oh, to know you is to love you,is to see you, being free as the wind
'Cause the power, of your loving, is to be strong to hold yourself within
To know you is to love you
To see you going free ...
The collar, of your loving
I never found a woman like you, that could be my lover 'n' my best friend
I know you, and I think I love you
I know you, and I think you love me
I know you and can't you feel our love just growing,growing, growing, growing, 
growing, growing, hey
I know you, and I think I love you
I know you, and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love just growing,growing, growing, growing,
