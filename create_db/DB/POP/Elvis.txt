I'm living dead 
Dreaming of ghosts 
You've been trying to tell me all this time 
And the King's in my head 
Sings his songs he's amazing 
I've been dreaming of Elvis all my life 
Chorus: 
So now you're stealing my time 
All the hours that I once stole from you 
I never thought you would mind 
But I can see you do 
All skin and bones 
All on my own 
You've been trying to tell me all this time 
And the things in my head 
Are slowly driving me crazy 
I've been dreaming of Elvis all my life 
Chorus x2 
So now you're stealing my time 
All the hours that I once stole from you 
I never thought you would mind 
But I can guess you do
