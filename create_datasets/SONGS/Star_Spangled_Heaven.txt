Over the battle fields of all the great wars since the beginning of time
Have walked perhaps the bravest heroes of them all
The men known simply by the soldiers as the Chaplain
And this is the story of but one of the many and many thousands
Who gave his life in the service of his God and his country

There's a star spangled heaven for every soldier boy
Who fights to keep our country clean and free
So soldier trust in Jesus let him fill your heart with joy
He'll stand by you throughout eternity

And although army chaplain who was stopped and bent with years
Was walkin' o'er the battle field his old eyes filled with tears
He was searching for the wounded to try to ease their pain
And for those he knew would never live to rise and fight again
For life for them was over their earthly cares were done
They had gone to meet their Savior their battle had been won
And I couldn't help but notice as he went from place to place
That each soldier boy had died fighting with a smile upon his face
And I saw him kneel beside each one and slowly breathe the prayer
While the tears were streamin' down his face and the wind blew through his hair
And I could hear the big guns boomin' o'er the hill and not too far away
And as I turned to leave him that's when I heard him say
There's a star spangled

Though days and month and even years have slowly drifted by
And all we have are the mem'ries of our boys who have to die
They're living with their Savior beyond the crystal sea
In the Star Spangled Heaven throughout eternity
