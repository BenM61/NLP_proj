A honey skinned girl, she's light on her feet
Twirling on Apollo but she's going down there for something to eat
On the corner, we see him coming
Followed by the rabbis with their soft shoes humming

We're falling up, yeah, yeah
We're falling up

Come on try to remember
Honey girl, we could be like him
Transfiguration, try to remember

We're falling up, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're falling up, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're falling up, oh, woah
We're falling up

Honey baby
We're living with the Romans now
I want you to remember this
Come on, try to remember

We're falling up, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're falling up, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're falling up, hey
We're falling up, oh, woah

Try to remember
Try to remember
Try to remember
