It's over now, it's over now
They're gonna try and teach us
It's comin' down, it's comin' down
They're gonna come between us
I'm over now, I'm over now
Let them try to

'Cause I beat you once and I'll beat you twice
And you let me dance and you let me cry oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh

It's over now, it's over now
They're gonna try to beat us
It's comin' down, it's comin' down
This is nothing to discuss
I'm over now, I'm over now
Let them think too

I've let you once and I've had you twice
And I danced all night to the morning lights oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

I let you down
You knocked me out
I don't think back
So I hold on

I let you down
I watch your phone
Please call back
Dance in your hometown

It's over now, it's over now
They're gonna try to buy us
It's comin' down, it's comin' down
They're gonna fight agaist us
I'm over now, I'm over now
Let them try to

'Cause I tricked you once and I kissed you twice
And you let me dance and you let me cry
Oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh

It's over now, it's over now
They're gonna try to beat us
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
They won't come between us
I'm over now, I'm over now
Let them try to

'Cause I've hurt you once and I've hurt you twice
And I danced all night to the morning lights oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
