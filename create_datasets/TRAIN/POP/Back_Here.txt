These broken strings they won't pull them back again
Caught in the middle with the future, got no plan
Wish I could freeze these moments now to never end
But I just don't know where to start

Stepping up knowing everything will change
We reach out but no one's there to point the way
I'm not the first but not the last but I won't say
I'm not afraid that this might break us but

You and I, we're both the same
Try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know, that we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again

If I miss those sleepless nights that turn to days
If trouble finds me then there's no one I can blame
No regrets we know it's got to be this way
And everything must change but

You and I, we're both the same
Try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know, that we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again

You and I, we're both the same
Try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know that we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again

You and I, oh, we're both the same
We try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know, we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again
I wish that we were back here
