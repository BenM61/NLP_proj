When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered

Your data, my data
The chromosomes match
Exact as in matter
A matter of fact

These amaranth feelings
A cognitive state
Need the love object
To reciprocate

When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered

When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
But I'm overpowered

As science struggles on
To try to explain
Oxy-toxins flowing
Ever into my brain

As science struggles on
To try to explain
Oxy-toxins flowing
Ever into my brain

A chemical reason
If reason's your game
A chemical needing
Is there in the brain

With pre-programmed meanings
Like a little more pep
Alien feelings
We have to accept

When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered

When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered

As science struggles on
To try to explain
Oxy-toxins flowing
Ever into my brain

As science struggles on
To try to explain
Oxy-toxins flowing
Ever into my brain

I'm overpowered
