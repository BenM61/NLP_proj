I tell you he was a masterpiece
How are you says I
Just cool says he
He never shook my hand
He was no gentleman
But he was o-o-o-over me, oh-oh-oh

I met him hanging out at the park
I was scared 'cause it was after dark
And he wore fast street clothes
And he was clearly posed
But he was o-o-o-over me, oh-oh-oh

Pleasure of love, pleasure of love
I tell you he knew the pleasure of love
Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love

His smile was rich although his clothes were poor
Something in his eyes of great allure
And I could not resist
A calculated risk
Since he was o-o-o-over me, oh-oh-oh

We broke the rules but we won the game
Nothing to lose, everything to gain
And now I have no doubt
I could not live without him
I am o-o-o-over him, oh-oh-oh

Pleasure of love ..., pleasure of love ...
I tell you he knew the pleasure of love
Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love

We'll have our babe, or maybe two or three
We'll love that babe our own sweet family
And we will live in style
And make it well worthwhile
'cause I am o-o-o-over him, oh-oh-oh

I tell you he was a masterpiece
How are you says I
Just cool says he
He never shook my hand
He was no gentleman
But he was o-o-o-over me, oh-oh-oh

Pleasure of love, pleasure of love
I tell you he knew the pleasure of love
Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love

Pleasure of love, love, love, love ...
Pleasure of love, love, love, love ...
Pleasure of love, love, love, love ...

We broke the rules but we won the game
Nothing to lose and everything to gain
And he will marry me
I'll carry his baby
Because I'm o-o-o-over him, oh-oh-oh

Pleasure of love ..., pleasure of love ...
I tell you he knew the pleasure of love ...
Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love ...

Pleasure of love, pleasure of love
I tell you he knew the pleasure of love
Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love

Pleasure of love, pleasure of love ...
I tell you he knew the pleasure of love ...
Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love ...
