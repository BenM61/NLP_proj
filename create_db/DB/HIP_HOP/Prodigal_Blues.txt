Riding my life
Like a run-a-way train
Moving from
One track to that
Howling, crying,
Screaming at the moon
Only my voice came back
Only the echo came back

When I was a boy
Daddy told me
Grow tall
Yes and Billy don't crawl
Taught me how to ride
Set me out on my own
And I never came back

And yes I'd do it again
Oh wouldn't you
Yeah I'd do it again
A-huh oh yeah
Do it again
Baby
Wouldn't you?

Remember
When I lied
Just when you
Needed me
Now I sit
Alone and cry
'Cause now I believe in mercy
Remember when I lied
Just when you needed me baby
I believe in mercy

Riding, walking
Looking so cool
Guess I crossed
Over the borderline
Treated like a dunce
Who just can't read
Did I fool me too?
And yes I'd do it again
Oh wouldn't you
Yes I'd do it again
Aha yeah I'd do it again
Baby
Wouldn't you

Remember
When I lied
Just when you
Needed me
Now I sit
Alone and cry
'Cause now I believe in mercy
Remember when I lied
Now that you
Needed me
Yes I believe in mercy

I said "Come here"
Look into my face
And hear into my heart
Hesitation
Could re-arrange
The other side
To your love
Take hold now baby
And take
What other
Lovers have not
Times is changing
Will they re-arrange

The other side to your love
No-woah woah woah
Yeah

Wooooo

Here he is impatient one

The impatient one
