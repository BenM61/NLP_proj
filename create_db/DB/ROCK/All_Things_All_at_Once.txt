In those days, we were lions
In those days, we were kings
It's not one thing or the other
It's all things all at once

Ooh, I will love you better than him [x5]

OOooh [x6]

And these wings aren't for flying
These wings are just for show
It's years since I've been flying
I'm down to the earth

Ooh, I will love you better than him [x5]

OOooh [x6]

In those days we were lions
In those days we were kings
