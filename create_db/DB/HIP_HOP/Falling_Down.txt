'Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Yo let's do that song for Peep
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So 'Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down, yeah

'Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around (I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town (out of town)
(Ooh, ooh)
So 'Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(Ooh, ooh)

Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Darling, your love is like walking a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fighting

'Ko, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (falling down)

(Ooh, ooh)

It's unfortunate because it's like, yo, when people die, that's when you're there, you know?
'Cause your remorse kinda makes you check 'em out

Darling, your love is like walking a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fighting
