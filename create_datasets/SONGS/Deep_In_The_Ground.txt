There's a hole
Deep in the ground
And I can be found
Diggin' it deeper

And if you want
Look all around
'Cause you'll fit right in

Things are lookin' up
From way down here
So long as you don't stand on me

You know that things are looking
Clearer since I closed my eyes
And I can see the things I need to see

There's a hole
Deep in the ground
And I can be found
Diggin' it deeper

And if you want
Look all around
'Cause you'll fit right in

Well I don't really care
What they say up there
'Cause I got me a place to go

If you don't know what you want
How do you know what you want
When I've got what you want right here

There's a hole
Deep in the ground
And I can be found
Diggin' it deeper

And if you want
Look all around
'Cause you'll fit right in
