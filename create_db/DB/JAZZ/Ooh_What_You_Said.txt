Ooh! What you said, got me all flustered, face is red 
Ooh! What you said when you said what you said 
Ooh! What you did, got me all bashful like a kid 
Ooh! What you did when you did what you did 

Fun is fun, but look at what you've done 
ain't you the naughty one, talking that way, 
Say, are you joking or just outspoken? 
Ooh! What you said, oughta go cover up my head, 
When you whispered "I love you" 
Ooh! What you said...!
