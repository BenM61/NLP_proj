I'm in the deep end, cannonball jump
Thinking of your love and my heart beats like a drum
Not feeling guilty, 'cause the water's just right
Oh, it might be wrong, might be the time of your life

So jump on in with me
Let me set you free
I'll make you feel like you're dreaming

Try try try, to follow the rules
I break every one of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what I always do
Yeah I'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you

It's getting hot out under that summer sun
I'm not playing games, I'm just a girl having fun
I need to cool down, 'cause I know we're just friends
But one look from you baby then I'm falling back in

What's a girl to do?
I got it mad for you
You make me feel like I'm dreaming

Try try try, to follow the rules
I break every one of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what I always do
Yeah I'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you

I get a feeling, looking you in the eye
Know you wanna take a bite of my cherry pie
Get so excited, boy youâ€™re making me blush
Let's just take our time now, there ain't no need to rush, no

Why don't you make a move?
Got nothing else to lose
Just make me feel like I'm dreaming

Try try try, to follow the rules
I break every one of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what I always do
Yeah I'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you

I got that something I know you can't resist
I'm gonna make you feel it when I blow you that kiss
