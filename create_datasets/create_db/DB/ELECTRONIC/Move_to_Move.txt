Since you've been gone
I sit alone and watch the same old screen
I carry on
It doesn't matter what it is a sin
I just feel the need to hide away
As I loose myself in Saturday

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you would you move to me

I call you up
[Sorry, I'm not home right now, but you can leave a message]
But all I ever get is your machine
I know you're there
What make you think it could be just a dream
Do you feel the need to run away
Are you searching for a better day

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you would you move to me

How many times changing my mind
How many days wasted away [Wasted away, ooh]
How many words, what will it take? [What will it take, ooh]
How do we work out this mistake [Aaah]

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
Look at you trying to fill up your life with things to do
Look at us will we ever find a key in the history
Could it be if I move to you, would you move to me?

Look at me I keep turning the pages of history
