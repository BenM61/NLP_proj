Never wanted anyone as much as I want you
For you there's nothin' I won't do
I live to love you, baby, this is my confession
You're my beautiful obsession

Deep in my dreams at night I see your face
I'm in a fever when I wake
Your love consumes me, baby, this is my confession
You're my beautiful obsession

My world is spinning round and round
My heart is pounding, can't slow down
My body's aching to hold you tight
My mind is racing, can't wait to see you tonight
Can't wait to see you tonight

When we surrender to each other's kiss
And just the two of us exist
It's overwhelming, baby, this is my confession
You're my beautiful obsession

My world is spinning round and round
My heart is pounding, can't slow down
My body's aching to hold you tight
My mind is racing, can't wait to see you tonight
Can't wait to see you tonight

When we surrender to each other's kiss
And just the two of us exist
It's overwhelming, baby, this is my confession
You're my beautiful obsession

I live to love you, baby, this is my confession
Your love consumes me, baby, this is my confession
It's overwhelming, baby, this is my confession
You're my beautiful obsession

My beautiful obsession
My beautiful obsession
Beautiful obsession
