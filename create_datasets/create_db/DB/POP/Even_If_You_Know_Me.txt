I got this thing, though I don't want to
And I'd do anything, not to know you
But the fact that I sing cause I want to
Puts me in a ring of fire

Have you had a day, you had to be alone completely?
Been looking for a place where the streets and the sidewalks are empty?
If I must stay here
I wanna make it perfectly clear

To the ones who know my name
To the ones who care about fame
You should know that I'm the same
It's just a little bit different game

Even if you know me, don't say hello
Got to many thoughts in my head now
Just wanna sit and watch them grow
