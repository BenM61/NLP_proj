It takes nothin' but a hot slug to fill a villain 
Crook I'm about to make a killin' 
So weed to escalate the feelin'
I regulate the dealin' jealous niggas hate the feelin' 
I stack my safe appealin' jake on my trace I'm peelin'
And what a Mecca had whole fuckin' nation kneelin'
Embrace the wheel and hit a buck without crashin' f*ck
My drug passion got a nigga stashin' fast what
One love to hill billys run forever out to Chile'
Playin' the cuts nigga what can't stop the willy
Cops harassin' niggas blastin' while the day' passin'
Time for action cock the mac what a satisfaction
Shoot laughin' slug caught up in the chest gaspin'
Nigga blanked out chopped before he start rappin'

(Hook:)
(Khadafi:)
Microchips in the celly the game don't stop (don't stop)

Scared to death of the jail stories that's true
