Don't you walk away from me
Because I know that
This is where you want to be
I will listen to your stories
But do you think I will want to heal?

Oh, the way the way the way you talk about her
Oh, the way you look at me
Oh, the way the way you hear my whispers
Oh, the way the way the way

And all I want is what I cannot have
Why does it always seem to be this way?
Oh, I will take what you give
Take what you give to me
But it's not good enough, not good enough

Oh I want the way the way you talk about her
To be the way the way you talk about me
Oh, the way the way you give yourself free
Oh, the way the way the way, yeah

When will I ever learn?
The one thing that draws me near to you
For peace is not out of my reach
Just drawn inside until I open my eye

I know the way I always do this to myself
Only makes it harder
But I love the way the way you give yourself free
Oh, the way the way the way

Oh, I want the way the way you talk about her
To be the way the way the way you talk about me
Oh, the way the way you I give yourself free
Oh, the way, the way, the way
