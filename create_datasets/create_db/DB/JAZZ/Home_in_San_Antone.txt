Haven't got a worry, haven't got a care
Haven't got a thing to call my own
Though I'm out of money, I'm a millionaire
I still have my home in San Antone

When I greet my neighbors with a hi ya all
I'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
You can have your mansion, or your cottage small
I'll just take my home in San Antone

Traveled o'er the country, on my merry way
Been in crowds and felt I was alone
When I feel like braggin', I just up and say
I'm a native son of San Antone

There's a sweet somebody by the Alamo
Someday she's gonna be my very own
And we'll buy a highchair in a year or so
For our little Home In San Antone
