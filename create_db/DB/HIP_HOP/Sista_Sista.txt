Oooh, oh sista, sista sista
Sitting alone with her head full of empty thoughts
Playing with time that she just doesn't have
Dreaming that life is a stranger that brings you flowers
Praying the dream is as real as she feels it is

Dreams give you anything
Knowing that chance could bring you to the other side
Wanting her future there, feeling that love affaire
With the other side

[Chorus]
Sista sista, better run, better fly
Better weather on the other side
Sista sista, stand up tall, don't you ever fall
Sista sista, can't you hear my call?

Over the bridge turning right at the stop sign
Lives a woman who thinks as you do
Watching the world through the glair of a tv-screen
Wondering what's round the corner for you

I would give anything, hoping that chance could bring me 
To the other side
Soon as my thoughts are clear, one day I'll see you there
On the other side

[Chorus]

Ooh, calling, calling
Sista sista sista sista sista
My sista

[Chorus until fade]
