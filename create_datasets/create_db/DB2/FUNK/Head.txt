I remember when I met you, baby
You were on you're way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked, the things you said
And I was so nonchalant, I didn't want you to be misled
But I've gotta have you, baby, got to have you in my bed
And you said
"But I just a virgin and I'm on my way to be wed
But you're such a hunk, so full of spunk, I'll give you Head
Till you're burning up
Head
Till you get enough
Head
Till your love is red
Head
Love you til you're dead

You know you're good, girl
I think you like to go down
You wouldn't have stopped but I, I came on your wedding gown
And you said, "I must confess I want to get undressed and go to bed"
With that I jammed, you fool you married me instead

Now morning, noon, and night I give you head
Till you're burning up
Head
Till you get enough
Head
Till your love is red
Head
Love you til you're dead

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Head
Head
Head
Head

Head
Till you're burning up
Head
Till you get enough
Head
Till your love is red
Head
Love you til you're dead

Head
Head
Head (oh, baby, no)
Head
Head (oh)
Head
Head (you said I could)
Head
Head
