Well, it feels alright, and everything is really okay
Well, it feels alright, and everything is really okay
Well, and the love of my baby, whoo, make me feel this way
Well, she got great big legs, whoo, and the cutest little feet
Oh, she have big legs, man, and the cutest little feet
Well, she upsets everybody, every man she meet
Alright, man

Look out, baby
Oh
Well, she's the woman for me, sweet like heaven up above
Well, she's the woman for me, whoo, sweet like heaven up above
Well, I pray to the Lord, she's the only woman I love
