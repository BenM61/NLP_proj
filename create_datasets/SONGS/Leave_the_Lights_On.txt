We're in the dark, it's getting late
I really should go, he's waiting for me
We both know it's not what it seems
We both know what's between the sheets

I know that it's a secret
And that I gotta keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run away anymore
Leave the lights on, leave the lights on, leave the lights on

What would they say, what would they do?
Would it be trouble if they knew?
I'm trying hard to make you see
All that you are is all that I need

I know that it's a secret
And that I gotta keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run away anymore
Leave the lights on, leave the lights on

I know that it's a secret
And that I gotta keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run away anymore
Leave the lights on, leave the lights on, leave the lights on

Let it out, let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out, let it out

I know that it's a secret
And that I gotta keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run away anymore
Leave the lights on, leave the lights on

I know that it's a secret
And that I gotta keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run away anymore
Leave the lights on, leave the lights on

I know that it's a secret
And that I gotta keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run away anymore
Leave the lights on, leave the lights on, leave the lights on
