The Messiahs of the milk bar, Hhellraisers to the end
Had a drop to many in a toast to all their friends
Movie stars and writers are present a to z
Now these ain't common people, they're personalities

And they've all got a story, ohoh
Tattle talk from Tinseltown, ohoh ("yeah, yeah, look at that, yeah...")
Some of them survivors, ohohoh
Others gone to ground

There's Brendan be	 and Hunter T, what's a poet got to say
Hunter's looking for a story about the IRA
And Lenny isn't laughing, he nearly lost his life
Transexual from the Transvaal slipped in as his wife

It's a star studded scandal, ohoh
So raise your glass my friend, ohoh
The Messiahs of the milk bar, ohohoh
Hellraisers to the end

"The rose garden is already littered with my victims..."

And they've all got a story, ohoh
Tattle talk from Tinseltown, ohoh
Some of them survivors, ohohoh
Others gone to ground

Bukowski wants to talk, but he's had too much to drink
Threw up in the piano 'cause he thought it was the sink
Little Richard and Sal Dali singing out of key
Both hallucinated, the Sandoz was for free

Osbournes at a party, Colin Wilson's on the line
Saying, "listen Johnny Baby, that catchphrase is mine"
Flynn and Reed in conversation, reowned throughout the land
Used a calculator, workout who's the better man

Now Errols' got the looks and Ollis' got the strength
One is talking numbers and the others' talking length
Fatty's feeling frisky, orders more champagne
Women run out screaming, "oh no, not again!"

And they've all got a story, ohoh
Tattle talk from Tinseltown, ohoh
Some of them survivors, ohohoh
Others gone to ground

It's a star studded scandal, ohoh
So raise your glass my friend, ohoh
The Messiahs of the milk bar, ohohoh
Hellraisers to the end

The Messiahs of the milk bar, ohohoh
Hellraisers to the end
