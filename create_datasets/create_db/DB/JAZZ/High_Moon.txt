Walk throught the night we knew so well
Over horizons in the dark
Blinded I wonder if you're there
Under the cover of your feigned silhouette

You were hidden in the broad daylight
Overlooken like a satellite
Overshadowed by the blaze of the sun
Wondering
Have you ever seen this side of me?
Will you ever keep me company?
Will you ever see the shadow that falls over me?

Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skyline
And pale winter moonshine we'll drink to this

Call out your name there's no reply
Will we be greeted by a smile?
Turn round and leave before the dawn
Under horizons in the sun promising

You were hidden in the broad daylight
Overlooken like a satellite
Overshadowed by the blaze of the sun
Wondering
Have you ever seen this side of me?
Will you ever keep me company?
Will you ever see the shadow that falls over me?

Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skyline
And pale winter moonshine we'll drink to this
Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skyline
And pale winter moonshine we'll drink to this
Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skyline
And pale winter moonshine we'll drink to this
