He's got the eyes I can't forget
His lips I always long to kiss
His arms hold me oh-so tight

Here's (here's) a toast to our new love (a toast to our new love)
And I, I'll tell the world who my love is
I'll tell the world who my love is

Extra, extra
Read all about it
Extra, extra
Read all about my love

He says the things I long to hear
The inspiration of my dreams
Your season's all I want to see

No (no), holding back my love is wrong (holding back my love is wrong)
And now (and now) you'll know who my love is
I said, you'll know who my love is
