Walkin' blind across this silver room
Lookin' through a smoke menagerie
Lookin' at your face inside of me
In the darkness you're Tunisia
 
Nights are long entropic
I can't seem to cope
It's cold when I look in your eyes
 
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
 
Where the zebra lightning strikes the room
Foreign words are strutted through the gloom
Women swooping down like birds of prey
Never close but never far away
 
Night are long entropic
I can't seem to cope
It's cold when I look in your eyes
 
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
 
Night are long entropic
I can't seem to cope
It's cold when I look in your eyes
 
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
Pieces of ice
