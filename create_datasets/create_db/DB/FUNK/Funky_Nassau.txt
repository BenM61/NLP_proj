Nassau's gone funky
Nassau's gone soul
We've got a doggone beat now
We're gonna call our very own

Nassau rock and Nassau roll
Nassau's got a whole lot of soul
Feels right

Mini skirts, maxi skirts and Afro hair do
People doing their won
Don't care 'bout you and me

Nassau's gone honky
Nassau's got soul now oh, yeah
And we've got a doggone beat now
We're gonna take care of business too

Listen to the drummer play his feet
Listen to the bass man, go get the same groovy beat
Listen to the guitar, give that soul some too
Bring it on home, girl
Bring it on home to you

Play the funky now
Oh, yeah
Funky, funky Nassau
Listen, listen good

New York, you know, has got a whole lot of soul
Good God, London town is too doggone cold, yeah
Nassau's got sunshine and this you all know, yeah
But we've gone funky and we've got some soul too, all right

Funky Nassau, funky Nassau, funky Nassau
Funky Nassau, funky Nassau, funky Nassau
Funky Nassau, listen
Funky Nassau, funky Nassau, funky [unverified]
