We will remember this first night forever
After all the songs fade away
And the stage fades to gray
And we will remember this first night together
We'll recall the things that we said
All the foolish dreams in our head
On the night we met

I'm searching your eyes
Have I seen you somewhere
You're filling my thoughts with a strange intrigue
I rivet my glance to your every movement
I got a notion your love's in a whole different league
Tell me your name, what's your persuasion
Your first impression of this whole occasion

[Chorus:]
And this night shall be the first night
And first nights were made for love
I can taste the action in the air tonight
Hearts are poundin' as the sparks ignite
And this night shall be remembered
Long after the music's gone
And we'll reminisce on the things we said
And we'll fall in love again

In the air I can sense a strong attraction
Emotions run wild, are we on the verge?
We got a hot-line to satisfaction
I got the answer, if you got the urge
My motor is hot, I'm feeling elation
You came in the night with the right temptation

[Chorus]

We will remember this first night forever
We'll recall the things that we said
All the foolish dreams in our head

[Chorus]
