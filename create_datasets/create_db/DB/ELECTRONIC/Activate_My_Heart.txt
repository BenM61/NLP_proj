I've been played around
Love has let me down
Tore my feelings out

(Robot, robot lover)

I refuse to hurt
I refuse to cry
Not another time

(Robot, robot love)

I know I need to be rewired
I want to love again
Don't think my heart is just a hard drive
I'm just malfunctioning

Show me how to love
Show me where to touch
Teach me how to smile

(Robot, robot lover)

I can learn to kiss
I feel happiness
I can be the one

(Robot, robot lover)

I came equiped with all the same parts
I'm not just megabytes
So hold me close while I push restart
So I can love you right
