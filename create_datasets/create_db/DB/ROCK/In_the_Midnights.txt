I ran with the dead and chased
And chased my own shadow
Built walls, walls of belief
Reaction from the fall
We are ones of will
Desperate and dying
I was, I was along for the ride
The ride of the unaligned
I gave you every word to hold
On a deathless night
Sucking, bleeding, inside out
If I had gave in
I'd never live that down

I wanted to believe in everything I'm after
But I was drowning in the hell that I raised
And when there's nothing left to say
You wont need a reason
To kill these cancers that may come your way

Long cold wind hits face to remind your not done
Unloved failure serves as lessons learned
Faith regained from plagues
What will I find in me
I found, I found in the falls, in the falls
The falls of the unaligned

I gave you every word to hold
On a deathless night
Sucking, bleeding, inside out
If I had gave in
I'd never live that down

I wanted to believe in everything I'm after
But I was drowning in the hell that I raised
And when there's nothing left to say
You wont need a reason
To kill these cancers that may come your way

I ran with the dead and chased my own shadow
Built walls of belief
I saw the dead rise
I saw the dead rise
Reflection dying with me

I wanted to believe in everything I'm after
But I was drowning in the hell that I raised
And when there's nothing left to say
You wont need a reason
To kill these cancers that may come your way
