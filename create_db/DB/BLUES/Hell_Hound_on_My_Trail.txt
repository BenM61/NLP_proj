I got to keep movin', I've got to keep movin'
Blues fallin' down like hail, blues fallin' down like hail

Umm mmm mmm mmm
Blues fallin' down like hail, blues fallin' down like hail

And the days keeps on worryin' me,
There's a hellhound on my trail,
Hellhound on my trail, hellhound on my trail

If today was Christmas eve
If today was Christmas eve,
And tomorrow was Christmas day

If today was Christmas eve,
And tomorrow was Christmas day
(Aow, wouldn't we have a time, baby?)
All I would need my little sweet rider just,
To pass the time away, huh huh, to pass the time away

You sprinkled hot foot powder, mmm
Mmm, around my door, all around my door
You sprinkled hot foot powder, mmm,
All around your daddy's door, hmm hmm hmm
It keep me with ramblin' mind, rider
Every old place I go, every old place I go

I can tell, the wind is risin',
The leaves tremblin' on the tree,
Tremblin' on the tree
I can tell, the wind is risin',
Leaves tremblin' on the tree
Hmm hmm mmm mmm
All I need's my little sweet woman,
And to keep my company, hmmm hmm, hey hey
My company
