Matter of time
It's a matter of time

How can we be more like your brother
He was tall, thin and fine
The head of his class, yeah, yeah
And everybody liked him, hey

He'd spent his whole life chasing Heaven
But never seemed to find it
'Cause Heaven resides right here
On the inside, yeah

And people go from bad to good in just
The blink of an eye, oh yeah
If they can go from bad to good I guess
Then so can I, yeah

It's a matter of time, yeah
It's a matter of time, yeah

He'd take us downtown to the mission
Over on Mack and Third
To hear some of the strangest sounds
We'd ever heard, yeah

He'd say that bad things, they happen
But it's all divine please
Don't let this crazy cruel world
Make you blind

'Cause people go from bad to good in just
The blink of an eye, oh yeah
If they can go from bad to good I guess
Then so can I, yeah

It's a matter of time
It's a matter of time, yeah

It's a matter of time, yeah
It's a matter of time, yeah

It's a matter time before I
Find my way home
It's a matter of time before
I get it together

It's a matter of time
Boys and girls, it's a matter of time
A matter of time
It's a matter time, yeah
Sweet time, yeah
