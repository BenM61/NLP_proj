Oh, Columbus was the discoverer of America
And he sailed the sea in 1492
But the good Queen Isabella 
Found a more attractive fella
And Columbus wound up in the junkeroo
Oh, let that be a lesson to you
Everybody meets his Waterloo
He wasn't too big to end up behind the eight ball
And remember, buddy, there's still lots of room for you
