Songbook baby,
I like to thank Mr. Bryan Michael Cox, for helping me illustrate my feelings.
It's just gettin' to hot baby, it' gettin' to hot.
This is the last time, the last chapter now
I mean for real, this has gotta be the last time
It's gon' be the best though, I promise
Just one last time

Cause if she catch me witchu
She gon' kill us
These hotel rooms
Is looking to familiar
Your love is so, so serious
Girl you keep me comin' back that is
I be with her thinkin' of you
I be with you thinkin' of her
My boo
She just don't deserve this
Ain't nobody perfect
But I just can't take no more
Cause

I'm livin' two different lives
One girl in the day
You in the night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough
Of the way you put it down
You really got me trippin'
Hold up baby girl
Don't talk just listen

[Chorus]
Let's just make love
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl this is the last time
I'm all caught up and it's time
To put it down
You really got me trippin'
Hold up baby girl just listen
This is the last time

See the problem is
I'm too deep involved
To be playin' with yo emotions
You really got me open, ooh
I gotta figure it out
Can't let no pussy come before my baby
Not my baby no
Cause she's the only one to ease my mind
But girl you just so fine, ooh
Give it to me one last time
Baby let your hair down
Take it to the bed now
Spread them lovely legs now
One last round

I'm livin' two different lives
One girl in the day
You in the night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough
Of the way you put it down
You really got me trippin'
Hold up baby girl
Don't talk just listen

[Chorus]

Let me see you take off ya clothes
For the last time
Let's keep this thang on the low
For the last time
Tell me how you wanna get it (get it)
I know ya favorite is the kitchen (kitchen)
From the way I used to kiss it (wooh)
Girl I know you're gonna miss it
But there's only one condition
Baby please don't fuss
Don't be trippin', keep it pimpin'
Baby girl let's just make love
I'm livin' two different lives

I'm livin' two different lives
One girl in the day
You in the night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough
Of the way you put it down
You really got me trippin'
Hold up baby girl
Don't talk just listen
Let's just make love

[Chorus]

I'm livin' two different lives
One girl in the day
You in the night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough
Of the way you put it down
You got me trippin'
Hold up baby girl
Don't talk just listen
Let's just make love

[Chorus]
