From the seed of a lifetime to the harvest years
A girl knows the bitter and sweet taste of tears
The first love was a green love it was free and sincere
It ended in heartbreak and the young taste of tears
Then came the fool's love of life's wasted years
Time changes nothing but the taste of your tears
You pray for a true love and soon he appears
To share joy and sadness and the sweet taste of tears
And the sweet taste of tears
