There is someone walking behind you
Turn around, look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps
Turn around, look at me 

There is someone who really needs you
Here's my heart in my hand
Turn around, look at me

And understand this
That there is someone who'll stand beside you
Turn around baby and look at me
And there's someone who'll love and guide you
Turn around, look, look at me
Oh I've waited, but I'll wait forever
I'm gonna wait for you to come to me
Look at someone look at someone who really loves you
Turn around, look at me

Ooh there's someone who'll stand beside you
Turn around baby and look at me
And there's someone yo love and guide you
Turn around babe, turn around and look at me

I've waited, but I'll wait forever
I'm gonna wait until you to come back to me
Look at someone who really loves you
Turn around and look at me
Turn around, look at me
Look over your shoulder babe
