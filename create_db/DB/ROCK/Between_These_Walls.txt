Between these walls I used to live
Without receiving
So much that I had to give 
Between these walls
There were a lot of things that I could
Have done differently
But it ain't about the way I live
It's the hard that comes

Comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me
In that what I'm here for?
You said you'd be here for me
No matter what

How come you feel so cold everytime 
You step into this room
Why does it feel so cold?
It's in your mind

In the spring of '75
That's when god made a mistake
He took me here to the wrong side
I bet you did the best you could
But never good enough
Cause it's the hard that comes

Comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me
In that what I'm here for?
You said you would die for me
Remember

How come you feel so cold everytime 
You step into this room
Why does it feel so cold?
I'm freezing

Stuck here with this broken heart
All I can do
Is hoping for a full recovering
Why did you have me in the first place?
Well...comfort, feed, embrace, love and protect me yeah
Comfort, feed, embrace, baby just respect me

How come you feel so cold everytime (just respect me, just respect me)
Comfort, feed, embrace, baby love me, baby love me, love me yeah
Do you love me yeah? D'you love me yeah?
