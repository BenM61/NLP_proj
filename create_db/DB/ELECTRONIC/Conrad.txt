I can feel it coming, we can never go back
We can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel

I can feel it coming over the hillside
It's a valley fire and it's coming to burn us down
Like a rushing comet bound for the planet
And we're dinosaurs living in denial

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
We can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel

As the ice is melting, merging with ocean
All our eyes are open and we're looking out to sea
And I'm hibernating, shut down and waiting
For another summer living in denial

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel it, feel it
We can never go back
I can feel

I can feel it coming, coming back to haunt me
It's a glass that's empty and we're trying to fill it up
We're lost civilians with the weight of millions
We're pawns in war living in denial

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
Never go back, we can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel

We can never, we can never go 
We can never, we can never go back
We can never, we can never go back

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel it
