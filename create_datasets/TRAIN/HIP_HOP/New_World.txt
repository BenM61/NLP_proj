I sat in my room
So dismal and blue
Feeling that I can
Communicate with you

So I picked up my thoughts
Picked up paper and pen
I know there are causes to defend

Now everybody stand up
Let's spread these words
Around the neighborhood
Return to the source, all isn't lost

Now the world is changing
Beyond recognition
And it's not too late
Don't seal your fate
With radiation, with pollution
And all that confusion

It's not too late
For making a new world
It's not too late
For making a better world
It's not too late
Ooh ou ooh
