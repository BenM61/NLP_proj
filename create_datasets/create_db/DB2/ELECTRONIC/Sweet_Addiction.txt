I don't wanna be high then no more 
I don't wanna be running no more 
Just wanna be cruising 
Oh, by the shore 
Just wanna be holding hands 
And more 
And I just wanna be free to ignore 
The hate you keep in store 

Sweet addiction to you 
Repetion feels new 

You're upside down 
Gotta throw the hatred 
Yeah, yeah 
Have faith in your healing right 
Showing you all out of sight 
Cause I'm upside down 

Sweet addiction to you 

Repetition feels new 

I don't wanna be running no more 
I just wanna be cruisin' 
Oh, by the shore 
And I just wanna be free to ignore 
The hate you keep in store. 

Sweet addiction to you 
Repetion feels new 

You're upside down 
We gotta be together 
I want you now 
Have faith in your healing right 
Showing you all out of sight 
Cause I'm upside down
