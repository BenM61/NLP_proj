Love is such a lonely sword
Love is such a lonely sword
You can't go where roses grow
If you love me - let me know
Come love me - I swear you - I never will go
Silence, it's a strong reply
It's no way to say goodbye
Come love me - I swear you - I never will go
Love is so invisible - comprehend impossible
I love you - I swear you - I never will go
I will hide my tears
Love is such a lonely sword
I will share your fears
Love is such a lonely sword
Oh, Catherine wheel
My Catherine wheel
Oh, love is like a mystery
Oh, Catherine wheel
My Catherine wheel
Come home
Love is such a lonely sword
Love is such a lonely sword
I don't know I can explain - what kind of fool I am ?
Come love me - I swear you - I never will go
Maybe you can make my day
Seven lonely nights I pray
Come love me - I swear you - I never will go
Love is so invisible - comprehend impossible
I love you - I swear you - I never will go
