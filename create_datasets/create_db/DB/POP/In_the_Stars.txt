Got a horseshoe in my pocket
And my hands are full of gold
My heart's racing like a rocket,
Wind it up and watch it go

We'll be ruling in the sunlight
Like we're pharaohs on the throne
We'll be dancing in the moonlight,
Dancing all the way back home

They're coming home at last
They're coming home again
They're coming home at last
They're coming home again
They're coming home at last
They're coming home again
They're coming home again

Skies open, where we going
It's in the stars, it's who we are
Don't you worry about the morning
It's in the stars, it's who we are
We're blowing up, blowing up the door
Blowing up, blowing up, we are
Blowing up, blowing up the door, yeah
Skies open, where we going
It's in the stars, it's who we are

Got a horseshoe in my pocket
