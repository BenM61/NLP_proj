Hey DJ!

When we were together, I held you down
I gave you all of me, but look at us now
Thinking of all your excuses, but they don't add up
Now it's so easy to see you don't deserve my love

You pushed me far you brought me to this
You had my heart but then you blew it
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

Trust and believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy I don't know, who do you think that you are?

You look so foolish
With my best friend
And she ain't no better than you, she's a three,
I'm a ten
So why are you calling my phone
You ain't got nothing I want
Thought we were really in love
But that was all up front

You pushed me far you brought me to it
You had my heart but then you blew it, oh
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy who do you think that you are

Trust and believe me, you're gonna need me
Trust and believe me, she'll never be me
And I'm so over you, go get lost
Boy I don't know, who do you think you are?

How did you try to clean it up
Boy please just stop it now (Stop it now)
Don't make a sound

'Cause you pushed me far
You brought me to this
You had my heart but then you blew it, ohh
And I'm so over you, so get lost (Go get lost)
Boy who do, who do you think you are?

Believe me, you're gonna need me (You're gonna need me)
Trust and believe me,(Believe me) She'll never be me
And I'm so over you (Over you)
Go get lost (Go get lost)
Boy I, don't know, who you think you are?

I'm so over you, go get lost
Who do you think that you are?
