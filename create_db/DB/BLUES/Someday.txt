I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody else
You'll expect me to be true and to keep on loving you
Though I'm feeling blue
You'd think I can't forget you.

Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new
And though you don't want me now
I'll get along somehow
And then I won't, won't want you.
