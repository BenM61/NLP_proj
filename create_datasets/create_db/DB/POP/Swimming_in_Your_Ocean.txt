When I'm sampling from your bosom
Sometimes I suffer from distractions like
Why does God cause things like tornadoes and train wrecks?

When I'm swimming in
When I'm swimming in your ocean
Floating aloft on creams
And scented lotions
I can get pretty side-tracked
I hope you'll understand

When I kneel before your bounty
Sometimes I wonder if there could be really
UFOs that come from other planets

And when you let me taste your fingers
I take them like fruit and as I linger I
Wonder if my seed will find purchase in your soil
