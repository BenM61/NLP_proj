Why Lucy, your eyes are filled with tears?
My heart is filled with gladness
Oh look, the orchestra's getting ready
Dance with me, George

Check the scene outside of Medellin
Make a fuss in Caracas
Big cigars in dark Havana bars
Mambo slow Guantanamo

Was so glad escape in Trinidad
Upside down in Kingston town
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota

Space cake break at the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Asked for a dance in a dive in Port-au-Prince
Went too far in Bogota

A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
A little weak, a little pale today

Rip 'em up

Space cake break on the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota

A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday

A little weak, a little pale today
