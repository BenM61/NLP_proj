Movin On-Movin On-Movin On
I'm Movin On-Movin On-Movin On

(DJ you-NEEK)
I escape from outta state I gotta date with big scrilla
the top billa, lampin rockin mansion and a villa
punany killa o' mighty dealer with mean stacks and green backs
lampin with a team of phat cats
but them dirty rats sceemin tryin to snatch up the capital
mad cause they know I'm stackin doe international
it's untouchable so they besta be jetti
cause a nigga don't play when your messin with my fetti
I'm ready, to do this my way, hit the highway
crusin with control, let the AC blow
it's all about the doe and nothin less for sho
and when my pockets get low I'm on a quest for mo
cause yo, life ain't the same without the ends
cause money buys friends and a hole lot of skins 

Chorus:
(NYT OWL)
Cause everybody's lookin for somethin
Some of them want to use you, (I'm movin on)
Some of them want to be used by you, (movin on)
Some of them want to abuse you, (I'm movin on)
Some of them want to be a-bused, (Oh......)

(DJ you-NEEK)
Hoes be layin on their backs just to stack a phat purse
but what's worse than your fella curse by the versa tella
a soul sella, hangin out for the clout, 
probably blow my brains out and hopes them chains fall out
I wouldn't doubt it, bye
niggas be actin shady 
so I pack a 380, yo black, don't try to play me,
its crazy, to see your homie flip on some bogus shit
only stick around cause this shorties on my dick,
so take a lick sis your on your knees already
they thinkin petty, hypnotized by the fetti,
with your eyes steady, locked on what I got
tellin the block that I changed cause I came up on a ????
they must forgot when I rose sellin smoke
tryin to make an end we wasn't hangin tight then

Chorus
(DJ you-NEEK)
Money bless, but money ain't the key to success
the only thing that changed was my name and address
now I dress to impress, the ladies I caress
f*ck the stress I got to live life at it's best
but nevertheless, snakes want to put me to the test
cause they depress, broken smokin to much cess
so they manifest, jealousy and envy
and that will be the cause of another felony
see friends turn to foes, and foes is enemies,
and enemies is fleas so they got the tendencies
to try to seize, all your geez and assets
but I smash threats like a blast for the tec
so show respect, and get respect in return
it ain't hard to earn, but some niggas will never learn

Chorus
Everybodies lookin for somethin, said ya gonna be used, they want to be 
abused, I just want to keep on movin, movin, movin, movin, Oh, movin on, 
Oh..., I'm movin on, movin on, movin on, I said movin, I'm movin on, 
movin, movin, movin on, movin on, I'm movin on, Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohoh Yeah, 
I'm movin on, movin on, I just got to keep on movin, I just got to keep 
on movin........
