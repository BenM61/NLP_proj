I've got the sun and the seasons
Giving days only wanting to please
But are you right with the reasons?
Spilling words that mean nothing to me

I'm not wanting more
Promises and beliefs
I'm just waiting for
Someone to hear this heartbeat

I've got a soul and devotion
I'm giving love out of Valentine
But I see life and its motion
You're dragging out on every subject despised

I'm not wanting more
Promises and beliefs
I'm just waiting for
Someone to hear this heartbeat

I'm not running, I'm not chasing
I'm just looking for that old sensation
I'm not crawling, I'm not craving
I'm just living for some new vibration

I'm not wanting more
Promises and beliefs
I'm just waiting for
Someone to hear this heartbeat

I'm not running, I'm not chasing
I'm just looking for that old sensation
I'm not crawling, I'm not craving
I'm just living for some new vibration

I'm not running and I'm not chasing
I'm just looking for old sensation
I'm not crawling and I'm not craving
I'm just living for new vibration
