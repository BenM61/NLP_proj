Hey Michel how's life are you ok
I wonder if you ever think of me
It's been nine years since that kiss
I can't help but reminiss
Hey Michel do you remember

We walked the street 
To the beat 
Hand in hand you and me
Smiling faces so in love 
Hoping they all could see
That we belonged together
You and me against the world
But we found out the hard way
That it wasn't meant to be
Now it's you and her I see

You were my first and worst love
And so it only could go wrong
But that ain't that just the way you learn
Hey Michel I just wanted to let you know
That someone else has stole my heart
And now another girl has caught your eye
That does not mean I don't think of you
I'm just hoping that she'll treat you right

Do you remember how we walked the street 
To the beat 
Hand in hand you and me
Smiling faces so in love 
Hoping they all could see
That we belong together
You and me against the world
But we found out the hard way
That it wasn't meant to be
Now it's you and her I see
It's just a silly dream

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Na na na na na na na

Hey Michel
Do you remember
