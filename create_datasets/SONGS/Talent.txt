I met this real cool dude today
Looking like Jack Palance
He said I wanna get through to you
And help you find your talent

He said that if I had a certain style
Then stuff would start to happen
He said that soon he was going away
Cause he's a major talent

Talent, fighting on the East Side
Talent, taking on the West Side
Talent, fucking up the North Side
He's a major talent

Talent, fighting on the East Side
Talent, taking on the West Side
Talent, fucking up the North Side
He's a major talent
(I don't know)

I said that he was getting through to me
And I would take his challenge
And maybe soon I'd be going away
Cause I had certain talents

Talent, fighting on the East Side
Talent, taking on the West Side
Talent, fucking up the North Side
I'm a major talent

Talent, fighting on the East Side
Talent, taking on the West Side
Talent, fucking up the North Side

I met this dude today
Down in the sewers of Paris
Was hiding from the sun
What a waste of talent
