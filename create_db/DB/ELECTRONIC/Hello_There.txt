Hey Mitch
They're pretty simple really, it was one of the first tunes I ever wrote

I watched you dreaming as the night it slipped away
I got the feeling that you're planning not to stay
But you're the only one, the only one I love
There's no decieving, you were dancing from above

I came and saw you on the corner of delight, oh yeah
The way you flicked your hair upon the pale moonlight
You came and spoke to me and put me to the test
Oh, don't you realize it was better than the rest?
Give me a reason not to feel this way was true
I would have waited here forever to see you

Give me a reason to stop playing in the rain, oh yeah
I watched you breathing and I felt your every pain
I saw your face as it got swallowed by the light
And you're my only one, my only one delight
And when you sleep-talk, yeah, I write the things you say
And I interpret that you wanted me to say

Give me a reason not to play around your heart
You got to feel it got to feel it from the start
You got to feel it got to feel it from the start
You got to feel it got to feel it from the heart

I watch my dreams tumble down, they tumble down
I have no feeling, have no memory now
Stop playing with my heart
Stop playing with my heart
Stop playing with my heart
