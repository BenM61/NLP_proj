I sat at home and watched 
The world go by on a screen 
I never questioned 
Never doubted that I could dream
I was a loner the phone would never ring
At least not for me
And now I look back and I can see that when we first met
You've changed my life
I've no regrets

So many times I've been left
Saying why didn't I make a move
I could see it in our eyes
Girl its not a lie
But your look just soothes
This time I'm not gonna run away
To save my foolish pride
No false pretences no walls
No fences I'm not gonna hide

Now you know that I'm madly in love
Hey girl I'm still so madly
Does it show that I'm madly in love
Listen all that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you

There's a six foot wall that stood between us
That I never thought I could climb
But the way you came on to me it nearly blew me
Blew the wall from my mind
This time there's a brand of new feeling
That I never ever felt before
Girl you're just a walking magnet
And this time its me that you've drawn

Now you know that I'm madly in love
Hey girl I'm still so madly
Does it show that I'm madly in love
Listen all that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you

I know you don't get what you want
If you don't put up a fight
And I know that the game that I've played
I've thrown the right dice

This time there's a brand of new feeling
That I never ever felt before
Girl you're just a walking magnet
And this time its me that you've drawn

Now you know that I'm madly in love
Hey girl I'm still so madly
Does it show that I'm madly in love
Listen all that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you

So now you know how I feel
Does it change the way you think of me
So don't you let it be
You are all I need and you're all I see
You've changed my life
I've no regrets

This time there's a brand of new feeling
That I never ever felt before
Girl you're just a walking magnet
And this time its me that you've drawn

Now you know that I'm madly in love
Hey girl I'm still so madly
Does it show that I'm madly in love
Listen all that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you
