Her eyes are sweet and dark as coal
But they've long since given up on finding someone to trust
She has a silver plated soul
Beneath the damage and the dust

They say, she's never known a single hour of stillness
And they say, she's as dangerous as a child that can inspire lust
And you know that people's minds are so full of illness
They never look beneath the damage and the dust

I want to lift her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)
I got to pick her up
I want to raise her up from the dust
I got to lift her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)
(C'mon here, child)

Well she's walking downtown on a foggy summer evening
Everybody watches with a blend of wonder and disgust
(Well I)
I want so bad to stop her grieving
To raise her from beneath the damage and the dust

I want to lift her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)
I got to pick her up
I want to raise her up from the dust
I got to pick her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)
(Oh yeah, pick it up)

To think that she was once some mother's baby
(And she got)
Left out in the rain like some dream that's gone to rust
Well they say that loneliness can drive you crazy
And bury you beneath the damage and the dust

I got to pick her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)
I want to lift her up
I got to raise her up from the dust
I got to pick her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)
(Oh, pick it up)

I got to lift her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)
I want to pick her up
I want to raise her up from the dust
I got to pick her up
(Beneath the damage and the dust)

And you've got to help me
(Damage and the dust)
(Damage and the dust)
(Damage and the dust)
