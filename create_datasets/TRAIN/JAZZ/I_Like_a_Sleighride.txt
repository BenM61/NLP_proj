Dashing through the snow 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
Through the fields we go 
Laughing all the way. 
Bells on bob-tail ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way, 
Oh what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh, O 
Jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way, 
Oh what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. 
A day or two ago 
I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
Was seated by my side; 
The horse was lean and lank 
Misfortune seemed his lot, 
We ran into a drifted bank 
And there we got upsot. 
A day or two ago 
The story I must tell 
I went out on the snow 
And on my back I fell; 
A gent was riding by 
In a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed at me as 
I there sprawling laid 
But quickly drove away. 
Now the ground is white, 
Go it while you're young, 
Take the girls along 
And sing this sleighing song. 
Just bet a bob-tailed bay, 
Two-forty as his speed, 
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! 
You'll take the lead.
