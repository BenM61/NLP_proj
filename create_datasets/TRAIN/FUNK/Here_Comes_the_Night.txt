Here comes the night
See the stars in the sky
Shining up above, night of love
Darling, just you and I

And here comes the night
How I thrill to your kiss
Music fills the air everywhere
Night of magic and bliss

Think of the moments
The hours and hours
That we were apart
Moments and hours that kept
Bringing showers of
Tears to my heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh
And here comes the night
Like the others before
But tonight's divine
You are mine once more

Think of the moments
The hours and hours
That we were apart
Moments and hours that kept
Bringing showers of
Tears to my heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh
And here comes the night
Like the others before
But tonight's divine
You are mine once more
Here
(Comes the night)
