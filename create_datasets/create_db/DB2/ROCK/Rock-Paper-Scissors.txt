Everything you want, everything you do
Everything and anything is up to you
Everything all-day starts with a riddle
You can go left or right, down the middle

So take a little trip down road and see
What you gonna find, who you want to be
What you mind after pick between the three

Rock, paper, scissors
Which one is it? It's your decision
And no matter what you chose
You gonna live it
Rock, paper, scissors

Everybody want's to be happy, so
Take a look around, find a hang to hold
If you really want take a change like the weather
And no matter what you do it'll keep getting better

Everything you want that is who you are
You can be the sun and the moon and the stars
Or the bass or the drums or the lead guitar

Rock, paper, scissors
Which one is it? It's your decision
And no matter what you chose
You gonna live it
Rock, paper, scissors

Rock, paper, scissors
Which one is it? It's your decision
And no matter what you chose
You gonna live it
Rock, paper, scissors
