Let's go... 

I've been lovin' you for here long knowin' I was never clear 
But I have no fear today 'cause I'm gonna say 
What I gotta say, I don't want to play the role 
Bustin' through the door, I'm gonna take you're heart fo' sure, oh 

Put you're hands up in the air, it's a stick up 
I'm gon' take you're heart from here, now let's fix up 
Put you're hands in the air, in the air, in the air 

I'm gonna play my cards from here 
And take this gamble sure
My words are gonna fumble, but this beat is mighty humble 
Ain't goin' nowhere, sure I'm scared but my life's a dare 
And baby you just got so much flare, we'll be the perfect pair 
I'm gonna share my mind with you, you've been blinded 
My life's been blue, I'm takin' you, I'm takin' you 

Put you're hands up in the air, it's a stick up 
I'm gon' take you're heart from here, now let's fix up 
Put you're hands in the air, in the air, in the air

Put you're hands up in the air, it's a stick up 
I'm gon' take you're heart from here, now let's fix up 
Put you're hands in the air, in the air, in the air
In the air, in the air, in the air

When I first met you, I wanted to wet you 
Not a gun but a different content, sexual 
You tried to run, I still get you 
Steel metal not needed, a whole 'nother meaning 
Don't want you're gold, want you're soul 
Control you're heartbeatin', cause when I start squeezin' that muscle 
That's the trigger, than I got you nigga, in ya 
Chopper spinners, got you're bodyguards wit cha 
Diamond dog tag chain swingin', I had them thangs ringin' 

This is a robbery, no one's gettin' free 
Till that man, he comes with me 

Put you're hands up in the air, it's a stick up 
I'm gon' take you're heart from here, now let's fix up 
Put you're hands in the air, in the air, in the air
