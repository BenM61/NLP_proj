Can't let the sun go down on me, oh no more
Can't let myself be washed out at sea, I gotta stay ashore
The world is full of ups and downs, you know what I mean
I got to make my mark in life, I'am through with dreams

Now I got to push ahead, 'cause the more I put out
The more it comes back
I'll do better things instead of hanging out in the streets
'Cause when the lights go down I'll see, I'm free

Got to meet my new horizon
Ooh, got to meet my new horizon
I got to live my life, I got to live my life

Now I got to push ahead
Undo better things instead
I'll see, I'm free

Got to meet my new horizon
Got to meet my new horizon
I got to live my life, I got to live my life, ooh

Got to meet my new horizon
Got to meet my new horizon
The world is full of ups and downs, yeah
I got to live my life, I'm through, I am through with dreams
Got to meet my new horizon
