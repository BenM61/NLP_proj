Things you told to me 
They play back in my head 
You showed me myself 
In the words you said 
And I could not believe you 
Your qualities unique 
And I was enchanted by the way 
You spoke to the strangers on the street 
In many ways you save me 
And keep my head above water 
You know your own mind so well 
And won't surrender any quarter 
Well if this is a dream 
I'll keep my eyes wide shut forever 
If this is a dream 
I hope I'm in a coma 
'Cause 

You kill me 
And then you bring me back to life 
You cut me 
With the sweetest knife 
You kill me 
And then you tell me why 
My baby 
The girl with the triple tone eyes 

I know you've been through it 
And that I do respect 
But if you can't let it go 
How can we connect 
I realize this is strange love 
But we should let it flow 
And you don't need to say anything 
'Cause I already know 
Don't it feel right dear 
Now we're making eye contact 
And yes it feels right here 
I don't ever wanna go back 
Well if this is a dream 
I'll keep my eyes wide shut forever 
If this is a dream 
I hope I'm in a coma 
'Cause 

You kill me 
And then you bring me back to life 
You cut me 
With the sweetest knife 
You kill me 
And then you tell me why 
My baby 
The girl with the triple tone eyes 

Well if this is a dream 
I'll keep my eyes wide shut forever 
If this is a dream 
I hope I'm in a coma 
'Cause 

You kill me 
And then you bring me back to life 
You cut me 
With the sweetest knife 
You kill me 
And then you tell me why 
My baby 
The girl with the triple tone eyes
