This world is big (this world is big) and so awake (and so awake)
I stayed up late (I stayed up late) to hear your voice
This light is here (this light is here) to keep you warm (to keep you warm)
This song is here (this song is here) to keep you strong

I made a list of things to say
But all I really want to say (but all I want)
All I really want to say is (that's all I want)
Hold her (I wrote a list of things to say)
And keep him strong (to say)
While I'm away from here (that's all I want)
Hold her and keep her strong (this world is big and so awake)
While I'm away from here (to hear your voice)
Hold her and keep him strong (this light is here to keep you warm)
While I'm away from here (this song is here to keep you strong)

I've seen the world
And so, awake and stay up late to hear me sing (keep him strong)
Just hold her
I've seen the world
And so, awake and stay up late to hear me sing (keep him strong)
Just hold him
Hold her and keep her strong (I've seen the world and stayed up late)
While I'm away from here (to hear you sing)
And hold him (I've seen the world and so awake)
And keep him strong (so stay up late)
While I'm away from here
