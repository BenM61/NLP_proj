Here I am before you naked in your eyes
Hoping with each kiss you will never see through my disguise
I have been made to believe that no one could love me for me
The good and the bad first to the last
No matter the cost, no matter the past

Your eyes only see what they wanna see
Your heart makes the truth what you want to believe
Passion turns pain into ecstasy
You can't walk away from love

Loving you more than I do myself
Revealing the things I would never tell
Daring to risk even life itself
You can't walk away from love

There will be no other lips against my skin
No need to regret, how can pleasure ever be a sin?
I tried to make you believe you meant almost nothing to me
Through all the lies chasing a dream
Finding at last the woman in me

Your eyes only see what they wanna see
Your heart makes the truth what you want to believe
Passion turns pain into ecstasy
You can't walk away from love

Loving you more than I do myself
Revealing the things I would never tell
Daring to risk even life itself
You can't walk away from love

Your eyes only see what they wanna see
Your heart makes the truth what you want to believe
Passion turns pain into ecstasy
You can't walk away from love

Loving you more than I do myself
Revealing the things I would never tell
Daring to risk even life itself
You can't walk away from love

Your eyes only see what they wanna see
You want to believe
Can't walk away from love
