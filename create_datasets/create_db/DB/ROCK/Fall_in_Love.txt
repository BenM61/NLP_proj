'Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, I may be
'Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, I

Love, it cut a hole into your eyes
You couldn't see you were the car I crashed
Now you're burning alive

Fall in me

'Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, I may be

The lines on the face ate away my smile
Could it be that I fell apart

'Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, I may be

Fall in me
I'll let you breathe
'Cause you were fallin, I'm sorry, I may be

Fall in me
