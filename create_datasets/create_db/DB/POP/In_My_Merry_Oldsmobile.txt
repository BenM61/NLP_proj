Come away with me, Lucille,
In my merry Oldsmobile.
Down the road of life we fly,
Automo-bubbling, you and I.

To the church we'll swiftly steal,
Then our wedding bells will peal,
You can go as far as you like with me
In my merry Oldsmobile.

Come away with me, Lucille,
In my merry Oldsmobile.
Down the road of life we fly,
Automo-bub-bub-bubbling, you and I.

To the church we'll swiftly steal,
Then our wedding bells are gonna peal,
You can go as far as you like with me
In my merry Oldsmobile.  Sh!
