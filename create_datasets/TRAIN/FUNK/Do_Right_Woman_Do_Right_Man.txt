Take her to heart
And she'll love you forever
And nobody can make her do wrong
But take her for granted, leaving your love unshown
Makes will power weak and temptation strong
A woman's only human
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood, just like her man
And if you want a do right all day woman
You've gotta be a do right all night man
