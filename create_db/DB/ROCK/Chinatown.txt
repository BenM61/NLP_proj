Well the cops are taking over
While everyone's in yoga
'Cause happiness is still a warm gun
What's it to be free man?
What's a European?
Me I just believe in the sun

Take me down
Through the streets of Chinatown
Show me that you know some places
God told me
Live a life of luxury
All our lives we've both been waiting

Telephonic doses
Eliminate neurosis
And some say it's the cause of it all
Concentrate on winning
Forgets about beginning
Forget about the middle and end

Take me down
Through the streets of Chinatown
Show me that you know some places
God told me
Live a life of luxury
All our lives we've both been waiting

Take me down
Through the streets of Chinatown
Show me that you know some places
God told me
Live a life of luxury
All our lives we've both been waiting
