So, there we were at a table for two
With a glass of bubbly and my brand new shoes
Found the restaurant on the internet
This Mexican place, but they haven't finished it yet

He took my hand and said,
"I love your eyes, your lips, your hands, your toes"
He seem intoxicated
As he started to chat a little X rated
I put my fingers to his lips and said

Hush boy (if you want me for your girlfriend)
Just take it slowly boy, there's no need to rush it
Hush boy (if you want me for your girlfriend)
Come on boy, don't play it tough

So the food was good, I had a chicken fajita
But he finished my plate and had four margaritas
As we gazed into each other's eyes
His ex walked in with her brand new guy

My man he tried to jump on me
To kiss my arms, my legs, my hips, my lips
He knocked the drinks everywhere
As he started to make an apology, I covered his mouth with my hand and said

Hush boy (if you want me for your girlfriend)
Just take it slowly boy, there's no need to rush it
Hush boy (if you want me for your girlfriend)
Come on boy, don't blow your chance

(We all need a little romance)

Hush boy
Just for the first date
Hush boy
You shouldn't worry cause I like you we should have some fun

Seamlessly
Those butterfly kisses all over me
Now dancing eyelashes
Sometimes dreams come true

I know talk to much most of the time
Especially when I'm in the bed or under one
You make me just want to push your buttons in too much, girl
When you blush
Hush, girl
You M-O-V-E me
L-O-V-E
That's all that's comin' from me
You're so sexy when I'm treading on dangerous ground.
You bite your lips I just get hard when I see you frown.
I want you to be my one and only

Hush boy (if you want me for your girlfriend)
Just take it slowly boy, there's no need to rush it
Hush boy (if you want me for your girlfriend)

You know, I don't really want to f*ck this up, ?
Come on, give me a little of your time, before you make up your mind

You shouldn't worry cause I like you we should have some fun
