Is this for real 
This can't be real
Are you for real
I must be dreaming
Is this for real
This can't be real
Woah

[Chorus
Ya so bad to di bone
Can't leave you alone
It's like yo inside my dreams
A perfect fantasy
A perfect fantast

'Cause every kiss, every touch
Boy you got me blushing
You blew mind roll in lika a russian
I'm on a double baby inna rush
Boy you put your spell on me
'Cause every minute, every day
Boy you got me senseless
I put my guard down playin' my defenses
I'm inna loop boy lost in you love
Boy you know me need it so much

[Chorus]

A now fling it up, back it up
I make it tear it up
De way you put it on me
I gotta give it up
You know what I'm in luck
I wanna love you up
I wanna let you know 
I never let you go
Daddy you have the ticket and you get the price
Bad to di bone ah you know me no like
Adamana check it but a dem get it klein
That's why me love you long time

[Chorus]

'Cause every kiss, every touch
Boy you got me blushing
You blew mind roll in lika a russian
I'm on a double baby inna rush
Boy you put your spell on me
'Cause every minute, every day
Boy you got me senseless
I put my guard down playin' my defenses
I'm inna loop boy lost in you love
Boy you know me need it so much

(Chorus)

A now fling it up, back it up
I make it tear it up
De way you put it on me
I gotta give it up
You know what I'm in luck
I wanna love you up
I wanna let you know 
I never let you go
Daddy you have the ticket and you get the price
Bad to di bone ah you know me no like
Adamana check it but a dem get it klein
That's why me love you long time

[Chorus]
