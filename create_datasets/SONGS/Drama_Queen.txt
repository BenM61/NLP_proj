Load up the drugs, we'll let the demons come in
Bring all the kids, they won't know where to begin
Shoot 'em a line, they'll lock you up in the pen
If you're rating my life, give it ten

But it remains to be seen
If you've got what it takes to be queen
Just get your ass through my door
And don't ask for the chance

Drama queen, are you clean?

Get in your head, invite me down for a dream
Slip on a tie and take it out on the scene
Tell all your friends to meet the girl that I choose
If they cancel your face, cut ?em loose

But it remains to be seen
If you've got what it takes to be queen
Just get your ass through my door
And don't ask for the chance to give more

You turn up, you tune in, strike a pose, start again
You turn up, you tune in, strike a pose, start again
You turn up, you tune in, strike a pose, start again
You turn up, you tune in, check your pulse

But it remains to be seen
If you've got what it takes to be queen
Just get your ass through my door
And don't ask for the chance to give more

Drama queen, are you clean?
Drama queen, where you been?

Drama queen, drama queen
Drama queen, drama queen
Are you clean? Are you clean?
Are you clean? Are you clean?
