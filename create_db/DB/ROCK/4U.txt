This shit right here is for you
All your faces I can see
You all think it's about me
I'm about to break, this is my fate
Am I still damned to a life,
Of misery and hate?

You will never know
What I'd do for you
What you are
Help me through
I'd do it for you
I could have, never lived
If it wasn't, for you
