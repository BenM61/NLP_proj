Rain in the sky
A tear in my eye
Static on the radio
The long night's begun
With dinner for one
You said you'd never go

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak
Blessed are all the left-behind
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again

Cold coffee cup
Sun coming up
Sleep is a distant dream
Something you said
Rolls round in my head
Something that you didn't mean

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak
Blessed are all the left-behind
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again
Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak
