On earth there are men who take
Lives of those who care enough to help
What gives you the right
To put man's life in your hands
You're a cold-blooded killer
You must be insane

Revolting against the human race
Don't give a damn about anyone
What gives you the right
To put man's life in your hands
You're a cold-blooded killer
You must be insane

Assassin, were you sent from hell
To destroy one more chance for peace
What gives you the right
To put man's life in your hands
You're a cold-blooded killer
You must be insane
Stupid man of hate
