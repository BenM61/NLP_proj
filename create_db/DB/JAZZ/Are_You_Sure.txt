Are you sure there's nothing you can do
To help someone worse off than you?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?

Are you sure it'll be a waste of time
To stop and let your love light shine?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?

Are you sure that it will be in vain
To show some love for your fellow man?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?

Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Think about it and be sure
Are you sure?

Are you sure that it's not your place
To help someone whose lost their way?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?

Are you sure it's not your concern
When you see a neighbor's home is burned?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?

Are you sure that I will still be down
When you've realized that you've been blind
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?

Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Think about it and be sure
Please, please, please be sure

Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
