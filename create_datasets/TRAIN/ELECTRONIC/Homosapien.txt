I'm the shy boy, you're the coy boy
And you know I'm a Homosapien too
I'm the cruiser, you're the loser
Just me and you sir, I'm a Homosapien too

Homosuperior in my interior
But from the skin out, I'm a Homosapien too

And I'm a Homosapien like you
And I'm a Homosapien too

And I think of your eyes in the dark
And I see the star
And I look to the light and I might
Wonder right where you are

All the gods in the sky way up high
See the earth spinning 'round
But the sun and the moon and the stars
Are so far from the ground

I'm the shy boy, you're the coy boy
And you know I'm a Homosapien too
I'm the cruiser, I self abuse her
Just me and you sir, I'm a Homosapien too

And I'm a Homosapien like you
And I'm a Homosapien too

And the world's filled with rage on the stage
Where we act out our lies
And the word in the scripts seem to fit
Except we have some surprise

I just want this to last, all my future
And past till they're gone
And if this is the case then we'll
Lose all trace from now on

I don't wanna classify you
Like an animal in the zoo
And it's good for me to know
That you're (incomprehensible) a Homosapien too

I don't wanna classify you
Like an animal in the zoo
And it's good for me to know
That you're (incomprehensible) a Homosapien too

I don't wanna classify you
Like an animal in the zoo
And it's good for me to know
That you're (incomprehensible) a Homosapien too
