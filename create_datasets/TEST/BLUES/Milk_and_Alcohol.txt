White boy in town
Big black, blue sound
Night club, I paid in
I got a stamp on my skin

Main attraction dead on his feet
Black man rhythm with a white boy beat
They got him on milk and alcohol
They got him on milk and alcohol

Stay put I wanna go
Hard work, bad show
More liquor, it don't help
He's gonna die, it breaks my heart

I decided eventually
This ain't doing a thing for me
They got him on milk and alcohol
They got him on milk and alcohol

They got him on milk and alcohol
They got him on milk and alcohol
They got him on milk and alcohol
They got him on milk and alcohol

Got up, I walked out
To the car, start it up
Feel bad, sad night
I never saw a red light

Sirens were a screamin' all around
I pulled on over and I shut her down
A black cop gave me a shove with his gun
Said up against the wall and don't make a run
They got me on milk and alcohol
They got me on milk and alcohol
