Weeping widow, don't you cry
Dressed in black, i don't know why
All the time that you've been waiting
You should feel like celebrating

He'll make you free as a bird in the sky
Free as a bird in the sky
Look out stranger, here comes danger
Don't let it look you in the eye, boy
You better take care, you know you've got to beware
Don't let it look you in the eye, boy, weeping widow

Weeping widow, spend your leisure
In you castle full of pleasure
When his spirit comes to haunt you
In your chamber, he will taunt you

He'll make you free as a bird in the sky
Free as a bird in the sky
Look out stranger, here comes danger
Don't let it look you in the eye, boy
You better take care, you know you've got to beware
Don't let it look you in the eye, boy, weeping widow

Weeping widow, don't you cry
Dressed in black, i don't know why
All the time that you've been waiting
You should feel like celebrating

Weeping widow, you gotta run
Weeping widow, you better see what's in store
Weeping widow, you better run
