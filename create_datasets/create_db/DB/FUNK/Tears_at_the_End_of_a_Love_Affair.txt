Tears at the end of a love affair (x3)
Yeah 

I cry 'cause I hear your footsteps leaving from my door 
& through my tears I can see you heading for her door 
I gave you the best of my years 
Sharing your laughter, drying your tears 
Baby, this is all I've got, all I've got is... 

(chorus) 

Ooo our love was as sweet as the sun is warm 
But like a sunny day that is with a storm 
Baby, this is all I've got, all I've got is... 

(chorus)

You kissed me goodbye & you're heading straight to her door now 
My heart is broken 'cause I won't see you anymore now 
I gave you a love so true 
I expected so much from you 
Baby, this is all I've got, all I've got is... 

(over background vocals singing title): 
Nothin' but tears now, baby 
So many tears, oh baby yeah 
So many tears just keep on fallin' 
...& fade
