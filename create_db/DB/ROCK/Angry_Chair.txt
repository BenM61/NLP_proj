Sitting on an angry chair
Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care
What do I see across the way, hey

See myself molded in clay, oh
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid
Changing the shape of his face, oh yeah
Candles red I have a pair

Shadows dancing everywhere
Burning on the angry chair
Little boy made a mistake yeah
Pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh

All that I want is to play
Get on your knees, time to pray, oh
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, yeah

Lost my mind, yeah
I don't mind
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind, yeah

Corporate prison, we stay yeah
I'm a dull boy, work all day
So I'm strung out anyway

Loneliness is not a phase
Field of pain is where I graze
Serenity is far away

Saw my reflection and cried
So little hope that I died, oh
Feed me your lies, open wide
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh

I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, yeah

Lost my mind, yeah
I don't mind
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind, yeah

Pink cloud has now turned to gray
All that I want is to play
Get on your knees time to pray, boy
