Dance me in 
Show me the first part 
I'll pay close detail 
To every note in every chart 

An escaped voice speaks from the corner of the room
It's avoiding the plans 
Sneaking past the narrow truth
Everyone else follows through 

You speak for all men 
The hopeless telling of sorries cling to your lungs 
In the print of tomorrow what reminds me of them does not remind me of yours 
Remind me of the young 
Dance me in 
Just dance me in 
Lose on both sides until there are two 
I'm sat at the last table 
My talk wearing thin 
I'll wait for answers 
I'll wait for answers 
Just dance me in
