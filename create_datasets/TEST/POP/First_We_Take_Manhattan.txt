They sentanced me to twenty years of boredom 
For trying to change the system from within 
I'm coming now 
I'm coming to reward them 

First we take Manhattan 
Then we take Berlin 

I'm guided by a signal in the heavens 
I'm guided by the birthmark on my skin 
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons 

First we take Manhattan 
Then we take Berlin 

I'd really like to live beside you baby 
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes 
But you see that line that's moving 
Through the station 

I told you 
I told you 
I told you I was one of those 

I don't like your fashion business mister 
I don't like those drugs that keep you thin 
I don't like what happened to my sister 

First we take Manhattan 
Then we take Berlin
