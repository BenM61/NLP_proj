Twenty four seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got twenty four seconds, can you beat the shot clock?
What, you're waitin' or look, daddy, I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant but you ain't press my line
Wondering why, why, why (oh why)
Know you see ain't shy, shy, shy (oh why)
I'ma say bye, bye, bye, better know I won't think twice (yeah)
Better let go of your pride (do-do)
Do it now (do-do), just do it now (do-do), oh yeah

When a nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down
You got twenty four seconds and it's starting right now

Shot clock (like, don't sleep, don't sleep)
You're gon' miss your opportunity
Shot clock (like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga)
Pick up your feet, nigga
Shot clock (like, don't sleep, don't sleep) (do-do)
You're gon' miss your opportunity (do-do)
Shot clock (like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga)
Pick up your feet, my nigga

L, Love
And "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart
