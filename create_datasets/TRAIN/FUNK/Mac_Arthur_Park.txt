Spring was never waiting for us 'til it ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance

MacArthur's park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh, no

I recall the yellow cotton dress foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees

MacArthur's park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh, no

MacArthur's park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left my cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh, no
