How long
How long have you been away
Oh, how long
I can't find the words to say

I've kept your picture on my shelf
Only there to remind myself
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me

Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me

Oh my love
Will I ever make you see
Oh, that somehow
You are still a part of me

Maybe we can compromise
' Cause our love just can't be disguised
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me
