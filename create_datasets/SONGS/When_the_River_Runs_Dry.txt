Good news for beautiful people
Watching the world go by
Make love in the middle of a warzone
Hey, ya never gonna die

Don't rock the boat, keep your head down
Just another fool in the crowd
Everybody knows, you can be a winner
Cmon, shout it out loud

On the fat of the land I been living
Now it's only a matter of time
Sooner or later, you open your eyes
And return to the scene of the crime

Dig deep at the top of the heap
Now you've bitten off the hand that feeds you
You got nothin' but your soul to sell
You got nothin'

When the river runs dry
You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry
Salvation will rain on you one last time

When the river runs dry
You got the power I got the money
Another million miles to run
I'd cry, cry for the future

But I wouldn't get anything done
Relax, abandon ship
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Blind luck, destiny, do me a favour

When the river runs dry
You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry
Salvation will rain on you one more time

When the river runs... dry
Good news for beautiful people
Watching the world go by
Make love in the middle of a war zone

All of God's children
Never gonna die
You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry

Salvation will rain on you one more time
When the river runs dry
You will return to the scene of the crime
When the river runs dry

Salvation will rain on you one more time
When the river runs
I'm going home to where the river runs dry
Salvation will rain on you one more time

It's only a matter of time
Only a matter of time
When the river runs dry
