Too tough to be denied got to keep my stride 
As I take you for a ride 
The rhythm and the beat and the rhyme must coincide 
Be rehearsed and tired 

Can't come off soft I gotta come off 
I like the spotlight like a moth 
Enjoy being seen but I have to stay correct 
To be the man that you select 

The one you choose when the blues begins to confuse 
All your dent's and do's 
I make the rules and I am setting the path 
Stating my case while I move the place 

Gonna win the race and I'll tell you face to face 
The J is the ace 
Possessing all the elements that are needed 
And you can't beat it 

No no no I don't want a deeper meaning 
In any song I'm dancing to 
No no no I don't want a deeper meaning 
All I want to do is dance with you 

Let's take a stroll get on a roll 
What I'm taling about is to fold body and soul 
I gotta grip so grab a hold 
If you think that I can fit the mold 

Never ending no pretending or descending 
We're gonna rock from the beginning 
Party full speed ahead 
Wake the dead 

You gotta dish those lead 
Feet that make you walk like a person that stutters talk 
You gotta be swift like the hawk 
Forever on the dancefloor drenched in sweat 

'Cause I'm the man the set 
The stage threw you into a rage 
Took you out your cage and out you into a daze 
Now you're out there dipping not slipping 
And I'm through hipping
