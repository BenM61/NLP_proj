When the wintry winds are blowing and the snow is starting in to fall, 
then my eyes turn west-ward, knowing that's the place I love the best of all. 
California , I've been blue, since I've been away from you. 
I can't wait 'til I get going. 
Even now I'm starting in to call, Oh

California, here I come right back where I started from. 
Where Bowers of flowers bloom in the sun. 
Each morning at dawning, birdies sing an' everything. 
A sunkist miss said, "Don't be late" that's why I can hardly wait. 
Open up that Golden Gate, 
California here I come. 

Any one who likes to wander ought to keep this saying in his mind, 
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder" of the good old place you leave behind. 
When you've hit the train awhile, seems you rarely see a smile; 
that's why I must fly out yonder, where a frown is mighty hard to find! Oh

California, here I come right back where I started from. 
Where Bowers of flowers bloom in the sun. 
Each morning at dawning, birdies sing an' everything. 
A sunkist miss said, "Don't be late" that's why I can hardly wait. 
Open up that Golden Gate. 
California here I come.
