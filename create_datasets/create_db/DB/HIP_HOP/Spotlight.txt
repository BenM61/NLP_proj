Gucci!
Rose by fifty
Uh Now she tipsy
Slow dancing in my mansion with no panties
Want to get me
Three girls Gucci trippin'
That's a lot of women
Expensive denim jeans on
Designer heels ya feel me?
I don't want no violence
But damn she tryin' to kill me
She tryin' to make me feel her
I'm trying to make her feel me
She just had a long day
Know I got that long cake
I give her that long scream
I f*ck with her the long way

'Cause the spotlight ain't nothin' without ya girl
And the dance floor ain't nothin' without ya girl
You a show stopper whoa
Lets get it poppin' whoa

Bang bang okay
Where you want to go today
No she is not a prostitute
But if she was I'd have to pay
Say, lay, you can stay
I sex you up couple days
Tell your girl no need to fret
She want to participate
Gucci ain't eliminate
Four girls with me
Simply I glaze they ass
Just like some churches biscuits
Beat her like she stole my Bentley
Swagger jackers pay attention
Cali girl, A-T-L, Detroit, New York girls be with me

'Cause the spotlight ain't nothin' without ya girl

I had a girl left alone
Gucci Mane's a bachelor
Sex tape just like Pamela
'Cause Gucci not an amateur
Mini skirt, sun dress, booty shorts, monster
Her ass phat as two basketballs
Gucci fittin' to dunk her
Pretty like Mariah
Finer than Alicia
Sexy just like Trina, dog
I think she a keeper!
Turn me on like Keri
No she is not scared of her
Probably sex her every uh
'Cause lil' mama is fine as f*ck!
