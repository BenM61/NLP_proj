The sooner you give, the sooner you get to have
A love of your own
The longer it takes, the better you come to know
A love of your own, ooh
Now don't you be afraid, to give your heart
You never know till you try it, yeah

Don't deny it to yourself
Don't be afraid, just walk right on in
The door is standing open, you know I'm always hoping
The sooner you give, the sooner you get to have
A love of your own
As far as you go, you're never too far behind
A love of your own

Now don't you be afraid to shoot the moon
You'll never know till you try it
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid to change your tune, ooh
The offers always open, you know I'm always hoping
You know I'm always hoping
For, a love of my own, to shelter me from the cold

A love of my own
A love of my own you never too far behind
A love of your own
You've got to keep looking till you find
A love of your own
A love of your own
You've got to keep looking till you find
A love of your own
