I tried a river of ink and a mountain of paper
But that couldn't save my long distance love
I met an old friend from home and he promised to tell her
To tell her I crave my long distance love

I know that when he met her she was lonesome as could be 
So he plied her with compliments and sweet sympathy
She gave away her fickle heart to the friend I'm speaking of
Now he's a short distance from my long distance love

I called her last night but she wasn't at home
What's become of the queen bee in my honeycomb
If you let your sweetheart get lonesome and blue
Your gettin her ready for somebody new

musical interlude 

I tried a river of ink and a mountain of paper
But that couldn't save my long distance love
She gave away her fickle heart to the friend I'm speaking of now 
Now he's a short distance from
My long distance love
