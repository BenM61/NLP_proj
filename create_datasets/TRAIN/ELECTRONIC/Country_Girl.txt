Never get to bed (be?)
Never get to hell baby
Never get to come until you start payin your dues
Yeah, What can a poor boy do
Better go back to yr mama
She'll take care of you

Lost your wife
Lost your son
Stay out drinking till the morning comes
Yeah
What can a poor boy do
Better go back to your mama
She'll take care of you

Country girl
Take my hand
Lead me thru this diseased land
I have I have i have (no idea)
I have stole
I have sinned
Oh my soul
Its unclean
Country girl
Gotta keep on keeping on

Crazy women
Mess your head up
Wake up drunk and beaten
In some strange bed
Yeah
What can a poor boy do
Better go back to your mama
Shell take care of you

Country girl
Take my hand
Lead me thru this diseased land
I have I have i have
I have stole
I have sinned
Oh my soul
Its unclean
Country girl

Gotta keep on keeping on
Gotta keep on keeping on
Gotta keep on keeping strong
Gotta keep on keeping on
With you
Got the riot city blues

What do you have to say
Before i have to go
Be careful what you say
Youll reap just what you sow
Yeah
What can a poor boy do
Better go back to yr mama
Shell take care of you

One last time

Country girl
Take my hand
Lead me thru this diseased land
I have i have i have
I have stole
I have sinned
Oh my soul
Its unclean
Country girl
Gotta keep on keeping on

Country girl

Lead me thru this diseased land
I have I have i have
I have stole
I have sinned
Oh my soul
Its unclean
Country girl
Gotta keep on keeping on
