The day I stop loving you will be the day the world stops turning
The day I stop loving you will be the end of time
But the saddest day I'll ever see
Is the day you stop loving me

The day I stop needing you will be the day that I stop breathing
The day I stop needing you the sun won't rise
But the darkest day there'll ever be
Is the day you stop needing me

There'll never come a time when I'll ever change my mind
Can't imagine a life without your love
You're forever in my soul, I'm never letting go
I will always be by your side

The day I stop wanting you will be the day my heart stops beating
The day I stop wanting you the stars won't shine
But the saddest day there'll ever be
Is the day you stop wanting me

Can't imagine a life without your love
You're forever in my soul, I'm never letting go
I will always be by your side
No, I'll never, never, never, never, never say goodbye

The day I stop loving you will be the day the world stops turning
The day I stop loving you will be the end of time
But the saddest day I'll ever see
Is the day you stop, please don't never ever, ever stop loving me
