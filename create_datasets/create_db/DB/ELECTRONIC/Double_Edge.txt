You cut me like a double edge sword
Now I've split in the middle tell me which side do you pick?
You cut me like a double edge sword
Now I've split in the middle tell me which side do you pick?

Somebody told me
All you had to say
Now that I'm wiser
Am I better this way?

Somebody told me, everything
All you had to say, I heard it from them first
Now that I'm wiser
Am I better this way?
I cant answer that

Somebody told me, yes they did
Its all in your head girl
Just don't think upon it anymore
But I cant do that
And I wont do that

You cut me like a double edge sword
Now I've split in the middle tell me which side do you pick?
You cut me like a double edge sword
Now I've split in the middle tell me which side do you pick?

So if this ain't about jealously
Why you making your point?
I think its ridiculous
You tell everyone around us
So put your cover up slowly
I'll ease into mine
Bring me to that fake smile you wanna see
You see this double edge?

You cut me like a double edge sword
Now I've split in the middle tell me which side do you pick?
You cut me like a double edge sword
Now I've split in the middle tell me which side do you pick?
