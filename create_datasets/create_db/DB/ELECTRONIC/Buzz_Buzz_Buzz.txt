Well, buzz, buzz, buzz goes the bumble bee
Tweele, deedle, dee goes the bird
But the sound of your little voice, darling
Is the sweetest sound I've ever heard

I've seen the beauty of the red, red rose
Seen the beauty when the sky is blue
Seen the beauty of the evening sunset
But the beauty of you
Sweet as the honey from the honeycomb
Sweet are the grapes from the vine
But there's nothing as sweet as you, darling
And I hope someday you'll be mine
