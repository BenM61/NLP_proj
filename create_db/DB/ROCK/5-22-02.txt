That's when I told you
5-22-02

Did you ever feel the way?
The feeling of a day gone by
I was hoping you felt that thing too

Could you stand another day
Making habits out of our gone bys?
You and I have better things to do

That's when I told you

Did you ever feel the day?
The feeling of the night gone by?
I kept hoping you felt that thing too

Now the mirror's on the bed
And the shades are black and lead, she said
It was then that everything was mine

That's when I told you
5-22-02

All your life you've been holding on, holding on
All your life you've been holding on, holding on

Could you stand another day
Making habits out of our gone by's?
You and I have better things to do
