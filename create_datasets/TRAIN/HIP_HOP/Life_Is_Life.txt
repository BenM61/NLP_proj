Originally performed by Opus
When we all give the power
We all give the best
Every minute in the hour
We don't think about the rest
And we all get the power
We all get the best
When everyone gives everything
Then everyone everything will get
Life is life!
Life is life
When we all feel the power
Life is life
When we all feel the pain
Life is life
It's the feeling of the people
Life is life
It is the feeling of the land.
When we all give the power
We all give the best
Every minute in the hour
We don't think about the rest
And everyone gives everything
And every soul everyone will feel
Life is life!
And we're all glad it's over
We thought it would last
Every minute of the future
Is a memory of the past
Coz' we gave all the power
We gave all the best
And everyone lost everything
And perished with the rest.
Life is life!
