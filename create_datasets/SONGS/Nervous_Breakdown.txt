      Every mornin',
      She woke up at dawn
      Kissed her little baby, 
      Then she'd yawn
      She'd go to work and
      School, so tired she'd feel
      She lost control, and circumstance took the wheel
      Once upon a time she was
      So full of hope
      She maintained walkin'
      on a tight rope
      Then a decade passed, 
      Things stayed the same
      Her mind went missin',
      Just her body remained. 

      Her soul went runnin'
      To find out if she'd been misplaced
      How could I be lost
      Stop the world let me get off
      No peace could she find
      The devil kept messin' with her mind
      The girl was so tough, but
      One day she had enough

      Pardon the miss, she's gotta
      right to have a 
      Nervous breakdown

      Her baby's daddy left
      She still got on fine
      She fell in love again
      But lost one more time
      Woe to the day her heart began to decay
      She tried to fight
      But then her will ran away
      To lose a dream
      Is very hard to live with
      Looked in the lost and found 
      Could not find it
      Blessed be the child 
      God gave her, who wipes her tears
      Lovin' the mother
      Who's loved him all his years

      But she was drownin'
      And could not come
      In from out there
      Seemed like no way out
      Storm and thunder all about
      No peace could she find
      The devil kept messin' with her mind
      The girl was so tough, but
      One day she had enough

      Pardon the miss, she's gotta
      right to have a 
      Nervous breakdown

      Balancing one minute
      Then her rope got too thin
      Searchin' for solid ground
      To turn her life around
      No stranger to the struggle
      She knows how to recover
      Won't let the fall do her in
      She will stand up again
      Lawd, lawd, lawd yeah
      Lawd have mercy yeah

      Nervous breakdown
