Who's falling in love, I guess it's me
Today I sat home hoping anxiously
Thought you would call or come see me
Every moment passes slowly

I still remember how we kissed last night
Oh, I can feel your arms that held me tight
Just recently it seems to me
Every moment passes slowly
Until I'm in your arms once again

I'm just waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
I'm still waiting on you, baby
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
(I'm still waiting)

I tried to call you, where can you be
I rushed through every call to keep my phone free
Played solitaire till late at night
Oh, I miss that lovin' feelin', yes, I do

"You're everything to me" that's what you said
Those words keep turning over in my head
Well, I tell myself, "Don't you listen, girl, no"
But you say those words so sweetly, yes, you do
And I wanna be in your arms once again

I'm still waiting, waiting
I'm still waiting on you, baby, waiting, waiting
I'm still waiting, uh-huh, waiting
I'm still waiting on you, baby, I keep waiting, waiting, waiting

Waiting, uh-huh, waiting
I'm still waiting, waiting on your love, waiting
Ooh ooh (I'm waiting) ah, waiting
I'm still waiting, waiting on you, baby, waiting

That I keep waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
I'm still waiting, waiting on you, baby, waiting
Don't you stay away, bring your love back home to me, my darlin'
I'm still waiting, waiting

'Cause I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Baby, stop hesitating
I'm still waiting, waiting (Ah, ha), waiting
I'm still waiting, waiting on your love, waiting
Ooh ho I'm still waiting
