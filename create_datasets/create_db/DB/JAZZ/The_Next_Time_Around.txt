One too many goals
The measure of your worth
Can sink your weight in gold
Sat by the ivory sill
The further out you look
The further out you'll be

It's not enough to set the terms
If nothing ventured nothing earned
Though odds are set against

In time I'll belong to you 
It's how it's meant to be

Settled on your own
Sweeping dust from stone
With a letter home
Back where the hour's long
The simplest things invite a thrill
If just by noticing at will

It's not enough to set the terms
If nothing ventured nothing learned
It's how it's always been

E onde a sorte ha de te levar saiba o caminho e o fim mais que chegar
E quiera o dia ser gentil a tua mao aberta pra quem e

In time I'll belong to you
It's how it's meant to be 
And how it's always been
