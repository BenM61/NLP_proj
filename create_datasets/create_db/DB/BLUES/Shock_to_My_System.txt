A message came across a void
And for the first time in my life
I'm awake, I'm alive

I thought I was immune to this
'Til I felt the static charges in the air
I touch you, you're a live wire
You're the raw fire burning in my heart
It took me by surprise, that's no lie

You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
A spark, a real shock
You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
You start, I can't stop
You taught me how to listen, shock to my system

My soul, my skin, you plug me in
And all of my pain is gone just like it never was
For the first time in my life I know what I feel
Now every time we touch I'm caught off my guard
That's no lie

You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
A spark, a real shock
You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
You start, I can't stop
You taught me how to listen, shock to my system

Shock to my system
Shock to my system

You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
A spark, a real shock
You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
You start, I can't stop

You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
A spark, a real shock
You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
You start, I can't stop

You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system
You know you are, you are a sharp, shock to my system

A message came across a void
And for the first time in my life
