Sometimes your eyes look blue to me
Although I know they're really green
I seem to see you differently
Changing as I'm treated kindly
Or treated meanly
From moment to moment
You're two different people
Faithful and warm, when I'm in your arms
And then, when you leave
You're so untrue

But
How
Ever you are
Deep down whatever you are
Whoever you are, I love you

Sometimes, I feel you're mine alone
And yet I'm sure it's just not so
I get this feeling on my own
After I learn if you're staying
Or if you're going
From moment to moment
You're two different people
Someone I know as the man I love
Or the man I wish
I never knew
But
How
Ever you are
Deep down whatever you are
Whoever you are, I love you
