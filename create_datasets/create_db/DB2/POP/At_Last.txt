At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh yeah yeah, at last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known, oh yeah yeah

You smiled, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known, oh yeah

You smiled you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

At last
At last
