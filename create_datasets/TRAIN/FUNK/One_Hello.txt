If you're not afraid Of what love brings
Then endings are beginnings 
Of beautiful things
It's a chance you take
A chance you're in
If someone's gonna find you
First you've got to let them in 

Cause love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now it's easy letting go
One hello is how it starts
You might win it all
Or lose your heart

If you're not afraid 
Of what you feel
Then try to keep it simple
But try and keep it real
And if bein' real 
Means that someday you'd say goodbye
Remember my friends
Goodbye's not the end
It's a circle you know 
And it starts with one hello

Love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now it's easy letting go
One hello is how it starts
Remember my friends
Goodbye's not the end
It's a circle you know 
And it starts
It starts with one hello

It starts with one hello
