If I lay down my love
To come to your defense
Would you worry for me with a pain in your chest
Could I rely on your fate to destroy
To pick me back up and to push me along

Tell me you be there in my heart of me
You won't turn me away
Help me out of the life I need
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made

If I gave you my soul for a piece of your mind
Would you carry me with you
To the far edge of time
Could you understand if you are far from the untrue
Would we become one or departed in two

Please tell me you be there in my heart of me
You won't turn me away
Help me out of the life I need
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made

Could I rely on your fate to destroy
To pick me back up and to push me along
Please tell me you be there in my heart of me
You won't turn me away
Help me out of the life I need
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made
