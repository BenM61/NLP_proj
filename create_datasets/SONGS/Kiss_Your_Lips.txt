Turn me inside out
You know I can't resist
Now you know how it feels
To die like this

Here's somethin'
I think I can leave you with
There was nothin' that I liked
Better than to kiss your lips
Kiss your lips

Lift me up
And turn me into something else
This broken skull
Just wasn't meant to fit

Here's somethin'
I think I can leave you with
There was nothin' that I liked
Better than to kiss your lips
Kiss your lips, kiss your lips

Here's somethin'
I think I can leave you with
There was nothin' that I liked
Better than to kiss your lips
Kiss your lips, kiss your lips
Kiss your lips
