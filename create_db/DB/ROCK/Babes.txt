I saw there, in the rain, in the leather jacket, a killer babe
I told you so, so don't you know, we're the same, I'm a killer babe
Babes, and chills, ever, she was dancing, a killer babe
Back and forth, on the stage, can't keep my eyes off, that killer babe

Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes
Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes
Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes
Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes

Babes, at every turn, where I go, with all that feet, it's killer babes
Babes, don't loose my eyes and all that feet, are killer babes
Your lips are killer babe, your eyes are killer babe, killer babe
You're looking killer babe,
That girl is killing me, that is killing me
And all my women know, we're killer babes

Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes
Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes
Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes
Girls, girls, girls, women, women, are babes, killer babes
