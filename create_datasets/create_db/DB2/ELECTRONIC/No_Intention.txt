The renegade feeling satisfied
You blinked and closed your eyes
You like the feeling of Saturday
You love the danger in the night
The restless corpse is collapsed wind
The breath is daffodil
What not become what is lapsing
Into the universal fill
Or maybe just

No intention
Or maybe just
No intention
Woah yeah woah

When I am full with endeavor
Nothing can stop 
The freshness of my reality
Makes me feel tingly and hot
When you wake up shouting "Idea!"
Is that a punishment?
You represent saying, "I'm real,"
But is that what you meant
Maybe you meant

No intention
Maybe you meant
No intention
Woah ah woah

No intention
No intention
Woah ah woah
