Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

Well, I'll be
I'll be so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I'll be so lonely, I could die

Oh, although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

They'll be so
They'll be so lonely, baby
Well, they're so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

Now, the bell hop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they been so long on Lonely Street
They'll never ever look back

And it's so
Well, it's so lonely baby
Well, they're so lonely
Well, they're so lonely, they could've die

Well, if your baby leaves you
You got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel

Where you will be
You'll be so lonely, baby
Well you'll be lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die

Oh, although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

They've been so
They're be so lonely, baby
Well, they're so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die
