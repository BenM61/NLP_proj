I don't have a need to be the best
Don't want to be just like the rest
Just stay who I am
Just an ordinary middle man
Give me the happy medium
Don't want to be the one whose leading them
I've got no master plan
Just a simple mddle man

Standing on a fine line between this and that
Just biding my time waiting for a sign
To tell me that I'm something special

My ideas are mine alone
Not yours, not theirs, but I care
I hurt for you, but not with you
I love that thing that's inside you
But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm your middle man

But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I am your middle man
