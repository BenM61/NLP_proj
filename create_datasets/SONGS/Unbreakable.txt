Tell myself all the time that it's getting better
That it's all inside my mind
Tell myself all the time that I'm really messed up
But I feel fine

Just don't let me fall for anybody else
Until you make me
Unbreakable and ready for the world to turn

Hold my head for a while till I'm feeling better
To catch a thought that's on my mind
Hold my breath for a while as the sun is setting
And breathe in the light
