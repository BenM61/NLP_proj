It's time to say goodbye for now
We'll have our second time around
But before we go
There's something I'd like to say

Every thing's not what it seems
There's a stronger force behind the scenes
He's in our lives every day
He's right there when we call

In Him is where our strength lies
I'll lift my eyes beyond the skies
Only He can save my life
And only He can hear my cry

I wanna thank You, God
For giving me one more chance
To raise my voice and to sing Your praise
I sing it out loud, I sing it all day

This song in my prayer
I give to only You
It can't compare to the gift from You
He gave us His love, He gave us His Son
Oh yeah, Jesus

I know there's some who don't believe
Some times it's very hard to see
Oh, we live this old life every day
Some things don't go your way

But to be without is not His will, no
There's cattle on a thousand hills
And they're all yours to claim
Claim them in His holy name

See, we don't have to beg or crawl, no
He'll see you standing proud and tall
He'll give His everlasting love
Come to Him as you are

I wanna thank You, God
For giving me one more chance
To raise my voice and sing Your praise
I sing it out loud, hey, I sing it all day

This song is my prayer
I give to only You
It can't compare to the gift from You, oh
See, He gave us His love, He gave us His Son

I wanna thank You, God
For giving me one more chance
To raise my voice and to sing Your praise
I sing it out loud, oh, I sing it all day

Said, it's my prayer
I give to only You, yeah
It can't compare to the gift from You, yeah yeah
You gave us Your love, You gave us Your son

Now I say Amen
God, our Father, Father
I say Amen, I say Amen
