Yeah, it's ya boy man
I'll Mind on production, of course
I got my nigga O-Dash with me tonight
I got Phonte in the house with me tonight

I got my nigga Young Krysis on the boards
D-Brock I see you in the back, baby
But check it out yo

Uh, I got my headphones steady
And you are not ready, 'cause the flows too heavy
Pooh be navigate over tracks like Mario Andretti
I'm sharp as a machete, you tossin' the confetti

Go against me that's doors on a Chevy sixty four
Dishin', niggaz still pitchin'
Sittin' in the kitchen, bangin' on moms table
The rap Clarke Gable, I'm kinda fly with it

I was blessed with the talent to rhyme
And motherfuckers I'm a die with it
Takin' y'all in the high with it
It's my ship from the captain you wanna take a ride in it?

I'm the truth when I step in the booth
AKA a hundred proof raps gasoline
Americas nightmare but a black mans dream
My eyes on the prize no sacrificin'
That's how we do it man, yeah

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
Never, D-Brok tell 'em man

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one Pooh, one true authentic
Uh

It's been five long years since we started this
Group that was targeted, that people so annoyed with fast
And them wannabe niggaz and they gorgeous past
You ask me if I changed, f*ck man, of course I have

'Cause I got more records to sell
More dollars to clock, I hate it but that's how it's gotta be
Got more stories to tell, more people to watch
And ten times more people watchin' me

So f*ck the masquerade, just let me have a say
I still be spittin' regardless of the accolades
Y'all can take back the mics in The Source
Take back the props from Pete Rock Quest and them boys

Take back the night we did, "Speed", at four in the mornin'
Even take back the day I met ninth in the dorm
Y'all can re-write the history to settle the score
And I still be writin' wizardry like never before

'Cause I broke down this year almost lost my clarity
Felt wicked times needed God to carry me
Like, when I found success but lost my family
In the process I will not let you bastards handle me

Lookin' for some guidance, so I figured
I pray to God and He said, Tigga
Low I ain't let you run it back this far
Just so you can go and fumble under one nigga
What he sayin' dog for real?

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me, uh
Yo, you better tell 'em dog

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one Tay one true authentic
What? O-Dash, where you at nigga, man, c'mon?

Keep thinkin' shit gravy man
I heavy man, bet you all a dollar, I can change the game
I ain't gotta change the name, just change the aim
For months we gon' have to rearrange ya frame

Stay strapped on the hip, for those wanna trip
'Cause I got fresh feet on the whip
Man gimme a half I'm like Dominique doors on the flip
No respect when I'm clutchin' ya grip

Paranoia sets in, thinkin' 'bout the time you investin'
Could be gone in a second, that's life in perspective
Ya ace froze, case closed, nigga body found up in Texas
No witnesses to see who that is

That's how I handle my biz, yup for sho'
Might kidnap your broad in exchange for dough
You know how it go

Ain't nobody like me
Tryin' to be hot like me y'all niggaz keep tryin'
But you not like me
That's how we do it, man, y'all better get it

Ain't nobody like me
All day they tryin' to walk wit' it
But there's only one O one true authentic
Yup

Oh yeah
Ain't nobody like me
