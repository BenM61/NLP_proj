Uhh, whatchu want to do? (SoSoDef)
You want to get down? (Ah get down, get down)
Whatchu want to do? (Ah get down, get down)
Said you want to get down? (We got Snoop Dogg, in the house tonight)
Whatchu want to do? (With the homeboy JD)
You want to get down? (Ah get down, get down)
Whatchu want to do? (Ahh ha ha)
Yeah, now check this out

Now, everywhere I go
They want to see Don-Che-Che-O
Yes obsessed with SoSo all my dough
How the jewelry glow and the Cristi' flow
Ain't no secret I sleep with freaky
Premium bush when I push they push
And after we push I leave her
'Cause I don't love her

(Snoop Doggy Dogg:)
Ha ha, and me neither
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
Who could it be, it's the D-O-double-G
Known for the bone and the chrome on the D's
Gold credit card, backyard full of green trees (What?)
Breeze through the summer in a Hummer wit tint
Or dip in the low-low but that's just for promo
Never leave me alone, without the dough doe
I'm SoSo cold but y'all didn't know doe
