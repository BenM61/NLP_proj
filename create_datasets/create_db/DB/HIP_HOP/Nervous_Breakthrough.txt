sometimes somebody can bring you down so far
below anywhere you've gone
sometimes somebody can bring you down so far
below anywhere you know
so much so fast feels like you can't
take the pain but remember
there's no going back
something's so broken down
busted and underground
but here's your chance to surrender

thanks to you
i had a nervous breakthrough

lay down your gun, lay down your pack
it's time to recognize the fact
that all the best things make you nervous
and all the best things come in disguise
so much so fast feels like you can't take the pain
but remember there's no going back
somethings so broken down
busted and underground
but here's your chance to surrender

thanks to you
i had a nervous breakthrough

It's the thing that creeps into your feet
It's the thing that flows into the beat
It's the thing that puts music in your soul
It's the thing that lets everybody know
It's the thing that creeps into your feet
It's the thing that flows into the beat
I was off kilter, now I got shelter
thanks to you I'm gonna breakthrough.
