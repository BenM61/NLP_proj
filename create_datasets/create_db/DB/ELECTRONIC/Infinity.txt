I sit alone in my cold room
The deadly silence comes over me
All is forever all is lost
All I can see are black candles
They shining on me
Where can I go when the light go
Out today I drown in a deep black sea
All I can see, all I can see is a light
All I see are black candles
When I die in a black
Winter night I'm so far away

No memories into the light I fade
Screams and convulsions
Breakin' the walls of my innerself
All I can see, all I can see is a light
All I see are black candles when I die
In a black winter night I close my eyes
I sleep forever I fade away
Never wake up again
