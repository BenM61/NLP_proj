Chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions in my ways
I've come to take as law
All that I ask, you be on the other side
All that I ask, you be on the other side

If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no, you're going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no, you're going backwards

How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?

How can you sleep, baby, there's no good way?
How can you sleep?

More chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions I have come to take as law
Oh there's Pakistan and Netherlands

If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no
You you're going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going, no
You you're going backwards
