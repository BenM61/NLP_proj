I know, I know
I guess you're used to people approaching you all the time
I guess most of the time people probably ask you out to lunch, to dinner, to the movies
I just wanna know if it's possible that you and I could spend a little time together all alone
Why don't you think about it, okay

I can't believe what I saw with my own two eyes
The girl made my world spin all around when she walked by
I want you to know that I love you so
Maybe we could spend a little to get to know each other

Can we spend some time together
All alone
Can we spend some time together
All alone

I know that so many guys approach you every day
But little time is all I need to prove the words I say, baby
I want you to know that I love you so
Maybe we could spend a little to get to know each other

Can we spend some time together
All alone, you and me, can we be
Can we spend some time together
All alone

You're the girl every girl want to be
You're the kind of girl that I want right here with me
Can't you se that I'm in love with you
Won't you please tell me how you feel about me

Can we spend some time together
All alone, you and me, you and me, baby
Can we spend some time together
All alone

Everybody knows
Girl, I love you so
And I want you here with me
Baby, please, baby, baby, please

Can we spend some time together (Can we spend some time)
All alone (All alone, my baby, oh, can we spend a little time)
Can we spend some time together
All alone
