Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord, I just need one day

Well, I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay

Oh, the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh, give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

Been breaking this rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping I'm gonna die

(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I said, I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
Will pardon them (I won't be breaking no rocks)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes, when the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
When the kingdom comes
