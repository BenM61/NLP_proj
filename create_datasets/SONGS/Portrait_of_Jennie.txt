A Portrait of Jennie
More precious to me
Than a masterpiece
How ever famous it be

The portrait of Jennie
Is etched on my heart
Where her features have been
Sketched from the start

Ah, the color and beauty of life
And the glow of her spirit divine
All cast in heaven's own design

With a portrait of Jennie
I never will part
For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heart

For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heart
