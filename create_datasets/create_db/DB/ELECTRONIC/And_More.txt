[Verse 1:]
 Love me for a little while
 Love me if you can
 'Cause I want to be your man
 And I want to understand You
 Ah...

[Verse 2:]
 If you try to follow, girl
 Please stay close behind
 'Cause I want to be with you
 And I want to love you too
 Or three

[Chorus:]
 Ah, ah, ah
 Ah...
 Ah, ah, ah

[Bridge:]
 I don't want to waste your time
 I just want to make you mine
 Ah... whoa-oh-ah

[Verse 3:]
 One, two, three, four, I love you
 And I always will
 'Til the sun falls off the sky
 Gonna love you 'til I die
 And more

[repeat chorus]
