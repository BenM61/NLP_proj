I was walking on feet just like my fathers and my knees were trying to reach you at
Your mothers cause my nose was screaming that you smelled like a lover but my hands
Were happy to treat you like a brother then

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night? we do we do

Pow pow now now pow pow now now

I've been into the plants and simple treasures
And I sew patches on pants and I get pleasure
And I don't make particular plans cause they don't matter
If you keep on foolin in bed with my sleeping patterns

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night? we do we do

What's with all the changes since the time I was aware its like the apple eating people that we once were aren't there
Did they empty out their pockets and debase their younger faces and you must make sure your happy when you leave your summer places
Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat id be sad if your rejected from my hip bone and my knee if I sailed away from continents and touched my lovers hair then you'd be very happy if I touched her there

You'd be very happy if I touched her there, I was very nervous how I felt in there I was very cautious whatd you say hey there
Would you like to see me often though you don't need to see me often
Cause id like to see you often though I don't need to see you often

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night? we do we do
