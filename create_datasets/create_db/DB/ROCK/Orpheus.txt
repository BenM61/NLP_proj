That summer I did nothing
Just sleeping, thinking and hanging around
Left the dark streets of September
As the air was cooling down
Woah yeah it was cooling down

I need the sunshine in the morning
I'm heading for the open road
Sunshine in the morning
Lord you gotta let it flow

Yeah yeah yeah

Ever since I lost her
Seems the more I learn, the less I know
Everyday I think about her
But if I look back I'm gonna turn to stone
To stone, woah yeah gonna turn to stone

I need the sunshine in the morning
I'm heading for the open road
Sunshine in the morning
Lord you gotta let it flow

I need the sunshine in the morning
Yeah I gotta feel its glow
Sunshine in the morning
Lord you gotta let it flow

I'm heading for the open road
I'm heading for the open road
I'm heading for the open road

It hit me without warning
I was left out on my own
The sad times they were forming
I went through them alone

A new day it is dawning
I feel the pain is gone
The open world is calling
And I am moving on

I need the sunshine in the morning
I'm heading for the open road
Sunshine in the morning
Lord you gotta let it flow

I need the sunshine in the morning
Yeah I gotta feel its glow
Sunshine in the morning
Lord you gotta let it flow
