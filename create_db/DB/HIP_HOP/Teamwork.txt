Somebody kill the lights, we doin'

How many licks does it take to the center of a Luda pop double the tumbs
Who knows, plus I gotta undress em', caress 'em, bless em' steady keep em' guessing

6 hands gripping the sheets, 30 toes are curled
What in the world is going on till the break a break a dawn wit man and them girls
'Cause 3 hearts are beating fast, but only 2 people screaming
We coming together for one cause other than hear ourselves breathing
Get in the game n start working it out n digging in out
Now lean to the side, throw a dick in your mouth
You gotta get in the groove you got nothing to lose
So don't move till you figured it out
And keep making that face while I'm rubbing them spots
And we can take turns while the other one watch
And see how she be taking them shots
And wake up the hood till they calling them cops, man

Now I'm ready to ride, so you can get your tools and you can start the ignition
I'm grabbing perms, wigs, weaves, ponytails and extensions
Not to mention it's gonna get, hot, better come ready to sweat
I make women cum harder than jacuzzi jets
And I'm willing to bet that I be keeping it wet cause I feel yea
Little bit of ring on the neck it won't kill yea
Put me on the bottom or top n I'll drill yea
Given how you wanted to get it, I feel ya
And I'll peel yea, back to back so get ready for the mack attack
They got me thinkin' they some acrobats
The way they bending it from sack to sack because the mack is back and I'm gone
