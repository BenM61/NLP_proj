You're freezed and I try to make
You're freezed and I try to make you warm
'Cause you, always got what it takes
To act like you're some kind of hard ass clown
But I, I know better than that
I know you way too long
See I know about your background
It wasn't easy, I know for sure
But that's no reason to crack
It's in the past, so learn to let it go
And just be who you are now, and who you're supposed to be

Now listen girl
Learn how to love yourself again, yeah yeah
And then just fly out girl
'Cause you're worth it
'Cause you're worth it

You fell and I try to get, you fell and I try to get you up
'Cause when things don't work out, oh no
You shut yourself up, let it all just drop
But that is not the way it works
That's not the way it works

And I know that it's easy
It's easy to hate yourself but then, you must realize
The black parts need to be loved as well, oh yeah
The black parts need to be loved as well

Now listen girl
Learn how to love yourself again, yeah yeah
And then just fly out girl
'Cause you're worth it
'Cause you're worth it

Listen girl, listen girl
Listen girl, listen girl

Now listen girl
Learn how to love yourself again, yeah yeah
And then just fly out girl
'Cause you're worth it
'Cause you're worth it

I know one day
I know one day
I know one day
I know one day, you'll get there
