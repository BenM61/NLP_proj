Hey, where did I go on?
Because I don't wanna stop
Before I go

Say goodbye before you leave
Say goodbye before you leave
Say goodbye before you leave
Say goodbye before you leave

Did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I did?
Did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I could?
So I'm not cool with you
I'm done, I'm done
I'm done, I'm running
I run, I run, I run, I'm running

And it was so magnificent
When we had it all
Before it seemed to slowly go wrong
And now I don't wanna go on, go on, on
And how can I forgive you when I don't have the space to
I'm a fool, I've passed regrets
Where did you leave, know you already left

And did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I did?
Did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I could?
And did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I did?
Did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I could?
And did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I did?
Did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I could?
And did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I did?
Did it ever occur that you forgave yourself before I could?
