Could I be falling for you
Is this a fantasy come true
Is this a dream that I've waited for
Am I the one that you adore

Whoa, whoa
I think I'm falling for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
What am I supposed to do
'Cause you make me feel 
Like I'm falling in love (am I falling for you)

Could it be love   Tell me boy
Is it true, I get a rush when I think about you

Lose Control    From my body and my soul
And when you hold me    I don't want to let go
(You give me reason) you give me reason
Every reason just to    Love you babe (babe)
Everything that you do    Is so amazing
I can't believe what    Your body makes me wanna do
I'm having visions    Of me all over you

Whoa, whoa
I think I'm falling for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
What am I supposed to do
'Cause you make me feel 
Like I'm falling in love (am I falling for you)

You must have known though I try to disguise 
The way I feel was there fire in my eye
On that night when our bodies intertwined
I knew right there and then that you will be mine 

Could I be falling for you
Is this a fantasy come true
Is this a dream that I've waited for
Am I the one that you adore (adore, tell me)

Whoa, whoa
I think I'm falling for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
What am I supposed to do
'Cause you make me feel 
Like I'm falling in love (am I falling for you)

Whoa, whoa
I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
What am I supposed to do (what am I supposed to do)
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm falling for you (falling for you)

Every day
You seem to find a way to make me go crazy
I just can't understand but let me tell you one thing
You make me wanna sing 

Whoa, whoa
I think I'm falling for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
What am I supposed to do
'Cause you make me feel 
Like I'm falling in love (am I falling for you)
