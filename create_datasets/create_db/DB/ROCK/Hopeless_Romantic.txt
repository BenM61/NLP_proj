'Cause I'm a hopeless romantic
When I should run for my life

You got me on my knees, you got me crawling
Love is always better when you're falling
Everything is dangerous when it's just the two of us
Jumping in over our heads
I'm never satisfied I never wanna close my eyes
Now I can't sleep at night
No, I am never sleeping

'Cause I'm a hopeless romantic
When I should run for my life
Honey, I don't understand it
'Cause it's magic, but it's tragic
I know you're gonna eat me alive
You're gonna eat me alive

Underneath the sheets, I feel so wanted
You're the mystery that I am solving
Everything is dangerous when it's just the two of us
Jumping in over our heads
Now I toss and turn
Now, I only toss and turn
But will I ever learn?
Boy, I never listen

'Cause I'm a hopeless romantic
When I should run for my life
Honey, I don't understand it
'Cause it's magic, but it's tragic
I know you're gonna eat me alive
You're gonna eat me alive

'Cause I'm a hopeless romantic
When I should run for my life
Honey, I don't understand it
'Cause it's magic, but it's tragic
I know you're gonna eat me alive
You're gonna eat me alive
