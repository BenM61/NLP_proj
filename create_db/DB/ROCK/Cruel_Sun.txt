See the bloody faces lifted to the sky
Do you want to run to a future left behind?
I remember asking why, there lies aggression.
Separation where there should be love
Power plays while the people die

[Chorus]
Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun
Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun

I remember asking why, there lies aggression
Separation where there should be love
Power plays while the people die
I remember asking why, I remember asking why
I remember asking why, I remember asking why, why.

Open up your eyes, your eyes and let the child learn.
Open up your eyes, and let the child learn

[Chorus]

Why does war kill only the small man?
Why does war kill only the small man?
I think we know, yes, we know
I think we know, know, know

I remember asking why.
I remember asking why.
I remember asking why.

[Chorus: x2]
