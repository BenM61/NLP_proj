A time of fear, so long ago,
Lived a man in Salon,
In his dark and magic room,
He gazed on times to come,
All is then revealed, and visions on water speak true!
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
A flash of light, fills the night,
And chills the blood in his veins,
Will the power possess his mind, soul in chains
All is then revealed, and tears that he shed were for you
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
Battles of kings, and of fools,
And changes in ways he once knew,
As pages of days fade away
He's lost in time...
Cry for the nations.
