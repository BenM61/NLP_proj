Welcome to the colored section
Welcome to the Negro leagues
Sign your name on the black list and know this
It's American history

See what it is to be blackmailed
See a real life conspiracy
Sign your name on the black list and know this
It's American history

First black this and first black that
Give me the truth and not the facts
We are the original people
The alpha and omega of it all
We get the short end of the stick all of the time

Welcome to the colored section
See what it is to be me
Sign your name on the black list and know this
It's American history

See the rape of the earth queen
See the buy, sell, and trade of me (on the auction block)
Sign your name on the black list and know this
It's American history

First black this and first black that
Tell me the truth and not the facts
We are the original people
The alpha and omega of it all
We get the short end of the stick all of the time

Who would have thought that we would come this far?
Who would have known that we would almost forget who we were?
Did ye not know you are Gods 
The real celebrity and the star
And for this cause, we get the short end of the stick all the time.
