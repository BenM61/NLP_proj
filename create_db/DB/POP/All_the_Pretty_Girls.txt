Like a '90s dream, cool cut, left drop earring
Cigarette stuck to the bottom of your lip
Saw you standing on the corner of the street
You got your own style with the way that you're moving
I know your type, I spent too many nights
Black mascara dripping from my eyes
So I tell myself "girl, don't get, girl, don't get too close"
'Cause

You
You make all the pretty girls cry
You
So easy, you don't even try
You spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that
You're standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad
You
You make all the pretty girls cry

I get turned on, I get strung out on the idea
From the chaos and the bad romantic feelings
But guys like you know what to say to get me naked
Give me temporary pleasure
There's something you do better

You
You make all the pretty girls cry
You
So easy, you don't even try
You spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that
You're standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad
You
You make all the pretty girls cry

I know your type, I spent too many nights
Black mascara dripping from my eyes
So I tell myself "girl, don't get, girl, don't get too close"
You make all the pretty girls cry
(All the pretty girls cry)
You
So easy you don't even try
You spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that
You're standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad

You
You make all the pretty girls cry
You
So easy, you don't even try
You spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that
You're standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad
You
You make all the pretty girls cry

You, you make all the pretty girls cry
