Throw me a bone
The night it trickles like the sleeping sand
And the roads in my hands, 
This all'd heal, it's stuck in every drain

Tell me why you came 
'Cause I don't know why people can change 
And now I'm not the same
And heaven help me 
Now I've got no good reason to stay 
And now I'm not the same

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Time hanging limp
It sulks around and whisks the sky to strands
But I can tame you, my man 
Now I can see you through your lion's mane

Tell me why you came 
'Cause I don't know why people can change 
And know I'm not the same
And heaven help me 
Now I've got no good reason to stay 
And now I'm not the same

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Tell me why you came 
'Cause I don't know why people can change 
And know I'm not the same
And heaven help me 
Now I've got no good reason to stay 
And now I'm not the same
