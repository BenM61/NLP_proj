Don't fear your best friends, 
Because a best friend would never try to do you wrong.
And don't fear your worst friends, 
Because a worst friend is just a best friend that's done you wrong.
And don't fear the night time, 
Because the monsters know you're divine.
And don't fear the sunshine, 
Because everything is better in the summertime.

But it's never too late to start the day over, 
It's never to late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home.

Don't fear the water, 
Because you can swim inside you within your skin.
And don't fear your father,
Because a father's just a boy without a friend.
And don't fear to walk slow, 
Don't be a horse race, be a marathon.
And don't fear the long road, 
Because on the long road you got a long time to sing a simple song.

But it's never too late to start the day over, 
It's never too late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home.

Don't fear your teachers, 
Because if you listen you can hear music in a school bell.
And don't fear your preacher, 
If you can't find heaven in a prison cell.
And don't fear your own self, 
Paying money to justify your worth.
And don't fear your family, 
Because you chose them along time before your birth.

But it's never too late to start the day over, 
It's never too late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home. 

Hold to your children, hold to your children, hold to your children, let them know.
