I know you need me
And I will surrender
For you somehow
Forsake my soul 

What's over is done
What's over is true
To be like you
To be like me 

I breathe you in me
Now and forever
For you somewhere
Forsake my soul 

What's over is done
What's over is true
To be like you
To be like me 

My love
For you
Leans on
Leans on me 

What's over is done
What's over is true (for you)
To be like you
To be like me (for you)
