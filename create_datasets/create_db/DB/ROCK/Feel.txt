I can feel it now that you've gone
I have made you all that I want
I know you're keeping to your own sound
You're running out of sight when the light goes down
Said you'll be waiting 'till the night's done but there's no one
And the world went on but I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

I can feel it coming so clear
I can feel you already there
And I can see you with my eyes shut
You're running in my head and I can't keep up
Said you'll be waiting for the next one
But I always knew, I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

Our love was long so long
And then forgotten like an old song
You said your life went on
But I always knew I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
