Couple of jiggers of moonlight and add a star
Pour in the blue of a June night and one guitar
Mix in a couple of dreamers and there you are
Lovers hail the Moonlight Cocktail

Stir for a couple of hours 'til dreams come true
Adds to the number of kisses, it's up to you
Moonlight Cocktail, need a few

Serve it in the starlight underneath the trees
You'll discover tricks like these 
Are sure to make your Moonlight Cocktail please

Follow the simple directions and they will bring
Life of another complexion where you'll be king
You will awake in the morning and start to sing
Moonlight Cocktails are the thing
