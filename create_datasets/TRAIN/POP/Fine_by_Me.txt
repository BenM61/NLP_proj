You're not the type
Type of girl to remain
With the guy, with the guy too shy
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever

I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees
With his hands clenched tight
Begging, begging you please
To stay with him for worse and for better

But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me

In the past I would try
Try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart

Who are you, you, you
I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start

And it seems that every time
We're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you
That I don't wanna lose

And I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl I need

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me

And it's never easy
Darling, believe me
I'm as skeptical as you

But when I think of, life without us
She's like "what we supposed to do?"
But I don't wanna come on too strong

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
We can live like this forever
It's fine by me

It's fine by me if you never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If we never leave
And we can live like this forever
It's fine by me
