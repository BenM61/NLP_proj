He's a stone delta blues man.
He's a top rollmo' star
He's a stone delta blues man.
He's a top rollmo' star
Black wand, white magic, nitroglycerin
He's earned the right to be known as

Machine gun Ibiza

Voodoo up rollmo' down

Machine gun Ibiza

Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound

If you've never been nowhere
Don't you pay that no mind
If you've never been nowhere
Don't you pay that no mind

Feel part of no circle ?
If you make no scene
Well you've earned the right
To hang out with

Machine gun Ibiza

Voodoo up rollmo' down

Machine gun Ibiza

Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound

If you're a goddess
If your heart's sixteen
Girl you're gonna wake up buddies with

Machine gun Ibiza

Voodoo up rollmo' down

Machine gun Ibiza

Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Ooh light a fire - be an ex-marine
Baby learn to burn your dog tag like

Machine gun Ibiza

Voodoo up rollmo' down

Machine gun Ibiza

Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten with the hurricane sound
Hangin' ten, sound

Machine gun Ibiza, voodoo
