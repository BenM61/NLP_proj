Wait here, go there
Come in, stay out
Be yourself, be someone else
Obey the law, break the law

Be ambitious, be modest
Plan ahead, be spontaneous
Decide for yourself, listen to others
Save money, spend money

Be good, be evil
Be wise, be foolish
Be safe, be dangerous
Be satisfied, be envious

Be honest, be deceitful
Be faithful, be perfidious
Be sane, be mad
Be strong, be weak

Be enigmatic, be plain
Be aggressive, be peaceful
Be brave, be timid
Be humane, be cruel

Be critical, be appreciative
Be temperamental, calm
Be sad, be happy
Be normal, be unusual

Stop, go, live, die
Yes, no, rebel, submit
Right, wrong, sit down, stand up
Create, destroy, accept, reject

Talk, silence, speed up, slow down
This way, that way, right, left
Present, absent, open, closed
Entrance, exit, believe, doubt

Truth, lies, escape, meet
Love, hate, thank you, flunk
Clarify, pollute, simple, complex
Nothing, something, stop, go

Live, die, yes, no
Rebel, submit, right, wrong
Sit down, stand up, create, destroy
Accept, reject, talk, silence
