Yeah nigga, West coast

Nigga, G'z Young Gotti

I'm like f*ck a bitch and f*ck you too
It's so many different things that I'm gon' do
Switches all fucked up livin' in the '80's
Jackin' niggas for Nissan trucks
A quarter piece to flip it's me and Daz and two bitches
I never gave a f*ck, nigga Daz and Kurupt
They say, this ain't the way to get rich
I might as well get me a bitch

I don't get it, I take it put a glitch in the Matrix
Flip some bricks to strip ya bitch naked
'Cause I just don't care, live from "G" square
Wit a vest and a cup to put in the air
Nigga, f*ck a bitch and f*ck you too
What a punk mothafucka like you gon' do?
I holla'd at Dr. Dre, hit up Bigg Snoop
Wit the candy cut-cut perfectly on fueled

It's on one, nah he said, "It's on two"
On fifteen shells, ducked and detailed, de-railed
All you to want do, do what the f*ck you want to do too
Get what ya got to get to get through
Light what ya wanna light to light fire
Big arsonist blew to white fire
Blast through ya home or blast to hit doors
Crap like the crap table, Canaan Abel

I'm signed-out Sinatra, galactic Gallagher
Metaphysical, sixteen Calibur metallica
'Sane asylum shanker, big and little banker
Punk mothafucka, bust a bank mothafucka, yeah nigga
We can go heads nigga you bitches be hatin' nigga
Heard what I said nigga, lend me some bread nigga
Keep ya chest bust like lead niggas
The fed nigga, Daz and Fred nigga

Kurupt Young Gotti, baby face Capone
We on Niastra, nigga on the microphone
Never, never have I ever gave a f*ck
That Nigga Daz Dillinger, Fred, Kurupt
And we do what the f*ck we want to just do
Get what we got to get to get through
And we blast what we got blast to get ours
Life of a gangsta in a world of stars

Light what ya wanna light to light fire
Big arsonist blew to white fire
Do what the f*ck you want to do too
Get what ya got to get to get through
Through, just do it, don't stop

Unless you stuck up in a time-warp
You all ready know about the West

They say, them niggas on the North side
Keep tabs on they skrill
All my niggas on the South side

Throw ya mothafuckin' hood up somebody
What dem niggas do, they ride

Throw ya mothafuckin' hands up somebody
Throw ya mothafuckin' hood up somebody
