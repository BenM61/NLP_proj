Standin' on the ceiling babe, it's alright
Suspended by the dreams you seem to lose
You been floatin' for awhile, awhile, can't hold on
Standin' on the ceiling baby, it's alright, it's alright

Somebody is tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now you're flying like you want to be
Right where you belong

Starin' at the wall like it's a window, don't know
Blinded by the dreams you seem to lose.
You've been starin' for a while, knock it down
Starin' at the wall, you don't know, don't know...

Somebody is tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now you're flying like you want to be
Right where you belong

Runnin' from the sun again, it's alright, alright
Runnin' from the dreams you seem to lose
You've been runnin' for awhile, awhile
You can't slow down

Runnin' from the sun again, it's alright, 
Alright Somebody is tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now you're flying like you want to be
