Like one I knew all along
And daddy, he got a hold on me
I know you think that it's wrong
But he grew on me like a rose
The sweetest I've ever known
I swear that he got a hold on me
And now I can't let him go

No one ever said it was easy
And I love him, you gotta believe me
No, it don't seem right
But I'll change your mind, mind
Trust in me, I'ma need your blessing
Oh, I love him, I'm confessing
If it takes my life
I'ma change your mind

He spoke to me like the rain
I knew that I would have to see him again
And as he poured out his heart on me
I was a moth to a flame, oh

No one ever said it was easy
And I love him, you gotta believe me
No, it don't seem right
But I'll change your mind, mind, yeah
Trust in me, I'ma need your blessing
Oh, I love him, yeah, I'm confessing
If it takes my life
I'ma change your mind (mind)

Oh
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no
I'ma change your mind
Oh, oh

You look at me like the sun
And I can see that your mind's made up
But daddy, he got a hold on me
I swear that he is the one
