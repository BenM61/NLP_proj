I think I cracked my skull on the way down 
I think I lost my head when I lay down 
The fear of facts presented in the cold light of day 

I say the time has come for decision 
Better steer my boat for a reason 
Lost the way I went over horizon 
She went out of sight 
The girl lost me a lifetime 

Sometimes I feel, ['m washed up under] 
Sometimes I feel, [I'm washed up under]

I say the time has come for decision 
Better steer my boat for a reason 
Lost on the way I went over horizon 
She went out of sight 
The girl lost me a lifetime 

[Chorus: ]

[Repeat: 1st verse]

And when I step back from all this I see that I'm fighting 
I can't help myself, there's no reason for lying 
Truth and fiction they all become one 
Help me from the sea to the beach to the laaaaa
Sometimes I feel, I'm washed up under baby
