What a day
Everything's going my way
What a day
Everything's going my way, yeah

What a day
(La la la...oh, what a day)
Everything's going my way
(La la la...oh, what a day)
I got me a lovely girl
And she's okay, oh
(Oh, what a day)

What a day
Let me tell you
(La la la...oh, what a day)
It was out of sight
(La la la...oh, what a day)

It's gonna be a wonderful day
I had a wonderful night, oh, yeah
(Oh, what a day)

Ain't no use
Sitting around with the blues
You better enjoy yourself
And one thing else
Don't let life get the best of you

What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
(Oh, what a day)

I wanna sing my song
(Oh, what a day)
If you wanna get in the groove
You gotta sing along
(Oh, what a day)
Oh, yeah, sing a song

(La la la la....)
One more time now
(La la la la....)
Say it again
(La la la la....)

(Oh, what a day)
(Oh, what a day)
(Oh, what a day)....

What a day
What a day, what a day
(Oh, what a day)
