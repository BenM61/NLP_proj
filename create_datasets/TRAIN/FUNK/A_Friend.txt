A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

Sometimes, there's no one to talk to
No one else I can find
But He's always there, He's everywhere
I'm talkin' 'bout a friend of mine

Problems seem like they never end
You have no one to turn to
But you can lean on Him
He'll never let you fall and
All you got to do is call Him
He's just a friend

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

It seems so crazy
You see times have changed and
People say they treat you so good
But then they smile in your face and
They talk behind your back
They're not like the friends of old

But I found a friend who's love is true
It won't change no matter what happens
He's gonna be right there
And you can depend on Him

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

And if you ever need a friend
He's always by your side

And He'll never, ever let you down
He's a friend of mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Yes He is

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more
