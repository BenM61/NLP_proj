Yesterday brought us here
And for better or for worse we inherit the seed
But the message is clear we can make it happen
If we let the music be free
Got to groove it harder
Got to say it louder
Rock the music

Rock the music
Got to wear the flower
Got to feel the power
Rock the music
Rock the music
All together
All as one

Like the sun
Turn the night into day
There is money in chains
Making choices for the rest of us is good for the few
But the air needs a change
And the spirit of creation is the motion we chose
Got to groove it harder
Got to say it louder

Rock the music
Rock the music
Got to wear the flower
Got to feel the power
Rock the music
Rock the music
All together A
Ll as one
Like the sun
Turn the night into day
