On Saturday night, where I was born, down on the farm
Guitar plinking and we started singing 'til the break of dawn
About twelve o'clock ev'rything gets hot, up steps old Jones
We started clappin' and he started singin' a sweet little country song

Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil, where've you been all day
Your momma's been lookin', hasn't stopped lookin' since you went away
Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil, where did you go and stay
Your momma's been lookin', hasn't stopped lookin' since you went away
