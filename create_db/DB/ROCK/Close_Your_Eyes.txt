Lost the things that you thought you would never miss
Let them out, miss them while they're gone
But there's memories down here that will always live
And they can't take them away, so they won't

Open this window, let the sickness out
Sleep softly, breath again
If there's a way then it'll find you and help you out
You're like a circle, there is no start and no end

Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
'Cause it's not all pitch black in the back your mind
So close your eyes, you might see something prettier
You pick a dream right out of the night

And change I wish, for I will, 'cause it's gonna work
You can do this, it's your life
And if you're unhappy about something, stop jerking about
Follow the clouds and dive right in

Open this window, just let the wind blow in
And let it grab you and calm you down
And if there is no way, then find a way
But don't go down that easy way
And don't let any of them bastards hold you down

Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
'Cause it's not all pitch black at the back your mind
So close your eyes, you might see something prettier
So pick a dream right out of the night

Welcome to the show 'cause you're
Following the man, with a million dollar plan
And all your dreams are gone if you let them go
And all the dreams you win, if your dare to make it so
If you dare to make it so

You lost the things that you thought you would never miss.
You let them out, miss them while they're gone
But there's memories down here that will always live down here
And they can't take them away, so they won't

Close your eyes, you might see something beautiful
'Cause it's not all pitch black at the back your mind
So close your eyes, you might see something prettier
You pick a dream right out of the night

So close your eyes
You close your eyes
So close your eyes
Common close your eyes
