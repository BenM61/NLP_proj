I'm waking up-and you are there
 Times are over when you had me out of breath
 I think of you and have to say:

 Every night,my god you're boring me to death
 Oh Baby I am in for something
 again and again

 Oh Baby sex with you just didn't' do
 Oh Baby don't believe that I was true
 Go Back to your mum
 I won't miss you babe that's all I know
 get out of my life
 go back to your mum
 get out of my sight
 You were once my love but its really long ago
 I can't believe-it took so long

 all the time you wre just longin'for your home
 Also there you'll have to do it all alone
 And then I hope-you understand
 Oh Baby have a beer and watch tv

 Oh Baby you're not many enough for me

 Oh Baby I was just too blnd to see
 Again and again
 Go back to your mum
 I won't miss you babe that's all I know
 get out of my life
 go back to your mum
 get out of my sight
 You were once my love but its really long ago
 I can't believe-it took so long

 get out of my life

 Oh Baby I am in for something new
 you were once my love but it's really long ago
 Oh Baby sex with you...(s.o)
 I won't miss you babe that's all I know
 get out of my life
 go back to your mum
 get out of my sight
 You were once my love but its really long ago
 I can't believe-it took so long
