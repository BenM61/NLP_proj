Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharing

I'll never forget the moment we kissed the night of the hay ride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm while takin' a sleigh ride

Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The telephone call that tied up the line for hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve to send you some flowers

Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

(The way that we cheered whenever our team was scoring a touchdown)
The time that the floor fell out of my car when I put the clutch down
(The penny arcade, the games that we played, the fun and the prizes)
The Halloween hop when everyone came in funny disguises

Magic moments filled with love
