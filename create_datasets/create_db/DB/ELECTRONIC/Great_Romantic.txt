Hey, so you threw your heart right in
And it turned out less than perfect
A losing streak is starting in your mind
You let yourself believe the pain

It's never going to be worth it
Don't beat yourself up
Know that you were never wrong for wishful thinking
So now that you've lost the battle
Should we just cross out your name and let you sink?

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling like the last surviving great romantic,
Just stop the dreaming and the world stops spinning around
You feel foolish 'cause love never turns out
Like you planned it
Stop believing and the world stops letting you down.

So you had to let it go
It clearly wasn't working
New love leaves you trembling
You hide behind the door

So unsure of what you used to know
So now you think your every move ten steps ahead and you are frozen
Caught inside yourself
You're drowning as the anger overflows....

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling like the last surviving great romantic,
Just stop the dreaming and the world stops spinning around
You feel foolish 'cause love never turns out
Like you planned it
Stop believing and the world stops letting you down.
