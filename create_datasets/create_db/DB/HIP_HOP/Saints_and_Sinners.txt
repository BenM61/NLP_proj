Fast, slow
Stop, go

I got the strangest feeling
I refused to believe in
I got the strangest feeling
Feelin' you admire me
Deep inside desire me
I'll befriend you
I'll try to pretend to
Have your interest at heart
Promise to take it far
Open up your mind, are you ready for the ride

Do you want to go fast,
Do you want to go slow,
Do you want to stop,
Do you want to go,
Are you ready,
Do you want to taste me

You can go up
But you gotta come down
Ain't no joke, are you fooling around
You know,
Things have come to taste you, 
I'm about to let you
Make you have a good time
Make you lose your mind
You can run, 
but you know you can't hide
are you a Saint or a Sinner inside?
I will,
Take you by your soul,
Make you lose control
If you're capable to sin
I'll take you somewhere you've never been

Are you ready for the ride?

Please forgive me

Can I ask you a question?
(Yeah yeah)
An irrelevant question?
(Uh huh)
I got a feeling pretty deep
Feeling that I want to keep,
Feeling we won't get no sleep
I want to let you
(Want to let you)
Do what you want to
(Do what you want to)
There's a million reasons why
You gonna fry tonight
Baby hold on tight
Are you ready for the ride?

Do you want to go fast,
Do you want to go slow,
Do you want to stop,
Do you want to go,
Are you ready,
Do you want to taste me
(Yes you can)

You go up
But you gotta come down
Ain't no joke, are you fooling around
You know,
Things have come to taste you, 
I'm about to let you
Make you have a good time
Make you lose your mind
You go run
But you know you can't hide
Are you a Saint or a Sinner inside?
I will,
Take you by your soul,
Make you lose control
If you're capable to sin
I'll take you somewhere you've never been
