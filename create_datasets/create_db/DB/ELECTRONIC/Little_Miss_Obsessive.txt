Woah, woah, woah (that side of your bed is still mine)

Woah, woah, woah (that side of your bed is still mine)

Am I the reason why you tossed and turned last night?
Everything's such a blur, it didn't come out right
All of the sudden it's cold and we're falling apart
No this can't be, please don't leave me alone in the dark

And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive, can't get over it

Woah, woah, woah (that side of your bed is still mine)

Woah, woah, woah (that side of your bed is still mine)

I've never been a fan of long good-byes
I'm at the finish line and you're just way too far behind
In the morning I got in a fight with myself, I got the bruises to prove it
Then I swallowed your words and spit them right back out

And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, Aim not desperate
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive, can't get over it
No!

It's like a fairy tale without a happy ending (happy ending)
But then again maybe we are just pretending
Why does it have to be so unfair?
Tell me that you care

And I guess we're really over, but come over, I'm not over it
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it, oh

Little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss obsessive

Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive, can't get over it

Woah, woah, woah (that side of your bed is still mine)
