Into the night I go 
Day for night 
I know what you talk about in your sleep 
Wrap yourself around me

Not just a passer by 
I'm gonna stay awhile,
I like your peep show 
Magnetized I saw you in the window,

I've been watching you 
Don't know what else to do,
Trust me I'm sensitive intensitive 
I'll never let you go,

No need to be afraid 
Release yourself to me 
I got that heart-ache,
Hubble bubble you know my trouble 

I saw you on your own 
No need to be alone,
Let me levitate relax resonate 
Turn off the lights,

Day for night 

I saw your eyes on fire 
The desire won't release you,
I go where you go to 
I have to follow you,

So put your honey where your mouth is 
Look behind you,
Relax and let me hypnotize 
I'd like to touch mmmm,

Standing in the shadows 
I've had my fill of it,
Too close to the light 
Just for the thrill of it,

Hubble buble you know my trouble 
Turn out the lights,
Day for night...
