Ohh Ohh
I'm so blue
Cause I'm worried over you
I, I sometimes wonder
Why I never hear from you

You promised to write me
Each and everyday
And I haven't heard from you
Since you went away

Oohh oohh

I sit by my window pane
Hoping for a letter
One that never came

My heart cries for just
One little line
Anything to say you're mine

Oohh, oohh, oohh, oohh

I said a prayer
Every night, hoping
Hoping and praying
Someday, someday you'd write

Oohh, oohh

My heart cries 
For one little line

Anything to say you're mine
