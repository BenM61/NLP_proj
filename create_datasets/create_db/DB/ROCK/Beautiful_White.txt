She buys stripes and colors
She wears purple and black
Her arms jingle and jingle
Her lip kiss me go smack

Her boots stomp and clomp to my door
The boots that cowboys wear
She's got sticky little tangles
In her big yellow hair

[Chorus]
When she comes to me
In the dim morning light
She strips away the colors
Revealing beautiful white

She's got a big grey overcoat
She just dumps on a chair
But she paid a lot for those trousers
She'll handle them with more care

Bought her that sweater for Christmas
Now it lies on the floor
One black sock then the other black sock
She's hidden no more

[Chorus]
