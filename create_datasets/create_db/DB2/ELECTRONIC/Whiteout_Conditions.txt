I'm flying and feeling the ceiling
I'm barely dealing and the faces, the faintest of praises
Are too revealing, such a waste of a beautiful day
Someone should say, it's such a waste of the only impossible, logical way in
A fly-in in la was open
I wasn't hoping for a win, I was hoping for freedom
You couldn't beat 'em so you crumbled, you doubled your dosage
You wanna go, said the inhibitor blocking the passage
That thing is massive

And the sky will come for you once
Just sit tight until it's done
The sky will come for you once
Just sit tight until it's done

Got so hooked on a feeling
I started dealing in a stage of grief so demanding
I got a stand-in every radio buzzing, it wasn't the dream of the moment
Wasn't the current that carried me, keeping me going

Only want to get to work
But every morning I'm too sick to drive
Suffering whiteout conditions
Forget the mission, just get out alive
Only want to glean the purpose
Only to scratch the surface, raise the plow
Suffering whiteout conditions
Forget your mission, just get out somehow

Everyone suddenly busy
Suddenly dizzy you're so easy, it's pushing you over
You're taking tours of a treacherous strip of the badlands
You have your demands maybe you riot for nothing, it's just a bad hand

Only want to get to work
But every morning I'm too sick to drive
Suffering whiteout conditions
Forget the mission, just get out alive
Only want to glean the purpose
Only to scratch the surface, raise the plow
Suffering whiteout conditions
Forget your mission, just get out somehow

Flying and flat on the ceiling
I see myself and the revival, it suddenly hits me
It's going viral such a waste of a beautiful day
Someone should say
It's such a waste of the only impossible, logical way in
Got so hooked on a feeling
I started dealing but the days spent kicking the cages
Are too revealing so committed to your misfortune
But still a cheater such a waste of a beautiful day
Wish you could be here
