She'll read your mind, she's smart as a whip. 
She'll suck you dry, but look at how much I drip. 
At the point of ecstasy I write a symphony 
Of poetry in motion, and leaving me there to die. 

I tell myself let no one take her place. 
To confide in someone and look at how much I paid. 
I want you next to me, call it telepathy. 
We drifted into vision and look how much we see. 

I just want to get closer than close to you. 
I know that one way or the other 
Any test of my faith will do. 

And lovers fall for lovers' friends. 
We make each other cry, 
Living in each others lives 
And trying to make the fantasy come true. 

But I just want to get closer than close to you. 
Baby, I just want to get closer than close to you. 

Your soul is naked, it tells you what it wants. 
I read your letter and look at how close I've come. 
There's more for us to see in this philosophy. 
We both end up in heaven and look at how close we'd be. 

I 
Just want to get closer than close to you. 
I know that one way or the other 
Any test of my faith will do. 

I give my heart for you to break. 
I give my final breath. 
When nothing lasts forever see 
What we can turn eternity into. 

And I just want to get closer than close to you 
At the moment you discover 
What the best of my love can do. 

And lovers fall for lovers' friends. 
We make each other cry, 
Living in each others lives 
And trying to make the fantasy come true. 

I just want to get closer than close to you. 
Baby, I just want to get closer than close to you
