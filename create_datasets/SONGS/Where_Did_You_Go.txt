Where did you go?

Oh, I had a feeling that it might come this
I, I, I, I, I saw it in your eyes
I felt it when we kissed
Oh, something inside said
Warning, warning, warning
There's danger ahead
Better watch where you're going
This one's different
Proceed with caution
Enter at your own risk (own risk)

I knew how this would end
Still I let it begin
I'm just another fool that rushed in
You left me in the dust
Just another prisoner of your lust
You felt like water through my hands
Too slippery to grab
Like a castle on the sand that washed away
Was it something that I said?
Didn't give you enough attention?
What made you run from me?

I wanna know why
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go
I wanna know why
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go

Where did you go?
I wanna know why
Where did you go?

I wanna know why
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go
I wanna know why
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go
I, I, I, I, I wanna know where did you go
