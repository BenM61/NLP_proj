There's a city filth that lingers 

All over my naked hands
Deep into the weave of the clothes I wear

And every step brings another 

Every hour adds some more
Till I'm on the other side leaning on your door
Are the taps running, darling?
Is the air thick with steam?
Can I find some place to cry these tears of shame?

Every step brings another 

Every hour adds some more
Till I'm on the other side leaning on your door 

There's a smell so sweet it's sickly 

It follows me into the room
Hangs in the air like rotting perfume

I never bathe in it, darling
Got down on my hands and knees
Got in so far, I became, well, a part of it all
I've been wading through it
Don't you know it's up to my neck?
And it won't be long 'fore it's over my head
And it's the thought of you in my mind, keeps me

Thought I knew these streets, and how they turn 

Could always find my way home
There's something there, can't leave it alone 

The trains they run all night 

We could leave everything behind
Just bring that dress you bought when we first met

I know it's faded, darling
I know it's tattered and worn
In that dress, I could never love you more
I've been wading through it
Don't you know it's up to my neck?
And it won't be long 'fore it's over my head
And I can suck it into my love, breathe it in
