I'm dead my life's been sold
All my years are cold
No trees to hide my head
All my roads are red
And in the Easter
I will see that same old sun that shone

And in the winter
I will stand in seas of snow alone

I will wait for you yeah!
Your eyes will shine like dew.
Yeah! I close my eyes and you're now here.
And I'll wait for you

For one million years!
I'm face has long been wet
Ever since we met
We wed
I knew she'd stay

Then I passed away.
And in the Easter
I will see that same old sun that shone

And in the winter
I shall stand in seas of snow alone

I will wait for you yeah!
Just like you want me to.
Yeah ! I'll close my eyes and you're now here.
And I'll wait for you.
For one million years!
