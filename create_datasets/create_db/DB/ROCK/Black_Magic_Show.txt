Loosen your tie, enjoy the show
Hey man, don't be sad, man
It's always fun to lose control
Blinded by the bright lights, yeah

And it already has begun
The freaks have come out tonight
And it already has begun
There's no difference between wrong and right
Welcome to the black magic show

The devil sings a song for you
Hey man, why you staring?
He'll make you think that it's all true
It's all an illusion, yeah

And it already has begun
The king has lost his mind
And it already has begun
It's no reason for you to cry
Welcome to the black magic show, come on

And it already has begun
There's no room here for you
And it already has begun
There's nothing, nothing you can do
This is called the black magic show
