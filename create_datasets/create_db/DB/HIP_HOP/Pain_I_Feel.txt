We'd like to dedicate this particular tune
to all to all to all the hell of ya from wherever

[Channel Live] But there's only weak rappers steady making hits, f*ck that!

Verse One:

I drop clarity like kerotene, everytime I speak out
Rappers freak out, but never stick their necks too deep out
and touch the live wire, gettin live like from gaya inner
Jim Jones cool-aid you got mad reason to be afraid
You ain't ready, rappers are petty, never lyrical
It's a miracle they need to reign as they physical
to get blessed, East vs. West, we never on that
Cause the rugged format you can get from where you're born at
So learn this, to burn this, you gotta earn this
with your rap style be the firmest, forget about your color of epidermis
for advantages, there's bandages, whatever your language is
You be in Danger like that Blahzay triangle is
The Blah pre your mind freein
Not the fatigue wearin jewels glarin rapper, you used to seein
Absestos study lessions to make impressions
The P's come and squeal on the real I'm mad excited
I got my deal but still...

Chorus:

You don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak rappers steady making hits, f*ck that!
'cause 'cause 'cause you don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak, rappers, steady making hits
You don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak rappers steady making hits, f*ck that!
'cause 'cause 'cause you, 'cause, 'cause you don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak, rappers, steady making hits

Verse Two:

Now everybody lamp go ahead get amped for your camp
Without no harmony your Normandy will never be the champ
And let me mention, no racial tension the way the rule goes
I flows with bros, PF flows with papa chulos
We combine cluster, you can't muster break your ligaments
Building my predicaments, living with the immigrants
See special blow your vest or do it thorough
That's blurro, my referral don't try to rally up your borough
Just warm, stay calm if you don't got steel in your palm
you'll peel me, I'm top rank I got more lines than the Yanks
uni-form, carry on screamin on MC's
Running around together only bonded by smoking trees
Chronic, my tonic make you vomit for teamin up
Bringin the drama, be blank comma blank comma
Read it, singers get weeded, then conceeded
But you don't know the pain
So watch how you feed it to me

Chorus

Verse Three:

Comin with with the raw tech, strong like Gortex
Rappers get more plex, as they make their name off all fetch
and unrealistic, your neighbor crew know you're ballistic
Your statistic ain't mistic, under that talk we know who is it
So stay busy, keep touring
Your hood is roaring, it's not a place for pussycats to be exploring
Your plan lock it, you bandwagon just to start a rival
Without skills you better check for your own survival
And feel the pain rappers talk a good John Wayne but look stupid
You be trying to play us like a groupie
With your rap staff you riff and raff
I listen and laugh, in town you down out of town you get sent ass
And you don't know the pain...

Chorus
