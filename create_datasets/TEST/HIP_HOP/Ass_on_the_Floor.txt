When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor

You're the love of my life
But you hurt my heart twice
Now I'm drunker than a motherfucker
Trying to find my way back to your heart you motherfucker

So I know, there's a price
When you're running on ice
When your drunker than a motherfucker
Trying to find your way back to love
You motherfucker

Baby you know,
You know just what to do
I know you know the truth
And we will never lose
There's no me, without no you
I give my soul to you

When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When, when you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor

Them haters can't tell me nothing
Them haters can't tell you nothing

See babe you, made me cry
Don't you hurt, hurt my pride
Got me madder than a motherfucker
Trying to fight my way back to your heart you motherfucker

See your wrecking my brain
In your arms I feel sane
Shit, you know deep down, I will always love ya
Trying to find your way back to my heart you motherfucker

Baby you know, just what to do
I know you know the truth
And we will never lose
There's no me, without no you
I give my soul to you

When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When, when you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
Them haters can't tell you nothing
Them haters can't tell me nothing
Them haters can't tell you nothing

Yo turn me up,
Yo turn me up,
I'mma make sure she can hear me
Listen to me

That loves gon' get ya, motherfucker
Smoke weed, listening to Sade
I left my pain in Paris
Why can't you see shit my way
You on that lonely highway
My car's still on that driveway
Feels like I'm dying slowly
Feels like what more can I say
I made you face your fears
I think we could have made it
Thought I told you I love you
Maybe we should have waited
How could you ever doubt me
When I stood by you proudly
I would have gave my last breath
Now you can't breath without me

Oh when you're in the club ya
All you think about is your baby
Oh when you're in the club ya
All you think about is your baby

Baby I want you
To need me
I need you
To want me,
I want you
To love me forever

Baby I want you
To need me
I need you
To want me,
I want you
To love me forever

When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When, when you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
When you're in the club, get your ass on the floor
Them haters can't tell you nothing
Them haters can't tell me nothing
Them haters can't tell you nothing
