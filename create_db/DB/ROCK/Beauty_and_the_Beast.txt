You're not a stranger to me
And you are something to see
You don't even know how to please
You say a lot but you're unaware how to leave

My darling lives in a world that is not mine
An old child misunderstood out of time
Timeless is the creature who is wise
And timeless is the prisoner in disguise

Oh who is the beauty who the beast
Would you die of grieving when I leave
Two children too blind to see
I would fall in your shadow I believe

My love is a man who's not been tamed
Oh my love lives in a world of false pleasure and pain
We come from difference worlds we are the same my love
I never doubted your beauty I've changed
I never doubted your beauty I've changed

Changed who is the beauty
Where is my beast (my love)
There is no beauty
Without my beast (my love)

Who is the beauty
Who my love
Ah
Oh la bete la bete
Where is my beast

My beauty my beauty
My beautiful beautiful beautiful
Beautiful beast
