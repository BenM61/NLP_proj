When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen 'cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah

She is always in my corner right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting but
I'm empty when you're gone and they say

"Do you need me?"
"Do you think I'm pretty?"
"Do I make you feel like cheatin'?"
I'm like, "No not really 'cause, ooh!
I think that I found myself a cheerleader.
She is always right there when I need her."
"Ooh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her."

Well she walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, saying "Yeah, yeah"
I'm a wizard of love and I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone

"Do you need me!?"
"Tell me do you think I'm pretty?"
"Do I make you feel like cheatin'?"
I'm like "No not really 'cause, ooh
I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her."
Ooh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader.
She is always right there when I need her."

She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, gives me

Ooh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Ooh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
