US highway from north to south.
It's history breathing.
Get out from under the gun
And drive down Highway 61.

Hannibal's son saw the Gold Rush,
Saw the Civil War done,
Then settled down some
On Highway 61.

There's no reason to feel downhearted.
There's music in the wheels.
There to be found.

Goodnight Irene in the prison walls,
Killed a man
And lived to sing about it all
Stella-twelve on Highway 61.

The immigrant son left the mining town.
Electrified the traditional
And had it out on Highway 61.

There's no reason to feel downhearted.
There's music in the wheels.
There to be found.
