Calling me, callin' me Just call my name oh... 
Calling me, callin' me Just call my name oh... 

You just call my name with a smilin' face
I think it's time I spend with you
Just call my name, just call my name
If you don't call my name, I break my heart

My heart is feeling the pain
I hear your voice, calling me
Your smile taught me how to making love
Just call my name, just call my name... 

Calling me, callin' me Just call my name oh... 
Calling me, callin' me Just call my name oh... 

I wish I was not in love with you
I'm painful... , thinkin' of you
Just call my name, just call my name
If you don't call my name, I break my heart
Just call my name... 

Just call my name... 

Calling me, calling me, calling me, calling me

Calling me, calling me, calling me... 

Calling me, callin' me Just call my name... 

Calling me, calling me... 

Just call my name
