Do you remember we traipsed around 
From pub to pound shop up through Kentish Town 
Only a fiver to our name, 
The drunk on the doorstep had more to our shame 
Living over the office had its trials 
The fights all night out there and inside 
And those stews that lasted three days into four 
And the dreaded bailiffs returned to our door, 

But we stuck with each other with all our might, 
We pulled it together and held on tight, 
And I'm glad for us yeah I'm glad mo chroi 
But it's nothing to anyone 'cept you and me 
There were wrongs for every right, 
There's ups and there's downs 
But you're the one for all my life, 
My true love I have found, yeah you my love I found 

I watched the moon cover the might of the sun, 
The weird eerie light at a quarter past one, 
And I knew in my head as I lay in my bed 
That you'd stay in my heart til the day I was dead, 
We killed each other and loved in time, 
And laughed til we almost cried, 
Yeah we cried as well when it all went to Hell, 
And my heart it broke til I swear it died 

But we stuck with each other with all our might, 
We pulled it together and held on tight, 
And I'm glad for us yeah I'm glad mo chroi 
But it's nothing to anyone except you and me 
There were wrongs for every right, 
There's ups and theres downs 
But you're the one for all my life, 
My true love I have found, yeah you my love I found 

Oh you're good at the things 
I'm hopeless at and I notice what you ignore 
But it's when I see you're not perfect for me, 
Its then I love you more and more, 

And we stuck with each other with all our might, 
We pulled it together and held real tight, 
And I'm glad for us, I'm glad mo chroi 
But it's nothing to anyone except you and me 
There were wrongs for every right, 
There's ups and there's downs 
But you're the one for all my life, 
My true love I have found, yeah you my love I found 

Ooh ooh

There were wrongs for every right, 
There's ups and there's downs 
But you're the one for all my life, 
My true love I have found, yeah you my love I found
