You've got to believe there's something inside of me
That makes me feel this way
You've got to believe that you're still a part of me
Today

But telling a tale cannot be like living it
No matter what you say
And talking of love cannot be like giving it
Away

I know
And you know
The voices are calling
Now that I have you

Whatever in the world can I do
Now that I have you
Whoever in the world could say it's not true
Now that I have you

I wonder how much of our life is memory
Remember yesterday
I'm hoping to God you don't believe everything
I say

Remebering every part of our history
A year is like a day
You've got to believe that things won't always be
This way

I know
And you know
The voices are calling
The walls are falling
For my love
And your love
I've got to keep stalling
Now that I have you

Whatever in the world can I do
Now that I have you
Whoever in the world could say it's untrue
Now that I have you
