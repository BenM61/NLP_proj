Whatever happened to the funky race?
A generation lost in pace
Wasn't life supposed to be more than this?
In this kiss I'll change your bore for my bliss

But let go of my hand and it will slip on the sand
If you don't give me the chance
To break down the walls of attitude
I ask nothing of you
Not even your gratitude

And if you think I'm corny
Then it will not make me sorry
It's your right to laugh at me
And in turn that's my opportunity
To feel brave

Because ridicule is no shame
Oh, it's just a way to eclipse hate
It's just a way to put my back straight
Oh, it's just a way to remain sane

Every morning I would see her getting off the bus
The picture never drops, it's like a multicoloured snapshot
Stuck in my brain
It kept me sane for a couple of years
As it drenched my fears
Of becoming like the others
Who become unhappy mothers
And fathers of unhappy kids
And why is that?

'Cos they've forgotten how to play
Oh, maybe they're afraid to feel ashamed
To seem strange, to seem insane
To gain weight, to seem gay
I tell you this

That it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, in this world all covered up in shame
(Oh, take it to the stage)

So, take it to the stage in a multicoloured jacket
Take it jackpot, crackpot, strutting like a peacock
Nailvarnish Arkansas, shimmy-shammy featherboah
Crackpot, haircut, dye your hair in glowing red and blue

Do, do, do what you wanna do
Don't think twice, do what you have to do
Do, do, do, do, let your heart decide
What you have to do
That's all there is to find

'Cos it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, in this world all covered up in shame
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh, in this world all covered up in shame

Oh, it takes a fool
(It takes a fool to remain sane)...
