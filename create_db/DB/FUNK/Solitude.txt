In my solitude you haunt me
With memories of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die
I sit in my chair, I feel despair
No one can be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude I pray
Dear Lord above send back my love
