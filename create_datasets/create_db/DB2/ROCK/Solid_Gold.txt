We're gonna blow people's fucking heads off
Ooh, they're gonna shit themselves
Crying out for more
Caution, wet floor
This one's going out to the fans
Hell bent for denim and leather
Notoriety and wealth
After the show
I think we both know
This fist ain't gonna bump itself

We are legends
With a power that you can't deny
We're immortal
'Cause these songs will never die

And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold

There's a guy coming down from Sony
Artist an' repertoire
If he likes what he hears in those stupid ears
I'll buy myself a faster car
He's blowing smoke up our asses
Everything we do is ace
He wants to wine and dine us, desperate to sign us
'Cause we melted his fuckin' face

We are legends
With a power that you can't deny
We're immortal
'Cause these songs will never die

And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold

Stone cold foxes screaming in the front row
Sacred promise of fellatio
Soul, it can be sold
Low and behold
Behold!

And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold

And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold, yeah
