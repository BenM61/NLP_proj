Hello, who is this
(Obscene phone caller)

I came home knocked out after work
That's when my telephone goes berserk
How can I unwind or get some rest
Receiving sick phone calls from a lonely pest

Oh, oh, oh, find someone else to bother
Mister or miss obscene phone caller
Why do get off breathing on the phone
Obscene phone caller leave me alone

Why did you have to pick me
Out of all the people in the directory
I don't know what's going through your mind
But these naughty phone calls are a waste of time

I must have my number changed
Or trace these calls from whence they came
If Alexander Bell were alive today
Would he want the telephone to be used this way

Oh, oh, oh, find someone else to bother
Mister or miss obscene phone caller
Why do get off breathing on the phone
Obscene phone caller leave me alone

Listen here
I don't understand why you're callin? me, you know
I don't know who you are, you know
You're callin? me every day, you breathe on the phone
Just let me know if you're a girl, you know
So maybe I can talk to you
You know you don't say anything but hah, hah, hah, hah

Oh, oh, oh, find someone else to bother
Mister or miss obscene phone caller
Why do get off breathing on the phone (Obscene phone caller)
Obscene phone caller leave me alone

Oh, oh, oh
(Obscene phone caller, whoa...)

Oh, oh, oh, find someone else to bother (Obscene phone caller)
Obscene phone caller
You dirty little nasty twit
