Pushing all the buttons 
trying to come to something 
flying with his feet on the ground 
full of dreams and visions 
in a world of indecision 
he ain't around to be pushed around 

been a long time coming on - take a look at him now 
and the days of If are gone - 'cause he's showing us how 

knowledge fuels the mind of the few 
in a way that no - one's found 
brave new answers screaming the truth 
and the techno wins the crown 


micro-kid with mega-thoughts 
he is real, he is here, he is fashionable 
micro-kid speaks digitalk 
if you hear what he says it's acceptable 

generating square waves 
while computing new games 
finally gets the chips off his back 
a smile is on his face 
erasing every trace 
of doubt that plagues the rest of the pack 

and his brain stores memories - no alternatives could come in 
he's the living remedy - times are better than they were then 

knowledge fuels the mind of the few 
in a way that no-one's found 
brave new answers screaming the truth 
and the techno wins the crown
