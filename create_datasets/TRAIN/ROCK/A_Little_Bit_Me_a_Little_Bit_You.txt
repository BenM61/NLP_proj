Walk out
Girl, don't you walk out, we've got things to say
Talk out
Let's have it talked out and things will be okay

Girl
I don't want to find
I'm a little bit wrong
And you're a little bit right
And I said, girl
You know that it's true
It's a little bit me (a little bit me)
And it's a little bit you, too

Don't know
Just what I said wrong but, girl, I apologize
Don't go
Here's where you belong so wipe the tears from your eyes

Girl
I don't want to find
I'm a little bit wrong
And you're a little bit right
And I said, girl
You know that it's true
It's a little bit me (a little bit me)
And it's a little bit you, too
 
Oh, girl
I don't want to find
I'm a little bit wrong
And you're a little bit right
Well, I say, girl
You know that it's true
It's a little bit me (a little bit me)
And it's a little bit you
Too
 
It's a little bit me (uh-huh, it's a little bit me)
It's a little bit you (uh-huh, it's a little bit you)
Girl, don't go, no, no, no, no, no (uh-huh, it's a little bit me)
Girl, don't go, no, no, no, no, no (uh-huh, it's a little bit you)
Hey, girl (uh-huh, it's a little bit me)
Hey, girl, please don't go (uh-huh, it's a little bit you)
