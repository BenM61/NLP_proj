Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna

I had a girl
Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be? 
Where can you be?

Now that you're gone
I'm left all alone
All by myself
To wander and roam
'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be? 
Where can you be?

Well, darlin', now that you're gone
I don't know what I'll do
All time and all my love for you

I had a girl
Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be? 
Where can you be?

Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna

Oh, Donna!
