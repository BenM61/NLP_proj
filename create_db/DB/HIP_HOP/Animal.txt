I like it

I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal

Girl, you know I'm on my way now
Girl, you know I'm on my way, my way to you

Turn the bed into a jungle

Girl, you know I'm finna hunt ya, yeah

I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal
Animal, uh huh, yeah

Twist and bend and bend and twistin' all around
Treat you like you're in danger
And this the last time that I can take you down
That National Geographic (uh huh)
Document it and record it on a film
Anybody got a camera? Uh
Oh, you wanna experiment

I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack
Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back
Do your thing, do your thing, girl, you dunno how to act
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat, ay

I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal, woah, yeah

Put my face up in the monkey (my mask)
No umbrella but the rain is pourin' down
Kill the kitty, no lion
Big mon, I'm a well up in your sea (for real)
Got your body flyin', oh
No you feelin' like a dove, give me love

I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack
Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back
Do your thing, do your thing, girl, you dunno how to act
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat (go)

I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, yeah, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal, woah
