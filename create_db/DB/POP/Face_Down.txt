Lost in amidst this false reality 
Don't feel a thing anymore 
On your knees and begging 
Face down on the floor 

CHORUS : 
You try to fade into the background 
But you're always seen 
Face down  hit the ground 
You know you can't stay here anymore 
Crooked  tangled 
A heap of nothingness 
Lying there in shambles  a burning ball of stress 

CHORUS : 
You try to fade into the background 
Afraid of the hunter 
Face down, hit the ground 
You know you can't stay here anymore 
Silence comes, like darkness to the night 
Alone and peaceful 
There's no one to hurt you where you are now 
Safe from evil 
See the pain dwelling in your eyes 
Won't be long now 

CHORUS : 
You try to fade into the background 
Afraid of the hunter 
Face down, hit the ground 
One last breath
