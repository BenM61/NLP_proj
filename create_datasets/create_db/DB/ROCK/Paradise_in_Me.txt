Consuming far too much 
Ignoring the will to touch 
The ones who don't have food at all
I'm breathing 

I'm wondering how 
We watch Wheel of Fortune now 
I close my eyes and try to see 
A piece of paradise in me 

Beat me up 
And smash my brand new TV 
To help me look for 
A little piece of paradise in me 

I'm dancing  I'm writing songs 
About what bothers me the most 
About those who can't dance at all
I'm only jumping 

I'm only freaking out 
And I wonder what it's all about 
To close my eyes and finally see 
A piece of paradise in me 

Beat me up 
And smash my brand new TV 
To help me look for 
A little piece of paradise in me 

A little piece of paradise in me
