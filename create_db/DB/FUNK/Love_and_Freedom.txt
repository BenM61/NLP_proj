Freedom, freedom, (love) and freedom, freedom
Oohmm, freedom, talk about love 
Freedom, we talk about freedom
Freedom, we talk about freedom

Everybody needs a secret place, where defenses are down, fear cannot be found
Doesn't matter what the case may be, you will always be around, yes permanently

We are talking love, we are talking about you and me
How you unlocked my heart and set me free, now I am living and feeling once again

We are talking love, when you touched me I felt completely yours
I will always cherish and adore, good to know when you're found forevermore

I found freedom, freedom
Its, love, freedom, we talk about freedom

You know freedom stands for liberty, to say how you feel, what you believe
And even where there are times I am clearly wrong 
Still, you whisper my name and you hold me in your arms

We are talking love, when you touched me I felt completely yours 
I will always cherish and adore, good to know when you're found forevermore

I found freedom, freedom 
It's, love, freedom, we talk about freedom

Can you! 
Now can you imagine? Amidst of the ocean (oh yeah) 
And you trapped by a raging sea 

Its' just a description of a truth that has happened, then love came and rescued me 
(Yes we're talking) love 

Oh my oh my

We are talking love, we are talking about you and me
How you unlocked my heart and set me free, now I am living and feeling once again

We are talking love, when you touched me I felt completely yours
I will always cherish and adore, good to know when you're found forevermore

Yes, are talking love, we are talking about you and me
How you unlocked my heart and set me free, now I am living and feeling once again

We are talking love, when you touched me I felt completely yours
I will always cherish and adore, good to know when you're found forevermore

Talking love, we talk about you and me, you unlock my heart and set me free

Love is kind, love is patient, love is everything I need
So please don't take it away, we can talk about it cause we have love
