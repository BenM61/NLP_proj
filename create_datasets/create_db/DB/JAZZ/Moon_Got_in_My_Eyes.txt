Out of the darkness you suddenly appeared
You smiled and I was taken by surprise
I guess I should have seen right through you
But the moon got in my eyes

I was so thrilled by the love you volunteered
I gave my heart without a compromise
I guess you don't remember, do you?
When the moon got in my eyes

I thought a kingdom was in sight
That I would have the right to claim
But with the morning's early light
I didn't have a dream to my name

You know the saying all who love are blind
It seems that ancient adage still applies
I guess I should have seen right through you
But the moon got in my eyes

I thought a kingdom was in sight
That I would have the right to claim
But with the morning's early light
I didn't have a dream to my name

It seems that ancient adage still applies
I guess I should have seen right through you
But the moon got in my eyes
