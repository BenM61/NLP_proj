I belong to your heart, 
You alone can possess me
No one else can caress me, 
I belong to your heart.

I belong to your heart, 
With devotion, and seeing
Every part of my being 
Is a part of your heart

And when you reach out for me 
Your two arms are a magnet
And I'm caught in the dragnet,
Oh, but who wants to be free?

And when you kiss me, I know,
That for now and all time
I just have to be yours, my love,
You just have to be mine.

I belong to your heart,
Like the sun to the day,
Like the stars to the night
I belong to your heart, oh,

As I kneel at your throne
Say you'll love me alone;
Let me hear from your heart, 
My love, that I belong.
