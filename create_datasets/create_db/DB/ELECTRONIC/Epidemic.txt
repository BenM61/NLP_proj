Infect the world with your epidemic
Flood the earth, consume the sky
Let it flow from your holy spirit
Then exalt his name on high

It's yours, it's mine
It's spreading over all mankind
When it's over you will see
This epidemic is eternity

And now you've seen through my eyes
And it's over
I don't know how to disguise
That it's over
And now you've taken my life
And it's over
I know you want to be mine
But it's over
It's over now

Spread the epidemic
