Hello well my name is 
You look pretty can I join you 
Let me buy you a few drinks then we can go oh oh 
I know this little place 
Where we can boogie on the tables 
You'll go oooh baby 

And then a little later 
When we've finished with the tables 
Well I know this special place where we can go oh oh 
I'll be waiting for you 
In the back room with the lights off 
You'll say oooh baby 

Don't let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 

Cause baby we are driving 
On the fast lane of this road 
And if there's one thing you should know 
Then darling never, never let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 
Don't you ever let me... 

I'll love you in the morning 
In the evening when were legless 
We'll have drugged up funky lovin' me and you oh oh 
And you can make me breakfast 
Whilst I'm busy in the bathroom, yeah 
No or maybe 

And sometime in the future 
I'll be thinking of our romance 
How we didn't give a f*ck just who we might offend 
And do you still remember how we boogie woogie woogied 
You said oooh baby 

Don't let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 

Cause baby we are driving 
On the fast lane of this road 
And if there's one thing you should know 
Then darling never, never let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 
Don't you ever let me... 

Never ever, never ever 
Never ever, don't you ever 
Never ever, never ever 
Never ever, now don't you ever 
Never ever, never ever 
Never ever, now don't you ever 
Never ever, never ever 
Never ever, don't you ever 

Don't you ever let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go! 
Don't you ever let me go!
