Holding on, holding on

Every round she sings
When it's time for war
Every rising sun
Has a right to go down

Holding on, holding on

Every honey bee
Gets some peace of mind
Every lovely guest
Gets a glass of fine wine
So make some little babies

Holding on, holding on
Love, love
Love love love love love
I do love
Love, love
I fucking love you, I fucking love you
I do

I'm not fooling anyone
A few more 'til the world is ready
It won't be sick anymore
As long as that's what keeps you happy

Holding on, holding on
Love, love
Love love love love love
I do love
Love, love
I fucking love you, I fucking love you
I do
