When first I saw the love light in your eye
I dreamt the world had not but joy for me
And even though we drifted far apart
I never dream, but when I dream of thee

I love you as I never loved before
Since first I met you on the village green
Come to me or my dream of love is over
I love you as I loved you
When you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen

Come to me or my dream of love is over
I love you as I loved you
When you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen
