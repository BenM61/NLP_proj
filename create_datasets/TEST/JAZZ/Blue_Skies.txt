So these are the figurines
Acting out all the scenes before my eyes
I thought I knew them all by name
But they started looking much the same
And it's no surprise

But I don't wanna listen
Too much
How can I give up on all the days I know I've won
There's nothing but rainbows
I believe in the shadows

Now honey
Thought I might be dropping out
But now I am gonna work it out
I am gonna work with me
I am runnin' like it looser
Then I'm rolling like sea rusty ship on a stormy sea

You know that people are saying
Strange things

Talk to the hand 'cause I know you think the face is gone

I don't wanna listen
Too much
I'm not gonna give up on all the days I know I've won
There's nothing but blue sky
There's nothing but blue sky

Nothings gonna stop me now
I am skimming like a skipping stone on a silver lake
I take it when the chips are down
But to play the perfect happy clown
You gotta make a mistake (gotta make mistakes)

People are saying
Strange things
And I don't wanna listen (i don't wanna listen)
Too much yeah

Nothing but blue sky
Blue sky

How can I tell you I know this wont be the last song
I don't wanna listen (i don't wanna listen)
Too much
Not gonna give up on the days I know I've won

That's where I am going
'Cause there is nothing nothing but blue sky
That's where I am going
Nothing but
Rainbows falling down on me uh yeah heyyy

Nothing but blue sky
Can't you see
That's where I am going
Got to believe me
That's where I am going
