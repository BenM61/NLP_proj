If I find peace of mind in the sand and the sea
There's a hope in my heart that you'll soon be with me
There's a prayer that I share with the sand and the sea
And it cries "Come to me, come to me."

As my eyes search the skies from the edge of the shore
You are here in my arms for a moment or more
Then a tear rushes down to the sand and the sea
And it cries "Come to me, come to me."

But as long as there's sand, as long as there's sea
As long as there's time I'll wait hopefully
As long as there's heaven up above
Let the sand and the sea bring my love to me

But as long as there's sand, as long as there's sea
As long as there's time I'll wait hopefully
As long as there's heaven up above
Let the sand and the sea bring my love to me
