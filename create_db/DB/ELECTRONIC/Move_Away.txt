Moving moving 
Move away , move away
Spirit changed the conversation 
Stepping stones across the land 

I never wanted to be a hero 
I never wanted to be a man 
I hurt you darling 
I made you cry 
I hurt you darling 
Don't ask me why 

Move move move away from me darling 
I never said I'd hold your hand 
Move move move away from me darling 
I never said I'd understand 
If I could say this was judgment day 
You know I'd be a millionaire 

I'm prepared to wear my sorrow
Everywhere we go in town
Ain't no need to beg or borrow
While you're there to drag me down

I hurt you darling
I made you cry
I hurt you darling
Don't ask me why, oh yeah

Move, move, move away from me darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move, move, move away from me darling
I never said I'd understand
If I could say this was judgment day
You know I'd be a millionaire, yeah, yeah

Just right
Move away
I need you so
I can't let go

I hurt you darling
I made you cry
I hurt you darling
Don't ask me why, oh why

Move, move, move away from me darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move, move, move away from me darling
I never said I'd understand
Move, move, move away from me darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
If I could say this was judgment day
I'd be a millionaire, oh yeah

Move, move away
I never said that I'd hold your hand
Move, move, move, away
Why don't you move?
I never said I'd understand
Move, move away
Move, move, move, away
Why don't you move away?
Move away
Why don't you move away?
