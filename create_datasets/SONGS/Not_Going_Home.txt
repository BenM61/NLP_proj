Ain't I lost to your eyes?
Ever to your fire
Tell me where you're going
Tell me where you're out tonight
I go all laserlights when you're by my side
Everything I do now
Just tell me if you're out tonight

Oh I've been dancin'
On my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
Oh I've been dancin'
On my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
I'm not going home
I'm not going home

We're still up so late out
Deep down in the night
Even when the light's down
Tell me if you're looking out
I go all laserlights if you come around
Everything I do now
Just tell me if you're out tonight

(Tonight)

You know I'm up in the air, lonely firefly
I know oh, you're going somewhere
Don't, don't leave me there

Oh I've been dancin'
On my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
Oh I've been dancin'
On my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
I'm not going home
I'm not going home

Oh I've been dancin'
On my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
(I'm not going home)
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
