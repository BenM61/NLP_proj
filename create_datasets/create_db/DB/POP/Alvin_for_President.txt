Did you call me?

Alvin, you can't be President.

Why?

Well, because you're too young, and-

In addition, when I'm president...

Alvin be quiet and sing our new song. Now here are the words.

"Polite,"

Polite,

"We hardly ever fight,"

We hardly ever fight,

"We live in harmony,"

That's better.
"Don't care if we live in a tent,"

Alvin!

And, another thing, dear friends. Why shouldn't we have a penny ice cream
Cone?

Uh, I don't know!

Theodore, you can be my campaign manager.

Oh boy, your honor!

And Simon, I believe I'll make you vice-president!

Just as long as Alvin's President!

That's me!

Send Alvin,

Alvin, will you

I am certain you will elect me the next President of the United States of
America!

We want Alvin!
We want Alvin!
We want Alvin!
