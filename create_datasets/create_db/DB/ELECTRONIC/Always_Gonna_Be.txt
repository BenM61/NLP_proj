Over night
Better love
Energy, I just let it go
Switched in light
Told myself, soon we'll all be dust

I can breathe
Got my freedom
Won't believe, all we know is no one knows
I'm at peace, and that's more than enough

'Cause there's always gonna be, always gonna be something
Always gonna be something standing in your way
'Cause there's always gonna be, always gonna be something
Always gonna be something standing in your way

That's right
That's right

'Cause there's always gonna be, always gonna be something
Always gonna be something standing in your way
'Cause there's always gonna be, always gonna be something
Always gonna be something standing in your way

'Cause there's always gonna be, always gonna be something
Always gonna be something standing in your way
'Cause there's always gonna be, that's why I never let nothing
Why I never let nothing standing in my way

Hey
We get lost sometimes
'Cause there's a world of excuses, excuses
To regret life is useless

I said hey yeh yeah
We get lost sometimes
'Cause there's a world of excuses, excuses
Your investment is useless

'Cause there's always gonna be, always gonna be something
Always gonna be something standing in your way
'Cause there's always gonna be, always gonna be something
Always gonna be something standing in your way

That's right
That's right

In my way baby, in my way baby
In my way yeah oh
In my way baby, in my way baby
In my way yeah oh

In my way baby, in my way baby
In my way yeah oh
In my way baby, in my way baby
In my way yeah oh

That's right
That's right
That's right
That's right
That's right
