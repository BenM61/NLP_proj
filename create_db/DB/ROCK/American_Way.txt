Truth and honor faith and pride all convictions surely died honesties
Time has passed time for lies is here at last truth is false I'm so fed up
How did we come to be so fucked hate fear pain death all our country
Has got left

Talk to children hear them say daddy left again today brother steals and
Mommy lies future lost before their eyes the sun was lost behind the
Clouds they rapped it up and blacked it out acid rain fell today it came
And washed our hopes away

This was once the land of dreams now these dreams have turned to
Greed in the midst of all this wealth the poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy no one said that freedom's free lady liberty rots
Away no truth, no justice the American way

Don't look past your t.v. all of us are what you see a looking glass into
Our lives what we watch is what we buy priorities are out of whack
Who is next to stab our back doesn't it make you mad to have lost all that
We've had

This was once the land of dreams now these dreams have turned to
Greed in the midst of all this wealth the poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy no one said that freedom's free lady liberty rots
Away no truth, no justice the American way

Doesn't it fill you with disgust that there's no one left to trust is this
Happening is this real my body numb I cannot feel are you happy are you
Sad are emotions a thing of the past I have no tears I cannot cry no one
Mourns for a world that's died

This was once the land of dreams now these dreams have turned to
Greed in the midst of all this wealth the poor are left to help themselves
A capitalist's democracy no one said that freedom's free lady liberty rots
Away no truth, no justice the American way
