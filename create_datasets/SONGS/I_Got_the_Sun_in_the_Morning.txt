Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't
What do I find? The things I got will keep me satisfied
Checking up on what I have and what I haven't
What do I find? A healthy balance on the credit side

Got no diamonds, got no pearls
Still I think I'm a lucky girl
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion, got no yacht
Still I'm happy with what I've got
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night

Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no cheque books, got no banks
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening
I'm all right

De-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

De-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no cheque books, got no banks
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning, moon in the evening
I'm doing all right
Doing all right
Doing all right
I'm doing all right
