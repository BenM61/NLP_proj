Listen,
Is everything such a thrill?
Even dipping your fingers in somebody's till?
Heaven,
If there is such a place,
It wouldn't host the likes of your guilty face.

Well, does it feel better stealing cars?
When will it end, killing people in bars?
Is there nothing in your head
That will make you stop dead?
Is there nothing at all
To make your barrier fall,
Your barrier fall?

You never thought I'd catch you out
You never took the time
To cover up your dirty tracks
So now the choice is mine
You never thought I'd catch you out
You never took the time
To cover up your dirty tracks
Someday the public's fine

It happens
When you take those thrills
You have to lie and cheat to get your pills

Well, does it feel better that you're on Mars?
Or would you prefer to stealing cars?
Is there nothing in your head
That will make you stop dead?
Is there nothing at all
To make your barrier fall,
Your barrier fall?

You never thought I'd catch you out
You never took the time
To cover up your dirty tracks
So now the choice is mine
You never thought I'd catch you out
You think the public's fine
To cover up your dirty tracks
So now the choice is mine

You're only running away
Making it easier for today
Do you have full control
Of everything you do or say?
You're only running away
Making it easier for today
Do you have full control,
Of everything, of everything?
Everything

Running away, running away, running away, running away,
Running away, running away, running away, running away,
Running away, running away, running away, run!
