Can you feel me slide in? 
Can you hear your blood pound? 
I will think of you in pieces 
I will picture us found my filthy mouth, 
Well it makes my mom proud 

I will bask in or disaster if it'll phase us out 
Hey Carmelina target practice is for Mexico 
And I've become spectacular which is strange 
Because I feel dumb can you feel me glide in? 
Can you make the pig sound? 

I will think of you above me always 
I will picture us clowns my filthy mouth, 
Well it hides my clean selves 
I will bask in my disaster maybe it'll phase me out (here's to it)
