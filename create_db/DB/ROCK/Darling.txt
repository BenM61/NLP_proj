Why do you go to all the trouble
When you know what comes next
And when you're wishing you had just stayed home
What did you expect?

I woke up Sunday morning
Back where I belong
The chorus only interrupts
I sing to serve the song

All this hibernation
Has only left me tired
I feel I'd rather not leave the station
But lately I'm inspired

I woke up Sunday morning
Back where I belong
The chorus only interrupts
I sing to serve the song
