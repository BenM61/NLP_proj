Come over, spend a little time) 
Come over, spend a little time with me sometime 
Boy, you'd better let me know that you still want to be mine 
You know it doesn't cost that much 
We really ought to stay in touch 
So come over, baby come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime 

Come over, sit by & hold my hand just one night 
Then maybe my folks will feel everything is still all right 
It's lonely here & I'm alone 
Waiting by a silent phone 
So come over, baby come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime 

With my lonely lonely heart 
Baby, we shouldn't be apart 
So come over, baby come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime 

Come over, spend a little time with me sometime 
How long must I wait for you to make up your mind? 
I'm sitting on a shelf all by myself 
Don't kettle me bound, bored with nobody else 
So won't you please come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime 
My baby, won't you come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime? 
...& fade
