Me and you, nothing to do
What am I gonna do with you?
Go on an' dance, how's the chance
You and I gon' make romance?

'Cause that's the kind of rockin' I need
Takes a pinch and a bite and squeeze
Down on my knees
Well come on girl take a chance with me
A good ol' romance dance for me

Well I loved my way through the South one day
Runnin' scared all along the way
Wandering, looking to hide
Decided to head for the Mexico line

I had nothing going for me but my shoes
When I ran into this girl from Juarez
Didn't care who or from where I came
Don't matter where in the world you goin'
When it comes to lovin' it's all the same
(All the same)
All the same, and it's so insane
But I can't complain

What I need to be happy
A pretty girl in a lonely town
What I got to do to you
To get you to do the mess around?

'Cause that's the kind of rockin' I need
Takes a pinch and a bite and squeeze
I'm down on my knees
Well come on girl take a chance with me
A good ol' romance, no pants dance for me

[Incomprehensible]
