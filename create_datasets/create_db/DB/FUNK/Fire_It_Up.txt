My hair might be a little to long
For your taste my friend
My car might cost a little less
Then that suit your wearing
I'm glad you stumbled in here on your business trip
Before you close your tab
Remember I play for tips
Well I bet your wife is beautiful
And you're a really big so-and-so
Well I'm not doing bad myself
Hey friend don't you know

I play guitar
And I sing my songs in the sunshine
Captain and cokes and bar room jokes
Keep me feeling fine
And there's always a stage
And a beautiful babe to squeeze my lime
In my simple way
Guess you could say
I'm living in the big time

I know I'll probably never make a million bucks
But saving accounts and the IRS
Never worry me much
I don't need that stuff
Cause I've got friends like you
To buy me drinks, and boats and planes that I can use
I know your really living
In that house up on the hill
So if you feel like giving
Friend I've got a jar to fill

I play guitar
And I sing my songs in the sunshine
Captain and cokes and bar room jokes
Keep me feeling fine
And there's always a stage
And a beautiful babe to squeeze my lime
In my simple way
Guess you could say
I'm living in the big time


I'm having the time of my life
No worries on my mind
Everything's just fine
Today is even better than yesterday
Everything's going my way
I'm living in the big time

And there's always a stage
And a beautiful babe to squeeze my lime
In my simple way
Guess you could say
I'm living in the big time

in my simple way
Guess you could say
I'm living in the big time
