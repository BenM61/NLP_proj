Don't cry
Just let it pass you by
Ill be by your side
Each and everyday

Let go
You gotta lose control
Teach you how to roll
Never be the same

Cause am wasted
Face down on the floor
Can't take anymore
Gave it all away 
Lately I can't find the eyes
Help me realize
That am in love
Am in love am in love

Losing, am losing all my faith
I can't stand the days
That am alone
Tell me do you feel the same
And are you glad I came
Can I walk you home

Cause am wasted
Face down on the floor
Can't take anymore
Gave it all away 
Lately I can't find the eyes
Help me realize
That am in love
Am in love am in love

Your face my place 
Your face my place
Your face my place at night
