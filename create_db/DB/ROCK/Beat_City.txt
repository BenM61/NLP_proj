Want to die in beat city and run, run, run 
Want to hang with girls and shoot my gun 
Want to catch the rays off the sun 
Want to drink and drive and have some fun 

Want to die in beat city and go, go, go 
You can't come with me cause you're just too slow 
Inject the stars make them glow 
Put up a fight and put on a show 

Want to die in beat city 
Want to die in beat city 
Want to die in beat city 
Want to die in beat city
