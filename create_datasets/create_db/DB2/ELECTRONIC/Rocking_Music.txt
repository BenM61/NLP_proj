All the time
I've been searching for new definition
It is time
To come back and leave behind my inhibition
Ease your mind
This is how I'll pretend to be in favor

Take your time
And relax, keep fall in this trend dancer

I want you too
Listen to me
Rocking music
Set you free
I want you too
Get inside
Rocking music
Ease your mind

Wanna see your body groovin' on
Wanna see your body!
Really want to rock your body
Eh eh eh

All the time
Hesitation is what took me so long
It is time
To see where the power bright no more

In my file
I deserve a little relaxation
You look fine
But before I guarantee the satisfaction

I want you too!

I want you too
Listen to me
Rocking music
Set you free

I want you too
Get inside
Rocking music
Ease your mind
Ease your mind
Ease your mind

I think I got you babe
I can see the fire burning
I can see the fire burning
I can see the fire burning
I think I got you
To my rocking music

I think I got you babe
I can see the fire burning
I can see the fire burning
I can see the fire burning

I think I got you
To my rocking music

Eh, no no no oh
Rocking Music
In your mind, in your mind
