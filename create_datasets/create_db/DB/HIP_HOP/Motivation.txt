Better get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)
Nigga, get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)
Haters better get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (It's motivation)
Sucker nigga, get on yo job, if ya, hatin' get on yo job, nigga

You can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever
Anything don't kill me, make me better
I ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedda
And the game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter
Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't forever
I got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer
I'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killers
I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga
I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla
Even if I'ma all alone or standin' with four niggas
Tell'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer
5'9" with the soul of a 6'4" nigga
I separated the fakes, paralyzed from the waist down
From the real stand up guys of the A-Town
Can't even look me in my eyes, put yo face down
I'm outta jail nigga, what you gotta say now?

Motivation
Niggas fakin' only gonna inspire (Motivation)
All yo hatin' in fuel to my fire (It's motivation)
Niggas plottin' on the crown slowly drpopin' (It's motivation)
Hey but I ain't slowin' down and I ain't stoppin' (Motivation)
Now nigga don't stop my show (Motivation)
You ain't know I don't stop, I go (It's motivation)
Sucker niggas can't make me suffer
Just make me stronger and make me tougher (It's motivation)

To be locked in a box niggas happy to see
Put anybody on top, any rapper but T, I, P
But back to reality G, hoe D still carryin' me, nigga I run this
Spread yo rumors, kick all yo lil' dumb shit
Tell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm goin' get
If it make you feel better, picture me over and done with
Punk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with
Small thing to a giant, I can overcome this
Jail, I don' done this, rap I'm just havin' fun with
I could be a local joker, never have one hit
Nigga, "New Finish" alone'll get me dumb rich
While these rappers sellin' records gettin' pennies
If Grand Hustle sell any, I'ma get plenty
If God with me, who could be against me sucker?
Can't make me suffer, just make me tougher
