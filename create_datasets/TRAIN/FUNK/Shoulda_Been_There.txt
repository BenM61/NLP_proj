They say you never know what you got 'til it's gone
You shoulda been there, now she's singing this song

Before this go wrong, we should take a break
'Cause you feel like you know, you know everything
Before I go and say some things I'm gonna regret to you
I'mma call up my ladies, and tell them how you drove me crazy

They say the club is going up tonight, we up in there
Pour another cup tonight, cause, we up in there
If you didn't want them all on me, you shoulda been there
So why the hell you calling me, you shoulda been there, been there
So we gonna ball, ball out, gonna ball out, oh
My whip clean, my fit new, oh
Going up tonight, we up in there
So nigga don't be calling me, calling me
You shoulda been there

I've been on my own (I've been on my own)
I know how to play (I know how to play)
But in this Game of Thrones you 'bout to lose your queen
'Cause I've been holding up to try and work this out with you
You can't respect that
So I called up my ladies, and told them how you drove me crazy

They say the club is going up tonight, we up in there
Pour another cup tonight, cause, we up in there
If you didn't want them all on me, you shoulda been there
So why the hell you calling me, you shoulda been there, been there
So we gonna ball, ball out, gonna ball out, oh
My whip clean, my fit new, oh
Going up tonight, we up in there
So nigga don't be calling me, calling me
You shoulda been there

I put the "D" in Decatur
Yeah, it's three in the morning but I still got three in the chamber
I bring her to life with that D call that a defibrillator
Ha, niggas is funny, they all got jokes Cedric "D" Entertainer
But we can't see the haters, there's way too much cheese on the table
Aye, so, so, so what's the likelihood, you looking mmmm lip biting good
They say you never really know what you got 'til it's gone
You shoulda been there now she's singing this song

They say the club is going up tonight, we up in there
Pour another cup tonight, cause, we up in there
If you didn't want them all on me, you shoulda been there
So why the hell you calling me, you shoulda been there, been there
So we gonna ball, ball out, gonna ball out, oh
My whip clean, my fit new, oh
Going up tonight, we up in there
So nigga don't be calling me, calling me
You shoulda been there

Sevyn Streeter, Bobby Ray
You wasn't there, I took your place
