No thought, no breath, no eyes, no heart

Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something

This dark and secret crime
Cruelty masked as something kind
Sharp against the tenderness
Cold against the emptiness

Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something

Split open to the wound
Send another saviour soon
Eyes closed, torn apart
Body separate from the heart

You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin

Held down on the bed
This is what I think he said
The face of Jesus hung above
I will teach you how to love

You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin

And I can find you anywhere
Even if you run from there
Eyes closed, torn apart
Body separate from the heart

Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something

Balance reaches beyond itself to lay hold of intelligence
So that it's satisfactions brought to the surface of consciousness
May become profounder more intense and more compelling
Violent, we take a step away from awareness
And by striving to grasp the significance of our own violent impulses
We move further away from the frenzied raptures violence instigates

Everyone I see is missing something
Everyone I see is missing something

Burned with a cigarette
Some things you don't forget
Well trained in going numb
Well prepared for what's to come

You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin

No thought, no breath, no eyes, no heart

In order to reach the limits of the ecstasy in which we lose ourselves in bliss
You must set an immediate boundary
Pain can carry me nearer to the moment
Bring me to a state of bliss bordering on delerium

No thought, no breath, no eyes, no heart

And I can find you anywhere
Even if you run from there
Eyes closed, torn apart
Body separate from the heart

You wouldn't notice I have no skin
You wouldn't notice I have no skin
