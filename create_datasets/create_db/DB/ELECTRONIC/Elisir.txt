Love
Love for me
Is love
Love for me
I call your name
I keep on looking for you
And I don't know
Don't know where go where

Can set over night
I keep so over me
There is no way
The way to stop me falling

Believe in me
I can set you free a night
You never Elisir enough

Oh, no
Something's thinking over me

Your love
Your love
Your love is on my mind

Your love is for me
