If I could keep you underneath my wing
The sky above you, safe from everything
Under, under my wing

To watch you breathing is all that I can do
To see you smile, my only wish come true
I'm living, living for you

The waves roll in, I help you swim
You take my hand
And through the years and through the fears
I'll be your rock, the motherland

The bond is written, the animal in me
I'd lay my life down, I'd give it happily
I'd give it, I'd give it for you

The waves roll in, I help you swim
You take my hand
And through the years and through the fears
I'll be your rock, the motherland
