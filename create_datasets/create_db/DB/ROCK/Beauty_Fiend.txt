It's true, I've got demons inside me

And sometimes they need to speak
My dark places make me feel ugly
My lips are glossed but my heart is weak
I'm diseased
As seen on TV
Please forgive me
For not being pretty
Or sexy
But god never blessed me
Here's what you'll find
Next time you undress me 

Scars
Wounds
I'm
Bruised 

Watch me bleed
I'm your beauty
Watch me bleed
Beauty fiend

Once again
Without perfect teeth
I begin
The dream as I sleep
Soon I've sinned
My skin is still thick
My mouth as always
Is brutally honest
At my calmest
I'm tired of explaining
How it feels
To be exploited
And rated
Number one, two or seventeen
F*ck what they print in those damn magazines

Scars
Wounds
I'm
Used 

Watch me bleed
I'm no beauty
Watch me bleed
Beauty queen

Watch me bleed
I'm your beauty
Watch me bleed
Beauty fiend

Stuck inside this mask of mine
There's no place for me to hide
Won't you please come suck me dry
Don't touch me
Don't fucking touch me
Don't touch me... why?
Can't you see beyond my skin
Size, my shape, my ass, my tits
I am not your pretty face
I'm just a girl
The girl you love to hate! 

Watch me bleed
I'm no beauty
Watch me bleed
Beauty queen
Watch me bleed
I'm the beauty
Watch me bleed
Beauty fiend

Why can't you see beyond my skin
Size, my shape, my ass, my tits
I am not your pretty face
I'm just a girl
The girl you love to hate! 

Stuck inside this mask of mine
There's no place for me to hide
Won't you please come suck me dry
Don't
Don't you fucking touch me pig!
