Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Where's my samurai

I've been searching for a man 
All across Japan
Just to find, to find my samurai
Someone who is strong
But still a little shy
Yes I need, I need my samurai

Ay, ay, ay
I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colours in the sky
Ay, ay, ay, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colours in the sky

I've been searching in the woods
And high upon the hills
Just to find, to find my samurai
Someone who won't regret
To keep me in his net
Yes I need, I need my samurai

Ay, ay, ay
I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colours in the sky
Ay, ay, ay, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colors in the sky

Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Where's my samurai?

Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Where's my samurai?

Ay, ay, ay
I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colors in the sky

Ay, ay, ay
I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colors in the sky

Ay, ay, ay
I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colors in the sky

Ay, ay, ay
I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colors in the sky

Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Where's my samurai?

Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Ay, iyaiyai
Where's my samurai?

Ay, ay, ay I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue
Make the colors in the sky
