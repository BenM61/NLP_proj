I got dreams, dreams to remember
I got dreams, dreams to remember

Honey I saw you there last night
Another man's arms holding you tight
Nobody knows how I felt inside
All I know is I walked away and cried

I got dreams, dreams to remember
Dreams to remember

[Chorus:]
I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw you kiss him again and again
These eyes of mine they don't fool me
Why did he hold you so tenderly ?

I got dreams, dreams to remember
Dreams to remember
I got dreams, dreams to remember

I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway
I don't want you to ever leave
Girl, you just satisfy me

[Chorus]

I got dreams, dreams to remember
Ooh dreams
Broken dreams
Don't help each other
Bad dreams
Dreams to remember

Dreams to remember
Dreams to remember
Dreams to remember
Dreams to remember
Dreams to remember
Dreams to remember
