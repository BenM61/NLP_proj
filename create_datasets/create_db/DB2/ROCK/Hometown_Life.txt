I know you've waited for me here so long
To see me since I've been gone
And so as these years roll on
I always come back to where I belong
My hometown life

And have you noticed every way I've changed
'Cause to me I've simply stayed the same
But every time I walk away
You leave a little piece of you inside of me
And made me who I am today

My hometown life
Its spirits inside
My hometown tonight
Is filled with the light unfaded
That I created
My hometown tonight oooh

I walk around these streets
And stare at the things that remind me of me
I take it all inside and breathe in the air
Thats so unclean, yet keeps me alive
My hometown tonight oooh

My hometown life 
My hometown life
Its spirits inside
My hometown tonight
Is filled with the light unfaded
That I created
My hometown tonight 
My hometown life
My hometown tonight 
My hometown life
