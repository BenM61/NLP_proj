Is this how
You were found?
Like a star fallen
To the ground?

As you fall
You make no sound
As you fall
Wish for a place where you want to be

Lying still
Flowers all around
In my dreams I see you
Falling down

So is this how (is this how)
You were found?
Like a star fallen
To the ground?

As you fall
You make no sound
As you fall
Wish for a place where you want to be
