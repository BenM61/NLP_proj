Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rapped rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time
Jack B. Nimble, what, nimble, and he was quick
But Jam Master was faster, Jack saw Jay's dick
Now little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice stilled her hunger in Wonderland
Jack Jill busta in his hand
And Jam Master Jay is making out our sound
The turntables might wobble but they don't fall down

I got the juice and Mother Goose both did that thing
Jam Master's gettin' loose and DMC's the king
Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay, king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timin' when I'm climbin', I'm a rhymin' apparatus
When he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix, real quick, and I'd like to say
He's not fat, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It goes a one, two, three and

Jay's like King Midas, as I was told
Everything that he touched, turned to gold
He's the greatest of the great, get it straight he's great
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say
"Goddamn, that DJ made my day!"
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were his, he would be you
I'm not lying, y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie, my nose will grow
Like the little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story goes!

Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
He's the big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's the big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good!

There it is

We're Run-DMC, got a beat to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat, other get thinner
Jump on Jay like cows on moons
People take Jay like dish and spoon
Hands like all, first hails aim
You'll see Jay again my friend!
Huh!
