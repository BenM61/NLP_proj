I'm just as fucked up as they say
I can't fake the daytime
Found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
It's an outsider's escape for a broken heart

We hide out in the back
Like shadows in a stranger's dream
Hiding out in the back together
Hiding out in the back forever

I'll make
All that I believe
In dreams
So real
Faith I have to take the call
Faith don't fail me now

I'll make
All that I believe
I set myself free
So take all the time you need
And let yourself be

I'm as fucked up as they say
I can't fake the daytime
Found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
An outsider's escape for a broken heart

I'm as fucked up as they say
I can't fake the daytime
Found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
An outsider's escape for a broken heart
