Remember noah wrought his ship a long, long time ago
It's blessed that he ever did
No one believed his warnings, laughing, shrugging
Shoulders
Asking: 'is there any need of it?'

They found out they were wrong and he was right
As the waters rose the cresting tide sealed their fate

It's such an old but true cliche to say our days our
Numbered
Life for us is really through
There's only one way out and that's to build a
Spaceship
God knows where it's gonna lead us to

I'll be your captain, leader, hero, saint, guide and
King
The one who had this brilliant idea
I'll be happy to accept all medals
For having saved all millions following me

It's such an old but true cliche to say our days our
Numbered
Life for us is really through
There's only one way out and that's to build a
Spaceship
God knows where it's gonna lead us to

We'll sail the second ark, tickets are cheap
You can always choose a window seat if you wish
Let other people snicker, silly fools
When they come to grip with nature's rules, we'll be
Gone

Are you still asking me if I would take the risk
You must have lost your mind
It may be the chance for a lifetime

We'll sail the second ark, tickets are cheap
You can always choose a window seat if you wish
Let other people snicker, silly fools
When they come to grip with nature's rules, we'll be
Gone

Are you still asking me if I would take the risk
You must have lost your mind
It may be the chance for a lifeline
