All you heard for years in Ireland
Was the "Wearin' Of The Green"
But the biggest change that's come in Ireland
I have ever seen

All the laddies and the cooies
Laid aside their Irish reels
And I was born in Ireland
(Ha, Ha), so imagine how I feels

Now Ireland's gone Black Bottom crazy
See them dance; you ought to see them dance
Folks supposed to be related, even dance
I mean they dance

They play that strain
Works right on their brain
Now it goes Black Bottom
A new rhythm's drivin' the folks insane

I hand you no blarney when I say
That song really goes
And they put it over with a wow
I mean now

All over Ireland
You can see the people dancin' it
'Cause Ireland's gone Black Bottom crazy
