My confession
I'll steal anything in sight or sound
My confession
This is the sound of fear
And I'll fall down

I don't need it
If you're gonna leave then do it soon
I don't need it
Everything you've ever seen
I've seen before

Leave her to me
Leave her to me

I don't suppose you ever laughed at me
Your fascination leaves me cold
I don't suppose you ever loved at all

I don't need it
I don't need it

If you want it
Every little girl is welcome here
