It was love at first sight 
on the second of july 
Met her on the third floor 
Four times in one night 
It was a little bit of magic 
And the time stood still 
She took me to another side 
she got the key to my will 

Tell me how could such a good thing only last... 
One, two three, four 
Five days once in a lifetime 
Five nights 
Too good to be true 
The universe is passin' by 
But I can't forget our 
One, two, three, four 

Five days, sunshine, one way trip 
Where she touched my soul when I touched her lips 
She said "boy take me to wherever you go destination anywhere" 
But destiny said no. 

Tell me how could such a good thing only last... 
One, two three, four 
Five days once in a lifetime 
Five nights 
Too good to be true 
The universe is passin' by 
But I can't forget our 
One, two, three, four 

Five days once in a lifetime 
Five nights 
Too good to be true 
The universe is passin' by 
But I can't forget our 
One, two, three, four 

Five days...can't you hear me? 
Five nights...where you are? 
Five days...can't you fell me? 
Five nights...you're still my love 

It was so great when we were together, baby 
So great when we were together 
It was so great when our days were endless, baby 
So great when we were together 

Tell me how could such a good thing only last... 
One, two three, four 
Five days once in a lifetime 
Five nights 
Too good to be true 
The universe is passin' by 
But I can't forget our 
One, two, three, four 

Five days once in a lifetime 
Five nights 
Too good to be true
