I've got this feelin' inside me babe
Got my eyes on you
Just a matter of time
'Till I make up my mind
Before the night is through.

I've been searchin' everywhere for a little girl like you
Now I'm on their prowl
Gonna need you now
I've got my sights on you.

I'm a hunter
I'm a stalker
I'm a creeper round every corner
I'm a seeker
Your love is all I need
Ain't no use in runnin' now
'Cause I get what I always go after
I'm on the prowl.

ain't nothing in the whole world, honey
I wouldn't do it for you
Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Enough to get me through
I've been searchin' everywhere
No one else will do
You're gonna be mine, baby, I ain't lyin'
Got my sights on you

I'm a hunter
Oh I'm a stalker
I'm a creeper round every corner
I'm a seeker
Your love is all I need
Ain't no use in runnin' now
'Cause I get what I always get what I go after
I'm on the prowl.

Got this feelin' inside me baby
Got my eyes on you
Just a matter of time
'Till I make you mine
Before the night is through
I've been searchin' everywhere
But no one else will do
You're gonna be mine, baby
I ain't lyin'
I've got my sights on you

I'm a hunter
Oh I'm a stalker
I'm a creeper round every corner
I'm a seeker
Your love is all I need
Ain't no use in runnin' now
'Cause I get what I always get what I go after
I'm on the prowl.
