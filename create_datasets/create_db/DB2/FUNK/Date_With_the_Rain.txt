Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Oh rain

I've got a date with the rain
Gotta go walking in the rain
The clouds that gather in the skies
Gather in my eyes every time it rains

On just such a day you let me go
And as the raindrops began to flow
I'll go walking in the rain no no
Hiding my tears in the rain

I grabbed my coat and leather shoes
Walked out the door with a bag full of blues
No one notices it all but when my teardrops fall
Walking in the rain

Every time the rain comes along
The absence of you become so strong
And I just go walking in the rain
Hiding my tears in the rain

Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain

On just such a day you let me go
And as the raindrops began to flow
And I go walking in the rain
Hiding my tears in the rain

Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain

Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain

Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
