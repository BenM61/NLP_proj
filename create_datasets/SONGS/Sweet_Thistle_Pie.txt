It's been a long time since I had sweet thistle pie
It's been a long time since I had sweet thistle pie
She claps her hands and snaps her fingers
Knows my name but calls me ginger
It's been a long time since I had sweet thistle pie

Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Sweet thistle pie
Sweet thistle pie
Sweet thistle pie

It's been a long time since I've been so very low
It's been a long time since I've been so very low
When I was young you were no stranger
Around the world and slip through my fingers
It's been a long time since I've been so very low

Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Sweet thistle pie
Sweet thistle pie
Sweet thistle pie
