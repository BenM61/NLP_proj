You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't need crying lies
I don't need stupid alibi's
I don't need convertible cars,
And don't think you can push me too far
You got the money, I got the time,
Nothing better to do, so you might just change my mind.

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't want to see you again
I don't want you for a friend
I don't want you hanging around
I don't mind just putting you down.
You got the money, I got the time
Nothing better to do, so I might just change my mind.

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need

I don't have to tell you
How that you should do your job,
I don't want to have to be the one to shock your happy home.

You got nothing I want
You got nothing I need
