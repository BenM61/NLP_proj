So, boy where you go, what you do,
Hey there boy what is wrong with you?
No future, no hope, just broken dreams,
You spend your days wondering why

I'll be your friend, I'll be around
I'll be everything you need

I'll be your friend, I'll be around
I'll be everything you need

Hey young man, why you cry
Don't you know, you've got to try
A little bit harder, you've got to stand
On your own two feet

Never let them drag you down
Hey there boy
This prejudice and ignorance we can overcome

I'll be your friend, I'll be around
I'll be everything you need
I'll be your friend, I'll be around
I'll be everything you need

Disenchanted angry young man
Disenchanted angry young man
Disenchanted angry young man
Disenchanted angry young man

I'll never let you down
Never let you down

So boy now you know what to do,
Hey there boy don't be blue
There's future, there's hope, hope for you
Hey young man just believe in what you do.

I'll be your friend, I'll be around
I'll be everything you need
I'll be your friend, I'll be around
I'll be everything you need

Pride is something good for you
Believe in yourself.
