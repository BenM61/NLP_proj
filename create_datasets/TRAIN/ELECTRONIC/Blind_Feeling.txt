Well, they claim that you took me away
They claim that your love came down on me
They claim that you took me away
They claim you're to blame in changing me

I have changed since you came
I feel relieved, I feel strange
You have given me space
To see where I've been

The flame of a love is high, I realize it's a mystery
You came and you saved my mind
From the fear that was near
When you rescued me

Everywhere
I see jealousy in peoples eyes
I don't care
'Cause your magical power has made me realize

Blind feeling brought our lives together
Blind feeling suddenly you came
Blind feeling stay with me forever

We could leave if we wanted today
Tomorrow we'd be on the other side
Away from the judges eyes
They can't deny we're not good for each other

Pain and sorrow and my empty past
I'm leaving behind
I know you know it too, together alone
It's blowing my mind

Blind feeling brought our lives together
Blind feeling suddenly you came
Blind feeling stay with me forever
