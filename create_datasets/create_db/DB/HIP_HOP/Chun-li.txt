Ay yo
Look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court full drenched
Here go some haterade, get your thirst quenched 
Style'd on 'em in this Burberry trench 
This birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench 
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he bite a rock

Ay yo I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men Benz foreign
He keep on dialing Nicki, like the Prince song
I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ay yo I been North, Laura been Croft
Plates say 'Chung-Li' drop the Benz off

Oh I get it
They paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats bitch, f*ck the gossip 
How many of them could've did it with finesse? 
Now everybody like, "she really is the best"
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch it's King Kong, yes it's King Kong
Bitch it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on 
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch it's King Kong, yes I'm King Kong
Dis is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom, with my Timbs on
(How many championships?) What? Six rings on

They need rappers like me
They need rappers like me
So they can get on their fuckin' keyboards and make me, the bad guy
Chun-Li

Ay yo I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men Benz foreign 
He keep on dialing Nicki, like the Prince song
I been on, bitch you been con
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ay yo I been North, Laura been Croft
Plates say 'Chung-Li' drop the Benz off

I am alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs
It's my lifestyle
I am alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs 
It's my lifestyle
I need a Mai Tai, so fuckin' sci-fi
Give me the password, to the fuckin' WiFi
