I never knew girls existed like you 
But now that I do 
I'd really like to get to know you 

The girl's too young 
She don't need any better 
It's all coming back 
I can feel it 
The girl's too young 
She don't know any better 
It's all coming back 
I can feel it 

She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
The girl is beautiful 

You're giving me moves that hit from all sides
and when you are hitting like that you melt my eyes

The girl's too young 
She don't need any better 
It's all coming back 
I can feel it 
The girl's too young 
She don't know any better 
It's all coming back 
I can feel it 

And though I never know you 
I look at your face. 
To tell you that I love you 
Don't know what to say 
You're everything I got, you beautiful girl
The only thing I live for in the whole wide world 

She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
The girl is beautiful 

I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) 
Going to throw it away 
And talk to you 
She looks good 
She looks good 
And it's true 
And it's true 
The girl is beautiful 
She is beautiful 

I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) 
Only living one time
And I want you 
She looks good 
She looks good 
And it's true 
And it's true 
The girl is beautiful 
She is beautiful 

She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
Na na na na na na na na 
She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
Na na na na na na na na 
The girl is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
Na na na na na na na na 
She is beautiful 
She is beautiful 
Na na na na na na na na 

I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) 
Going to throw it away 
And talk to you 
She looks good 
She looks good 
And it's true 
And it's true 
The girl is beautiful 
She is beautiful 

I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) 
And I'll never forget 
When I saw you 
She looks good 
She looks good 
And it's true 
And it's true 
The girl is beautiful 
She is beautiful
