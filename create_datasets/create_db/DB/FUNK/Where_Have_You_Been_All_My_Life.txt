Until we kissed, I never knew
The thrills that could be tasted
Until we kissed, I never knew
The years that I had wasted

But now I know
I was waiting for you to come by
I was waiting, girl
Won't you please tell me why
This took so long to begin
Darling, where have you been all my life?

Oh, don't you know that 'til we touched
I never knew the touch was worth revealing
Until we touched
I never knew my heart was really beating

But now I know
I was waiting for you to come by
I was waiting
Won't you please tell me why
This took so long to begin
Darling, where have you been all my life?

Oh, darling
Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was feeling blue

Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was needing you

Oh, where you been
Where you been

Where you been

Now don't you know
I was waiting for you to come by
I was waiting, girl
Won't you please tell me why
This took so long to begin
Darling, where have you been all my life?

Oh, darling
Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was feeling blue
Feeling blue

Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was needing you

Oh, where you been
Where you been
