What would you do if it came to me?
And what if it came to you?
Oh, as heavy as this burden's been
Why would we have to choose?

Because in the dawning, you will wait for
For her warning, she was warning, yeah

I don't know of anyone that's taken this from me
I'm lonelier than I've ever been, I'm lonely without you

But it was time for you to leave me
And are you leaving? And are you breathing?
Or going out more? In the dawning
She was warning, yeah

Coldness on me, is it my trial?
A dead weight on me, it is my trial
Coldness in me, and I need more
Are you more? Are you more?

'Cause in the dawning, I will wait for
For her warning, is she warning?
Or going out more? Yeah
No
Yeah
No
Yeah
No
Yeah
