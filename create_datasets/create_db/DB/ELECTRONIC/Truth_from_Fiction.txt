I was too busy playing princess
While you were off there somewhere else
I was too worried about someone else
And her name could almost rhyme with mine

I never meant for you to feel this way
I never meant for you to feel this way
Can't tell truth from fiction
Can't tell truth from fiction

I said: pretty one listen to me
Truth is all that's asked for
And love is steering you to the inevitable
But you can't stop trying
Or you may start crying

I can't tell truth from fiction
I can't tell truth from fiction

I was too busy playing princess
While you were off there somewhere else
I was too worried
I was too worried about someone else
I didn't know the truth was mined
Mined...

I never meant for you to feel this way
I never meant for you to feel this way
Feel this way
Can't tell truth from fiction
Can't tell truth from fiction
I never meant for you to feel
I never meant for you to feel this way
Can't tell truth from fiction
Fiction
