Kisses in the Rain,
A chance that we might meet for Kisses in the Rain,
Trying to find the heat that left long ago,
And left us with so much pain,
Kisses in the Rain,
Nothing more or less, just Kisses in the Rain,
Two hearts that won't confess to knowing what's true,
No skies of blue remain,
We're now a time remembered,
Love's just a passing glance,
It's all a cold September and all along last dance,
Hiding in the lane,
We try so hard and yet there's nothing to regain,
Two hearts that never met, still holding on in vain,
To Kisses in the Rain.
