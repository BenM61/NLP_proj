If I can just make it up there
And if I can walk through that city bright and fair
There'd probably be a thousand things
I want to tell the Lord on that day
On that day, that day

I'll just begin to cry
You'll wipe the tears from my eyes
I'll say thanks, You'll ask why
This will be my reply, You know

Millions didn't make it
But I was one of the ones who did
I'll look at God and say
Millions didn't make it
But I was one of the ones who did

Yeah, don't you know
There'd probably be a thousand things
That I, I'm gonna tell the Lord, just to the Lord on that day
On that day, that day

Oh yeah, I'll just begin to cry
You'll wipe the tears from my eyes
I'll say thanks, You'll ask why
This will be my reply, You know that

Millions didn't make it
But I was one of the ones who did
I'll tell everybody
Millions didn't make it
Yeah, I'm one of the ones who did

I'll tell everybody
Millions didn't make it
But I was one of the ones who did

You see, I made it over
I came through hard trials and tribulations
Persecutions
I was one of the ones who did

Millions didn't make it
But I was one of the ones who did
So sad to tell you

Millions didn't make it
But I'm mighty glad to let you know
Yeah, I'm one of the ones who did

Millions didn't make it
But I was one of the ones

I made it over
I made it over
I made it over
I made it over
