When my lover boy comes rollin' in
Bottle of rum in his hand thanks to Sailor Jim yeah
Sleeves rolled up and he's wringin' wet
The boy is all man covered in blood and sweat

[Chorus]
An arrow through your heart sayin' "I love you"
A name on your arm sayin' you'll always be true
Declaration of love in red white and blue
You got a love tattoo, you got a love tattoo

Well he's mean and rude when he wakes and starts
Yeah one of his moods could just break my heart
But it pounds and it thumps when he grabs me tight
I love my rough lover every inch every night

[Chorus]

This hunk of a boy
Talks soft to me
Behind closed doors he can be so awfully sweet
When he lays by my side
He's my very own real wild child
With his heart of stone sittin' all alone
Between the anchor and the bride

[Chorus]

This hunk of a boy
Talks soft to me
Behind closed doors he can be so awfully sweet
When he lays by my side
He's my very own real wild child
With his heart of stone sittin' all alone
Between the anchor and the bride

[Chorus: x2]
