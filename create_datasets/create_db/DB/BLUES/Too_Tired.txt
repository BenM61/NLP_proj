Yeah!
I laid down last night, too tired to wake.
I had a chill this morning, too tired to shake.
I got a good poker hand, too tired to win.
I can hear my baby knockin', too tired to let her in.

I'm tired.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm tired.
Too tired, too tired for anything.

I'm too tired to walk,
too tired to run.
I can hear my baby callin'.
Too tired, too tired,
I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
I'm tired,
I'm too tired for anything.

Take over Albert, I'm too tired for this!

I'm tired of prospherity.
I'm tired of luck.
I'm sittin' on a pin,
I'm too tired to get up.

I'm tired.
I declare I'm tired.
I'm too tired,
too tired for anything.

Oh, Albert I'm tired.
You better take over Albert.
I'm too tired baby.
