My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine
Everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get 'round in the sunshine

Just bees and things and flowers

My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine
Everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get 'round in the sunshine

Feel, what I feel, when I feel, what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine
Feel, what I feel, when I feel, what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine

Do what I do, when I do, what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine
Do what I do, when I do, what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine

Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
