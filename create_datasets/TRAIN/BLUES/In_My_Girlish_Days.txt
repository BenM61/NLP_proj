Late hours at night, trying to play my hand 
Through my window, out stepped a man 
I didn't know no better 
Oh boys 

In my girlish days 
My mama cried, papa did, too 
Oh, daughter, look what a shame on you 
I didn't know no better 

Oh boys 
In my girlish days 
I flagged a train, didn't have a dime 
Trying to run away from that home of mine 

I didn't know no better 
Oh boys 
In my girlish days 
I hit the highway, caught me a truck 

Nineteen and seventeen, when the winter was tough 
I didn't know no better 
Oh boys 
In my girlish days 

Lord, play it for me now
All of my playmates is not surprised, 
I had to travel 'fore I got wise 
I found out better 
And I still got my girlish ways
