Hugged your friends
Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why
From me

Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the
State line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must've known
What we were going to find

This ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancin' without the sound
It ain't nothin' no nothin'
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're gonna climb
Pat on the back and better luck next time
It ain't nothin' no it ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town

Stardust well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen 'em rise
I've seen 'em fall
Some get nothin'
And lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawled away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm, I'm gonna need you
Down this yellow brick road

This ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancin' without a sound
It ain't nothin' no it ain't nothin' no
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're gonna climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothin' no it ain't nothin'
But a heartbreak town
Town
Heartbreak town
