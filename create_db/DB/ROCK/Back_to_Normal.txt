Naturally I heard the doctor say
Cut the cord and give the child away
So you had him over for dinner
Carving beans with a butcher knife 

I'm back to normal
(He's going over her)
I'm back to normal
(With his thermometer)
I'm back to normal
(She's getting normal)
I'm back to normal now
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal now 

You tell him to try and kiss away
All those little things we could not say
And he's got you under that pillow
Well I left instructions for you 

I'm back to normal
(I see ya live for hope)
I'm back to normal
(Get out your microscope)
I'm back to normal
(You got enough rope)
I'm back to normal now
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal now 

He thinks he's all you ever wanted
He's turning off the lights now
Does he know your bed is haunted? 

Who's that in the shadows on the wall?
Who's that with the camera in the hall?
You got doctor's orders
I got all the pictures I need 

I'm back to normal
(I sit alone at night)
I'm back to normal
(In the projected light)
I'm back to normal
(It's such an insight)
I'm back to normal now
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
I'm back to normal now

Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
Back to normal
