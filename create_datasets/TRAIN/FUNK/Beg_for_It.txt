Can you say Omarion?
There's just something I wanna do to you
I been watchin you all night long

Beg For it
Don't panic, when you see it you better hold on
You said you need it, well damn it come on
I'm a lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it
Take that off, when you go in there you better get it all
Don't play with it baby, go head get it all
I'm a beg for you baby as soon as you get all

Ain't never had body make your hood friends
Ask you "how long does he give it?"
Baby, get ready to know (they ain't ready)
For the play, I'm a game
When its up, I'll make you

Beg For it
Don't panic, when you see it you better hold on
You said you need it, well damn it come on
I'm a lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it
Take that off, when you go in there you better get it all
Don't play with it baby, go head get it all
I'm a beg for you baby as soon as you get all

Ain't no me loving you, ain't no you lovin me,
This is strictly because when we came in free
No we were chosen for
Understand what's the dress code
Don't be mad if I ain't playin for keys
Damn I'ma do all those things in my dream
On my hood in the cold
While it's raining on us
When I get it I'm gone, you gon let all ya girls know
Ain't gon be no second guessing bout me

Beg For it
Don't panic, when you see it you better hold on
You said you need it, well damn it come on
I'm a lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it
Take that off, when you go in there you better get it all
Don't play with it baby, go head get it all
I'm a beg for you baby as soon as you get all

You can get it oo yeah
(Can I get a hit on the dance floor?)
Tell me, can you feel it?
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it 
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it 

Beg For it
Don't panic, when you see it you better hold on
You said you need it, well damn it come on
I'm a lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it
Take that off, when you go in there you better get it all
Don't play with it baby, go head get it all
I'm a beg for you baby as soon as you get all
