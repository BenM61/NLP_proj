Keep close but keep quiet 
As if an angel graced us all up in our hands 
Redefine close to tears 
It looked painful like I secretly feared 

What I mean to say is you talked me round 
Don't look down on the luck you found 

I mean well I steal 
I see violence in the corner of your eye 
Make sense of what you feel 
There's a danger in every story and every smile 

What I mean to say is you talked me round 
Don't look down on the luck you found 
What I mean to say is you tore me down 
But don't look down on the luck you found
