One step - I make an imprint
Two steps - is commitment
Three steps - I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set

Gotta believe in what's real
You gotta go with what you know
You can leave here with a good feeling
'You never know' you told me so

Jesus Christ and Heaven's always been there
Gotta believe in what's real
You gotta go with what you know

One step - I make an imprint
Two steps - is commitment
Three steps - I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set

Gotta tell you what I feel
Although your tank is running low
Over the split line for real
Pat the hood you're good to go
Hear you now
You're cut from the cords of the wicked

Gotta believe in what's real
You gotta move on down the road

One step - I make an imprint
Two steps - is commitment
Three steps - I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set

One step - I make an imprint
Two steps - is commitment
Three steps - I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set

(music)

One step - I make an imprint
Two steps - is commitment
Three steps - I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set

One step - I make an imprint
Two steps - is commitment
Three steps - I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set

(vocal & guitar)
One step - I make an imprint
Two steps - is commitment
Three steps - I'm not done yet
Draw my other leg up
And the pace is set
