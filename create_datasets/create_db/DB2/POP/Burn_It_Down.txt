Can you hear it in the distance, calling out to you
Can you see it in your shadow, the truth you always knew

So get up and get out, they can't hold you down
A fire can't be tamed, 
Cause you're here, time is now, all the fear and doubt
Is going up in flames

Tonight I'm gonna touch the sky and nothing's gonna stop me now
Temperature is on the rise, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down
Can't touch me (ah) I'm on fire, can't slow me down
We're gonna light it up tonight, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down

So afraid of your reflection, you're hiding from the truth
Always see imperfection staring back at you

It's OK you can say what you wanna say
Cause I already know
'Bout the hurt and the pain, it's about to change
It's going up in smoke

Tonight I'm gonna touch the sky and nothing's gonna stop me now
Temperature is on the rise, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down
Can't touch me (ah) I'm on fire, can't slow me down
We're gonna light it up tonight, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down

Can't touch me (ah) I'm on fire, can't slow me down
We're gonna light it up tonight, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down

Tonight I'm gonna touch the sky and nothing's gonna stop me now
Temperature is on the rise, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down
Can't touch me (ah) I'm on fire, can't slow me down
We're gonna light it up tonight, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down

Can't touch me (ah) I'm on fire, can't slow me down
We're gonna light it up tonight, I'm gonna burn it down, burn it down
