Yeah ma, your dude is back, made back roof is back
Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't got to argue about who could rap
Cause the proof is back just go through my rap
New York New York yeah where my troopers at
Where my hustlers where my boosters at
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued you back to the wall
You gotta brawl to that 
I been through that, been shot at shoot back
Gotta keep it peace like a Buddhist
I ain't a New Jack nobody goin' Wesley Snipe me
It's less than likely, move back
Let I breathe Jedi Knight
The more space I get the better I write
(Oh) Never I write, but, if, ever I write
I need the space to say whatever I like, now just

[Chorus]
(Change clothes and go) You know I stay, fresh to death 
I brought you from the projects
And I'm a take you to the top of the globe so let's go (Change numbers and go)
Uh huh yeah, uh (Now girl I promise you, no substitute) 
It's just me

And I goin' tell you again let's get ghost in the phantom
You could bring your friend we could make this a tandem
You could come by yourself and you could stand him
Best believe I sweat out weaves, give Afro puffs like R.A.G.E.
You get if you could move it
Back it on up like a you Haul truck
Then run and tell them thugs you heard HOV knew
He and the boy for real make beautiful music
He is to the east coast what Snoop is, to the west coast what Face is to Houston
Young HOV in the house it's so necessary
No bra with the blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans that's so necessary
Now why you fronting on me is that necessary
Do I to you look like a lame
Who don't understand a bra with a mean shoe game
Whose up on Dot Dot Dot and Vera Wang
Ma are you insane, let's just
(What you want me to do?)

[Chorus]

Uh, uh (Sexy sexy) Woo!
Uh huh (Sexy sexy) It's so necessary right) 
Uh huh, woo! (Sexy sexy) That's right it's a groove 
Uh huh, it's a groove (Sexy sexy) bring it back 

Young HOV in the house it's so necessary
No bra with that blouse it's so necessary
No panties and jeans it's so necessary
Why you fronting on me?
Let's go to my hotel cause this don't go well
With those S Dots, gotta to stay fresh ma
Ma, I don't shop what the rest by
Oh no ma please respect ma
Jiggy this is probably purple label
Or that BBC or it's probably tailored
But y'all niggas acting way to tough
Throw on a suit get it tapered up, and let's just

[Chorus]

Uh uh (Sexy sexy) sing along
Yeah, uh (Sexy sexy) turn your radio up 
Woo! (Sexy sexy) Put your hands in the air if your in the car 
Uh! Snap your fingers now (Sexy sexy) woo, uh 
Uh, uh, your boy is back
Uh huh, uh, uh, uh, the bounce is back
Uh, uh, woo, uh HOV is back, peace!
