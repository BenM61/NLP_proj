Some will tell you that you're wrong
You do it all the wrong way
Some will tell you that you're wrong
That you don't know the way

They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Don't let them bother you no
They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Oh no

It's no use sitting down
Don't walk round with a frown
Oh no keep looking
It's no use sitting around
With your head in your hands
Oh no keep looking

Say let my life alone

Some will tell you that you're wrong
You do it all the wrong way
Some will tell you that you're wrong
That you don't know the way

They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Don't let them bother you no
They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Oh no

It's no use sitting down
Don't walk round with a frown
Oh no keep looking
It's no use sitting around
With your head in your hands
Oh no keep looking

Keep looking
Keep looking

Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your worries
Thinking about your problems
Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your worries
Keep looking
Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your worries
Thinking about your problems
Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your problems
Keep looking

Keep looking

If you never let it show
They're never gonna know
Keep looking

If you never let it show
They're never gonna know
Keep looking
