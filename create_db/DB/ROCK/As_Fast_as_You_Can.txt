I know a girl, got a long snake moan
A fever in her head and a restless soul
I got a feeling that the church don't know
What the church don't know, the church don't mind
We all work on borrowed time

[Chorus]
Girl, you run as fast as you can
Don't give up, we'll always be friends
Run as fast as you, run as fast as you can

I know a girl, got a long snake moan
Got the voodoo in her hips and a god-shaped hole
I got a feeling that the kids don't know
What the kids don't know, the kids don't mind
We all work on borrowed time

[Chorus]

Every dog will have its day
Every dog will have its day

[Chorus]
