Wherever you are look at the stars tonight
Whatever you do don't forget to shine
The second you feel like you don't know what's real
And you're running to stand still
You know you can stand still and let me reach you in time

Where do we go?
Where do we go to now?
A place where I know that our lives can start over, start over
Don't let the light go out
Where do we go? (Start over, start over, start over)

Everyone knows tomorrow's another day, the sun will rise
But everyone knows it won't be the same
The rain may fall, but the weight of it all could never break us
No matter where this will take us
I won't let it fade

Where do we go?
Where do we go to now?
A place where I know that our lives can start over, start over
Don't let the light go out
We're not alone
We're not alone tonight
With the world in our arms we start over, start over, start over

How can I be so sure we're only a breath away?
Here in a world where everything changes
Only a breath, only a breath away
Wherever you are, look at the stars

Where do we go?
Where do we go to now?
A place where I know that our lives can start over, start over
Don't let the light go out
We're not alone (We're not alone)
We're not alone tonight (We're not alone)
With the world in our arms we start over, start over, start over
We're not alone tonight
We're not alone
