Oh life what have you done to me
You've made it all so hard just to be
Now these young bones feel so old
Feel like I can't carry on

Oh life why leave me all alone
A woman here left out in the cold
I got no family to even call my own
All the good men escaped me

My best years left so far behind me
Deep inside I'm all choked up
All the storms you
Sent they've beaten me
Got no strength left to wipe away my tears

Oh life what have you done to me
I came into this world all brand new
Not one promise has even come through
Why drag me all this way just to hurt me

My best years left so far behind me
Deep inside I'm all choked up
All the storms you sent
Well finally they've beaten me
I've got no strength left to wipe away my tears

Oh life you made it so hard for me
Guess I'm still the strong one
I'm still laughing
Oh life you can't beat me
Got these young bones they'll keep walking
Got these young bones they'll keep walking
