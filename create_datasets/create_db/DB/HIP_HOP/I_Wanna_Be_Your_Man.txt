And its rte now volume 1,

Big up the ladies innit,
Check it,
I want you lot to listen to the lyrics yeah,
You know the deal rite now,
Its Ironik, 
Let me just speak to them,
Listen,

Look, look,
My first love was hot like Jamaica,
Didn't care wot ma boys said,
I wanted to take her,
And wen she was nothing,
I wanted to make her my w.i.f.e.y,
Yes me,
We went together like peaches and cream,
And teachers and teens,
And shoes and jeans,
And I said that,
'cause we was so sophisticated,
On the first date,
I was late,
But you still waited,
I wasn't late on purpose,
I swear 2 you,
You know I've made mistakes in the past,
But I'm there for you,
I didn't no time went so fast,
Its mad be,
We broke up,
But I wanna be your man be,

[chorus]
I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your man.

Look, 'cause I want you 2 much,
Your too much to touch,
Baby you're too buff,
2 2's
We both do 2 much,
And we both know I held you down like a clutch,
So please don't rush,
Into a next relationship,
Remember the days we spent together,
From 11am til 6,
And you see you yeah,
I like you 2 bits,
I ain't ready for the quits,
So please don't quit it,
It will be fixed,
Our relationship I wrote it,
Down in a tune,
Now you hear it,
You've heard it,
You can have your verdict,
But ya love I've earned it,
So you should take your time,
And still fink about it man,

[Chorus: x3]
