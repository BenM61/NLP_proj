Waiting at the door for some kind of life 
You never step outside because the fears you fight 
Can turn the day to night 
But only in your head 
And you say you're the only one that knows 
Well I don't give in to that nobody but me stuff 
I know where you go when you're down 
That place where falling stars tear up the ground 
And pace around 

(All in all it's the same old thing 
Float around until you get pulled in 
Gather it up and we leave it behind 
For someone else to see) 

Take it as it comes, you take it when you want 
But don't waste a fight if it doesn't feel right 
But dear God don't give up 
Kisses on your hand 
And slaps on your face is part of life 
Everybody gets their share of both, love
