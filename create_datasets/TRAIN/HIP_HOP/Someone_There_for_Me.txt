Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me

(Come in, RB)
Hey love, long time no see
Been reminiscing the time you and I used to be we
Started off back in September
As far as I can remember
You gave me the option I found hard to endeavor
You wanted me to see long-term, but I couldn't
Stop hanging with those low-life brothers, but I wouldn't
When I look back it's sure and plain to see
All you were trying to do is show you were there for me

Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me

Okay cool true, why should you listen
You could easily walk away, hold up the hand, straight dissing
But wait a minute, yo yo yo, hear me out
You'll soon realize brother's coming with a whole different route
We could hold hands and walk in the park
We could light up some candles and soothe down in the bath
I would be ready to listen to your plans about the car, villa
And okay meet your gran
Hey, I'm just joking, but to live without you is mind provoking
Ah man, I'm just saying hear the plan
I'm ready to understand
I'm ready to meet your fam
Babe, I just want to be your man

Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me

Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
As far as long term, let me tell you what I see
My career blowing up, you beside, that's what I want, that's what we need
Pretty picture, don't you agree
You and I girl creating our own destiny
Hey let me ease back all my rhymes from your mind
Go home, think about it, sit back and recline
Take a minute or two, with all the plans you have for me
Are you sure you're now ready to be the one for me

Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me

Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me

Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me

Could you be the only one for me
Take good care and see
That all I need is someone to be there for me
Would you stay around if times got bad
Even when I'm sad
Cause all I need is someone to be there for me
