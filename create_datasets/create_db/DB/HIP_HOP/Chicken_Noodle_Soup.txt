AG on the mic, doin' his thing
Walked in the park; they screamin' ma name
Stop! Now look at the chain

Let it rain; clear it out

Let it rain; clear it out

I was on 4-5th
In the Whippington
Ears naked, wrist was glistening
Eyes low like I'm blowing piffington
Girls talk slick
But they whisperin'

A let it rain, and clear it out
A let it rain, and clear it out
A let it rain, and clear it out
A let it rain, and clear it out
