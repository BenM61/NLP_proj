Well I'm here, I'm not there, and it feels good
To be here, and not there, watching burning wood
Floating through the air, I don't have a care
Two past three, it can't be any other time
It explodes in the road, and I witness it
No reply, bat an eye, 'cause it doesn't fit
See you over there, sitting in my chair
Perfect world, perfect girl, perfect tourniquet
I am over here, that is not my problem
I can disappear, I can just ignore them
Go away, go away, I don't want to see
Go away, leave today, have a lovely trip
Only half believe what the five receive
Uncle Bob lost his job, Bobs your uncle, mate
I am over here, that is not my problem
I can disappear, I can just ignore them
Go away, it's okay, they'll make more of it
Itching stop, did I cop, did I get me some
Sing my little song, life goes marching on
'Cause I'm here, I'm not there
And I just don't care
