Back in Nagasaki I got married to Cho Cho San
That was her name in those days
And I was her man
I'm going back to visit her
She got a problem
She got a little Cho Cho
Cho Cho San was her name
And this is her tale of woe
Take it away Cho Cho

Today's the day when I see clear
A tiny thread of smoke appears
Where blue skies fall upon the ocean
And shake this staid emotion

All the while I sing this song
I see a dot on the horizon
Growing bigger every second
Gleaming white in my direction

Who on earth can it be
Coming up the path for me?
What on earth will he say?
Shall I run to him or run away?

Freaking out, he's come to get me
My feet are stuck but just won't let me
Run to him do I dare?
Madam Butterfly don't blow it

Calling Butterfly, Madam Butterfly
That's the name he used to give me
He's my man till the day I die
Oh, sweet Butterfly, so sweet Butterfly
She's waiting
He'll be back, I have faith in this love track

Pinkerton's the name
Lieutenant Colonel Pinkerton, sir
U.S. Navy
I'm a bounder
I married a Yankee girl
But I went back to visit old Japan
Where there she was, Cho Cho San

Gotta have something to believe in
My white honkey, I do miss him
Someday soon he'll come around
Just to stop my nervous breakdown

Call me fool, call me stupid
Bend my arrow kill this cupid
Say it with me
He'll be back
I have faith in this love track

Calling Butterfly, Madam Butterfly
That's the name he used to give me
He's my man till the day I die
Oh, sweet Butterfly, so sweet Butterfly
She's waiting
He'll be back, I have faith

Cho Cho San
My little wife
My sweet butterfly
That's the name I'll give her
When I return

Little sweet sweet Butterfly
I hear him crowing faintly
He thinks I'm just still sweet sixteen
I guess I'll tease him gently

Calling Madam Butterfly
His angel plucked right from the sky
Hide my baby in mystic places
I feel the fear that I might die

Right in his arms and his embraces
Softly kissing my eyelashes
Got no right, no right to doubt it
Ain't no doubt, no doubt about it

Call me fool, call me stupid
Bend this arrow kill this cupid
I have faith I'll always pray
My white honkey's here to stay

Calling Butterfly, Madam Butterfly
Butterfly, Butterfly have no fear
I'll be back to wipe your tears
Oh, sweet Butterfly, so sweet Butterfly
She's waiting
I'll wait for him with unshakable faith
He'll be back

[Foreign content]

He'll be back
I'll be back
