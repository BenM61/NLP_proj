Life is a dream, yet it's so real
Hard to explain, just how you feel
Deep in your heart, joy seems to dwell
Like poets say, it's perfectly swell

In every step, of this old dance
There is delight, love and romance
If you are the one, give me the few
And I am sure there's no one like you

You are all I dream
You are a part of my heart and esteem
And since I've met you
Now I know that dreams do come true

Love is a dream, yet it's so real
Hard to explain, just how you feel
Deep in your heart, joy seems to dwell
Like poets say, it's perfectly swell
