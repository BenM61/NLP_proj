He was born and raised around Jacksonville
A nice young man, not the kind to kill
But a jealous fight and a flashing blade
Sent him on the run to the Everglades
Runnin' like a dog through the Everglades

Now, the posse went in and they came back out
They said he'll die and there ain't no doubt
It's an eye for an eye so the debt is paid
He won't last long in the Everglades
A man can't live in the Everglades

Where a man can hide and never be found
And have no fear of the bayin' hounds
But he better keep movin' and don't stand still
If the 'skeeters don't get him then the 'gaters will

Now, the years went by and his girl was wed
His fam'ly gave him up for dead
But now and then the natives would say
They'd seen him runnin' through the Everglades
Runnin' like a dog through the Everglades

Now, he never heard the news on the radio
He was deep in the 'glades so he'll never know
His runnin' and hidin' didn't make much sense
For the jury had ruled it was self-defense
Running like a dog through the Everglades

Where a man can hide and never be found
And have no fear of the bayin' hounds
But he better keep movin' and don't stand still
If the 'skeeters don't get him then the 'gaters will
Runnin' like a dog through the Everglades
Skippin' like a frog through the slimy bog
Runnin' through the trees from the Everlys
