I was taken by surprise
I was shattered by your eyes

Living far beyond my means
Do you know how that feels?
I was waiting for so long
I was praying to belong

Only holding out to see and believing there's only one
Strong enough and hard enough to give you away.

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside

Saying I
I want to let you go
Got that feeling
If anyone who comes to know you long enough will give you away.

There was never one as I who could stand the reasons why

Who would even take the time
Did you care
Was I right?
Only once did you try
Even then it was hard enough
Just for you to realize or believe there was only one
Strong enough and hard enough to give you away.

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside

In this big area of mine. sometimes you break me up inside

Sometimes you break me up inside
In this big area of life

Saying I
I want to let you go
Go that feeling
If anyone who comes to know you long enough will give you away.

I was taken by surprise
I was shattered by your eyes

Breaking down something so right and so fine.
