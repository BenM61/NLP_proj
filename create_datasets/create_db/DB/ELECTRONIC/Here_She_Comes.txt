She begins to steal the light
Confusion throws another mystery.
It's out of focus with the eye

So now you wonder is this just a dream?
Here she comes
Here she comes

She 's gonna cause a sensation now.
And just between you and me
I think she'll soon have you temptation bound.

Suppose who knows? She's not above suspicion.
Is she maybe on some kind of secret mission? 
Better listen.
Somewhere
Somehow
There's still some pieces missing.
I sense
I feel
Trust my intuition

Don't rush into your decision !
Now here's a riddle in a rhyme.
If she's the same how come she's different now?
The same old eyes but not the shine.
You know you're certain but you're full of doubt.

Now here she comes
Here she comes.
She's gonna have you at her beck and call.
So why refuse
Yeah
Why contend?
When all resistance is impossible!

Suppose who knows? She's not above suspicion
Now here she comes
Here she comes

Now here she comes
Here she comes.
This lady's serious make no mistake.
Face to face and eye to eye 
She'll cast a spell that you may never break
Oh
Here she comes
Here she comes.
Here she comes
Here she comes.
