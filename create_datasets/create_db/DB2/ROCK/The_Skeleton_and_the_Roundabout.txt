SKELETON and the ROUNDABOUT 

Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
I am the fairground man at heart 
I run the roundabout this part 
I fill this fair but custom have I none

I turn the handle round so fast it makes my elbow ache 
Nobody seems to care 
No-one rides upon my roundabout no longer anymore 
Oh what a horrid fair!

Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout

Money there is none - I'm thinner than a skeleton

But wait a minute, I'm so thin 
That all these aches and pains could be a chance for me 
I could be a horror or a ghost in a ghost train 
I think I'll go and see

I meet the man who runs the ghost train 
He says, "You're just great! 
I'll pay you top class wages 
If you'll just hang from this gate"

A year is passing lots of food and money come my way 
Oh lucky man am I 
But who's this telling me, "You're fired! 
You're much too fat to be a ghost, be on your way!" 
So here I am

Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout
