Over the city, under the Hollywood sign
City lights are flickering, like a million fireflies 
He turns up the radio and says to me 
Remember this old melody?
Hot Cali sunshine, radiating late June
Driving up the coastline, top down, me and you
Seashells, sand angels, taking in the sunset
Baby I’m dreaming of when we first met

California loving smooth as the ocean tide
Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving

Then we hiked up the Canyon on a warm starry night 
Spent the whole time dancing under the moon light
With the beat of the city underneath our feet 
And the feelings in our heart that still repeat
Hot Cali sunshine, radiating late June
Driving up the coastline, top down, me and you
Seashells, sand angels, taking in the sunset
Baby I’m dreaming of when we first met

California loving smooth as the ocean tide
Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving

Nothing has changed your still by my side
Taking in the moments under Hollywood lights
Fireflies, moonlight, dancing until midnight
Baby I’m so happy you’re mine, baby I’m so happy you’re mine

California loving smooth as the ocean tide
Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving
