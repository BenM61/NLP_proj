I know that my heart is given to you
But in my case, all I do is give and give
Now baby, what does it take for me to get my turn?
All the love that I deserve

It must have been the rain that put me in this mood
To think about the joy and pain that I shared with you
I never would complain but something's happened
To the sensitive and gentle man that I thought I knew

Where do we go from here? To separate ain't gonna solve the problem
'Cause you should know by now what it takes to make it right
So if you really care the way you say you do about me
Then all I ask of you

Do unto me as I do unto you
You got to give your all, baby nothing else will do
Give love to me as I give it to you
That's all I ask of you

Now I've been understanding when you come home late
But baby, when the tables turn you want me home by eight
If you can have a best friend who's a pretty girl
But when you see me with the guys you're jealous
When you don't have a reason to be

And when it gets this bad, I know the words ain't gonna make it better
'Cause you should know by now what it takes to make it right
So if you really care the way you say you do about me
Then all I ask of you, oh baby

Do unto me as I do unto you
You got to give your all, baby nothing else will do
Give love to me as I give it to you
Ooh baby, that's all I ask of you

Oh baby, you can count on me day and night
To be the strength and comfort in your eyes
I only want for me is to be right here by my side
So you've got to be faithful to me and have nothing to hide, oh baby

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, oh baby
That's all I ask of you, you, oh, no, no, baby

Don't you know
I'll give you respect and I'll be your girl
Baby, in return I expect the world
Ever you to do unto me

Trust is everything if you feel the same
Baby, what we got is a fair exchange
True love is all I need to keep on fanning the flame
That's all I ask of you

Nothing in this whole wide world would do, no, no, no baby
You got to do unto me as I do unto you, oh baby
