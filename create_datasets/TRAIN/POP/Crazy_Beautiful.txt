She's got big brown eyes and tangled hair
Voguing in her underwear
And nothing is better than doing nothing together now
She's got a toothbrush as a microphone
Belting out the Rolling Stones
I'm the last one to stop her
Can't believe that I got her

We get so close, kissing like Eskimos
It's a little bit much
I know, I do

Isn't she cra-crazy beautiful
Isn't she stra-strange and wonderful
And I think I love her more than I even understand

She's got a classic style that's all her own
Smile you can hear through the telephone
She says she's a rebel, but she's way too sentimental
She's precious even when she's mad
Gets angry and I start to laugh
And I know that it's nothing
She's just pushing my buttons

We get so close, kissing like Eskimos
It's a little bit much
I know, I do

Isn't she cra-crazy beautiful
Isn't she stra-strange and wonderful
And I think I love her more than I even understand (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)

She's a little bit wild, a little bit mad, a little bit uh oh, beautiful
Wild, a little bit bad, a little bit uh oh
And I never could know her too well
Oh, still I never want anyone else

Isn't she cra-crazy beautiful
Isn't she stra-strange and wonderful
And I think I love her more than I even understand

She's a little bit wild, a little bit mad, a little bit uh oh, beautiful
Wild, a little bit bad, a little bit uh oh
And I think I love her more than I even understand
