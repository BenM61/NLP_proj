We were tight 
But it falls apart 
As silver turns to blue 
Waxing with a candlelight 
And burning just for you 
Allocate your sentiment 
And stick it in a box 
I've never been an extrovert 
But I'm still breathing 

Someone tried to do me ache 
(it's what I'm afraid of) 

With hindsight 
I was more than blind 
Lost without a clue 
Thought I was getting carat gold 
And what I got was you 

Stuck inside the circumstances 
Lonely at the top 
I've always been an introvert 
Happily bleeding 

Someone tried to do me ache 
(it's what I'm afraid of) 

I've gotta breathe to stay alive 
And 1 4 2 9 7 8 
Feels like I'm gonna suffocate 
14 16 22 
This skin that turns to blister blue 
Shoulders toes and knees 
I'm 36 degrees 
Shoulders toes and knees 
I'm 36 degrees 
Shoulder toes and knees 
I'm 36 degrees 
Shoulders toes and knees 
I'm 36 degrees
