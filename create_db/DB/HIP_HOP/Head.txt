Sometimes I wake up in the mornin'
My feet, my soul, my arms
My legs myself, my eggs
Are all fried

I've gotta do my exams today
I've read my books, turned up on time
But I haven't revised
I

I'm not getting along
I'm not gettin' the answer
I'm not getting along

I'm not getting along
I'm not gettin' the answer
I
I can't get out of my head

In the night, sometimes I wake up
Uncool, uptight
I'm tired of being tired
But in my dreams, my arms are open wide
Open wide

I open up my eyes
Open up my eyes
Everything is dark
I think I'm blind
I think I'm blind
I think I'm blind

I'm not getting along
I'm not gettin' the answer
I'm not getting along
(Too dumb to use the phone)

I'm not getting along
I'm not gettin' the answers
'Cause I can't get out of my head

No, I
No, I
No, I can't get out of my head

No, I
No, I
No, I can't get out of my head

This profession is my obsession
And this obsession is my depression
And this depression is my release
And this release will never cease

No, I
No, I
No, I can't get out of my head

No, I
No, I
No, I can't get out of my head

I get my head, hey
Uh, hey!
(Can't get out of my head)
Yeah, sometimes
Uncool, uptight
In my dreams my arms, myself is open wide
(Can't get out of my head)
(Can't get out of my head)

I'm not getting along...
