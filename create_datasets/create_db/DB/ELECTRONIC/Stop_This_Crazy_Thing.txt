Oh yeah
Stop this crazy thing!
See what they're doin'
People are starvin'
Children are cryin'
Animals are dyin'
Governments who lie to you
Don't let them tell you what to do
We gotta stop
Whooay
Stop this crazy thing!
Rock if you're rockin'
Shake if you're shakin'
Move if you're movin'
Skank if you're skankin'
Skankin'
Skankin'
Shabadoo
Shabadey
Stababastoo

Meanwhile back in the jungle: (Tarzan call)
Plans that they're dealin'
It's a world without a feelin'
So all that they're doin'
Drivin' us to ruin
Get up people
Get up people
Get up people and stop
Stop this crazy thing!
Rock if you're rockin'
Shake if you're shakin'

See'mon everybody
Let's do it right
Stop the fuss
Stop the fight
See'mon everybody
Let's do it right
Stop this crazy thing!
See'mon everybody
Te's all unite
All unite
Whether you black or white
See'mon everybody
Let's all unite
Stop this crazy thing!
We got the music
Play
We just can't refuse it
So what the music keep on playing
This is all I've got to say
(Tarzan call) Stop this crazy thing!
Rock if you're rockin'
Shake if you're shakin'

See'mon everybody
Let's do it right
