What can I do
Now that you say we're through?
I'm left with the blues in my heart.

How can I smile
When love don't seem worthwhile?
I'm left with the blues in my heart.

How can I live?
What is there life can give
As long as we're apart?

How can I go on
Knowing that you are gone?
I'm left with the blues in my heart.
