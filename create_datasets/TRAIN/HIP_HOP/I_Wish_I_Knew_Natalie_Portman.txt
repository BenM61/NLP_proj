I'm on the run for my life
It's seems that everything that you said was right
Has come undone, lost my sight
But have you ever thought you've done your best

When you were under the gun, that's right
I know. I've seen this place before
But it's never been so fun
Never been so fun

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

You know I'm haunted on overseas
Haunted on each coast
Play them like Ebaneeza
I made them see the ghost

Back from the future donned in Japanese kimonos
Even though the streets show love, try to see me grow
I often see me floatin', but my shadow it weighs a ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage

But I can't make you love me
This time it's on you
And you can't try to deny, these words when they're true
I'm on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me

Oh no, ay yo, cud get to steppin'
Your tongue is like a weapon
This is cappin' from heaven and yet so are ye's

Since the age of seventeen
I've been taking apart microphones
You've been taking apart men you've blown
With glowing skeleton bones

In the closet, animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat between us
But you need a woman's glorious style on diamond to fetus
Carry my penis, I'm like the man in the moon
When we kissed then you soon on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
