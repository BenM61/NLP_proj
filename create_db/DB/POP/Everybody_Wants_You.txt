Patience, get some self control
Feels like I'm waiting
Forever for this love
Is the grass greener
On the other side?
Maybe I'm a dreamer
When I look at you tonight

Everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
Everybody wants to have what they can have
Don't it drive you mad?
Everybody's on you
Everybody's on you
And I'm the one that wants to
Give something that will last
It's gonna drive me mad
'Cause I can't be without you
Can't be without you
Can't leave without you you now
I can't be without you
Can't dream without you
Can't be without
Can't be without you you now
You you now
You you now
Can't be without 
Can't be without you you now 
You you now
You you now
Can't be without you

I swear I miss you
It's only been one day
So I wanna kiss you
I think you met your match
So many people
Try to knock you down
You take your time
'Cause I'll still be around

Everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
Everybody wants to have what they can have
Don't it drive you mad?
Everybody's on you
Everybody's on you
And I'm the one that wants to
Give something that will last
It's gonna drive me mad
'Cause I can't be without you
Can't be without you
Can't leave without you you now
I can't be without you
Can't dream without you
Can't be without
Can't be without you you now
You you now
You you now
Can't be without 
Can't be without you you now 
You you now
You you now
Can't be without you

Can't be without you you now
You you now
You you now
Can't be without you, you, you

Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without (You you)
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without
Can't be without you you now 
You you now
You you now
Can't be without 
Can't be without you you now 
You you now
You you now
Can't be without
Can't be without you

Can't be without
Can't be without you
You you now
You you now
You you now
Can't be without you
