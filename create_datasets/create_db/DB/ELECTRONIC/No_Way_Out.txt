There is no way out 
I am stuck here behind the window 
Tangled in the wires and burned by electricity 
And there's no place left to go for me 
And there's no way out for me 

No way out, no way out for me 
I try to get to my feet 
Feels like I'm glued to my seat 
I try to crawl through the door 
Feels like I'm nailed to the floor 

No way out for me 
No way out, there is no way out for me 
Stranded in the great vast wasteland of my TV 
And there's no place left to go for me 
And there's no way out for me 

Somehow I don't feel the same 
I can't remember my name 
If there was only a chance 
to struggle out of this trance 

No way out for me 
No way out, there is no way out for me 

No way out 
I am stuck here behind the window 

No way out for me 
No way out, there is no way out for me 
There is no way out for me 
And there's no way out for me
