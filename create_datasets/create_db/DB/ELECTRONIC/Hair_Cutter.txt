Like a lake
They'll find nothing
Sometimes she watched it
Why would she touch it?
Like a soft mouth
Drinks with her navel
When she's feeling bad
Dusting, she wishes she were

And I hope
I feel good at home
Happy that I need you
You help me not to be
But there are some times
Things don't go like you want them to
You mean it

Like a little
Why does she heed it?
As strong as something
For a lovely customer
Help her sometimes
Better help her often
She kept on working
And sitting by a hair cutter

Hair cutter
My hair cutter

Yes
Yes
