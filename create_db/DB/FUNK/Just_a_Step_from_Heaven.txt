Tell me that we still belong 
Tell me that the will is still alive 
There must be another chance for us tonight 
'Cause everyone who's walked upon 
Trouble or lies, they come and go 
We can be the lucky ones 
And find love, after the storm 

Don't let go 
'Cause it's just a step from heaven 
And the strength of love is on our side 
Soon you'll find 
That our faith will take us higher 
'Cause we're just a step 
Baby just a step from heaven 

We don't need to justify our emotions 
We don't need to worry 'cause if they hold on 
There's a bigger destiny that was made for us 
So don't let troubles bring you down 
Believe in the foundation of our love 
Can't you see my faith in you 
Is forever and more 
Don't let go 
'Cause it's just a step from heaven 
And the strength of love is on our side 
Soon you'll find 
That our faith will take us higher 
'Cause we're just a step 
Baby just a step from heaven 
Heaven, oh yeah 
Heaven, oh yeah 

Baby can't you see 
This love was meant to be 
We can rise above this pain in our hearts 

Don't let go 'cause it's just a step from heaven 
And the strength of love is on our side 
Soon you'll find 
That our faith will take us higher 
'Cause we're just a step 
Baby just a step from heaven 
Heaven
