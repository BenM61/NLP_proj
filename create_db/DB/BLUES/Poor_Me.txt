Woke up this mornin'
Feelin' low
Where my loved one used to live
She ain't there no more

Poor me
Why does bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm livin' in misery

What I'm gonna do
Is hard to tell
I'm not gonna kill myself
Though I might as well

Poor me
Why does bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm livin' in misery

All I do
All day long
Fall down on my knees and pray
She'll come back home

Poor me
Why does bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm livin' in misery

All I do
All day long
Fall down on my knees and pray
She'll come back home

Poor me
Why does bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm livin' in misery
