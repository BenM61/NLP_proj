I had to call you on the phone
Because I feel so all alone
Don't like this being on my own
Can't ya, won't ya hurry home?

I'd leave the door unlocked in case
Like me you find you are out of place
I'd give the world to see your face
Can't ya, won't ya hurry home?

I've learned a lot that I didn't know
I was a fool when I let you go
Since you've been gone it's all very clear
Life is just an empty space without you near

I've made an awfully big mistake
Oh, what a difference love can make
Please give my heart another break
Can't ya, won't ya hurry home?

I've learned a lot that I didn't know
I was a fool when I let you go
Since you've been gone it's all very clear
Life is just an empty thing without you near

I've made an awfully big mistake
Oh, what a difference love can make
Please, please give my heart another break
Can't ya, won't ya hurry home?
