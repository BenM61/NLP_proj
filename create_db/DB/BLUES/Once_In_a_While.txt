Once in a while
Will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart
Once in a while
Will you dream of the moments 
I shared with you
Moments before we two drifted apart
In love's smolderin' ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
One spark may burn again
I know that I'd be
Contented with yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

Once in a while
Will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else
May be nearer your heart
