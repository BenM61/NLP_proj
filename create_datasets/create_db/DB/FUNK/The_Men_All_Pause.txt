I know I was lookin' good, I had my Kenneth Cole shoes on
My Gianni Versace blue leather suit
My nails were done and my hair was fierce
And I was riding in a Cooper's limousine, don't you want to ride?

I was at home feelin' sleazy
So I went down to the speak easy
As soon as my feet hit the door
I had all attention from the dance floor

Don't you know the men all pause?
When I walked into the room the men all pause
The men all pause when I walked into the room
The men all pause and the brides held their grooms

And they all sang the same old tune
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Starin' faces startin' to get tired
I wanted to get out and go for a ride
Maybe this boredom created my hunger
So I said, "Pull over at the local fat burger"

I tried to walk in shy, very unnoticed
But the men turned away from their burgers and sodas
The focus was on me, I guess admirin' good taste
I tried to play it off but assurance was all over my face

The men all pause
When I walked into the room
The men all pause the men all pause
And the brides held their grooms the men all pause

And they all sang the same old tune
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

The men all pause when I hit the door
Attention came from the dance floor
When I went to the burger stand
I had my claim on any man

Slap me, no, somebody slap me
'Cause I know I'm lookin' good
I'm givin' attitude all over the room
People are starin' at me
And I just look too good for these people

Don't you know the men all pause?
Yeah, just look at them
(Woof)
The dog is coming out of them
A natural dog Radar
(Woof)
Radar, kitty girl

I think I'm gonna leave right now
Because I have some things to do
Call my chauffeur
I love you, I love you all but I got to go

Oh, turn me on
The men all pause the men all pause
The men all pause the men all pause

Don't you know the men all pause?
When I walked into the room the men all pause
The men all pause when I walked into the room
The men all pause and the brides held their grooms

And they all sang the same old tune
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
