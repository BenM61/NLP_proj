I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you I feel something tells me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
I know everybody's gonna be lonely
We got the reason, we got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a weapon, I'll be more than you ever could dream of

I got you baby
I got you baby
I got you baby
I got you baby
I got you baby
I got you baby
I got you baby
