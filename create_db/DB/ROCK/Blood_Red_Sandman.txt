"They called me the Leather Apron
They called me the smiling Jack
They prayed to the heavens above
That I would never ever come back"

Can you hear how the children weep?
Chills of fear like a sawblade cutting deep

Once again there is pain
I bring flames - I bring cold
I'm the Blood Red Sandman coming home
On this unholy night I will make you my own
Blood Red Sandman
Coming home again

Red drops stain satin so white
"The way I sign my name"
The neighborhood's pretty dead at night
"And I'm the one to blame"

Scream all you want you won't wake up when you scream
"No-one leaves
The Monsterican Dream"
