Show me the golden gate
Blue sky and silver feathers
I wanna run away
Fall in love and see the sun
Sparrow in my way
Looking for hidden treasures
And every memory made
Tell me who knows what it's worth 

No paper cage
No map, no signs 
Let's lose our way
All that we got is time

Wander off the page
You never know what we might find
Why don't we take a little walk
Outside of the lines

Eyo eyo oh
Outside of the lines
Eyo eyo oh
Outside of the lines

Wander off the page
You never know what we might find
Why don't we take a little walk
Outside of the lines

Outside of the lines

Story on our arms
Loose bait, fadin' ether
I wanna go beyond
Show me how round is the earth
Stars until they're gone
You know it's now or never
And if we see the dawn
Tell me who knows what it's worth 
Who knows what it's worth
Who knows what it's worth

No paper cage
No map, no signs 
Let's lose our way
All that we got is time

Wander off the page
You never know what we might find
Why don't we take a little walk
Outside of the lines

Eyo eyo oh
Outside of the lines
Eyo eyo oh
Outside of the lines

Wander off the page
You never know what we might find
Why don't we take a little walk
Outside of the lines

Outside of the lines
Outside of the lines
Outside of the lines

No paper cage
No map, no signs 
Let's lose our way
All that we got is time

Wander off the page
You never know what we might find
Why don't we take a little walk
Outside of the lines
