I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like, oh, my gosh
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get rocked

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out and losing all control

Fill up my cup, mazel tov!
Look at her dancing, just dance along
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
Let's do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling
Tonight's the night

Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock

Easy come, easy go, now we on top

Feel the shot, body rock, rock it, don't stop

Round and round, up and down, around the clock
