In the morning 
On the beach there 
People gather 
To meet the sunshine 

With open arms 
Reaching for heaven 
With open hearts 
and open minds 

I found a lover 
By the seaside 
With sexy brown skin 
And haunting eyes 

Time keeps passing 
But no one cares 
Life for living 
Is the thing there 
Be yourself, be free 

2nd verse: 
In Bahia 
And in Rio 
In San Paulo 
In Brasilia 

Sandy beaches 
Cooling breezes 
Sexy women 
Calling to you 
For you aaaaahh... (continue aaahhs until break)
