There are the moments that we save
And the dreams that fade away
And sometimes they come together
And we can walk through the room we made, in the winter

On a bed, made of feather
When our hands held the answers
To life and love and nothing
To life and love, and some things

You just can't pull away
I waited for an answer
You turned towards me, leaving

Body of mine
Body of Christ
The tongue is left to dine
And takes its precious time

Your body alive
My body on fire
Give me the chance to burn
One last time

Watching from the shore
A house caught in storm breathes for the morning
And calls us, without warning and pleads
To the light in your eyes
Never stop your lanterns burning
I shield you like a candle

Body of mine
Body of Christ
Can I be the one who saves your life?

Your body alive
My body on fire
Can I be the one you hold tonight?
Can I be the one?
Can I be the one you hold tonight?
