Well if you see somebody knocking on your door
If you see somebody crawling out across the floor
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll be looking for you

If you see somebody in your living room hall
If you see somebody crawling up a totem pole
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll be looking for you

I'll be searching in the mountains
In the deep blue sea
Well I'll be looking in the fountains
I'll be climbing every tree

If you see something happening on a fishing hook
If you see a funny face in a comic book
Baby, it'll be me
I'll be looking for you

I'll be searching in the mountains
In the deep blue sea
Well I'll be looking in the fountains
I'll be climbing every tree

If you see something happening on a fishing hook
If you see a funny face in a comic book
Baby, it'll be me
I'll be looking for you
I'll be looking for you
I'll be looking for you
I'll be looking for you
