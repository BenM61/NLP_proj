And so many things I'd forgotten, 
In a world that we shared, 
With so many things for the asking. 
Never asked for the madness there.
Strange how I find myself 
So often on a distant shore. 

There's only one thing that's confusing. 
Was it you? Was it me? 
With so many questions unanswered 
Or was that part of your mystery? 
Strange how I find myself 
So often on a distant shore. 

So many things I'd forgotten.

So many things for the asking.

Strange how I find myself 
So often on a distant shore. 
How I find myself 
So often on a distant shore.
