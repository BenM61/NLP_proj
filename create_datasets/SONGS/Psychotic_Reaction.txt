Well I feel depressed I feel so bad
Cause you're the best girl that I've ever had

Now I can't get your love I can't get satisfaction
I only get a psychotic reaction
Sounds like this:

Well I feel so lonely night and day
If I can't get your loving I must stay away
Yeah I need you girl by my side
But how the hell, girls call Howie for a ride now

No I can't get your love I can't get satisfaction
I only get a psychotic reaction
It sounds like this:
