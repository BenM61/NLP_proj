Every day I walk some lonely street
Searchin' 'til you come back to me
People around just stop and stare
As if they know the hurt I bear
And suddenly I realize
I'm cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

'Cause I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And my heart feels much confusion
Since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless, since you're not around
I'm helpless

Oh I'm helpless
Since I lost your love
Helpless
'Cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
Ever since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless in this world of grieve
I need your words of confidence
I need those happy times we spent
I'm in a hopeless feel confusion
And your love is your solution

It's my fault
And I won't search for you no longer
As I go home alone
Needing you to stop

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
And my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In a helpless situation
And I need your consolation
And I'm having these strange illusions
