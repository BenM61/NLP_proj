Oh oh oh Lazy
You drive me crazy
Love is hazy
So I will love

A kid like you
Had to send me away
Left me on my back
I had a heart attack

Oh oh so lazy
You make me lazy
This love is hazy
So let me go

What do I do
When you turn blue
I didn't even know
You loved me so

Oh oh oh lazy (lazy)
You drive me crazy
This love is crazy (crazy)
So let me go
