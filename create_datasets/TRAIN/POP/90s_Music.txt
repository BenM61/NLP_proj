I've been driving 'round in my car
Rolled down the window beside ya
Blaring out loud of the broken speaker
(Everyday be listening to 90's music)

From that day we'd only be with one another
Gang hangs, bust the jams, meet my mother
There was nothing that could come between us
(Teens tearing up the streets)

(Everyday be listening to 90's music)

Stones at my window, like Romeo
Shot by Cupid with the bow and arrow
Old school, make me drool, roses at my door
(Everyday be listening to 90's music)

Romance from the book, sun-drunk desire
Summer night star-gaze, hands to the sky
You moved to the burbs, many words you meant
(Came back in a year and it just felt different)

Same old song I know
Won't get out of my head
Though the feeling's gone
The love ain't disappeared

But I've been missing what you love like, love like
I've been missing what you love like, love like
I remember what you love like, love like
I've been missing but it don't mean we can't spend
Time listening to
(Everyday be listening to 90's music)

TLC & Left Eye

Out to find me a house with the white picket fence
Wedded, tied to a new life present tense
Stopped at the drive-in of our spring fling
And then the radio played that song we used to sing

Hey, sometimes I think about it
Oh, you know I think about it
Hey, sometimes I think about it
(After all these years it just felt different)

Same old song I know
Won't get out of my head
Though the feeling's gone
The love ain't disappeared

But I've been missing what you love like, love like
I've been missing what you love like, love like
I remember what you love like, love like
I've been missing but it don't mean we can't spend
Don't remember what you love like, love like
I've been missing what you love like, love like
I remember what you love like, love like
I've been missing but it don't mean we can't spend
Time listening to
