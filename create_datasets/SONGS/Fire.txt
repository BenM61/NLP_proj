Fire! I'll take you to burn
Fire! I'm gonna take you to learn
I'll see you burn

You fought hard and you saved and earned
Now all of it's going to burn
In your mind, your tiny mind
You know you've been completely blind
Don't you dream of what you left so far behind?

Fire! To destroy all we've done
Fire! To end all we've become
I'll see you burn

You were living your life just like a little girl
Spreading your wings in the middle of this little world
In your mind your tiny mind
You know you've fallen far behind
Now you're gonna burn

Fire! You're gonna burn!
