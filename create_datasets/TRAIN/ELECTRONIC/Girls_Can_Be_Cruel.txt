Your honey smell makes me sick 
Your lies are spreading so thick 
Pins in your photo I stick 
Your lovers all gather round 
They laugh and cheer at your sound 
I'm all but lost in the crowd 
You don't need me to survive 
Too busy ruling your hide 
You barely know I'm alive 
Your a stranger when we kiss 
And if I cease to exist 
Just cross me off your list 
Just one sip of your behaviour and my senses tell me danger 

I'm getting sick of your shit
