Touch my heart feel the hurt it's destroying me
I've tried but can't seem to shake her memory
Touch my heart feel the hurt the pain and misery
Then tell me again what love can do for me

If you lived in my world awhile you'd soon forget how to smile
In my world there's a million ways to cry
If you had my eyes you could see how someone changed my destiny
I'm a man who can't live and yet can't die
Touch my heart feel the hurt...

Touch my heart feel the hurt...
