There's no sin in this: getting dressed to kill, 
laughing down the sun like a jackal will.
With his eyes ablaze and his lips apart 
he's gonna fill his cup with the love in your heart 
and drink it up til the morning starts.
Circulate the red light vistas.
Get the girls and get their sisters.
Pinch em up and give em blisters.
Kiss em fierce with all his might, forever.

Bye bye to another life.
Bye bye to another life.
Bye bye to another life.
Bye bye to another life.

Standing on the verge of the edge of the ledge, waiting for me to fall, but then I got a call.
It said "Wait, hold up homie!
You must be trippin!
You can't be putting that simping and whimping up in your pippin!
You better stand tall, fool you was born to ball.
Took a little fall and now you wanna end it all!
You've been chasing dreams like a hound dog on the hunt.
Take your place in the front.
Put your hand on the pump.
And it's right in your grasp, man.
I know they're laughing, but you'll be laughing later cuz time's are gonna get greater.
You's a player, and when I say player I mean player cuz your daddy and your uncle was a player.

Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?
Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?

Put yourself in your position.
You ain't wishin for no food and no warmth and no light, so you must be doing all right.

But wait a minute!
Something's wrong.
It's lunatic, it's mad, insane!
Busted like a water main.
Indulgence in another vein.

What they're saying round the neighborhood is what he's drinking's not aged in wood.

He's filling out.
He's all growed up.
He's all blowed up.
He's gotten fat.
He's filling out.
He's all growed up.
He's all blowed up.
He's gotten fat.

Sure enough at the midnight lounge there's a dent in the seat where the vampire sat.

Bye bye to another life.
Bye bye to another life.

Living dead is doing time, like drowning on the circle line.

Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?
Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?

Who's gonna cry over you?
Cry over you?
Tell me would they lie for you?
Die for you?
You're hoping that it's true for you do for you, fool.
But who's gonna cry?
