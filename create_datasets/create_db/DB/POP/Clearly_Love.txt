Where am I when you're not here
I see you but we're not clear
You wouldn't know
How could I show you

Where to look when I'm not here
You can hold and have me near
But when I go
How can I show you love

I just don't know
Who am I when you are you
I just don't know what to do
But when we're here
It's all so clearly love
