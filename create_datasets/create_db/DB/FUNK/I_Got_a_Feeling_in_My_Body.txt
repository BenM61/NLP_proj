When Moses walked the children out of Egypt land
He said now don't you worry we're in the lords' hands
He's gonna' walk beside us - the time is coming near
He's gonna wash away our misery and our fear

I got a feelin' in my body
Tomorrow'l be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' long the way

When Daniel faced the lion there wasn't any doubt - 
We've got to be like Daniel and the Lord will help us out

I got a feelin' in my body
Tomorrow'l be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' long the way

Won't you lift your eyes up children
Lift 'em to the sky
Heaven stands before you
Gates are of'en wide
Shelter for the weary
Comfort for the weak
We'll leave the devil's evil
Sweatin' on the stret

I got a feelin' in my body
Tomorrow'l be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' long the way
