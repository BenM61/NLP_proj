I'll go somewhere else I'll move to the couch it's darker in the dark it's darker in the day I forgot you were a liar now it's five to twelve shut up and smoke and I'll go somewhere else no more orange nightgowns one o'clock and then it ends this is no place to be addicted to another place never get to go don't you want me to make it I took as long as you took you take a lot from me I forgot you were a thief I want to be like her instead I stay nowhere marked down in the basement lousy at the bottom a life of intermission
