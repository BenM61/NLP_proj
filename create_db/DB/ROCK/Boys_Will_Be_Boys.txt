I've had nights I will never forget
I've had nights I will always regret
But I can take it on the chin and say...
Boys will be boys
There's been girls that have stolen our hearts
But their arms simply couldn't be prized apart
They will never let us in and say
Boys will be boys

Well it's under my skin so I could never win, oh thanks a lot
We cheat and we lie and we fight, we don't cry but we try
Ha!

I felt driven and I felt obliged
I've had feeling like thorn in my side
I hope you never let us down now
Boys will be boys

Blinded by sorrow I could hardly restrain
Everywhere there's guilt laboured with pain
Chin up, chin up now
Boys will be boys

(Ranking Junior)
Ah you said, you better move out the way
I come to keep the people rocking and sway
I'm well serious, I'll never ever play
Boys will be boys, and there's nothing you can say (way)

Spread the word I'll cross the land
Must make people understand
Wish I had a magic wand
To connect people united as one

this goes out to all the girls
On the mic might send you round the bend
Boys will be boys, listen right to the end!

Well it's under my skin so I could never win, oh thanks a lot
We cheat and we lie and we fight, we don't cry but we try
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys till the end
