Don't wanna think about it
Don't need a picture of it
I think we've traveled enough
No resolution to it, constant confusion
The kind that tears you up

So could we alter the lies?
Could we open the night?
The signs are screaming at us
The signs are screaming

Sad, but we will break it
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I can see you're faking
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now

I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now

Can't we just talk about it
Instead of skating from it?
I think we've wondered enough
Cold front with everybody
The bitter sweet embrace
Kind that fused too much

So could we alter the pace?
Could we open the race?
The signs are screaming at us
The signs are screaming

Sad, but we will break it
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I can see you're faking
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now

I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now

You're afraid of falling over the line
You're afraid of falling over the line
You're afraid of falling over the line
You're afraid of falling over the line

Sad, but we will break it
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I can see you're faking
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now

I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
I don't wanna leave you now
