Painted old lady
Collecting splinters on the bench
She's waiting to go to heaven
One-eyed old man
With his party hat on
Swears there is no hell
No hell

I know a girl who believes
A girl who believes
She used to be a dog

Elevator rising
I wonder what's on the top floor
The numbers are on the wall
The sun also rises
And the shadows soon fall
I keep looking to the sky

I know a girl who believes
A girl who believes
She used to be a dog

It don't matter what I say
'Cause no one is right and no one is wrong
I guess that we'll find some day
That no one was right
And no one was wrong

I know a girl who believes
A girl who believes
She used to be a dog
