How many times must we tell them
Are they never gonna learn

How many times must we tell them
Are they never gonna learn
This is sacred ground, sacred ground

How many times must we tell them
Are they never gonna learn
This is sacred ground, sacred ground

For all those trying to make a stand,
Fighting to save their
Tribal land, for all those trying to make a stand,
Dying to protect their tribal land
For all those dying to protect their tribal land

Rainbow warriors, Chico Mendez
All the dissidents that they tried to suppress

How many more martyrs
Must there be will this be our poisoned
Legacy how many times must us tell them
Are they never gonna learn
This is sacred ground, sacred ground
How many times we must tell them
Are they never gonna learn
This sacred ground, sacred ground

For those who lie before the bulldozers
And chainsaws
Battling the devouring megacorps
Here they come with their cash draws grins
Vampires, parasites and vermin

How many times must we tell you
Are they never gonna learn
This sacred ground, sacred ground
How many times must we tell you
Are you never gonna learn
This sacred ground, sacred ground

How many times
How many times
