Falling over backwards for you, falling over everybody else
I put myself in that position every single time I had the chance
I know it's not my business to be digging up these things I should've known
But twenty years of bad decisions haven't taught me much at all

I permit the advance you're making; everyone pretends it's not your fault 
And all of this offense you're taking doesn't bother me at all
Twist my arm if that's the way you think you're gonna work this whole thing out
You know you own my body, but don't think you control my mouth

(Having every question answered isn't going to help at all)

When you're not supposed to know
Anything

Another textbook situation, everything I think I know I've read
What's the point if medication only makes me wish that I were dead?
It's pretty clear that you want me; it's written here on every single page
Spitting blood, not stupid, I can read it all over your face
