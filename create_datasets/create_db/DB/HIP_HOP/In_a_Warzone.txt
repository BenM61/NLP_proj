Civil war, civil arrest
Civil disobedience, civil aggress
Out of sight and out of mind
You're out of bounce, you're out of time
He's got no weapons, his takes got the means
The risk of no protection is worst that it seems
Play your part, play the role
Protect your life, protect your soul

Human rights, watch it go
Watch you live, partying in soul
Drunk with power, fast outrage
Sad and settle, plans engaged
They pack blazers right to hell
Death to death, curtings found
Burning cause, burning wind mills
Above the wind, shutters to the children
