I'm so afraid of night 'cause I'm too romantic
Moonlight and stars can make such a fool of me
You know you're much too near, and I am too romantic
Wouldn't I be a sight on a bended knee

I'm startled when you whisper
I'll run if you should sigh
I must be so careful
Or I'll kiss my heart goodbye

You shouldn't let me dream 'cause I'm too romantic
Don't make me fall unless it could all come true
