The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor 
The bass and the tweeters make the speakers go to war
Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor

Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at
Tell me, tell me, where the freaks at 
Freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, freaks at

Tell me where the freaks at

We get that bass thumpin', people jumpin' all over the world
We got them speakers pumpin', Timmy Trumpet for the woman with curves
Got that freak flow, freak show
Welcome to the circus
Let the leaders lead, preachers preach
Welcome to the service

Close the curtains on 'em if they're actin' like they never heard us
See we do this for a purpose just to keep that fire burnin'
And we don't need no water let that mother-mother-burn
Timmy play your trumpet let the people go berserk

Ah, the mighty trumpet brings the freaks out to the floor

Freaks at, freaks at, freaks at, freaks at

Tell me where the freaks at
