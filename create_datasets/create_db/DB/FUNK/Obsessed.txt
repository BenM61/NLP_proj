Baby, you got somethin' special
Your body is a work of art
But we got a little issue
I feel your chest, but I can't find your heart
Got more muscles than the ocean
Sculpted like an ancient god
For love yourself, but no emotion
Yeah, I like to touch, but I can't feel no love

You're lookin' in my eyes just to see your own
See your own reflection, your own reflection
Your body's overpriced 'cause you pay yourself
Way too much attention, too much attention

You're so obsessed with yourself
Maybe you should undress with yourself? Hey
Get a table for two, your ego and you
Take him home and make a move
So obsessed with yourself, obsessed with yourself

Baby, like your lady special
Picture perfect beauty bells
Only lookin' surface level
That's if you can take your eyes of yourself
Gonna end up with nobody, nobody
Even though we form a line, ooh yeah
But I don't even think you're worried
If you've got a mirror, baby, you're fine

You're lookin' in my eyes just to see your own
See your own reflection, your own reflection
Your body's overpriced 'cause you pay yourself
Way too much attention, too much attention

You're so obsessed with yourself (ah you're so)
Maybe you should undress with yourself? (Undress with yourself) Hey
Get a table for two, your ego and you
Take him home and make a move
So obsessed with yourself (obsessed), obsessed with yourself

You're so obsessed with yourself (yeah)
Maybe you should undress with yourself? (Undress with yourself) Hey
Get a table for two, your ego and you
Take him home and make a move (yeah)
So obsessed with yourself, obsessed with yourself

Do it, baby, like you do
I love it and I hate it too
Do it, baby, like you do
'Cause I'm obsessed with myself too
