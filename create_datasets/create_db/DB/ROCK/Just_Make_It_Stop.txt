If I could just make it stop
I could tell the whole world
To get out of the way
If I could just make it stop

If I could just make it stop
Breaking my heart
Get out of the way
If I could just make it stop

You see I'm close to the edge
I'm at the end of my rope
The rope is starting to thread
I'm trying to keep my hold
You say I'm something I'm not
But I'm not what I seem
Get my back off the wall
If I could just make it stop

If I could just make it stop
I could tell the whole world
To get out of the way
If I could just make it stop

If I could just make it stop
Breaking my heart
Get out of the way
If I could just make it stop
If I could just make it stop

Now I'm looking up
From a ten foot hole
Seeing nothing but blue sky
Shining on my soul
As I untie the chord
And untwist the knot
We could get where we're going
If I could just make it stop

If I could just make it stop
I could tell the whole world
To get out of the way
If I could just make it stop

If I could just make it stop
From breaking my heart
Get out of the way
If I could just make it stop
If I could just make it stop
