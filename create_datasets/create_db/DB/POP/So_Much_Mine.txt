Where'd you get that dress?
Where'd you learn to walk like that?
Don't talk back
Tell me where you've been - maybe I don't want to know
Oh, Lord, why me?

You were so much, so much mine, now I reach for you
And I cannot find you
So much, so much mine, now I reach for you
And I cannot find you

So much mine
So much mine
So much mine

You know you've got my hands,
And you've got your father's eyes 
Lovely, bold eyes
I know that it's not fair, but things aren't always what they
Seem, and now I worry so 

Where you'll lay your head, where you'll sleep tonight,
Way up high, why, oh why can't I
Someone's pillow's cold, someone loved you so,
And bluebirds sang, "There's no place like home"
(They sang)

Where's the heart in me that made the one in you so cold,
Please don't go
'Cause I know where you got that dress, I know where you
Learned to walk like that

'Cause you were so much, so much mine
Now I reach for you
And I cannot find you
So much, so much mine
Now I reach for you and I cannot find you

(Where you'll lay your head, where you'll sleep tonight,
Way up high, why, oh why can't I
Someone's pillow's cold, someone loved you so,
And bluebirds sang, "There's no place like home"
They sang)

So much mine
So much mine
So much mine
So much mine, so much mine
