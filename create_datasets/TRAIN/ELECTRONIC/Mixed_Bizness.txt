I'm mixing business with leather
Christmas with Heather
Freaks flock together
And make all the be-boys scream

All right
Turn it up now
All right
Turn it up now

Word up to the man thing
She's always cold lamping
Visine at the canteen
I just want to watch you dance

Do you want to ride on the Baltic Sea
I'll be your mistress C.O.D.
I'll comb your hair 
Re-write your diary 
Pour champagne on a honey bee

She can really do me
She can look right through me
And make all the be-boys scream

I'm mixing fitness with leather
Homework with Heather
Freaks flock together
And make all the lesbians scream

All right
Turn it up now
All right
Turn it up now
