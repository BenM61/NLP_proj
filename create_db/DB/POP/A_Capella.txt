Oh yeah

Little boy, lift your head and carry on
We're gonna save your life
With an a cappella song
With a scooby scoob
And a bap chooiah
Little boy, you're gonna be just fine
Ooh woolen hats
Ah bap, leather straps
Ooh smile
Look on your face like you know jesus personally

(So what makes a cappella so cool?
Well, you only need your voice
And nothing else!)

We don't need any drums
All we need is John
We don't need any trumpet
When we've got Tom
We don't even need an uber app
We just bap
Open up
Take me home
Here it is, now stop
That is a cappella to me
Boodelooap

Everybody's wondering why we're singing
Boodelooap
That's because they've never tasted
Boodelooap
Nigerian soft drink
Boodelooap
One sip and you never go back

Boodelooap!

Now, let's go fight those bullies
With a cappella's strongest weapon
It's the, 'we can do any style' trick
Come on
Rock!

Come on
Hip hop rap!
Yo yo yo
Gangsta man
My vocal cords
Is my gun

Hey g-man
Come on the tour bus and live the dream life with us
Oh sorry g-man, I want to stay here with the gang
I know it's a tough life, but it's my life
Oh g-man, I hope you learned something today
You bet! Don't worry about me now
I don't, I trust in you, you know a cappella now
I do?
But hey, before I leave
Give me a style and an artist
Michael jackson? Samba?
You got it!
