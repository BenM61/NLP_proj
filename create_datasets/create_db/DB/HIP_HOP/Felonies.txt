what's up with partner, Where he live, Where he stay at 
Where the ice, where the bread, where the cake at? 
I'm telling you man you don't want it with dem boyz,

[DUKE] 
I'm sick & I'm tired of niggas asking bout mine 
If I'm cockin that iron, I'm telling you I'm sending them signs 
I move fast forward I ain't got no button to rewind 
I react of instinct I ain't stressin no time 
I came a long way from peddlin rocks 
Block recognized the gansta & he up my stock 
Showed me the recipe & other grams I copped 
Home ain't a home withoutta arm & hammer box 
Shit, Jeezy just be being on that cell 
Got them pre-teen numbers I like, like R.Kelly (I got that work nigga) 
Lotta niggas they be claimin the spot 
But we the only ones that still represent it like mascots 
So ask not why my attitude is shitty 
Step aside why a real nigga move the city, huh 
From my block to your block niggas know me 
They know that ole reppin ass niggas a O.G. 
We use to rock flip-flops, tube socks with gold teeth 
& A flip flop crease with gold shoes on all they feet 
Please believe we ain't playing no games 
But I will take a charge if you try to drive my lane 
Plus I gotta donkey dick to drive the broads in sane 
I'm a street cat, shit you know I'm hard to tame

I'm telling you man I be rollin on dem corners no Range no necklace man 
Range Rover no rims left they neck in da pain 
& Put the silencer on the tip professional man 
Pressure point blank like a sexual change 
& Splitcha head down the middle like a sectional man 
Hard blow to hard coat exsposen the four 
Even though I tote gun I don't rob no more 
Now here I go on the patio with a flat head screwdriver 
Prying on the side door in a gat proof suit liner 
Calm but I'm wide open they act I'm do something 
Quite its going down on em with a Mac 11 two rifle 
Pistol, pumps, switch & knives, 
Pistol grips, smoked clips, nighsticks & plyers 
No myth I'm him fucka get hypnotized 
Now get killed in da mist we suggest you ride

While y'all out spending 100's on your necks 
Spending 100's on your wrist, spending 100's on your rims
