Well, now I never went to college, babe
I did not have the luck
Stole out of Indiana 
On the back of a pickup truck
No education higher
Than the streets of my hometown
I went looking for a fire just to burn it all down

You got a real fine love
You got a real fine love
One I am unworthy of
You got a real fine love, girl

Thought I had a line of something
Baby, no one else could say
They couldn't find it in their hearts to just get out my way
And out of nowhere, and for nothing
You came into my life
I've seen an angel or two before
But I never asked one to be my wife

You got a real fine love
You got a real fine love
One I am unworthy of
You got a real fine love, girl

You can sprinkle all your teardrops
Across the evening sky
But you cannot hide that twinkle
Starlight in your eye
I left my map way back there, baby
I don't know where we are
But I'm gonna pull my pony up
Hitch my wagon to your star

You got a real fine love
You got a real fine love
One I am unworthy of
You got a real fine love, girl

Well, now the babies are sleeping
And the twilight's giving in
She looks like you
He looks like her
And we all look like him
Well, maybe it's just a little thing
The way I feel tonight
A little joy, a little love, and a whole lot of light

You got a real fine love
You got a real fine love
One I am unworthy of
You got a real fine love, girl
