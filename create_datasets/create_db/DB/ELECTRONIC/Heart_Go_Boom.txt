Sitting on a bench in the sunshine
Filling up my belly with some fine wine
All locked up in the afternoon
Kiss my baby and my heart go boom
Make my heart go boom-boom

Diddly-bop, diddly-bop, diddly-bop, boing
Diddly-bop, diddly-bop, diddly-bop, boing
Diddly-bop, diddly-bop, diddly-bop, boing
Diddly-bop, diddly-bop, diddly-bop, boing

Make my heart go boom-boom
