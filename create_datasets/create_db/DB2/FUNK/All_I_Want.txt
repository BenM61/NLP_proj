There was a time, not too long ago
You and I we're still believeing
We could of made it on our own
But I was blind to our situation
I needed you more
More than I ever dreamed of
Been thinkin about you
Through all my lonely nights
Without you in these arms
I thee want

All I want
All I ask of you
All I need
Is for you to be holding me forever
You're my superstar
And this love, I will defend
Til the day that we're together
I'll be missing you

I should've known
That it was so hard to do
How could I been away so long?
So long without you
With or without
Anybody else
There's only you
Been thinkin about you
Through all my lonely nights
Without you in these arms
I thee want

All I want (All I want)
All I ask of you
All I need
Is for you to be holding me forever (holding me)
You're my superstar
And this love, I will defend (I will defend)
Til the day that we're together
I'll be missing you

I'm wondering if you're ever be coming back
Take your time
To show me you care
Too many lovers fall along the way
And I don't want to be alone (alone)

All I want (All I want)
All I ask of you
All I need
Is for you to be holding me forever (holding me)
You're my superstar
And this love, I will defend (I will... yeah)
Til the day that we're together
I'll be missing you

Til the day that we're together
I'll be missing you
