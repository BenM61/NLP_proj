This is so weird
Am I sleeping? Is this a dream? 
No!
Am I a Mouse?
Am I an elephant?
And I had just sliced your tongue

So tell me he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-hey
Do you wanna drink some alcohol?
I'm just a boy (girl) but I have a very strong punch
And I had just broken your nose

Am I a horse?
Am I on fire?
Am I the curse?
Am I the curse?

So tell me he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-hey:
Do you wanna drink some alcohol?
