A different time, 
A different place,
A different world,
You never know.
Allocate,
Immediate,
And separate,
You never know.
'Cause I am torn again
And I am trapped again.
Another time,
A separate place,
A cheating world,
You never know.
Choose the one,
The others' gone,
You got it wrong,
You never know.
'Cause I am torn again
And I am trapped again
'Cause time won't heal the pain, you know.
'Cause time is what's to blame, you know,
You know, you know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I am torn again
And I am trapped again.
'Cause time won't heal the pain, you know.
'Cause time is what's to blame, you know,
You know, you know,
