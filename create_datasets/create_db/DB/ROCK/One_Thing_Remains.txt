You don't know it all 
I've got you figured out 
So proud, walking tall 
is what you're all about 

What you are is what you make 
Don't know how to give and take 
Blame it all on someone else 
Everyone except yourself 

One step forward 
never seems to get you nowhere 
Sinking faster 
In you go 

You want to save they day 
so you grab on the reins and run in circles 
You're going to crash and drag the world down with you 
Only one thing remains 

Hey man be aware 
Better watch yourself today 
I know he don't care 
about you anyway 

You can run but you can't hide 
from the guilt you built inside 
All the lies they won't forget 
Never will get over it 

Thinking backwards 
How the hell did this get started 
Drowning faster 
Down you go 

You want to save they day 
so you grab on the reins and run in circles 
You're going to crash and drag the world down with you 
Only one thing remains
