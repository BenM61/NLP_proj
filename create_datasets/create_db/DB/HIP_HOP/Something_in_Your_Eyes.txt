Oh, yeah
You like that
So lay your head back
Here we go
You like that
Feels good
Oh, yeah

You ask me why I say why not
Anything is possible and anything can be
Therefore tonight I'll get you hot
You feel the passion you never dreamed

And I know you feel I'm over-confident
What kind of man could I be
It's clear to see it's like animal attraction
When you add it up it's just a matter of fractions, girl

Something in your eyes told me
That you were lookin' for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes are givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

If think you're dry, I say you're wet
I can make it possible, I can make it true
And all night long I'll make you sweat
Gonna do a feelin' that long past overdue

And I know you think why so much confidence
What kind of man must I be
It's clear to see it's like adding and subtracting
When you add it up, it's just animal attraction

Something in your eyes told me
That you were lookin' for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes are givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

Something in your eyes told me
That you were lookin' for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes are givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

So when I get inside and make you wet
I'll lick you dry
Make your body weak from all the body heat
Just like a lion you'll hear me roar
And then I beat into your body, make that body get weak some more
I'll take you to the peak, I'll make you want to scream
And like a lion you'll hear my body roar and roar and roar and roar and roar

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Something in your eyes told me
That you were lookin' for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes are givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

Anything is possible and anything can be
You can feel the passion you never ever dreamed of
See it in your eyes, you're givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

It was something in your eyes told, made me feel
Something in your eyes and hey, I could see it
Something in your eyes are givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

Something in your eyes told me
That you were lookin' for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes are givin' me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on
