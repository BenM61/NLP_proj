Floating on the water ever changing picture
Hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams

The ocean takes me in to watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight we ride

Cruising through the city after hours
With me fusing all our powers
Here's to all our dreams
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight we ride
