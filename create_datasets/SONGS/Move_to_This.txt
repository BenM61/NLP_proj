Move to this

The way that you walk, the walk of a king
The way that you look, oh, you tell me something
The way that I feel, oh, baby, I want you, you

So send me a sign sealed with a kiss
Don't wait in that line or you're gonna miss
The chance of your life to do something good, so good

We could be sharing a little bit of Heaven
If everything goes our way
If you can do it like I want you do it it, baby
Love is on its way

Move to this, if you wanna be my lover
Move to this, if you wanna be my everything
Move to this, if you wanna be discovered
Move to this, if you wanna be my special thing

The look in your eyes is teasing my heart
Just look at my love, ooh, it's raring to start
So send me a sign and capture my soul, soul

We could be sharing a little bit of Heaven
If everything goes our way
If you can do it like I want you to do it, baby
Love is on its way

Move to this, if you wanna be my lover
Move to this, if you wanna be my everything
Move to this, if you wanna be discovered
Move to this, if you wanna be my special thing

We could be sharing a little bit of Heaven
If everything goes our way
If you can do it like I want you to do it, baby
Love is on its way

Move to this, if you wanna be my lover
Move to this, if you wanna be my everything
Move to this, if you wanna be discovered
Move to this, if you wanna be my special thing

Move to this, if you wanna be my lover
Move to this, if you wanna be my everything
Move to this, if you wanna be discovered
Move to this, if you wanna be my special thing

Move to this, if you wanna be
Move, if you wanna be
Move to this, if you wanna be
