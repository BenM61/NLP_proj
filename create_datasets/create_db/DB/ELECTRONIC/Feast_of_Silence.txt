There is a storm coming
And it is headed straight for our shore
Hold on to your heart, I've seen the signs before
How wicked these, how wicked these hours

These times we've seen
How we built these odes to our God
Wasting our tears and chasing our fears
I look at these, I look at these and wish this was gone

Don't say another word
Some things are better kept silent
Don't say another word
Leave in silence, let me live in silence

There is nothing left in this beggar's hand
I gave like I give to my God
Nothing is sacred within these walls

That I built and you built in our shame, in our fear
In this room full of yesterday's ghosts
Who am I? I ask as I shatter and fall

Don't say another word
Some things are better kept silent
Don't say another word
Leave in silence, let me hear in silence
Let me feast in this silence
