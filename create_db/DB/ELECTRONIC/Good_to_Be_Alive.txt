Don't crucify if I feel alive
It's a natural high and I'm satisfied

Absolved from sin
I called the devil from within
He told me live my life
Don't let them criticize

It's good to be alive
Sometimes I wonder how I survived
And in my minds eye
When you're low no-one seems to know
A fallen angel tonight
I feel no shame when I'm high
It feels so good must be right
It feels so good inside
Inside

I'd love to love you but I'm too impure an angel X3
I'd love to love you

Don't compromise
You don't live my life
'Cos l don't judge you
When i look in your eyes

lt's good to be alive
Sometimes I wonder how I survived
And in my mind?s eye
When you're low no-one seems to know
A fallen angel tonight
I feel no shame when I'm high
It feels so good must be right
It feels so good inside
Inside

I'd love to love you..
