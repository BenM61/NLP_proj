Like morning will keep us
Locked in our arms
Roses for weepers
Not easy to charm
And I am not a fool

So get on that bus now
And ride it on home
Lone in the back seat
With no telephone
And I am not a fool

If you want to take the world on I will
Be right there beside you
But if you want to sleep the whole day through I will
Be right there beside you

Outside they're waiting
The people in white
It's crying anticipating
For someone to fight
And I am not a fool

If you want to take the world on I will
Be right there beside you
But if you want to sleep the whole day through I will
Be right there beside you

If you want to take the world on I will
Be right there beside you
If you want to take the world on now I will
Be right there beside you
