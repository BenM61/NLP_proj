Flash the darkness
Fill the night
Turn the love into light
We're the ones, the ones He said
To lead the lost to arms outspread

Shine a light and they will see
Be a hook and set them free
'Cause it's true that we're all soulbait

When they see me
Do they see you?
Do they see something else I do?
Dangle me on a line
In a bowl where fish are blind

Shine a light and they will see
Be a hook and set them free
'Cause it's true that we're all soulbait

Something special something real
Way down deep in me soul...bait!

Shine a light and they will see
Be a hook and set them free
'Cause it's true that we're all soulbait

Shine a light and they will see
Be a neon effigee
Yes it's true that we're all soulbait, soulbait

Deep water, my destiny

Soulbait!
Soulbait!
