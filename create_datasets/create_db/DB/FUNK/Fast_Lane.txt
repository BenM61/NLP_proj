Hey, living in the fast lane
Driving fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimping through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone

Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinning
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

It started when they birthed me
Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come
Little older now and can't wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like telling is in 
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matching the car
All white, slinging all night
So we rapidly spar
That's what they want to clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane
