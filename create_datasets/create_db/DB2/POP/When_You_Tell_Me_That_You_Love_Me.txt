I wanna feel this way
Longer than time
I wanna know your dreams
And make them mine
I wanna change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I wanna do

I wanna hold you close under the rain
I wanna kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

I wanna make you see
Just what I was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

In a world without you (without you)
I would always hunger
All I need is your love to make me stronger

And baby
Every time you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

When you tell me that you love me
When you tell me that you love me
When you tell me that you love me
