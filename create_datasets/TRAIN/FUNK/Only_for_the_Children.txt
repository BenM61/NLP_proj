Give all that you have to give
When she estranged you
And bitterly blamed you
'Cause she's so unhappy

Give, swallowing compromise
Though it won't matter
Your so near the chatter of her
Winding (Incomprehensible) up you

Somehow so far
All the demands that never seem to win
You try to withstand
All of her mood, her childish attitudes

Only for the children
I keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
My love survives

Give though it means sacrifice
You feel temptation
But your imitation of hope
Must satisfy

You give, though it means you ignore
The lack of affection
And constant rejection destroyed
Though it hurts you

To swallow my pride, toss it aside
Though deep inside of me
I feel that through life
Living this life knowing it has to be

Only for the children
I keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
Our love survives

Only for the children
I keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
My love survives

Only for the children
I keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
My love survives

Only for the children
I keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
