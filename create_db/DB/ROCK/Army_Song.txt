Got my marching orders in the morning post
When I read the letter I thought it was a joke

You gotta fight fight for what you want
You gotta fight fight for what you want
You gotta fight fight for what you want
But why should we fight when the battle is yours

I don't wanna fight in world war three
Don't wanna fight the japanese
Cause there's no honour in dying for the love of your country

And who are you to tell me I gotta fight in a war?
It won't be the same as '39 in 1984
