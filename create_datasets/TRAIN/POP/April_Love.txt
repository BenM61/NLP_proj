April love is for the very young
Every star's a wishing star that shines for you
April love is all the seven wonders
One little kiss can tell you this is true
Sometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet
But April love can slip right thru your fingers
So if she's the one, don't let her run away
