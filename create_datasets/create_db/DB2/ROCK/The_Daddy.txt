I know that you don't understand
The reason why he ask you where've you been
So you dug into your room and tell him
You were hanging out with some of your girlfriends
But did you ever stop and think
Maybe he just wants to know if you had a good time

And if he asks you why do you wear
Your blue jeans when they're old and torn
Well, he don't know that blue jeans
Do not have no soul until they are fainted and warm
But don't take it all to hard 'cause he's just trying to be
A part of your life, yes, he is

And if he does not like to hear the music you are playing
Well, maybe he don't understand the words we are saying
But he is still the man who brought you into this world
And he's got to live here too and a little respect
A little respect will never hurt you, oh yeah

And if he says your hair is more becoming
When it does not hang so long
Just tell him when the cold wind blow
It covers up your ears and keeps you warm
Uh, don't take it all to hard 'cause he is just trying to be
A part of your life, yes, he is

And if he does not like to hear the music you are playing
Well, maybe he don't understand the words we are saying
But he is still the man who brought you into this world
And a little respect, a little respect will never hurt you
Oh no, it won't

And if he says your hair is more becoming
When it does not hang so long
Just tell him when the cold wind blow
It covers up your ears and keeps you warm

Oh don't take it all to hard
'Cause he is just trying to be a part of your life
The man is trying, he may not know how
But he's trying to be a part of your life, oh yeah
