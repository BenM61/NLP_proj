Nights don't come any longer
Days seem to last forever
Nothing you can do
Could bring him back to you
Forever blue

Trying hard to force a smile behind your tears
Though you try these memories won't disappear
Your heart's still beating out of time

Nights don't come any longer
Days seem to last forever
Nothing you can do
Could bring him back to you
Forever blue

Memories don't come stronger
Dreams lost and gone forever
Softly whispering
Won't bring him back to you
Forever blue

Close your eyes but you still see, though love is blind
Though you try just can't leave the past behind
He's on your mind

You'll forget him
Like he forgot you
Nothing you could do
Could bring him back to you
You'll be forever blue

Nights don't come any longer
Days seem to last forever
Nothing you can do
Could bring him back to you
Forever blue

Memories don't come stronger
Dreams lost and gone forever
Softly whispering
Won't bring him back to you
Forever blue
