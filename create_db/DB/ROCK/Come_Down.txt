Open up and let me in
I was lucky to live, don't need to win
Forgave myself and if that's a sin
It's not enough you'd even know it
You did right to call my bluff
'Cause I won't say when I've had enough
And I worked so hard to need this stuff
And you tried so long to just ignore it

Won't you come down where I am
Words are hidden, understand

I won't repeat myself again
I will not repeat myself again
It's another promise D.O.A.
And despite my every hope there is no truth
Behind my best intentioned oath
 
Won't you come down where I am
Words are hidden, understand
Won't you come down
Been away to long, I know I have

Won't you come down, help me stand
There is healing in your hands
Won't you come down where I am
Words all leave me
Been away too long
I know I've been away too long
I know I have
