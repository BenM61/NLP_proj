Little brother's got a habit
That he thinks he's getting under control
And he's selling all our love and best wishes as the hunger grows
Living by the scripture on the subway wall
He wants to be a rebel but he can't find a cause.

He needs something to believe in
He needs something to believe in
All he ever wanted was to get away

Little sister's getting serious with a fella nearly twice her age
And she's aiming to move in with him
As soon as they can find a place
But there's no getting through to her, there's no other way,
You can't learn from mistakes that somebody else made.

She needs something to believe in
She needs something to believe in
All she ever wanted was to get away

Caught in the void of no hope and no choice
It's a nobody wins situation
What can they do? it's a catch-22
It's a breakdown in communication

Little wonder they're confused, no wonder we misunderstand
Little wonder there's a wind of change blowing through the land,
Nobody's guilty, it's a sign of the times
But we won't see the future till we open our eyes

We need something to believe in
We need something to believe in
Something to believe in
We need something to believe in
Something to believe in
We need something to believe in
All he ever wanted was to get away
