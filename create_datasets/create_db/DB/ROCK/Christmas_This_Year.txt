As fall rides off in the sunset
I sweep the snow from my doorstep
I just can't help but stop and grin
It's like I'm ten years old again
And everywhere I go I can feel it
Some say it moves like a spirit

It falls on us once a year
Like it came on a midnight clear
It's all love the season is a gift
When love came down to let us live
Let's open up and let our hearts embrace this moment

For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound gonna make it loud
For Christmas this year
We're gonna make some noise let the world rejoice
For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

The laughter starts
Before the sunrise
I sneak downstairs to sparkling eyes
And oh what joy it brings to me
Our family around our Christmas tree
And I thank the Lord for his favor
As we sing the songs of the Savior (our Savior)

It's all love the season is a gift
When love came down to let us live
Let's open up and let our hearts embrace this moment

For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound gonna make it loud
For Christmas this year
We're gonna make some noise let the world rejoice
For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

Holy Holy holy
God is coming near
Unto us a Savior's born
On a midnight clear

Holy Holy holy
God is coming near
Unto us a Savior's born
On a midnight clear

Oh For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound gonna make it loud
We're gonna make some noise let the world rejoice
For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

For Christmas this year
Gonna make a sound gonna make it loud
For Christmas this year
We're gonna make some noise let the world rejoice
For Christmas this year
For Christmas
For Christmas this year

Holy Holy holy
God is coming near
Unto us a Savior's born
On a midnight clear
