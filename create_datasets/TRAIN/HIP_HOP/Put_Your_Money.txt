Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

(Ludacris)
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they see-note stacks
Busting dominoes, spades, Cee-lo, craps
We shooting pool at the Luda-plex, I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools want to do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you want to do
But come up short and oh the things that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm making 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase, scared money don't make none!

Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

(Ludacris)
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gambling problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
Drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowing steam
Counting green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the strength to the block
Yes sir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's goin' do it
It's people living they life coming up off change
And hustlers paying they bills coming up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate, catch me out in A.C.
Calling yo' bluff with Puff eating cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers

Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

(Ludacris)
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breaking the whole casino and doing back-flips, man
Cameras eying us, sidebetters trying us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buying us
Trying to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breaking 'em, and dice still shaking 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em

Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
