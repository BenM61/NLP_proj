Her daddy got a big aeroplane
Her mommy holds all the family cash
A beautiful rose, I stay at the corner
She is living in and out of tune

Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C

Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C
Your vitamin C

A monster press machine in on her body
While she is stepping on the quicksand
A beautiful rose, stay at the corner 
She is living in and out of tune

Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C

Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C
Your vitamin C

Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C

Hey you
You're losing, you're losing, you're losing, you're losing your vitamin C
