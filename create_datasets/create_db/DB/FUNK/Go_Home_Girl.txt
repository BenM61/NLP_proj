Well, me and frank were the best of friends
And our friendship will never end
But it would hurt him so for him to know
That Im in love with his girlfriend

Now, the love of a girl and the love of a friend
Are two things you cant compare
Though my heart will ache I will let it break
cause I know that it just aint fair
So go on home girl, lets call it a night
You better go home girl, this just aint right

But before you go I want you to know
That I love you, yes I do
And though it breaks my heart for us to part
Still I know frank loves you too

Well, you say that a we can make him see
We have a love thats really real
But I think that he is just like me
And I dont know just how hed feel

Darling, people know it would hurt him so
If you told him that it must end
And I could never hold the love I stole
From a man I call my best friend

Go on home girl, you better go home, girl
Go on home, you better move on

Me and frank been friends for so long
And our friendship is really strong
He gives me his car to go for a ride
Never knows how long Ill be gone

Well, Im trying to forget all the things that weve done
While frank is just a-waiting back home
Girl you cant go ride with me anymore
Thats the way its got to be from now on

Go on home!
Uhn, hun. better go home, girl
Uhn, hun. now you better move on, girl
Uhn, hun. better go home, girl
Uhn, hun. you better move on, girl
