Cigarette ends on a nightclub floor
All the people you know are going to the door
You danced all night tried again and again
But you could breathe no life into the tired veins

New Year's Eve it's the lowest tide
There's a burning emptiness inside
Out into the night and the winter's air
But you know you can't face another year

Don't go to the bridge of sorrow
Don't go to the bridge of sorrow

You don't belong to a respectable scheme
You don't belong in the mainstream
You don't belong in the material world
You try to talk you were never heard
So you're keeping to yourself
Doing the best you can
It's been this way since time began

Don't go to the bridge of sorrow
Don't go to the bridge of sorrow

Who is to say what is the best to do
When the world is as heavy as it is for you
There is no comfort by the light of the moon
Something is gonna give soon

You've run away from the mother and father
But you can't escape the heart of the matter
'Cause all around you other lives are falling
But voices are heard calling

Don't go to the bridge of sorrow
Don't go to the bridge of sorrow
