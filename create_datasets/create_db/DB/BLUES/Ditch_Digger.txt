I dug on down - for to see my true love
She is the only - girl I will speak of
Yes I went on down for to get my girl
An' free her from the devil's world
I hear the sound of her heart a poundin'
Fear was the hole boy that she wer' found in
The tears of my lord
Yes they run to the ground
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
Yes I wen' on down for to see my true love
Yeah an' I foun' trouble there
But even so I thank the lord for givin' me
And givin' one so fair
