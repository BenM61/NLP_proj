They told me not to smoke drugs, but I wouldn't listen
Never thought I'd get caught and wind up in prison
Chalk it up to youth but young age I ain't dissin'
I guess I just had to get it outta my system

Outta my system, outta my system
Oh Lord I'd never do it now I know what I ain't missing
Glad I went and got it all outta my system

The lustre of youth versus married security
I'm glad I'm here now, but just between you and me
I had to get it out and make the deals
And learn to know how it feels, but that it ain't real
Outta my system' outta my system

There's a way to have it all you know I ain't kidding
Some things I know I'll never get outta my system
If you don't live now, you ain't even trying
And then you're on your way to a midlife crisis

Let it out anyway you feel
You can feel it in your bones, but try to deny it
Wipe it off your face but your eyes won't hide it
You knew it all along but never made it clear

They told me not to steal cars, said I'd wind up in prison
Thought I knew it all yeah I wouldn't listen
Chalk it up to young but youth I ain't dissing?
I guess I just had to get it outta my system

Outta my system, outta my system
I'm glad I did it all then I know what I ain't missing
Glad I went and got it all outta my system

I'm glad I do it all now I know what I ain't missing
Glad I went and got it all outta my system
I'm glad I do it all now I know what I ain't missing
Glad I went and got it all outta my system
