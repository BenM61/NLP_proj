If time itself was his demeanor
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer
Of sunlight landin' on the street
Some say girls must be discreet
Some say girls must be discreet
Nursing their fathers locked inside
They masqueraded as his bride

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

They slump by the courthouse with windburn skin
That man could give a f*ck
About the grin on your face
As you walk by, randy as a goat
He's sleepin' on papers
But he'd be warm in your coat

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

There's no easy way to lose your sight
On the street, on the stairs
Who's on your flight
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin
But he's got her, she's got him

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
