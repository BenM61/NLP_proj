Black eyed man he took the blame
For the poisoning of the well
They found this shoes by the pulley
They found his fingerprints all over the pail
Black eyed man I'm warning you
The people around here

Will not be fooled by a simple line or two
Yes your honor I do solemnly swear
That I saw him late last night,
Dancing barefoot, bathed in light
And reaching for every star in sight
Yes I did go to him,

But completely against my will
And yes he did things to me
Things of which I dream of still
Black eyed man I'm warning you
What I say is what you'll do
To hell with love and truth
I always meant to say I'm sorry
For all the things I said and did
'Sorry,' I feel better now, do you?

But you promised me the sky
And fell short a star or two
What else did you expect me to do?

Black eyed man he took the blame
For the poisoning of the well
They found his shoes by the pulley
They found his fingerprints all over the pail

With a noose around his neck,
Cicadas trilling everywhere,
He says to the people gathered round him,
'it ain't the water that's not right around here'
Black eyed man I'm thirsty dear
Be a love and bring some water here
Drawn fresh from the well
