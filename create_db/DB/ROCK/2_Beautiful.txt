She's just too wonderful
She's just too sweet
She's just too beautiful
And beautiful for me

A girl like you has got to have about 100 
Guys just waiting in line for her
A girl like you wouldn't give a guy the time or day for sure
But I can't help wondering what it would be like
To have someone like you in my life
Even though i know its just a hopeless faith to see
'Cause you're too beautiful for me

Too lovely, too sweet
Too irresistible in every guy you meet
Too wonderful, too fine
Too unapproachable ever to be mine
Not in this lifetime	
So why even bother try 
Try try 

A girl like you makes a guy like me
want to hand over my life, my heart
But the problem is everytime you get close
want to tell you, but i dunno where to start
For all the tears I had thinking of you
I might as well be as well a freak in a zoo
We don't belong together anyone can see
'Cause you're too beautiful 

Too lovely, too sweet
Too irresistible in every guy you meet
Too wonderful, too fine
Too unapproachable ever to be mine
Not in this lifetime	
So why even bother try 
Try try 

She's just too wonderful
She's just too sweet
She's just beautiful
And beautiful for me

If we ever got together someday
I know exactly what people would say
They'd say here look,there goes beauty and the beast
'Cause you're too beautiful

Too lovely, too sweet
Too irresistible in every guy you meet
Too wonderful, too fine
Too unapproachable ever to be mine

She's just too wonderful
She's just too sweet
She's just too beautiful

I want to know, I want to know, I want to know
Do i ever stand a chance with you

Do I stand a chance
