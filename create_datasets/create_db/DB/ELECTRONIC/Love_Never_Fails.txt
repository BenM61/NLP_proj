There will be those times we fight back tears 
And there will be those times that we get scared 
As long as we're together we'll get there 
'Cause love never fails 
Love never fails

I have all that I need 
So much so I feel weak 
'Cause the love that we have is never ending 
All those moments we make 
Are too precious to waste 
In a world that is forever changing 
I wouldn't change you for anything 
I'll be forever loving you 

There will be those times we fight back tears 
And there will be those times that we get scared 
As long as we're together we'll get there 
'Cause love never fails 
Love never fails 

There's no greater gift 
Than the love that you breathe 
Forever hold me 
Many rivers to cross 
But our love will guide us 
It's all we need 
It's all we need 
 
There will be those times 
We test our faith 
On some other roads 
We have to take 
And I know that we'll always find our way 
'Cause love never fails
