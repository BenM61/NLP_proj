Some see a teacher standing on a hill speaking words of wisdom
Some see a healer reaching out His hand to give sight to a blind man
Some see a dreamer wasting His life for what can never be
Some see a fool dying for His dream

But I see love, I see love
Light of heaven breaking through
But I see grace, I see God's face
Shining pure and perfect
Love when I see You
I see love

Some see a prisoner alone before His judge with no one to defend him
Some see a victim beaten and abused with all the world against Him
Some see martyr carrying His cost for what He believes
Some see a hero who set His people free

But I see love, I see love
Light of heaven breaking through
I see grace, I see God's face
Shining pure and perfect
Love when I see You
I see love

With your last breath I see love
Through Your death I see life
I see peace in the eyes of a King
I see hope in Your suffering (I see love)
I see a calm in the center of a storm
I see a savior

I see love, I see love
Light of heaven breaking through
I see grace, I see God's face
Shining pure and perfect
Love when I see You
I see love

Some see Him walking from an empty grave
