If I knew being here with you today,
Would mean being alone tomorrow.
I would gladly trade all of my tomorrows away
For a moment with you.

Brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Say yeah,yeah,yeah

Can you look,can you look into my eyes
Or has your heart,said has your heart gone blind?
Can you look,can you look into your own
And find the safe place to hide.

Brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Say yeah,yeah,yeah

Why be with strangers
When you can be with your friend.
If you're ever lonely
You know I'm lonely too
And i will stay lonely until I'm again with you.

I said brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Say yeah,yeah,yeah
I said brown eyed blues
You can find yourself another fool.
Singing brown eyed
