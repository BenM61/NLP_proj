Things aren't quite as they seem inside my domain 
You can't know about everything, only pleasure and pain 
You wonder why I come here with head to my hands 
Where else can I be cured and the king of your mansion 
A thorn in your side, a child to protect 
That claims he's free 

Just around the corner, half a mile to heaven 
Strong enough to hold you, starved for some affection 
Darling come quickly, come ease my mind 
For my prayers have not been answered in a long time 

I've already made my bed, like it or not 
As long as there's no regrets 
I'll be here when the ride stops 
These comforts to me and these crosses to bear 
With which we live 

Just around the corner, half a mile to heaven 
Strong enough to hold you, starved for some affection 
Baby, I can't drag you into this mess 

I'm the thorn in your side and the child to protect 
And I'm just around the comer, half a mile to heaven 
Strong enough to hold you, starved for some affection 
Darling come quickly, come ease my worried mind 
For my prayers have not been answered in a long time
