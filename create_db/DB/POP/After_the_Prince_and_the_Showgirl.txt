You've gotta be hard
If you gonna get her
Don't leave her scarred
All dead equals all better

You've gotta remember
To do it all right
Turn the lights out
Lock it up tight

Don't you walk on the grass
And don't leave any clues
Better wash off your glass
And wipe the mud off your shoes

Too much information
Just gets â??em going
Down at the station
Don't want â??em knowing

Don't stop to wonder for too long
Just make sure there's something
That she likes on the radio

When duty calls
Miss Niagara falls
But when they ask me
I'll just say that I didn't know

When will you call?
Well after it's over
Are you sad at all?
I don't even know her
Don't let it hurt
I'll be fast
I feel so bad
It won't last
When you get back
I'll be clean
And please don't say anything mean

But you've gotta dress nice
Try not to upset her
Just a little advice
If you're gonna get her

Drive by the bank
And check on the tank
And when they ask me
I'll just say I didn't know
