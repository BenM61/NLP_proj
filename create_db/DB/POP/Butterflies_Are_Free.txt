Butterflies are free
Butterflies are free
I knew the day you had me
I could love you if you let me
Though you touched my cheek and said 
How easy you’d forget me
You said,
Butterflies are 
Butterflies are free
And so are we
Butterflies are free
Butterflies are
Butterflies are free
And so are we
Butterflies are free
On a velvet morning
When our love was forming
You said it wouldn’t hurt me if you left without warning
I said
Butter flies are
Butterflies are free
And so are we
Butterflies are free
Butterflies are 
Butterflies are free
And so are we
And you made me understand 
Right from the start
I could hold your gentle hand
But never hold your heart
So why the crying, 
Was afraid we’re lying
When we both agreed there’d be no tears in our goodbyin’
Butterflies are free
Butterflies are free
Why aren’t we? 
Butterflies are free
Butterflies are free
Why aren’t we?
Butterflies are free
Butterflies are free
Butterflies are free
Free, free, free, free
Why aren’t we?
Butterflies are free.
