It might not last
So we're gonna record everything

Trip the power on
And we'll set up our equipment
And we'll be there for that moment
When our world is transformed from night to dawn

It's an outside chance
That the light will be reflected
And our lives will be connected
In the same sphere, as we glance each other's eyes

Open up the mic
'Cause we're gonna record everything

This is a moving part
This is a big idea, just waiting to spark

Clank out those random parts
A kinetic freedom's reaching
Between the earth and the stars
There'll be magic errors meeting
