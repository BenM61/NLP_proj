Hello, such a simple way to start a love affair
Should I jump right in and say how much I care?
Would you take me for the madness of a simple-hearted clown?

Hello, with affection from a sentimental fool
From a little girl who's broken every rule
One who brings me up when all the others seem to let me down
One who's nice to be around

Should I say that it's a blue world without you
Nice words I remember from an old love song
But all wrong 'cause I've never called it love before
This feeling's new, it came with you

Oh, and I know that the nicest things have never seemed to last
That we're both a bit embarrassed by our past
But I think there's something special in the feelings that we've found
And you're nice to be around, and you're nice to be around
