I don't know who you are now
Mystery drenches my brain
I wanna jump deep into your mouth
'Cause something tells me it's gonna rain

I hear the drum rolls thumping
And my heart starts jumping
And that's when I spit on the floor
Now my head's exploding
And your gun is dirty
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll
Well it's a fine time
Looking for a wine time man
And you said "baby you ready to play"
Well come right on this roller coaster
'Cause it ain't over, it ain't over

Now we're on this planet
I'm in love with all your dangers, dangers
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
Beautiful dangerous

We acted smooth like rain
Save all flame that we'll light
You can be sick, I'll be nasty
'Cause sometimes it's more fun to fight

I hear the drum rolls thumping
And my heart starts jumping
And that's when I spit on the floor
Now my head's exploding
And your gun is dirty
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll
Well it's a fine time
Looking for a wine time man
And you said "baby you ready to play"
Well come right on this roller coaster
'Cause it ain't over, it ain't over

Now we're on this planet
I'm in love with all your dangers, dangers
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
Beautiful dangerous

Now we're on this planet
I'm in love with all your dangers, dangers
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
Beautiful dangerous

Now we're on this planet
I'm in love with all your dangers, dangers
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
Beautiful dangerous
