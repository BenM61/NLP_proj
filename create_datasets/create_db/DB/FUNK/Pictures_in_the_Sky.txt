Lord Jesus You are the One 
Who made the heavens 
And You'll take me there someday 
But 'til that time they'll hang around 
To say that You love me 
And down here on earth 
It's hard to keep in mind 
When the days are hazy 
The sun still shines 
But if my head's in the clouds 
It suits me just fine 
'Cause they're what's above me 

And there the world unfolds 
Right before me 
With whispers of hope 
And shouts of glory 

I like to see the pictures 
Way up in the sky 
It looks like moving pictures 
When the clouds go by 
I like to see the pictures 
Way up in the sky 
It looks like moving pictures 
When the clouds go by (by, by, by) 

Lord Jesus You are the One 
Who sends the clouds 
That roll along 
On the crest of the wind 
I look up I see in them Your power 
See the vapor trail 
Reddened in the setting sun 
It's like a heavenly blessing 
On a trail of crumbs 
See the light beam burning bright 
Shining like a rung 
On Jacob's ladder 

And there the world unfolds 
Right before me 
With whispers of hope 
And shouts of glory 

I like to see the pictures 
Way up in the sky 
It looks like moving pictures 
When the clouds go by 
I like to see the pictures 
Way up in the sky 
It looks like moving pictures 
When the clouds go by (by, by, by) 
When the clouds go by 

And there the world unfolds 
Right before me 
With whispers of hope 
And shouts of glory 

I like to see the pictures 
Way up in the sky 
It looks like moving pictures 
When the clouds go by 
I like to see the pictures 
Way up in the sky -
