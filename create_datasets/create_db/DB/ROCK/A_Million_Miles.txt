I must have walked past this doorway thirty times
Just trying to catch your eye
You made it all worthwhile when you returned my smile
It all became worthwhile

Don't you feel a little cold stood by the door?
You know, I'd really like to talk some more
Oh, don't be worried about your friend -
I think she left some time 'round ten

What was her name again?
You're not like anyone I've met
Do you see much of Charlie over here?
Oh, I've known him off and on for years

He's never mentioned you before
Oh that didn't come out right at all
And now I feel this small
That seems to be it

Don't get me wrong, but how are you going to get back home?
I'd be willing to walk that way
There's something I've just got to say
I could walk a million miles today

You're not like anyone I've ever met
I kept bursting out with laughter all the way home
I had to tell somebody & you just happened to phone
I can't think of anything else, no matter how I try

But, you know, I can't even remember the color of her eyes
You're not like anyone I've ever met
Well, at least not yet
