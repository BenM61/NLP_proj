I learned my lesson, nobody is to blame
Except for you
I learned my lesson, we're all trying to hide
Doing the best we can, in order to survive
But some of us keep it simple
And some of us will deceive
We tell half of the story, so we can take the things we need
And some of our efforts are colorful
And some people they lose
And some people live in the shadows
So they never have to choose

You spread your darkness, like a disease
Then you offer your body, as the only remedy

I believe in love
I believe in love
No, darling, you can't take that away from me
I believe in love
I believe in love
No, darling, you can't take that away from me

You had me by the throat
You had me by the horns
You had me in the same bed
While it was still warm
My hair was still on the pillow
My clothes were still on the floor
You didn't care, no darling, the hungry always want more
Oh, my hair was still on the pillow
My music was still in the air
You didn't care to tell her why I had been there

And you knew that she was scared
But you took her anyway
You told her she was everything, then you had your way
And she told you that she loved you
And you told her you were tired
Oh, the things we say
Once we've got what we desired

I believe in love
I believe in love
No, darling, you can't take that away from me
I believe in love
I believe in love
No, darling, you can't take that away from me
I believe in love
I believe in love
No, darling, you can't take that away from me

I learned my lesson, nobody is to blame
Except for you
