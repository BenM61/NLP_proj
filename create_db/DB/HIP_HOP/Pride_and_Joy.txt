You're always there for me
Whenever I fall 
Whenever I'm in need
You always know when to call 
When I've come to my ends
I know I can depend on your loving me
Your touching me
Constant faith and trust in me
 
And how can I tell you
How I love you so
Oh darling
I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy
 
You've been right there for me
Through thick and the thin 
You were the strength for me
You wouldn't let me give in
At the end of the road
Somehow I've always known 
That your trust in me 
Your love in me
Got me to believe in me
 
And how can I tell you
How I love you so
Oh darling
I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy
 
You are my first and last thought of the day
You are my heartbeat
Without you I can't breathe
I can't imagine me without you in my life
You are my one soul inspiration
Without you I'll just die 
 
And how can I tell you 
How I love you so
Oh darling I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy
 
And how can I tell you 
How I love you so
Oh darling I just want to tell you
That you're my pride and joy
