Everything was ready, but he had to run away
Shot for the money on the very same day
Le garage, le garage-rage
Le garage, le garage-rage

Everything was ready, but he had to run away
Shot for the money on the very same day
Le garage, le garage-rage
Le garage, le garage-rage

Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit

You, you are the thing
With your tight skin making me jealous
And I agree
I never think now when I'm with you

And I won't say a word of its truth if it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage

And things pushed in my face
With locked arms making me nuder to everything
You you give me sound
I always think now when I'm with you

And I won't say a word of its truth if it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage
And I won't say a word of its truth if it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage
