Anytime, anytime, anytime
Anytime you want me, come on back
Come on home

Ran away and left me alone in this empty place
Anywhere I go, whoa whoa, all I see is your sweet face
Though my pain keeps on growing
There's one thing, baby, you should be knowing

Anytime you want me
(Come on back)
Anytime you want me
(Come on back)
Anytime you want me
(Come on back, whoa yeah)

Tried to make you happy, the very best I could
Anything you wanted, whoa whoa
Just like a good man should
Even though you did me wrong,
I'll be waiting no matter how long

Anytime you want me
(I'll be here)
Anytime you want me
I promise I'll be here, baby)
Anytime you want me
(I'll be by your side, whoa yeah)

Said I'll forgive you for everything in the past
All I need is one more chance, I know, I know it will last
Now you heard my story, know just what's on my mind
Tired of being lonely, whoa whoa, I've had my share of crying
Without you I can't go on, I'll be waiting no matter how long

Anytime you want me
(Anytime you need me)
Anytime you want me
(Anytime you need me)

Anytime you want me
(Anytime you want me now)
Oh, oh, oh
Anytime you want me
