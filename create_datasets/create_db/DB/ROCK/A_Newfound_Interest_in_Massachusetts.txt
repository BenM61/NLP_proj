If I told you that I was thinking of moving east, would you save a place for me? I'll come home because it's worse than I expected. A place in my heart for my home to the west where we'll watch the same sunsets, and when I doubt... I'll look east and lock my heart in a brass box to newfound mass. I'm breaking off but this is my home. I'd do anything for you, give you the world if I could. Is that what you want me to do? These bridges and boundaries are bringing me closer to you.
