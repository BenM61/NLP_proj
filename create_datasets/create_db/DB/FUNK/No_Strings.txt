I saw you lookin' at me girl
When I first set foot into the room
You didn't want me to see girl
You didn't wanna lay your cards so soon
I see you rollin' it over
You wonder what your friends might think of you
Angel on your shoulder, but you know just you wanna do

Well I don't need to know a thing about your past
No I just want one night with you no strings attached
And I know that we might not be a perfect match
I just want one night with you no strings attached

I know you tryin' to be good girl
But you imagine what I'm like in bed
You try to push it aside girl
But it already went through your head

It's one o'clock in the morning
And you're buzzin' like a honey bee
Oh why you trying to control it
When you wanna just come home with me?

Well I don't need to know a thing about your past
No I just want one night with you no strings attached
And I know that we might not be a perfect match
I just want one night with you no strings attached

I don't want to think this through
I just want one night with you
No I don't want to think things through
I just want one night with you girl
