Blue Gene
That's what they call me now
Since you broke my heart

Well now it's blue Gene
I still can hear you say,
"They'll never be anyone but you, Gene"

Those ruby red lips
Those little white lies
That golden light
Of love so bright
Just seemed to fade from your eyes

And left me a blue Gene
'Til I can hear you say
"I'm sorry I made you blue, and I love you too, Gene"

That golden light
Of love so bright
Just seemed to fade from your eyes

And left me a blue Gene
'Til I can hear you say
"I'm sorry I made you blue, and I love you too, Gene"

I love you too, Gene
I'm a blue Gene
