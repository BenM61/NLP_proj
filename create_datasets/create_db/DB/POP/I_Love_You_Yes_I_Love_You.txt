Take off your shoes
Sit on the floor
I'll make us a coffee he'll keep you warm.
Remember the times we couldn't afford
Even the bare necessities
But we made it somehow.

And I love you
Yes I love you.

Tell me do you love me
Do you love me still.

They tried to keep me down
You made me strong

And I love you
Yes I love you.

Tried to sell a tune nobody would buy.
Hunger and frustration nearly made me die
Pressure when it takes you can drive you wild.
Baby you've got the kind of love that really drives me wild.

And I love you
Yes I love you.

Don't say it
Oh child
Don't suck your teeth on me
No
No
Baby
Don't play child
You know you made a man out of me.
Take off your shoes
Sit on the floor

And I love you
Yes I love you.

They tried to keep me down
