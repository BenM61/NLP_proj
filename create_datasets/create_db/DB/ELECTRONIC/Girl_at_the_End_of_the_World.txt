Overtaking, SUV approaching
We're on a blind curve
There's nowhere to swerve

My mind goes still
As still as he is racing
I whisper a prayer
To whoever is there

Remind me to breathe at the end of the world
Appreciate scenes and the love I've received
To love who I've been at the end of the world
The departed
The departed

Remind me to breathe at the end of the world
Appreciate scenes and the love I've received
There's always a girl at the end of the world
The departed
The departed

A hairpin bend, Moonlight drive
We'll meet it open eyed
The big whatever
While this world can drive me fucking mad
Just off to the side
Is love and laughter

Remind me to breathe at the end of the world
Appreciate scenes and the love I've received
To love who I've been at the end of the world
The departed
The departed

Remind me to breathe at the end of the world
Appreciate scenes and the love I've received
There's always a girl at the end of the world
The departed
The departed

Remind me to breathe at the end of the world
Appreciate scenes and the love I've received
There's always a girl at the end of the world
The departed
The departed
