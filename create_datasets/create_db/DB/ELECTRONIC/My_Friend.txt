Put your head on my shoulder
No need to worry ?bout a thing
I'll be the cure for your loneliness
I'll make you feel like you're whole again

And you can always count on me wherever I may go
When this world's got you feelin' blue
Call my name and I'll run to you
My friend

On my wings we both can fly
Cause there's no burden big enough
And when you're hurtin' baby so am I 
And we'll both cry
There's nothing stronger than our love
And you can always count on me 
wherever I may be
Oh I'm gonna find the way
To a better day
My friend

So let me be the one to save ya
Cause it's the least that I can do
And you don't have to return the favor
Cause I promise you
Oh we're gonna make it through
My friend
Oh we're gonna make it through
My friend

Put your head on my shoulder
You don't have to worry bout a thing
If you need me I'll be there in a hurry
Call on me, time and time again
Cause you're my friend
