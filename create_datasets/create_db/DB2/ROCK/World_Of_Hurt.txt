Day one God smiled, 
Gave us all the wisdom of a newborn child 
But by the time we take our first step 
We've already begun to forget 
What the heart knows the heart sees 
We're just as much the forest, as we are the trees 
Every little seed trying to find 
Where the light comes from 

And it's a world of hurt, nothing works 
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt 
Who'd ever think that in the midst of all this 
Something as beautiful as love exists 
And when I hold you, and you hold me 
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery 
Darling in a world of hurt 
You make me feel so good 

Day one of our love, 
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much 
Oh but here it comes that feelin' again 
That every lover swears will never end 
We thought we'd been there, done that, 
But when we kissed 
We knew we'd never been here,
We've never done this 
All the walls come tumblin' down 
When you love someone 

And it's a world of hurt, nothing works 
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt 
Who'd ever think that in the midst of all this 
Something as beautiful as love exists 
And when I hold you, and you hold me 
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery 
Darling in a world of hurt 
You make me feel so good
