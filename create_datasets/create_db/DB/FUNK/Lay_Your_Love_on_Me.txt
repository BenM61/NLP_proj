We've talked about life,
We've talked about love,
It gets to the point,
Where the words ain't enough,
There isn't a reason why this should be wrong,
Open your heart and I'll play you a song.
Come on, come on,
Lay your love on me,
Come on, come on,
Lay you love on me.
Don't you know sometimes you've gotta let yourself be free,
Don't you know it's your right, to be who you want to be,
Don't you know there's a whole world out there,
Waiting for us to see,
And don't you feel sometimes you've gotta let be,
what's gotta be,
All I'm saying to you is.
Come on, come on,
Lay your love on me
Come on, come on,
Lay your love on me.
There isn't a reason why this should be wrong,
Open your heart and I'll play you a song,
Yes I will.
Come on, come on,
Lay your love on me
Come on, come on,
Lay your love on me.
Come on, come on now,
Come on now, you've got to come on now,
Come on now, come on now, come on now with me.
Come on, come on,
Lay Your love on me,
Getting tired of asking you baby,
Talk about life and love,
Lay it all on me,
Come on, come on, come on
Lay your love on me,
Talk about life and love lay it all on me,
Come on, come on, come on.
