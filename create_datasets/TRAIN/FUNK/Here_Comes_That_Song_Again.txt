Here comes that song again
Theyre playing that song again
I guess it will never end
Theyre playing it again

Here comes that song again
Here comes that old ache again
The story of my life begins
Theyre telling it again

Ill have to leave
I cant bear it anymore
There must be a place where
Theyll play a different score

Here comes that song again
The jukebox must have found a friend
My heart will never mend
Theyre playing it again

Here comes that song again
The jukebox must have found a friend
My heart will never mend
Theyre playing it again
