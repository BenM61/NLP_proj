Walk up on the set, steppin' with the swag
Clothes got a dro odor so you know I blow bats
Fresher than a motherfucker, pockets got stacks
Hoes lookin' over here 'cause they like Ski Jack

Chirper goin' off like I got a dispatch
Could be lookin' for that work and I ain't about to holla back
Post up on the whip and start lookin' for somethin' bad
Nice thighs, cute face and gotta have a fat ass

Bust that pussy open then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' you never had
Caught you at the club doin' that sexy ass dance
Dropped it down to the floor and bought it back up in a stance, got damn

I like the way she workin' it
Ass sit right and it's like magic when she twerkin' it
Baby, don't you jerk me, I know this is for certain
'Cause it's guaranteed, she let me beat then I'll murk it

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

Just gotta fade, dressed to impress
Bone got a shoe fetish, so you know I stay fresh
I ain't worried about that mess a couple grand up on my chest
Plus drew then bought a tick and I stay fresher than some sess

Don't want my shoes to get no specks
Don't want no bitch to touch my neck
I'll tear this club up, if I feel some disrespect
I just wanna find a chick 'cause lil Wil just popped an x
And I don't wanna work hard 'cause I'm feenin' for some sex

Do my dougie fresh and watch them hoes get to choosin'
Middle of the club, jammin' hard to my music
Bet you can't do me like a triple x movie
Pull that dick up out ya pussy let it slap there on ya booty

Goin' hard in the jacuzzi, oh my god I like a [incomprehensible]
Stars still pursuin' 'cause I get a thing of boozey
Don't know what I'm doin' better check me out fully
Mix that dougie fresh with that north side boogie

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker

My dougie, my dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
She say she like my dougie, I'm fresh, my dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh, yep, flyer than a motherfucker
