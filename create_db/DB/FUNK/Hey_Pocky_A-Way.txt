Live a boy with a heart of steel
He can't move it now
But his sisters sure will
Feel good music
I've been told
Good for the body
And it's good for your soul
You can do it now
Hey hey hey
Hey pocky a-way
I'm back grooving 
Right in the car
It don't make no difference where you are
Feel good music
In your soul
Make your body
Do the slow boogie roll
Hey hey hey
Hey pocky a-way
Alright!
Hey hey hey
Hey pocky a-way
Hey hey hey
Hey pocky a-way
Hey hey hey
Hey pocky a-way
Hey hey hey
Hey pocky a-way
