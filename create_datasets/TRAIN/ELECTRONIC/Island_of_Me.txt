Adolescent dreams
Runnin' in stride with me
Reason for misbehavin'
Indulgin' all my cravings
Makin' time for daydreamin'
And never really seein'
I sit around just teemin'
Everything losin' meanin'

Is this the meanin' of bein' free?
When the only one on this island is me
Is this our one true destiny?
Everywhere I look on the sea
Are islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me

The custom of my country is to never grow up
Run away from everything 'til I get better luck
Why should I have to look and never touch
What I wanna touch, what I wanna touch, what I wanna touch

Is this the meanin' of bein' free?
When the only one on this island is me
Is this what we are meant to be?
Everywhere I look on the sea
Are islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me

Adolescent dreams breakin' out of me
But the sun is comin' and the world in front of me
Kool-aid I drink, pour it on the street
In memory of my melancholy

Is this the meanin' of bein' free?
When the only one on this island is me
Is this our one true destiny?
Everywhere I look all I see
Are islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me
