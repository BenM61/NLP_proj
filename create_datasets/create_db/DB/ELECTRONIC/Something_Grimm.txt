Once apart of never, you're the reason I lived
Always looking to you to make me feel like shit
Everyone knows fairy tales don't exist
Hoping you can prove that love actually can

You find yourself, from deep within
You cry for help, it's something grimm
You fall apart, you meet your end
Life is short, it's something grimm

Once upon a time, the reason that I lived
Once upon a time, the hope and hopeless
I refuse to live a life that's filled with regret
Don't want to grow old as miserable like you

You find yourself, from deep within
You cry for help, it's something grimm
You fall apart, you meet your end
Life is short, it's something grimm

Shadows fall from everywhere (Silent minds behind blank stares)
Empty hearts and subtle scenes (There's no happy ending)
Shadows fall from everywhere (Silent minds behind blank stares)
Empty hearts and subtle scenes (There's no happy ending)

You find yourself, from deep within
You cry for help, it's something grimm
You fall apart, you meet your end
Life is short, it's something grimm

Life is no cheap thrill (Something grimm, it never ends)
As the ship sets sail (Something grimm, it never ends)
As the weights tips on the scale (Something grimm, it never ends)
Our new eyes looking in (Something grimm, it never ends)
