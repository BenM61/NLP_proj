Yeah is dis Mike on? Right

Lil shhh for the mc please (thank you) 

Ya way ain't step away now back away 
cause the only ting I be is heavy weight 
Let me demonstrate the key to create 
Check out the vibe that I am create 
You want me to stop well it's too late 
Want me to flow? never me 
Neva hesitate to drop the mic'
I never, hesitate to do what I like 
Neva hesitate to pick up my fight 
At the things that challenging at my vibe 
Continue? Yes I'm sure 
Get off my little cannonball
I will leave it so old so old like a beat up whore 
Eyes them after a dumb hard draw 
High ten lyrics them against the law 
Be lame right now wen the girls so flaw
Eating bread n water 
My living can count its slaughter 
With a order 
Have you come to a decision? 
Yes shes going to
Don't Send me there 
The beef for my living just get you no war 
Don't really care write what I like 
Say every type of prayer 
Oh yeah be aware

[Chorus] 
Yo a lil bit of shhh for me 
A lil bit of quiet for the mc 
A lil bit of shhh for me 
Make way for the S.O.V 
A lil bit of shhh for me 
Now shut ya mouth for the MC 
A lil bit of hush for me 
Right now its the S.O.V 

Right haha 
Don't joke with us move forward please (thank you thank you) 

Yeah about one nightstand 
Wat you fink of my stands 
Right now how it sounds I go zippy cold hands 
An acoustic band got some hands up some hands 
All my fans I'm in trouble uh-oh 
Down sauf the pollution man go down 
Well I make up noise like pots and pans 
They should put my voice on a ice cream van 
That way the streets want b bland 
Big headed no cough headed yes 
I must confess well I'm never gonna rest 
Well done less I don't want to mess 
Here comes the press!! 
Never damn reporter 
Obsessed with my disorder 
Diagnosis please whats wrong wiv her Bill? 
She's ill 
Nah she's

[Chorus]

Oh my god! Pete Ellis! Oh! 

Its cold theres a new top girl on row 
Running ting running ting running ting everything Oh you been told?! 
Twisted shit like wen I gully 
So let me carry on while you sit back and vomit 
Some sit crooked like Wallis and Gromit 
cause you know you cant stop it 
Some don't like me like the homeless 
Spitters of Madonna's story unpoorly 
Lets keep writing surely you could ignore me 
But then again if you saw me you'll adore me 
Cause I'm so cute and scrawny 
Spit on a track and leave it so horny 
And who taught me? Nobody 
I did it all by myself, you cant stop me! 

Yo 

[Chorus]

It's OK, it's alright you, you can start making some noise now if you like, ya know what I mean right? 
I'm not gonna go completely off the rail ya no what I mean? 
Thank you 

Hype hype hype 

Hey! [Whistle] alright now calm down please 
Alright now a lil bit of shh

[Chorus: x2]
