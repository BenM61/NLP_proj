Orion's arms are wide enough
To hold us both together
Although we're worlds apart
I'd cross the stars for you

"In the heart of a sleepless moon"
"I'll be with you forever"
"This is my destiny"
"'Till my life is through"

The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

When I am lost and feeling alone
I just look to heaven
I find my comfort there
God only knows where you are to night

"God only knows where you are to night"
"Maybe time will tell me"
"'Till then I'll close my eyes and say a prayer for you"
(I'll say a prayer for you to)

The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

Orion's heart is bright enough
To shine on both of us
The constellations never fail
To light the way for love

'Orion's arms are wide enough'
To hold us both together
"Although we're worlds apart"
('I'd cross the stars for you')
"I'd cross the stars for you"

The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
"Since you've been gone I've been drowning" ('lost')
"In the sea of tranquility" ('lonely')
"Drowning without you here my dear" ('baby')

The arms of Orion'
That's where I want to be
That's where I want to be ("the arms of Orion")
That's where I want to be ("the arms of Orion")
Since you've been gone, babe'
"Since you've been gone"
"I've been drowning", ('drowning') "drowning"
Drowning without your love
"The arms of Orion" ('arms of Orion')
