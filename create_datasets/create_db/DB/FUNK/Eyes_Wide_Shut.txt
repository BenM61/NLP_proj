They say that some things are too good to be true
But I just hope they ain't talking about you
I heard that everything must come to an end
But I just can't imagine me without you

Don't tell me I'm dreamin'
Cause if I've been dreamin'
I don't ever want to wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut

Out of sight they say out of mind
But your image will remain til the end of time
I'm strong but hearts are easy to break

Don't want to fall if there ain't no one to catch me
Me without you, me without you

Oh, I don't ever want to wake up

Don't tell me I'm dreamin'
Cause if I've been dreamin'
I don't ever want to wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut
