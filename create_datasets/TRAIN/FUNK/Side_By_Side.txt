Oh we ain't got a barrel of money maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along singing a song side by side
Well don't know what's coming tomorrow mybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road sharing our load side by side
Oh honey through all kind of weather what if the sky should fall
Just as long as we're together it doesn't matter at all
When they've all had their quarrels and parted we'll be the same as we started
Just traveling along singing a song side by side

Honey through all kind of weather
