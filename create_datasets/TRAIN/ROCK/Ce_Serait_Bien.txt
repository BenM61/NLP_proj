Uh-huh, honey
All right

My baby whispers in my ear
Umm, sweet nothin's
He knows the things I like to hear
Umm, sweet nothin's
Things he wouldn't tell
Nobody else
Secret, baby
I keep them to myself
Sweet nothin's
Umm, sweet nothin's

We walk along hand-in-hand
Umm, sweet nothin's
Yeah, we both understand
Umm, sweet nothin's
Sittin' in the classroom trying to read my book
My baby give me that special look
Sweet nothin's
Umm, sweet nothin's

Ah, sittin on my front porch
Umm, sweet nothin's
Well, do I love you, of course
Umm, sweet nothin's
Mama turned on the front porch light
Sayin' "come here, darlin' that' enough for tonight"
Sweet nothin's
Umm, sweet nothin's
Sweet nothin's
