When? 
It happened so fast 
those visions in my mind
although could it pass 
your other different path 
it seems you come down from the stars, 
and somehow you are still so much human then they are 

I want to know you, mister Starman 
I want to love you, mister Starman 

Love, can happen so fast, 
and some say that's it's mine 
the future is past 
you're from a different time, 
tell me is is from there that you came?
a different sense I'll ask 
but our hearts are still the same

I want to know you, mister Starman 
I want to love you, mister Starman
I want to know you, mister Starman 
I want to love you, mister Starman

Don't go away alone
Don't go away alone

I want to know you, mister Starman 
I want to love you, mister Starman 
I want to know you, mister Starman 
I want to love you, mister Starman
