Everything is quiet
There, in a pool of light
I would have sworn that she had died
I'm telling you

In all that I will say
In every move I'll make
You'll see that I don't fake, even if I wanted to

She passed it on to me
She passed it on to me
She passed it on to me

She walked into my life
The ridiculous and sublime
Beneath the lowered sky
She fell in love

And passed it on to me
And passed it on to me
And passed it on to me

I threw it all away
Like a record that you don't play
And all the hurt I saved
Well, time had come

I passed it on to her
I passed it on to her
I passed it on to her

Do you realize
Do you realize
To look into her eyes
And to let her go

To pass it on to him
To pass it on to him
To pass it on to him

Now everything was quiet
I would have sworn that she had died
And I didn't even try

Now all you want to hear
Is everything you fear
So don't you come too near

And everything you need
Everything you need
Everything you need
You'll get from her

everything you need
Everything you need
Everything you need
You'll get from her
