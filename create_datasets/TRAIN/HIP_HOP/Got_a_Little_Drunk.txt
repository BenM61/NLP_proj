When we broke up
Found out that you were cheating on me
And when we broke up
I was happy to watch you leave
And find another lover
I thought I wouldn't care then last that weekend when I saw you
I saw you standing there

And I thought that it was over, but it isn't
Just a little liquid courage got me wishing
Now my friends tell me I shouldn't go out drinking
But there's nothing I can do, party now

Got a little drunk last night
And I don't know what I said to you
Got a little drunk last night
At 4am I started texting you
All the shots I kept on drinking
And it really got me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
Got a little drunk last night

All the shots I keep on drinking
And it really got me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
Got little drunk last night

They told me that time would heal it
Said "nothing I can't deal with"
But still recall the feeling of how we used to be
I'm good in life and though you ain't
The one I 'pposed to be with
And one thing is to know but it's another thing to see
Spotted you with your man out, added a couple of drinks
Put me into my feelings and spat out a couple things
Probably outta place but at least it was fucking honest
Nothing more I relate to than hearing my brother say

And I thought that it was over, but it isn't
Just a little liquid courage got me wishing
Now my friends tell me I shouldn't go out drinking
But there's nothing I can do, party now

Got a little drunk last night
And I don't know what I said to you
Got a little drunk last night
At 4am I started texting you
All the shots I kept on drinking
And it really got me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
Got a little drunk last night

All the shots I keep on drinking
And it really got me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
Got a little drunk last night

I don't know what I said to you
When I know I meant it
No, I know that I said the truth
You know I meant it

Got a little drunk last night
And I don't know what I said to you
Got a little drunk last night
At 4am I started texting you
All the shots I kept on drinking
And it really got me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
Got a little drunk last night

All the shots I kept on drinking
And it really got me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
Got a little drunk last night
