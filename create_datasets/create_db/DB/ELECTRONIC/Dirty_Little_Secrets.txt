So you want to do something that's a little bit not too
Afro-centric-erotic-space-groove-jazz-f*ck-acid-punk?
Come on, what do you want?  Come on, baby
It's all about power, baby
You know what I'm saying?
It's all about sleepwalking through this endless night
You want me to make you feel
Like you ain't never felt before, baby?
Tell me all your dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
I'm coming up to you like some kinda
White witch in a fever, baby, oh yeah
Don't tell me to control myself
I mean, you don't want me 
To control myself, do you?
Tell me all your dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
I just want you to slip your
Tongue up a little bit closer
And relate to me, baby
You know what I'm saying?
Tell me all your
Dirty little secrets
