Why am I happy, why am I gay
Me and my baby just moved out today
To Happiness Street, corner Sunshine Square.

Now we don't quarrel, now we're so glad
Glad that we're living where love is the fad
On Happiness Street, corner Sunshine Square.

They never heard of blues, they never heard of fears
They never heard of woes, they never heard of tears
That's the reason folks are happy there.

So pack up your troubles, take my advice
You and your baby can find paradise
On Happiness Street, corner Sunshine Square.
