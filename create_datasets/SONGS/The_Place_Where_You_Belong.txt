Misery,such a fool to let you walk away from me 
Now it seems there' s just nobody there for me 
Girl I'm in agony, for you 
Gone without a trace 

Never knew that love was such a lonely place 
Damn I need your lovin just to feel this space 
I' m in so much pain without you 
You left me here alone 
Why don' t you come back home to me (everybody help me sing) 

This is the place where you belong 
Rights here in my arms 
Without you something is wrong 
Waiting for your call 

Can' t help thinkin' that 
This mess is all my fault 
And just to have you back I swear I'd risk it all 
My every thought is of you 

Girl I'm on my knees 
Beggin' for forgiveness and your sympathy 
But most of all my love I miss your company 
The only thing I need is you 

I need you back my friend 
So I can live again 
Come back home (everybody help me sing it) 

This is the place where you belong 
Rights here in my arms 
Without you something is wrong 
Waiting for your call 

This is the place where you belong 
Right here in my arms 
Without you something is wrong 
(somethings wrong 3x)

This is the place where you belong 
Rights here in my arms 
Without you something is wrong 
Waiting for your call 

This is the place where you belong 
Right here in my arms 
Without you something is wrong
