Your life's a passing star
The price you paid was dear
You make the most of my life
Yet movements dance with fear
Your specialty's only nights
As you and pride compete
Neglect the pain in your heart
Come on and dance with me

Once again this is short and sweet
So check the calorie, jump to the beat
Up two, three, four, encore
Now hit the dance floor
This is how it should be done
As my tongue beats with the drum as one
So what you got to say good lookin'
It's time to get this here jam cookin'
So does you does or does you don't 
Want to keep on frontin', 'cause i won't
If my brothers want to keep on cruisin'
Tell em stop don't jump to conclusions
Pick your spot, give it all you got
And then rock, and send me Forget-Me-Nots
And yo, as i speak, it's time to freak
So yo, hop, skip and jump to the beat
