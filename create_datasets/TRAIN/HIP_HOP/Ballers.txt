(Hook(2x)) Ballers we be on some twinkies twinkies
Playa hataz get found stanky stanky
Trickin fat blunts of dat danky danky
Big diamond rings on ou pinky pinky

(Project Pat) 
Jumpin out da trizak
Chewin on a sizack
Sippin on some sizurp
Jus slung a bizag
Name iz Project Pat-a
Moet in my lap-a
Stayin on da grind, 'cause da loot gonna stack-a
Watchin for a jack-a
You know I'm a mack-a
Whatcha need dog, ? weed or some crack-a
Ice on my pinky
Smokin on stinky
Caught a sucka slippin
Now I'm on some twenties
Flossin like a playa
Golds keep a twinkle
Eyez fire rized
I'm startin to grow wrinkles
Fall up in da clizub
High off of dizub
Famous in da hood, so these hoes show me lizuv
A dope I'm abizove
So don't be a hate-a
You lame 'cause da game, 'cause you iz a fake-a
My dopes on da triple
My gats at your temple
I'm hungry for cheese, like hungry hungry hipp-o
