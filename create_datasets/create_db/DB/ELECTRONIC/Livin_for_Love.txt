Who do you love when your heart has had enough
And it's just another lie, and all you can do is cry
Where can you go when you're left with just too much
And its' more than you can take, gotta find another way

'Cause we've all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more
But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down
Fed up, messed up, I still get up I'm gonna keep on
No one can stop me from, hey, hey, hey

Who do you trust when you've given all you've got
And there's nothing left inside but another damn goodbye
Hey, how do you know if it's just another night
And you're heart won't be betrayed and you face another day

'Cause we've all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more
But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down
Fed up, messed up, I still get up, 'cause I'm livin' for love
No one can stop me from
No one can hold me from, I'm livin'
I'm livin' for love, oh, yes, I am, are you
Because I'm livin' for love why'all

Jacked up, backed up, cracked up, fed up, talked up, messed up, I still get up
'Cause I'm livin' for love, ooh, ooh, livin'
No on can stop me from
Uh huh I'm gonna keep 

But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down
Fed up, messed up, I still get up (livin' for love) sha da da da da
(Livin' for love) whoa whoa whoa whoa (livin' for love) no one can stop me
(Livin' for love)i may be tore down, wore down
Fed up, messed up, backed up(livin' for love)
Stepped on, splattered on (livin' for love for love)
I may be broke down and beat down and tore down and wore down
And fed up, and messed up but it's all right and you can kiss my
Because I'm livin' for love why'all
