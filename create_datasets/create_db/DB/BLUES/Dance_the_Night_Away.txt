Dance the night, dance the night
Dance the night away
Dance the night, dance the night
Dance the night away

Oh, it was just another letter on a rainy day
Crumbled in my hands and then thrown away
I ain't gonna love you now that loving's gone
I'm looking for the strength to carry on

Dance the night, dance the night
Dance the night away

Now you're just another photograph from yesterday
And I'll tell myself I didn't love you anyway
So I'll take a trip downtown with some old friends of mine
And if they ask, I'll say I'm feelin' fine

Gonna dance the night with all my friends
Until the morning light, 'til the last song ends
And all the while I'll be loving you like I do

Dance the night with all my friends
Until the morning light, 'til the last song ends
And all the while I'll be loving you like I do
Like I do

Oh, I'm gonna dance the night, dance the night
Dance the night away
Dance the night, dance the night
Dance the night away

Dance the night, dance the night
Dance the night away
Dance the night, dance the night
Dance the night away
