In here my Brixton briefcase (yea)
From across the pond
London's burning (yea)
But the beat goes on

Feel my power (power)
The electric life
Real rude boys (yea)
On the town tonight

We don't need no fighting
All these beautiful birds around
The liquor charge like lightning
As soon as the sun goes down

Turn it on
Hey!
Oh, turn it on
Hey!

Turn it on
Hey!
Oh, turn it on
Hey!

I got a Brixton briefcase (yea)
Ministry of Sound
The walls between us
We gon' tear them down

It's a Brixton briefcase (briefcase)
Is that such a sin?
Blokes get batoned
They get a Chelsea grin

Girl do your dance for me glorious
Smile and sing along
Shake your ass for me, mama
They're playin' your favorite song

Turn it on
Hey!
Oh, turn it on
Hey!

Turn it on
Hey!
Oh, turn it on
Hey!

All along from records
Nothing's solved
Turn it up louder
Tell Old Bill f*ck off

All my feelings
All my friends
Had to ride that train
All the way to the ends

All of you and not your neighbor
Pretending to be posh
Baby, the music can save us
Only a wanker was searching for

Get it on
Hey!
Get, get it on
Hey!

Turn it on
Oh, turn it on
Hey!

I got a Brixton briefcase
Feel my power
Got a Brixton briefcase
Feel my power
