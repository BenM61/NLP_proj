I never loved anyone, anytime, anyplace, 
With anything like the love I feel for you . . . 
I never saw anyone, more than once, maybe twice, 
But I had no ties until my eyes saw you . . . 
 
I may have kissed one or two, three or four, maybe more, 
But after all, I didn't fall, and who they were I can't recall . . . 
For I never loved anyone, anytime, anyplace, 
With anything like the love I feel for you . . . 
 
For everything that I love, I find in you . . . 
I never loved anyone, anytime, anyplace, 
With anything like the love I feel for you . . . 
For everything that I love, I find in you . . .
