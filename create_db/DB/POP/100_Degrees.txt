All around the world
Anticipation
'Cause here it comes again (you see)
No matter where you are
It could be near or far
But it still feels like Christmas time to me

I tell you what you already know
Forget and ready to let it go
The countdown has begun
Whether you're in the mmh
North, South, it's all the same
Let your troubles fade away
Get ready to love everyone

Whether the sun beats down
Or there's a storm around
Whether the snow falls or
It’s a hundred degrees
It’s still Christmas to me

Oh, we're gonna dance tonight
Oh, let the temperature rise to one hundred degrees
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees
Don't you know you just can't get enough?
Gonna keep heating it up to one hundred degrees
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees

Can you feel the heat on the floor?
Really gets you wanting some more
Let's make it neverending tonight

Whether the sun beats down
(Sun beats down)
Or there's a storm around
(Storm around)
Whether the snow falls or
It’s a hundred degrees
It’s still Christmas to me

Oh, we're gonna dance tonight
Oh, let the temperature rise to one hundred degrees
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees
Don't you know you just can't get enough?
Gonna keep heating it up to one hundred degrees
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees

Oh, what a cocktail time
Oh, we're loving all the fairy lights
Everyone's got a different way
But we all want the same
We want disco night

Hundred, hundred, hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred degrees (yeah, yeah)
It's still Christmas to me

Oh, we're gonna dance tonight
Oh, let the temperature rise to 100 degrees
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees
Don't you know you just can't get enough?
Gonna keep heating it up to 100 degrees
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees
