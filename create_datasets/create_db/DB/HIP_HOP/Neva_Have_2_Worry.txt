Fifteen years in the game man
And I'm still relevant
It's a blessing
It's a fine line and how to keep it cool
And keep it g
All keeping a g
Is keeping it cool
And all keeping it cool
Is keeping it g

[Verse 1]
1992, d cover hit the world
And fell in love with snoop
Doggystyle came out it's like I dropped the bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young, gettin' money livin' wild and free
Got owned and I brought the whole pound with me
Didn't matter who's around I kept it way to G
Niggas know it was eastside LBC
Gangsta shit
That's what A mothafuckin' gangsta Get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast then I Caught That Case
Hm, I fought dat case wondered where
Dad west would be
If I'd have lost that case I slow ma down
Swimin' with the sharks
And I almost drowned

[Chorus]
I done made some mistakes Long the way
To become the G I am today
Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't going nowhere
Only I ain't ever comin' down
I'm too high in the cloud
To ever have to worry 'bout that

[Verse 2]
I'm finally out and the critics
Say they love me cause I went to the south
Said I wasn't gone shine
Had me left for dead
Switch sides
Now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three
And you said it was weak
No limit top dogg the return of da biz
And from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
Last Meal was the one who took me off the leash
Thats the last time a nigga gonna eat off of me
Stack black after black game
Mil your soul I'm the boss of this bitch
And I ain't never went gold 
Nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Boss of the city
Boss of the coast
Some other niggaz try but none
Of them come close they stuck like a silly
But nothing like a loke the big bow wow
I kill it with one stroke thats what it's about
They tryin' a tell a nigga What to come out his mouth
Mothafucka I'm a G, but first I'm a man
Freedom of speech bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me saying this my talk
Just some women is hoes like it's my fault
Hm, damn they lost they just don't know
That a bitch is a bitch and a hoe is a hoe
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smokin' Down livin' like a boss
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smoking down livin' like a boss
Nigga

[Chorus]

Too high, too high In the cloud

[x7]
To ever have to worry 'bout that too high, too high in the cloud

To ever have to worry 'bout that 
Too high

To ever have to worry 'bout that 
To ever have to worry 'bout that 
No, no, to ever have
To worry 'bout that 
No, no, no
To ever have to worry 'bout that 
To ever have to worry 'bout that 
No more, no more, no more
To ever have to worry 'bout that 
I'm too high
To ever have to worry 'bout that 
To ever have to worry 'bout that
