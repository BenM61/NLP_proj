There's something, that I gotta tell ya'
'Cause I know, that a brother got needs tonight
I ain't trippin' on ya' pimpin' just that this time
'Cause you gotta pay tonight tonight tonight

I know you wanna get paid tonight
But I'm tryna get paid tonight
We ain't even gotta fuss and fight
Just hit me right, it's on all night
I know you wanna get in bed wit' me
But you gotta come correctly
Nothin' in life is free, especially not me

(Oobie)
I hope you, can feel me
When I say, pay before you play wit' me
Wanna taste this, but it's priceless
It's something that you never done before, I'm not ya ordinary hoe

I know you wanna get paid tonight
But I'm tryna get paid tonight
We ain't even gotta fuss and fight
Just hit me right, it's on all night
I know you wanna get in bed wit' me
But you gotta come correctly
Nothin' in life is free, especially not me
