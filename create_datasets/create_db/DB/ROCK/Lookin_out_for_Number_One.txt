Get in my car and start the engine
I ain't ready for another day
There's a line up at the station
There's a crawl on the highway
I can't believe it's Monday morning
I can't believe I'm out of bed
I'm still living in the weekend
I feel the pounding in my head

This time there's no turning back
I'm gonna find my place in the sun
You can tell the boss he's at a loss
I'm lookin' out for number one
Maybe I'll go to New York City
Maybe end up in L.A.
I've had enough of bad luck, baby
For once I'll do it my way

I don't need no bad job
I don't need no nine to five
All I need is a Rosalita
To make me feel alive

This time there's no turning back
I'm gonna find my place in the sun
You can tell the boss he's at a loss
I'm lookin' out for number one

(GUITAR SOLO)

This time there's no turning back
I'm gonna find my place in the sun
You can tell the boss he's at a loss
I'm lookin' out for number one

This time there's no turning back
I'm gonna find my place in the sun
You can tell the boss he's at a loss
I'm lookin' out for number one
