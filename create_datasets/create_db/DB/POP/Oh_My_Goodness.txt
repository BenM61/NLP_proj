Oh me, oh my
I'm so sad that I could cry
With a very good reason why

I've no one to be gay with
That's why I wear a frown
No children I can play with
London bridge is falling down
My fair lady

I wanna make mud pies
In fact I'd like to be a mess
I wanna make mud pies
I know that I'd find happiness
If I got jam on my fingers
Chocolate on my face
And molasses all over my dress

You're the only friends I've ever had
But one minute you're good
And the very next minute you're bad!

At times I ought to hate you
You make me feel so blue
But honest I can't hate you
When you smile at me the way you do
Oh, my goodness!

Sometimes I want to leave you
You tell such awful lies
But I could never leave you
When I look into those great big eyes
Oh, my goodness!

I love you, do you love me
Honey, if you don't, why don'tcha
Honey, if you won't, why won'tcha
Am I gonna have trouble with you?

I really ought to scold you
You'll have me old and grey
But when it's time to scold you
I hold you in my arms and say
Oh, my. Oh, my...
Oh, my goodness!

Zometimes I ought to hashe you
You make me veel zo blue
But onest I can't hashe you
When you zmile at me, my lovely poupchen
Ach, mein gootness!

You are my ev'ry ting-a-vitch
You're like a day in spring-a-vitch
And you make my heart sing-a-vitch
Looky-looky-looksky, here comes trotsky
Oh, chah chornya

I lovee you, do you lovee me
Maya-kaya-kow-kow see see
Eenie-meenie mo-guss meenzie
Am I gonna have ta-louble with you?

Honey child, I really ought to scold ya
You'll have your mammy old and grey
Pickaninny, when it's time ta scold ya
I just hold ya in my lovin' arms and say
Oh, my-- heidi, heidi, heidi, hi!
Oh... my goodness
