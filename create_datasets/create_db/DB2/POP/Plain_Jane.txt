My plain Jane never wear no lipstick or paint
You know she'll never try to be what she ain't
Come early in the morning you can hear the fella's call (woo)

Plain Jane won't you come out tonight so we can have a ball
Plain Jane won't you come out tonight, come out tonight, come out tonight
Plain Jane won't you come out tonight, spend some time with me

Her mouth's a little too wide and her nose a wee bit long
And when you take a good look at her her shape seems all wrong
But she got this certain something that's so hard to define
And I wish that certain something was mine, all mine, all mine

And old Plain Jane won't you come out tonight, come out tonight, come out tonight
Plain Jane won't you come out tonight, spend some time with me

I used to go with glamour girls to worship day and night
But Plain Jane has a cotton dress and it don't fit her right
I could never, never tell 'ya why I love her like I do
But if you took her out one fine night, you'd feel the same way I do

Plain Jane won't you come out tonight, come out tonight, come out tonight
Plain Jane won't you come out tonight, spend some time with me

I say, spend some time with me
Woo plain Jane
I love her just the same
Oh plain Jane
