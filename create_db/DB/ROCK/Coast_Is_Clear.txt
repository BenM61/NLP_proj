Above my bed, in this ugly room
Hangs the whisper of the same man
You can't be my father
For the love we've shown
It's just a little to me
It's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and always will be
Take it, I don't want it
You can have what you like
Just don't try to trick me to sleep
Don't turn out the lights
You can't be my father
For the love we've shown
It's just a little to me
It's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and I always will be
Dreams of meeting truth
Be my father
Dreams of meeting truth
For the
Dreams of meeting truth
Be my father
Dreams of meeting truth
Now I'm sick, always, always, always
Just when you thought it was all right
Just when you thought it was all right
Just when you thought it was all right
Just when you thought it was all right
Open your eyes now, girl
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
