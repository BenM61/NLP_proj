But if only you could see them
You would know from their faces
There were kings and queens
Followed by princes and princesses
There were future power people
From the loved to the loveless
Shining a light 'cause they wanted it seen
Well there were cries of why
Followed by cries of why not

Spreading love and unity so it can be found
