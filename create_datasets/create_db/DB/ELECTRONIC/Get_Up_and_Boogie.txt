The night was happening; music was loud
He sat alone another face in the crowd
I knew for certain, didn't think twice, he seemed nice
A little action could really break the ice

So I walked over and I asked him to dance
To my surprise he simply held out his hand
I knew for certain, he was too shy, don't know why
Well know he's doing just fine

Get up and boogie
Stand up and do it
Get up and boogie and get in the mood, yeah

Get up and boogie
Time for some happiness
Leave all your troubles behind
Get up and boogie now

Rock it, swing it, everybody sing it
Come on, boogie, don't you ever stop!

We started dancing; he didn't have a clue
And so I showed him how to get up and move
I knew for certain, I told him why, my oh my
We had to give it try

Get up and boogie
Stand up and do it
Get up and boogie and get in the mood, yeah

Get up and boogie
Time for some happiness
Leave all your troubles behind

Now he's having the time, the time of his life, yeah
Now he's out of his mind, look at him go, go, go 

Rock it, swing it, everybody sing it
Come on, boogie, don't you ever stop!
Dig it, shake it, there's no reason to fake it
We're gonna do it all night, come on take over baby now

Get up and boogie now
Oh yeah, and get in the mood, yeah
