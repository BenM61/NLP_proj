Dave ran away to the circus
To get away from the clowns
To give his life some purpose
Before he shot somebody down

He stopped at every service station
On the motorway heading west
And drove the central reservation
Into the center of his chest

And the world carries on without Davy
It's not a worse or better place
Uglier and safer maybe
But that's a question of personal taste

And every year come rain or sunshine
I put flowers on his grave
But it's not easy sometime
I've learned to live in a world without D A V E

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeeh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeh, yeeh

Monday I do the laundry
Tuesday pay the bills
Wednesday the gospel
According to the supermarket tills

Thursday, empty the dustbins
Friday, I visit my mum's
It's just a simple loss adjustment
Until the weekend comes

And the world carries on without Davy
It's not a worse or better place
Uglier and safer maybe
But that's a question of personal taste

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeeh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeh, yeeh

And the world carries on without Davy
It's not a worse or better place
Uglier and safer maybe
But that's a question of personal taste

I might run away to the circus
To get away from the clowns
To give my life some purpose
Before I shoot somebody down
