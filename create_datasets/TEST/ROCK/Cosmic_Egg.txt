Walking through the gallery of light
Say hello to all those wayward eyes
Light up and cast your fears away
Look into what you've learned
How does it feel to have yearned?
The gift that she gave was given to be given away

Tell me all of your good reasons
Tell me every word you say
Ive given you all of the seasons
Running through the night and day
I'm going out of my mind since Ive seen you
Tell me how I got to live this way
I take a look around this town
People get up but they don't get down

Standing on the edge of nowhere
Tell me all of your good reasons
Tell me every word you say
Ive given you all of the seasons
Running through the night and day
I'm going out of my mind since Ive seen you
Tell me how I got to live this way
