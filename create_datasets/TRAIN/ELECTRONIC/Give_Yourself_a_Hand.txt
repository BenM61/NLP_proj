Hello, Mr. Fussy 
Hello, Mrs. Nice 
Have you ever shared a bathtub 
Full of beer and ice?
I know you want to 
I know you can 
Put down your children 
And free up your hands

Come on and free up your hands 
Come on and free up your hands

Do you still like to kiss her? 
Do you still hold her hand? 
Would you cheat with her sister? 
Do you march to her band? 
And when you're by yourself 
With a drink in one hand 
Do you break your little rule 
And give yourself the other hand?

C'mon and give yourself a hand 
C'mon and give yourself a hand 
C'mon and give yourself a hand 
C'mon and give yourself a hand
I know your wife's uncle
He's a very nice man 
He's got long clever fingers 
On his lovely pink hands 
Did you give that bad boy 
The back of your hand? 
I know you want to 
I know you can

Give him the back of your hand 
Give him the back of your hand 
Give him the back of your hand 
Give him the back of your hand
