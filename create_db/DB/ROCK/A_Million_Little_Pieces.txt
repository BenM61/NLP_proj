There wasn't much I used to need
A smile would blow a summer breeze through my heart
Now my mistakes are haunting me
Like winter came and put a freeze on my heart

I've lost the power to understand
What it takes to be a man with my heart
I saw you wanted this to end
You tried your best to be a friend to my heart

But I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love, understand?

Whenever I was feeling wrong
I used to go and write a song from my heart
But now I feel I've lost my spark
No more glowing in the dark for my heart

So I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love, understand?

Understand? 
Understand?
Understand?
Understand?

Understand? (Can't you see I'm sick of fighting?)
Understand? (Can't you tell I've lost my way?)
Understand? (Look at me theirs no denying)
Understand? (I wont last another day)

So I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love, understand?

Then I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love, understand?

All my dreaming torn in pieces
All my dreaming torn in pieces
All my dreaming torn in pieces
All my dreaming torn in pieces now
