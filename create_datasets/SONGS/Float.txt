Now I don't know if I'm lost
But this all just looks the same
I am pushing on the door
Between sorrow and fame

I would crawl out of this hole
If it wasn't so cold
In the morning, I'll be fine
In the morning, I'll be right

If I go all the way
Then the girl won't stay, no the girl won't stay
I know I can change
If we both get old, will you let me float away?

I don't want to be young
But I don't want to die
I can whisper in the wind
We can smoke out every night

I don't want to live alone
I don't want to stay inside
I can learn from my mistakes
In the morning I'll be right

If I go all the way
Then the girl won't stay, no the girl won't stay
I know I can change
If we both get old will you let me float away?

If I go all the way
Then the girl won't stay, no the girl won't stay
I know I can change
If we both get old will you let me float away?
