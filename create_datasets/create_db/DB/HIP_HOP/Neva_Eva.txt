Get some rank bitch while I'm diggin' ya grave with a shovel
Time after time I ask myself is it really clever
For you to get with me, bitch nigga you can neva eva
You ain't on my level, I'm pushin' Chevrolet pedal

Call us some broad to the Geor-Georgia Dome
Tryin' to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P AKA Corlio
Up in the club with my Cartier's on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or gettin' my roll on
He on the cell "Can ya hear me" hell nah
Get on my level, that's what I'm tryin' to tell y'all for real

If ya thinkin' you can f*ck with a nigga like me

Pussy nigga, get bit boy 

'Bout cut out ya brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood suckin' vampire, my venom is worse
Head bustas deal with dangerous thirsts
Shatter ya bones in ya chest and make ya motherfuckin' heart burst
Don't worry now, Prince of the South on the map
Knock yo' thoughts out and leave yo brains in ya lap
Don't touch my Kango shorty, what's wrong with you
I might cock my fist back and knock yo grill through

Bitch nigga you can neva eva, eva eva
Eva eva, eva eva eva eva
