Well in a few more hours, and millions of people
Hate their alarm clock even more than their wives
The day is beginning, you can tell by the sunrise
People get ready for a day in their lives

They're getting together in the streets of the city
Like lost computers of a shattered tribe
They're all in a hurry, to be in time
Some for promotion, some to stay alive

Yeah, yeah
I'm the all day watcher, that's all I do
I'm the all day watcher, I'm watching you
Well I shake my head and I shake my brain

And I don't understand why they're all the same
I weigh pro's and con's, against their lives and mine
But I don't know, it's beyond my frame of mind
Beyond my frame of mind, yeah

Oh, in a few more minutes, and millions of people
Hear the whistle of freedom blowing through their head
They push and they hurry and the herd starts moving
They follow the trail back home again

Where they're taking it easy with a box of beer
Watching the late late show on color TV
And life ain't easy when you're livin' that way
But sometimes I wonder, maybe it's fun everyday

Yeah, yeah
I'm the all day watcher, that's all I do
I'm the all day watcher, I'm watching you
