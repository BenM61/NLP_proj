I guess it's luck, but it's the same
Hard luck you've been trying to tame.

Maybe it's love but it's like you said,
Love is like a role that we play.

But I believe in you so much,
I could die for the words that you say.

But I believe in you so much,
I could die from the words that you say.

But you're chasing the ghost
Of a good thing. Haunting yourself
As the real thing is getting away from you again,
While you're chasing ghosts.

Just bend the pieces 'til they fit,
Like they were made for it.
But they weren't meant for this.
No they weren't meant for this.

Chasing the ghost
Of a good thing. Haunting yourself
As the real thing is getting away, away, away, away
From you again,

Chasing the ghost
Of a good thing. Haunting yourself
As the real thing is getting away, away, away, away
From you again,
While you're chasing ghosts.
