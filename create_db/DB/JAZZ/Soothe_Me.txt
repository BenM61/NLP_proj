Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me

Oh how I used to ramble
And how I used to roam
Oh but since I met that baby of mine
All I do is stay at home
And I tell her to

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me

Oh I used to have a lotta girls
Have them big and small
Oh, but since I met that baby of mine
I don't want no other girls at all
I just tell her

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
For you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me

Soothe me, baby soothe me
Soothe me, with your kindness
Oh you know your powerful love is
Soothing to me.
