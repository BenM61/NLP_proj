Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Can't you see me breaking down
It's another day without sleep
It's another night without dreams, dreams

Full moon and my eyes are wide
I will wait for you till the sky turns blue
When the time is right

Make me dance, make me move in time
I can't go to sleep when I hear the beat
I come alive

Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Can't you see me breaking down
It's another day without sleep
It's another night without dreams, dreams

Kiss me deep, don't leave with life
All night all day, I just can't wait
You make me high

Hey, baby, where you been this time
Your insatiable and I just can't hold
All my love inside

Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Can't you see me breaking down
It's another day without sleep
It's another night without dreams, dreams

Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Patiently I wait for you to come to me

To come to me, to come to me
To come to me, to come to me

Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Patiently I wait for you to come to me
