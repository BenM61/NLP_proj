I am a foreigner 
And I'm walking through new streets
But before I want to I see the same deeds
Inherited by few a power machine
That crushed and strangles you right in your sleep

But be it me, or it's you 
The leisure class, I think we all know
That be it punk, hip-hop, be it a reggae sound
It is all connected through
The gypsy part of town
Let's go!

It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike

And let your girl scouts 
Lip-synch about the freedom
Just the way you want them but soon enough you'll see them
Soon enough they all turn around
And soon enough you'll see them in a different part of town

'Cause be it me or it's you
The leisure class, I think we all know
That be it punk, hip-hop, or be it a reggae sound
It is all connected through 
The gypsy part of town
Let's go!

It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike

I am a foreigner 
And I'm walking through new streets
But before I want to I see the same deeds
Inherited by few a power machine
That crushed and strangles you right in your sleep

But be it me, or it's you 
The leisure class, I think we all know
That be it punk, hip-hop, be it a reggae sound
It is all connected through
The gypsy part of town
Let's go!

It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike
It's the underdog world strike

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
It's the underdog world strike
