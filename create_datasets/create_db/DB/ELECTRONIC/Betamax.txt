Sometimes I lie to get what I want
Oh man, it's terrible I know
They won't agonize
And every time you betamax alone

Sometimes I fight to get what I want
Closer can help your mind, i know
Although, either time, it's hard to get inside alone

Miles 'til the very end of the sky
Loving every hour
Loving every minute
Arms and fingers, miles apart
Suddenly realize
My love is infinite

Sometimes I lie to get what I want
Oh no, it's tearing me apart
This time I will drive
For we've decided to see the long way home

Miles 'til the very end of the sky
Loving everyday
more than every minute
Arms and fingers, miles apart
Suddenly realize
My love is infinite

I'm hunky-dory every day
Loving every hour
Loving every minute
Hours and minutes, it's miles apart
