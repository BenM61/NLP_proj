Hmm, closer
I wanna be closer to you

(I like to get close)
Closer
(I like to get close)
Like to be close to you, baby
(I like to get close
To the one I love)

Oh baby, I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag

My girl, she asked me how come I don't do the boogaloo?
(Boogaloo)
I told her, baby 'cause I can't get close enough to you
(Close to you)
(Closer, closer)

I told her that's the only dance
That I like to do, it's a dance
I can hold her yet steal a little kiss or two

Oh baby, I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag
And I want to slow down with you, baby
I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag

My girl, she asked me out to the party
Her friends told her that I was a drag
(Drag)
Just because I don't do the dance the way they want me to
Can't they see that I'm in a different bag?

Oh baby, I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag
And I want to slow down with you, baby
I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag

Ooh, hold me close
Hold me closer to you
And all you got to do is squeeze me, baby
And hold me closer to you

Oh baby, I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag
And I want to slow down with you, baby

I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag
I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag

I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag
I like to get close to the one I love
So I slow drag
