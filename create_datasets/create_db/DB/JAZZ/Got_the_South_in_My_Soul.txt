When the dark night starts fallin'
And the moon starts to roam,
What is this thing that keeps callin'?
It's the south in my soul!

How I long for that delta,
It's my home, it's my goal!
Oughta be safe in its shelter,
Got the south in my soul!

Too long I've lingered in the darkness,
No matter what I won;
I wanna say goodbye to darkness,
Spend all my days in the sun!

Let me laugh there on that levee,
And let me burn black as coal!
I know my heart won't be so heavy,
With the south, south in my soul!
