[Tony Yayo]
Ma I'm curious to know if I lick that spot
Will it make your body shiver and your panties drop?
Ya baby father is a lame, he a dead beat dad
So you and your kids can come cruise in my Jag
You my boo like Usher and Alicia Keys
And every time that you touch me girl you please my needs
We like George and Weezy, Jada and Will
Lets shop till we drop out in Beverly Hills
I'm curious to know if you want me girl
If so ma lets fly the country girl
I'm not sellin you a dream girl I'll give you the world
You want them furs and the minks and them diamond pearls

[Joe-Chorus]
Ma I'm curious (yea)
I wonder if I can make you mine
Baby I'm curious (so curious)
I wonder if we can spend some time
Shorty I'm curious (whoa)
Girl I wanna know wat's on your mind
Baby I'm curious (so curious)
I wonder if I can make you mine

[Tony Yayo]
I saw her in the projects goin to the store
I never had a crush like this before
Her baby daddy is a killer, he hold weight in Attica
But every time he home, he beatin her and smackin her
Ma you don't need your face black and blue
You need diamonds from Jacob that's black and blue
Water front property you see the sun risin
Back to the subject let me stop fantasizing
Listen boo, nobody in the world is perfect
So when you around my team there's no need to be nervous
I hit it from the back pull out your tracks
This curiosity girl, you's the cat

[Joe-Chorus x2]
Ma I'm curious (yea)
I wonder if I can make you mine
Baby I'm curious (so curious)
I wonder if we can spend some time
Shorty I'm curious (whoa)
Girl I wanna know wat's on your mind
Baby I'm curious (so curious)
I wonder if I can make you mine

I wanna make you mine baby
I gotta make you mine baby
Said I wanna make you mine baby
Gotta make you mine baby
Ohhhh
So curious ohhh yeaaa
