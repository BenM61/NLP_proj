Peace with me now 
I never thought I could know how 
Sleep in Your love 
I feel Your arms that keep me now 

Could never be without You 
Could never be without Your love 
I feel You from above 
Don't ever want to be alone 

You'll never leave me drifting 
You'd never take away the peace 
Or run away from me 
Need Your love 
Love
