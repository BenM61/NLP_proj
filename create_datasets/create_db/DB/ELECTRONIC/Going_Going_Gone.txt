Sometimes looking back I can't
Believe how many times I left her
I guess it's all part of the game
That we play
All is fair in love and war
But in this case they're quite the same thing
What's the difference if I go
Or if I stay?
I tried to tell her
I was not the only one to turn to
But she was indifferent to my pleas
And now she's
Going, going, gone
And I did nothing wrong
But she's going, going, gone
If I disappeared tonight
It would not change her mind about me
She's in love with someone who has changed
Since that day
She tried to tell me
I was not the only one to turn to
But I won't get down on my knees
So she's
Going, going, gone
And I did nothing wrong
But she's going, going, gone
