Well, some people love mambo
And so do I
The dance is kinda hard
So I don't think I'll try
I'll do the boogie
Yes, I'll do the boogie
Well, I'll do the boogie
'Cause I think it's much easier to do

Well , some people swing fast
Some swing it slow
It just knocks me out
To see my baby on the floor
I love to see her boogie
Yes, love to see her boogie
Well, I love to see her boogie
I think I'll try it a little bit too

Well, I swing her way out
Then pull her in close
I'm tellin' you, boys
That upsets me the most
I love to see her boogie
Yes, love to see her boogie
Well, it knocks me out to see her boogie
So, I think I'll try it a little bit too
