Evil, they say evil lives.
They say evil takes and evil gives.
Evil, they say evil lives.
That it never forgets and that.
It never forgives.

It's never their own fault no it's,
always the same.
They always needed someone else or.
Something else to blame.
Never a question of who's.
Master or slave or who pushes
who to the grave.

Evil, they say evil breeds.
On evil deeds evil feeds.
Evil, they say evil breeds.
It's a pretty hard bite.
On the hand that feeds.

They're still burning witches here everyday.
And raise their crosses on their holy crusades.
It's what happens when you act in the shade.
There's where the shadows are made.

Evil, I'm not evil.
Evil, I'm not evil?
