Let your love flow down
Let it fall to the ground
Therein lies the roots
Reaching for the stream

All I wanna do
Is keep on reaching through
Keep on reaching through

To the river wide and strong
It won't take long
We can all go together
If we just hold on

A new generation
And a brand new age
I wanna fall like rain
On burning pages

Rise from the ashes
Like a phoenix sun
Learning to flow
Searching for love

You know that I can't get enough of
Get enough of that hope
Oooh oooh oooh
Hope

Hope
Hope, yeah
Hope, yeah yeah

Hope
Hope, hey eh
I want my child to see the beauty of this place
To walk from the mountains, to the sea

Hope
Hope, yeah
Hope, yeah yeah

Hope, yeah yeah
Hope, hope... yeah, yeah

You know that I can't get enough of
Get enough of that hope

Oooh oooh
Hope
Oooh, yeah
Hope
Oooh oooh
Hope
Yeah eh

You know that I can't get enough of (x4)

I wanna promise you
Hope for a generation (x2)

I wanna promise you
