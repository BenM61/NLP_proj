Let's take a trip to the edge of the night,
Where the stars and the sun collide
Won't wait a lifetime, it's our turn
To put our footprints all over the world

We live forever wherever we go,
Leaving footprints all over the world
In this together we'll never let go
We'll leave our footprints all over the world

The world, the world, all over the world
The world, the world, all over the world
The world, the world, all over the world
Let's leave our footprints all over the world

Leave our footprints all over the world

Let's leave our footprints all over the world

Leave our footprints all over the world
All over the world
All over the world
Over the world
Let's leave our footprints all over the world

We are the old and we are the young
A million strangers, we move as one
Won't wait a lifetime, it's our turn
To put our footprints all over the world

We live forever wherever we go
Leaving footprints all over the world
In this together we'll never let go
We'll leave our footprints all over the world

The world, the world, all over the world
The world, the world, all over the world
The world, the world, all over the world
Let's leave our footprints all over the world

Let's leave our footprints all over the world

Leave our footprints all over the world

Leave our footprints all over the world

The world, the world, all over the world
The world, the world, all over the world
The world, the world, all over the world
Let's leave our footprints all over the world
