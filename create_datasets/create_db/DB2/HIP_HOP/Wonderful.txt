Trouble burning up my mind
She's the spot in my shade
Thirsty for her all the time
She's my cold and my name

If there was a way I could put it
Make it so that you could understand
That I'm only half a man without her (oh no)
Gonna give my all, my heart, my mind, my soul
Take it
Ain't no other word that can describe it
Baby, baby, you are...

Wonderful
Your style, your vibe, your body
Amazing
Oh, just gotta tell somebody
Wonderful
Hey! To put it simply, you are
Everything (everything, babe)
You're so wonderful

Music to my melody
You are where I belong (yeah)
Girl, together, you and me
We're a beautiful song

If there was a way I could put it
Make it so that you could understand
That I'm only half a man without her (yeah)
Gonna give my all, my heart, my mind, my soul
Take it
Ain't no other word that can describe it
Baby, baby, you are...

Wonderful
Your style, your vibe, your body
Amazing
Oh, just gotta tell somebody
Wonderful
Hey! To put it simply, you are
Everything (everything, babe)
You're so wonderful

Baby, let's be the moon
Let's watch the stars get
Jealous of your shine (hey)
Nothing that better for me (nothing better, baby)
Girl, everything is too wonderful

Wonderful
Amazing (so amazing, baby)
Wonderful (to put it simply, you are)
Everything (everything, girl)
You're so wonderful

Wonderful
Amazing
Wonderful
Everything
You're so wonderful
