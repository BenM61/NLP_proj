And I know we were both too young way back when we had our thing
And you're not the one that I think every time that the telephone rings
And I know that what we had would not be called love by the ones who know
And I know it's been many years and hundred love affairs a go
I know all that so well but I also do know this

Calleth you cometh I
And that's just how it is
And how it is always been

It's were my reason stops
And something else comes in

I know it doesn't make sense
But still
Calleth you cometh I

And that's how it is!!!

And I know we became restrained every time we were among friends
And I know how it was last time and how bitterly it always ends
And I know we were both too young to know what real love would be like
And I know our communication didn't always work out right.

I know all that so well but I also do know this

Calleth you cometh I
And that's just how it is
And how it's always been

It's were my reason stops
And something else came in

I know it doesn't make sense
But still
Calleth you cometh I
And I've been waiting for this so long,waiting to sing this song
For, you
