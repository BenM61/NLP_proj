Sleep with the window open
Sleep till tomorrow
Be my hero
Be without being lonely

Try to open
We try to open
Hoping for a hero
I want something

I want everything
I want nothing
Nothing else
I want someone

Not just anyone
Be my hero
Keep what is secret
Secret

We can believe it
Be my hero
I want something
I want everything

I want nothing
Nothing else
I want someone
Not just anyone

Be my hero
See how we measure feeling
From a distance
See how we measure people

Into zero
I want something
I want everything
I want nothing

Nothing else
I want someone
Almost anyone
