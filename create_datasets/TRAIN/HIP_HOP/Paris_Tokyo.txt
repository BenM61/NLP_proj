I know, I know but I gotta get outta here
You know, I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do
You know, one time for your mind

Let's go to sleep in Paris
And wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, Mayne

I love her and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring ring went the Iphone, it was my homie
He said, ?Let's hit Japan if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the South of France?

Nothin' further, I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to 'Walk it Out' like Unk in my John Lennon chucks
That's when I heard Murder, you're killin' me, you're fillin' me
With sorrow, sunrise, goodbyes and missin' you tomorrow's

I turn to see, my dream love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene, cry
I drop my bags in a flash that's faster one
Than 180 on that dash sir to dry her tears

And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the user name to all my passwords
The reason I get fly as Ivan Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport, love, love

Let's go to sleep in Paris
And wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, Mayne

Then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sand
Take a train to Rome or home
Brazil, for real

Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

So let's keep it real, all in together, free chill
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class, seat and sleep

Don't wake me till I land, when they barely understand
What I speak but they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand and they clap
They applaud, they love me, my God

O'scadie sama'desta or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint Henry, then back to Charles de Gaul
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been
And everythin' that I done and tell her that she's the one and um

Let's go to sleep in Paris
And wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, Mayne

Then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sand
Take a train to Rome or home
Brazil, for real

Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth?
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed ya
In my dreams fore I went to sleep to Lala land to count them sheep

I swear you're lookin' prettier than Eva
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together ever more
For better or less or poor or worth our weight in buried treasure
X's on the shore

I know my world tour's like war to ya
But Ian said, ?Aloha? and Harley said, ?Cheers?
Julian said, ?Bonjour?, Big O was like, ?Yeah?
Amanda and Lemessie want to know when we goin' there

Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for my tenderness

She said, ?Pursue your interests, 'cause even if I'm ticket less
I'll be there, by your side in your heart on your mind?
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bay now bring it back, now

Let's go to sleep in Paris
And wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, Mayne

Then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sand
Take a train to Rome or home
Brazil, for real

Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
