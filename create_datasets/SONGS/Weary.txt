This woman is growing weary
Of having to be so strong
Of having to pretend 
Not made of stone
So I don't end up with no broken bones
I can't fight every battle alone

I want someone to love me
Heal my wounds and give me
Kisses on my head
Say words that should be said
Fear is not the matter
I would so much rather
Open up my heart 
And let down my guard

If I could trust someone
(To have my back and never do me wrong)
Then I would give my lover
(Just like that and stop singing this old juke song)
(Just like that and stop singing this old juke song)

Whoever said that love was overrated
Must not be getting none
My independent days have had their fun
But when the party's over
And the working day is done
I just want to go home to someone

I want a love to take me 
As I am not make me
Compromise myself
Or be like no one else
Fear is not the matter
I would so much rather
Open up my heart 
And just lay down my guard

If I could trust someone
(To have my back and never do me wrong)
Then I would give my lover
(Just like that and stop singing this old juke song)
(Just like that and stop singing this old juke song)

I want some one to love me
Heal my wounds and give me
Kisses on my head 
Say things that should be said
Say things that should be said

If I could trust someone
(To have my back and never do me wrong)
Then I would give my lover
(Just like that and stop singing this old juke song)
(Just like that and stop singing this old juke song)
