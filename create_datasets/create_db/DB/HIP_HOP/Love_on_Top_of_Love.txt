If I had two lips,
I could give you that killer kiss,
And make a smack on your leg, 
Make you forget about everything else,
But I don't need no extra help, 
I'm already too much for one man,
In love, you love, and love, 
Love to be loved over and over again.

I'll give you soothe cooling action, 
Juicy lipped passion,
I'm what you want, 
I'm what you need, 
That sexy looking mouth is me,
If you want to give a kiss, 
Come and get it, come get my love on top of love,
I've got what you need and more, 
More than you bargained for ,
Come get my love on top of love,
Yeah! Uh huh, love.

It's ten o'clock, 
Time for the second shift,
Another man, another love, another kiss,
I'm talking about jungle love, 
Tastes like cherries (after) paradise,
I'm mean a cooler passion, 
My killer kiss, hot as ice, 
The green-eyed stranger, time for a wager,
I'm what you want, I'm what you need, 
That sexy looking pout is me.

If you want to give a kiss, come and get it,
