Maybe I find it hard
Watching you live
Maybe I find the truth
Questions I can't bare
Feeling so tired
I'm wondering where
Selfish love inspires
Are you there to hold my hand
Saving me who I spy

Maybe you are the rain
Who makes my eyes closed
Ocean's grey and grey
Feeling my despair
Your happy smile is broken
I'm wondering there
Selfish love has spoken

Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy
Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy
Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy
