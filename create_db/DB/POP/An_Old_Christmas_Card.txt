There's an old Christmas card in an old dusty trunk
And it brings back sweet memories dear to me
'Though it's faded and worn, it's as precious as the morn
When I found it 'neath our first Christmas tree

I thrill with every word, every line
Guess I'm always sentimental 'round this time
Pardon me if a tear falls among my Christmas cheer
It's the memory of an old Christmas card

You know, I don't know why I get to feeling sentimental
About this time, every year
But every time I see a Christmas card
I somehow can't help reminiscing

About the very first Christmas that you and I spent together
What a beautiful Christmas card you gave me that year
Why I know you must have looked through thousands of cards
To find that wonderful poem that still brings a tear to my eyes

I thrill with every word, every line
Guess I'm always sentimental 'round this time
Pardon me if a tear falls among my Christmas cheer
It's the memory of an old Christmas card
