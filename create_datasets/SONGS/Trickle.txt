Trickle down my sadness
Watch it fall and wash away
Now that I have got this far
I'm leaving you
Never coming back to hear you say
Missing you has pained my day
Come to me and hear you say
All that we have gone through
Can't you see that it?s enough?
Fight for us
Don't throw it all away

If you want me back
You won't hear me say
Fight for us
Fight for us

Trickle down my sadness
Watch it fall and wash away
Now that I have got this far
I'm missing you
Never coming back to hear you say
Leaving you has pained my day
Come to me and hear you say
All that we have gone through
Can't you see that it?s enough?
Fight for us
Don't throw it all away

If you want me back
You won't hear me say
Fight for us
Fight for us
If you come my way
You won't hear me say
Fight for us
Don't throw away
