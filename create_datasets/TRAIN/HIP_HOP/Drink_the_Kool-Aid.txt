This ain't Sinatra! This ain't the Carter!
I am the "chaperon" nigga who brought ya!

Industry laid out authorities are too late!
M.C's passed the due date! Niggas? They do hate!
You are Bobby Boucher, I'm the "Mane" like "Gucci"!
I rock the Louie! But not like Kanye!
Nigga see me kinda like Harry Belafonte!
Step into the room they be like, "Ah, Day-O!"

Shots all fatal! Is this Laredo?
Boarder town I knock 'em down just like Lego's!
Drink the Kool-Aid!

I ain't the Doctor! This ain't the patient!

I got more bars then the penitentiary!
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary!
Young bucks try to step up to the harem!
Looking for some pussy I'm a' old buck, I dare 'em!
