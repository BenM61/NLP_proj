Every night I'm there,
I'm always there, she knows I'm there,
and heaven knows, I hope she goes
I find it hard to realize that love was in her eyes,
it's dying now, she knows I'm crying now,
And every night I'm there, I break my heart to please

Eloise, Eloise
You know I'm on my knees, yeah, I said please
You're all I want so hear my prayer, my prayer

My Eloise is like the stars that please the night,
the sun that makes the day, that lights the way
And when my star goes by, I'll hold it in my hands and cry,
her love is mine, my sun will shine
Every night I'm there I break my heart to please

Eloise, Eloise
You're all I want, you gotta hear my prayer

My Eloise, I'd love to please her,
I'd love to care, but she's not there
And when I find you, I'd be so kind,
you'd want to stay, I know you'd stay

And as the days grow old, the nights grow cold,
I want to hold her near to me, I know she's dear to me
And only time can tell and take away this lonely hell,
I'm on my knees to Eloise
And every night I'm there, I break my heart to please

Eloise, Eloise
You are my life so hear my prayer
You are the price, I know you're there
You're all I want so hear my prayer
You're all I need and I'm not there,
you know I'm not there
