We were sexy
We were bad
We were everything, everyone wished they had
We were crazy
We were good
We did everything that others wished they could

We were falling when the skies were blue
It's a shame how winter came too soon
Tried to love you but the love falls too
Should we let it go, let it go, let it go?

I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
All the things that we've done
Oh, how I miss your body and the sun
I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
We were nothing but fun
Oh, how I miss your body and the sun

Ain't no limits
Ain't no rules
Baby there ain't no telling what we can do
We'll get crazy
We'll be cool
We'll do everything that others wished they could

We were falling when the skies were blue
It's a shame how winter came too soon
Tried to love you but the love falls too
Should we let it go, let it go, let it go?

I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
All the things that we've done
Oh how I miss your body and the sun
I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
We were nothing but fun
Oh how I miss your body and the sun

Oh how I miss your body and the sun

I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
Oh, how I miss your body and the sun
Oh, how I miss your body and the sun
Oh, how I miss your body and the sun
