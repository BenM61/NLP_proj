Candles aflame
Drank all the red wine
Dancing to jazz, you know you keep me in time.
And your skin's so soft. 
Lips are so wet.
Afraid to move a muscle
Yeah I'm holding my breath.

And you asked me what I said?
And I tell you, I tell you now

Are you coming with me (coming with me)?
I always come for you
Coming with me, are you coming with me
I always come for you

Got it all down, got it all right
Putting moves together cause it's Saturday night
And I'm all about you
You feel it for me
Can't wait a second now
What will it be?

And you asked me what I said?
And I tell you, I tell you now

Are you coming with me (coming with me)?
I always come for you
Coming with me, are you coming with me
I always I always come

This could be the place
My fingers through your hair
And now we're getting somewhere
Turning off the lights
Fighting for your lives
Everything's all right

Holding my breath
Biting my tongue
If you don't understand it
Well, it won't last long
I've got, nothing to try
You haven't seen yet
Move a little closer cause it's your best bet

And you asked me what I said?
And I tell you, I tell you now

Are you coming with me (coming with me)?
I always come for you
Coming with me, are you coming with me
I always I always come

Don't know how
Don't know why
You're gonna make it alright

Coming with me, are you coming with me
I always come for you
