Where I am gonna be tomorrow
And where in the world have I been
How did it get that far when does the madness stop
Where is it taking me how did it begin
How did it begin

With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes I see you standing there
With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes with the look in your eyes

What are all of these changes
Can't you see take a look around
Just another episode

As this old world turns
Deep inside this heart of mine a wildfire burns
And it burns

With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes I see you standing there
With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes with the look in your eyes

At night I look to the sky
We'll reach forever you and I
Forever you and I
I look in your eyes you're all I see
I shut the world out surrounding me

If you're gonna have sunshine
Lord knows gotta stand the rain
But sometimes I get to feelin
It ain't worth all this pain

With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes I see you standing there
With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes with the look in your eyes
