Put the coke in the pots whip it over the rocks
Ship it over the blocks it's movin' movin'
I do the damn thang I get a brick, shit
I don't let it sit quick I move the damn thang
I can show you how to mix that shit
How to whip that shit how to twist that wrist
I can show you how to get back more
And the shit that you get back is just as raw
Girl I can show you how to hit that Ave
With that big fat ass and go get that cash
But you know you got to give back half
I'm somethin' like a pimp man go get that cash
Boy I don't play when it comes to money
Guess that's why I'm okay when it comes to money
I got two coups a truck and one four door
I can pick up all my hoes and have a one four org'

Stack it up like Pringles all type of chips

Ugh, you can smell it through the wrapper
That's that shit nigga sit it in a pamper
I still got two sittin' in the hamper
I let 'em sit and air out or else you on them dampers
My lil' brother got piff on them campers
We call him the N.O. capo
New Orleans that's what we ride for
We got Cash Money on the table layin' underneath the flo'
Shit it's like I got a pan how I heat the flo'
Aye but I really got a pan when I hit the blow
Shit aye this beat is so
Motherfuckin' G.I. Joe and the hydro
Got me high I can't see where I go
When the rap stop movin' you just follow the coke
When your bitch start choosin' she gon' ride wit a pro
I'm a have that hoe swallowin' coke
Birdman Junior
