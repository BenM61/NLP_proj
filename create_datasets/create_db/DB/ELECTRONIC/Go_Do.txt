(Go

Go sing, too loud
Make your voice break
Sing it out
Go scream, do shout
Make an earthquake

You wish fire would die and turn colder
You wish, your young, could see you grow older
We should always know that dreams can do everything

Go drum, too proud
Make your hands ache
Play it out
Go march through a crowd
Make your day break

You wish silence released noise in tremors
You wish, I know it, surrender to summers
We should always know that dreams can do everything

Go do, you'll know how to
Just let yourself, fall into landslide

Go do, you'll know how to
Just let yourself, give into low tide

Go do!

Tie strings to clouds
Make your own lake
Let it flow
Throw seeds to sprout
Make your own break
Let them grow

Let them grow (Endless summers)
Let them grow (Endless summers)

(Go do endless summers)

You will survive, will never stop wonders
You and sunrise will never fall under

You will survive, will never stop wonders
You and sunrise will never fall under
We should always know that dreams can do everything

Go do!
