Uncle Sam ain't no woman but he sure can take your man
Uncle Sam ain't no woman but he sure can take your man
He's taking them in the daylight to go to Korea and fight

The people over there are messed up, they are many very rough
The people over there are messed up, they are many very rough
We have to go there and show 'em what it means to be real tough

So pray for me baby I'll be thinking of you night and day
So pray for me baby I'll be thinking of you day and night
And with the help of the Maker every day will be alright
