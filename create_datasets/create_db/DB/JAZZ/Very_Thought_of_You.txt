I don't need your photograph to keep by my bed
Your picture is always in my head
I don't need you portrait, dear, to call you to mind
For sleeping or waking, dear, I find

The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish, though it may seem
Why, to me, that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here, for you
You'll never know
How slow the moments go
'Till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

The mere idea of you
The longing here, for you
You'll never know
How slow the moments go
'Till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
