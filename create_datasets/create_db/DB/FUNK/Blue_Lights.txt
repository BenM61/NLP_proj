I wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights
Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
Those blue lights into strobe lights
Maybe even fairy lights, not blue flashing lights

Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming you'd better not run
'Cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done? You went to school that day
Was a bit late, but it wasn't Monday
Kept at the class for answering back
You apologized, then you were coming out

(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run 
(Not blue flashing lights)If you've done nothing wrong  
Blue lights should just pass you by (maybe even fairy lights)

Gun crime into your right and
Drugs and violence into your left
Before our headphones flooding 
The order into a subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the fall back home
(Where you're at G answer your phone?)
Pulls the poison to answer his message
Your voice sounds rush, fists for his adolescent

(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run 
(Not blue flashing lights) If you've done nothing wrong
Blue lights should just pass you by (maybe even fairy lights)

Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bush
Shadow shows no emotion, so what's even the fuzz?
But the face saw you boy cause a darker picture
Of the red handed actees gonna whisper

No blood, I'm sorry 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think I had to get out of there
Not long ago, you and ? into the shook ones
Now what's really is part two, 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
Has man like you gonna make me a convict?
Never never felt, when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands, but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands, but you don't know where it's from

You'd better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming 
'Cause they will be coming for you
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
The blue lights are coming for you

(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run 
(Not blue flashing lights) If you done nothing wrong
Blue lights should just pass you by hmm (maybe even fairy lights)

Run when you hear the sirens coming
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
What have you done
Don't you run
Don't you run
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
