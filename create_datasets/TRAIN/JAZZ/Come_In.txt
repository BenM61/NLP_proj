When your ship is tossed on the ocean
I will shine you safely to shore
Of all my precious treasures our 
Friendship measure as the golden one
Please don't make me miss you forever
You're a diamond shinning brighter than light
And if no one can see you believe that I do
And I need you
I'll be here when you come in
When you been away to long
I counted the days you were gone
Hoping that you would come in
Come in

Open the waiting door
Don't worry about what you find anymore
Just come on in
All the places that you try to remember 
And the faces you try to forget
They are older and wiser they'll still criticize
But you can face them now
If you think they're ready to hear you
You might tell one or two what you know
Maybe someone will see what the truth really means
Let them find you and welcome you too
Come in

Come in you've been away too long
I counted the days you were gone
Hoping that you would come in
Come in

Open the waiting door
Don't worry about what you find anymore
Just come in

When your ship is tossed on the ocean
I will shine you safely to shore
Of all my precious treasures our 
Friendship measure as the golden one
Please don't make me miss you forever
You're a diamond shinning brighter than light
And if no one can see you believe that I do
And I need you
I'll be here when you come in
I'm like a rock and I just won't move
I'm like the sun I'll shine my light on you
Come in break it down
Come on in

Every secrete is safe with me
Every secrete is safe with me
I won't tell
It'll be locked away inside of my heart
Just come on in
Oh, and when you feel that the road is too long
All you gotta do is lean on me I'll help you carry on
You know I will I will I will
Just come on in Come on Come on Come on in
Come on
