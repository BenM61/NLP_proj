Right away, love me right away
Won't you come on girl, there's no other way
If I were you, I would see it through
I'd be loving me, I'd know what to do right away

How do you feel about me now
The time has come, you must decide
Where you will run, where you will hide
How will I know if you're alright
I can feel the warmth of you next to me
Hearing your voice inside my head
Don't ever leave me, tell me you'll stay
Don't let me go on living this way

Right away, love me right away
Won't you come on girl, there's no other way
If I were you, I would see it through
I'd be loving me, I'd know what to do right away

All of this days and nights we shared
Remember the good, forget the bad
All of the things that we've been through
Don't they mean anything to you
Oh, when the night comes I feel all alone
Knowing that you won't be there
It was a good thing, what we once had
Can't live without it, I've gotta get it back

Right away, love me right away
Won't you come on girl, there's no other way
If I were you, I would see it through
I'd be loving me, I'd know what to do right away

Why don't you stop and think what you're doing to me
