[Chorus]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars,
Success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce
Hollywood divorce

(And I'm a star!)
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong,
Oh, but you right, if you just put a little ice on,
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra. 
I'm so not sober.
I'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda.
You can call me a roller. (Hold up)
Your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different.
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know.
And did you know I'm the creator of the term?
I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long. 
They just making it burn.
Make a movie of our lifestyle,
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax 
Like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga
Cooler than anti-freeze 
Defrost on your window pane 
Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Little Wayne
Don't make me nut
So that's why I got a pre-nup
(I do)

[Chorus]

(Yeah, Yeah)
A is for Adamsville
Be is Bowen Homes
See if I give a f*ck 
If you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, 
I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither
I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back 
Three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap 
She ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your un-
Divided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run 
Under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack 
Promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest 
Three fourths of it all
(For what?) 
So your kids' kids' kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? 
Get get get get get on your knees
Cause 'wealth' is the word (yep)
'Rich' is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? 
Shoot me a bird

Tenth grade 
The way was paved 
For me and Dre. to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein 
The arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin
Been jamming for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint 
Public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears 
And think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel 
All new cast
Just ain't the same 
Gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name 
Behind that screen name
They're lame 
And their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face 
Straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
(What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot?)
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)
But even she can walk 
We'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes 
Must be something bigger waiting

[Chorus]

(I do) 
Love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, 
It's game time
Do you take this here 
As your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her 
For all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share 
Take you there
And me and you together 
Baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time 
We walked a thin line
Others say they got you 
But you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence (Is that right?)
But you love the dog
Gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growing up 
Showing up 
Blowing up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me 
Like a game of football
Used to feed me 
Need me 
Dress me
Now it's so messy 
Straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce. 
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing.
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talking about music
Everything else too.
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over.
But it's cool.
We just keep it going and make new shit.

Take our game
Take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb 
That's a cold thing
