Didn't you ever want to climb
The highest mountain you could find?
Didn't you ever want to do it all?
Didn't you ever want to do it all?

Long ago I heard a voice
Telling me I had no choice
Take a chance 'cause even if you fall
At least you know you tried to do it all

Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Some things in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free

And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye
I wouldn't hold on if I could
Some changes are for good

Didn't you ever want to feel
Just the part of life that's real?
After all we're dealing with the truth here
Isn't it the truth we're going for?

And if somewhere along the line
Your dreams are lying close to mine
Maybe you and I could have it all
Maybe you and I could have it all

Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Somethings in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free

And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye
I wouldn't hold on if I could
Some changes are for good

Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Somethings in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free

And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye
I wouldn't hold on if I could
Some changes are for good
Some changes are for good
