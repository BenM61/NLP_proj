You told me it was so 
A million dreams ago 
You held me in your arms 
A million dreams ago 
So many dreams have flown 
So many nights alone 
I guess I should have known 
It couldn't be... 
I'll lock my memories here in my heart 

And here in my heart they'll stay 
And through the years 
they'll always be part, 
A part of that lovely day 
Goodbye, good luck, old friend 
I'll smile and just pretend 
There was no end 
A million dreams ago
