I will be your Jesus
I will be your shining light
I will be your everything
Just let me in tonight

I'll be your lover
I'll be your honey
I'll be your Jesus
Your guru too

I will be your Buddha
Won't you let me choose your shoes
I've got a lot of love to give you
There's so much that I can show you

I'll be your lover
I'll be your honey
I'll be your Jesus
Your guru too
I will be your guru

I will be your lighthouse
Baby, if you're lost at sea
You're going to hit the rocks
Better shout "rescue me"

I'll be your lover
I'll be your honey
I'll be your Jesus
Your guru too
I will be your guru

We want you as a new guru

I will be your new addiction
Won't you let me turn you on?
I'll be your new obsession
Rid yourself of all possessions

I will be your Jesus
I will be your shining light
I will be your everything
Just let me in tonight

We want you as a new guru

If violence is your guru 
If money is your guru
Let me be your guru
