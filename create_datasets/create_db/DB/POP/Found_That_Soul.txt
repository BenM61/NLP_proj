Show me a wonder
You can be sure of
I exist in a place
A self-made vacuum
But still stranded here
With all the scum
So clean, So lost
So beautiful

But I found that soul
Yeah I found that home
But I found that soul

But I found that soul
Yeah I found that now
But I found that soul

Not a subject
Not a subject am I
Sick and pale but
Strangely alive
Broken blood vessels
Line my cheeks
Reflections look bad
And somehow unreal

But I found that soul
Yeah I found that home
But I found that soul

But I found that soul
Yeah I found that now
But I found that soul

But I found that soul
Yeah I found that home
But I found that soul

But I found that soul
Yeah I found that now
But I found that soul

Show me a wonder
Show me a wonder
Show me a wonder
Show me a wonder
