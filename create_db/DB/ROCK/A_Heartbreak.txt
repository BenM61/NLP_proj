I met your parents, they were lying
About falling in love
I met your parents, they were dying
About falling in love

Girl, you're just a, a child
A heartbreak
Girl, you're just a, a child
A heartbreak

I saw your friends at the drive-in
They were falling in love
I met your friends, they were lying
About falling in love

Girl, you're just a child
A heartbreak
Girl, you're just a child
A heartbreak

Girl, you're just a, a child
Falling in love
Girl, you're just a, a child
A heartbreak
