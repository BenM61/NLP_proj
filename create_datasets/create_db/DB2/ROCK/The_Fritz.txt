The computer is on the fritz
I got a million hits, yeah
Somebody aimed for the door
Somebody called for the whore

Until the mainframe breaks again
And the good guys get the better
And take the pill if and only when
Well, the missions coming to its end

Don't anybody sneeze
Their guns filled with bees
We better make up and foot static
Cause it will get us to where we need to go

Until the mainframe breaks again
And the good guys get the better
And take the pill if and only when
Well, the missions coming to its end

Look out now
