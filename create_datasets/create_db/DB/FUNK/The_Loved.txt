Everyone thinks it's fine
Making cash, coasting time
Everyone thinks it's fair
To be almost free - to be almost there
But not really aware

Anyone can cry
So wipe away those phoney tears in your eyes
Don't come 'round here
Expecting votes
See who charts the course on a sinking boat

And whatever you give
Listen - you give to give
But humanities so weak - if it can it would give
The loved of the loved

There's a man down there
And it should be clear
I thought we knew
And believed in it too

Anyone can see why
So wipe away the phoney tears you cry
An' don't come 'round here
Expecting votes
See who charts the course on a sinking boat

And whatever you give
Listen - you give to give
But humanities so weak - if it can it would give
The loved of the loved
