Mom, please tell me what to do,
I'm so disappointed in you
You said those words that made me cry,
And you always wondered why
Why I sing my lullaby

Mom, please hurry home to me,
I waited up so patiently
You sit down and you start to cry,
But you never ask me why
Why I sing my lullaby
Why I sing my lullaby

Was it my fault they lead you in the wrong direction?
Was it my fault they didn't show you any affection?
I show you when I start to cry
Still you always wonder why
Why I sing my lullaby

Mom, why love me if you're cold
You'll just get bitter then grow old
Ask me when I start to weep
Then I'll tell you in my sleep
Why I sing my lullaby
Why I sing my lullaby
Why I sing my lullaby
Why I sing my lullaby
Why I sing my lullaby
Why I sing my lullaby
