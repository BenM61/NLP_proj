I get the feeling, that I've been here before
Saying all these things to you
I get the feeling, that I fell through that door
Comin' down with deja-vu
There's no emotion, nothing at all
You don't even know my name
I get the notion that you don't recall
So here we go, and here we go
Here we go again

It's no good saying, that you've never been in love before
No good explaining, that you've never been in love before
No good denying, I've seen them comin' back for more
I know you're lying, baby
'cause your name is written on that door

Oh, baby
I get the feeling, that you've been here before
Saying all these things to me
I get the feeling, that I'm just a chore
You don't give your love for free
There's no excuses, nothing to say
You just play those little games
I get the feeling it would turn out this way
So here we go, here we go
Here we go again

Your love has given me, what I never never had before
But the way you're living, I just never never know the score
Oh, I'm though with trying, and I say I can take no more
You know I'm lying baby, when you hear me knocking at that door

Oh girl
I get the feeling, by the look on your face
Could be the right time, but it sure is the wrong place
I get the feeling that nothing I say
Is gonna change a single thing, gonna make you come away

Oh, I get the feeling
Oh, I get the feeling
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go
I get the feeling
Yeah get the feeling
No no no, tell me now now
Never been in love before
Don't try tell me
Don't try tell me about it
Never been in love before
I don't believe it darling, no
