When we wore a heart of stone we wandered to the sea
Hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free
And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night and the smells that filled the air
And we laid us down on sandy ground it was cold but we didn't care

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night
Memories stirred inside of us, the struggle and the fight
And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices telling us which way to go
And we cried out is there no escape from the words that plague me so

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

In the still and the silent dawn another day is born
Washed up by the tireless waves the body bent and torn
When you wake in the face of the blinding sun, and you search only to find
That heaven is a stranger place than what you've left behind

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm

Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
