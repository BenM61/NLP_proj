1, 2, 3, 4

I'd like to sing to you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sing to you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sing, sing, sing, sing, sing to you
Alone

And I'd like to dance with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to dance with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance with you
Alone

I'd like to sleep with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sleep with you if you'd like me to
I'd like to sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep with you
Alone

Ribbons around the fumes
We'll be sleeping soon
Ribbons around the fumes
We'll be sleeping soon
Ribbons around those fumes
Alone
