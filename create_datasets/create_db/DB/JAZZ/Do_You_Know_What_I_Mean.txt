Been fourteen days since I don't know when
I just saw him with my best friend
Do you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean

I just saw him yesterday
I just saw him, asked him to stay
Do you know what I mean
Lord, do you know what I mean

Him and Bobby were steppin' out
Him and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean
Lord, do you know what I mean

So I asked him if he still cared
He didn't hear, he just stared
Do you know what I mean
Lord, do you know what I mean

Then he said
You haven't loved me for nearly four years
Haven't you noticed I held back my tears
Now you're here, its really too late
Gotta find another man, another ma-an
Gotta find another place

Oh, oh, do you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean

He just left me yesterday
He done left me, had nothing to say
Do you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean

Now, he's a dandy, yes indeed
He's a dandy, now he's free
Do you know what I mean
Lord, do you know what I mean, yeah

Hey, hey-hey-hey
Lord, do you know what I mean
Do you know-ow-ow, do you know what I mean
Hey, hey-hey-hey-ey
Do-ya, do-ya, do-ya, do you know what I mean
Lord, do you know what I mean
Oh... oh-oh-oh-oh-hey-hey
Ow! do you know what I mean
