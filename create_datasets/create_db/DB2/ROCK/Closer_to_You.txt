Have you seen the ladies passing by?
They don't seem to notice that I'm lonesome and I cry
But soon they'll listen I can tell you, tell you why
I'm gonna make this ..., gonna go sky high

I just want to be closer to you
I just want to see if you can be moved
I don't want to be a fool for you, no
I'm goin' to the city, all the hustlers in the street

And can't you imagine just where my head might be
Bright lights are shinning, I can see in front of me at night
Clockwork deception, won't save us set us free
I just want to be closer to you, baby

Oh, I don't want to be a fool for you, whoa
I just want to see if you can be moved

I just want to be closer to you
I'm not supposed to be alone
You know I'm not supposed to be alone
Oh no, oh no

We're coming to this country, gonna play for all our friends
Yeah, we got positive action, got energy to last
So go down 'cause we're cookin', let the rhythm get you high
And bring all the ladies, tell them why, why, why

I just want to be closer to you, baby
Oh, I don't want to be a fool for you, whoa
I just want to see if you can be moved
Closer to you
