You're my thing
Give you something to hide
Working it's way to the side
Taking me, taking me, taking me
Taking it down on you

You're my thing
Watch me fall over you
Through the eyes in the bottom of shoes
Making me feel so small, making me
Making me feel so small

I have had it with you
And i've got bigger things to do
Than to keep on crossing your line
Just so fine, can't get you off my mind

You're my thing, (you're my thing)
You're my thing (you're my thing)

You're my thing
Starts with the way that she walked
She never listens to me when i talk
Tapping me on the shoulder
Trying to create a monster
Just so i can hold it

I have had it with you
And i've got bigger things to do
Than to keep on crossing your line
Just so fine, can't get you off my mind

You're my thing (you're my thing)
You're my thing (you're my thing)

You're my thing
Watch me fall over you
Through the eyes in the bottom of shoes
Making me feel so small, making me
Making me feel so small

And i have had it with you
And i've got bigger things to do
Than to keep on crossing your line
Just so fine, can't get you off my mind

You're my thing (you're my thing)
You're my thing (you're my thing)
You're my thing (you're my thing)
You're my thing (you're my thing)

You're my thing
