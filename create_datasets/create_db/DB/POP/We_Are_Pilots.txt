Holding close my secrets
Naked broken pieces
From the madness in what you do
The fingers point right back at you

What about my problems?
The people try to solve them
I guess I'm under the weather
Since no one else belongs here with me

Hello mother, some news for you
I'm really not that crazy
Hello father, I'm curious
Why you think there's something wrong with me

Sunday I cried all night
And it hurt so bad
But if you try to understand
This is who I am

Color coated sweetness
Swords beneath my clean dress
I'm making sense of shattered dreams
'Cause I want you to be proud of me

What about my problems?
The people try to solve them
I guess I'm under the weather
Since no one else belongs here with me
