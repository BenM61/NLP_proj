Feelings, nothing more than feelings, 
Trying to forget my feelings of love. 
Teardrops rolling down on my face, 
Trying to forget my feelings of love. 

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it. 
I wish I've never met you, girl; you'll never come again. 

Feelings, wo-o-o feelings, 
Wo-o-o, feel you again in my arms. 

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you 
And feelings like I've never have you again in my heart. 

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it. 
I wish I've never met you, girl; you'll never come again. 

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you 
And feelings like I've never have you again in my life. 

Feelings, wo-o-o feelings, 
Wo-o-o, feelings again in my arms.
