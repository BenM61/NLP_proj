They came down to the room
And I could see it written all over you
Since you already know
That I said, sorry, but I gotta go

And I'll rip these walls apart
And I went and shot an arrow right through your heart
But how those times have changed
'Cause now you don't remember my name

I'm sorry that I'm here so late
And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change, 
'Cause without you, I'm so hollow
I'm sorry that I let you go
It's only when it's lost you know
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
No, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I guess I played my cards too late
'Cause now my body can't take the weight
And once we flew so high, oh
But now I'm afraid to fly, oh oh oh

I'm sorry that I'm here so late
And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change, 
'Cause without you, I'm so hollow
I'm sorry that I let you go
It's only when it's lost you know
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
No, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm sorry that I'm here so late
And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change 
'Cause without you, I'm so hollow
I'm sorry that I let you go
It's only when it's lost you know
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh
