This is a vendetta

Long road
We've treaded on since day one
Hard times
We swore we would overcome
Without this where the hell would we be... dead inside
Enemies
You can't kill what will not die

This is war
This is pure hostility
This is vengeance
This is all that's driving me

This is a vendetta

Dead world
We're "out of step" with liars' times
Enemies
We swore we would fight the line
This is all that drives us to survive
The life we breathe
Power
Strength of the world inside of me

This is war
This is pure hostility
This is vengeance
This is all that's driving me

This is our vendetta against the world
