You never touch anything till it touches you
And oh when you touch me
I feel beautiful for you

So hold me tight tell me you'll never leave my side
Stay loving me boy - loving you boy all the time

Hey!

I promise you I'd take you away - get ready! get ready!
I'd promise you I'd take you away - get ready! get ready!

Your lips, your breath, you give me the softest caress
And oh when you kiss me
I'd do anything for you (for you)

So hold me tight, tell me you'll never leave my side
Stay loving me boy - loving you boy all the time

Now I, I've seen you laughing
Now I, I've seen you laughing

Hey!

Your eyes, it's something in your eyes
