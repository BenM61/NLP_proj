She locked herself in the bathroom again
So I am pissing in the yard
I have to laugh when I think how far it's gone
But things aren't funny any more

I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did

So I am knocking on the door again
I say, "Do you want to be alone?"
She says, "No I don't wanna be alone,
But I think that you do."

I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did

And I know she's right
I know how it would be
If I had my own way with the world
As I know it should be

She locked herself in the bathroom again
So I've been shutting down the lights
And I don't know if I'll ever go back again
I'm drivin' straight into the night

I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did
