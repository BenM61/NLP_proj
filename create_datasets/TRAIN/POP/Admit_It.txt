(mmmmm)
(oooooh)

Hangin' in the hood
Givin me the eye
I get the message
Why you gotta act shy?
Lookin at your light ahead
I can read your mind
You really want it bad
I can tell by the look on your face
That your really really really really in to me

Is it me or is it hot in here
(burning up, adrenaline rush, can't get enough)
Is it really really or am I just imagining
(do I want it too much, am I making it up?)
I try to ignore you babe, but I keep coming back for more

Just admit it 
I know you want it
Why you over there?
When you could be right here
Come and get it
You know I got it
Can't you read the signs?
Why you wasting time?

When you could be mine
(just admit it admit it)
(just admit it admit it)

Trying to impress
Got me actin like a fool
Don't want you to see me
But I really do
Cause I'm the type of girl whose used to playin it cool
If you wanna win me over its up to you

(yeah baby)
C'mon and make your move

Is it me or is it hot in here
(burning up, adrenaline rush, can't get enough)
Is it really really or am I just imagining
(do I want it too much, am I making it up?)
I try to ignore you babe, but I keep coming back for more

Just admit it 
I know you want it
Why you over there?
When you could be right here
Come and get it
You know I got it
Can't you read the signs?
Why you wasting time?

When you could be mine
(just admit it admit it)
(just admit it admit it)

When you could be mine
(just admit it admit it)
(just admit it admit it)

You could be mine
(ooooh)
