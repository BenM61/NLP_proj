Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions?
I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek and he from the Natti (Natti)
We make the sky crack, feel the fly track
Get your hands up like a hijack
Fist in the air for (Kweli), keep 'em there like
Natural mystic or smoke when they spliffs lit
It's a revolutionary (party), they ask me what I'm writin for
I'm writin to show you what we fightin for
Say Taleeb or Talib (Kweli), if it's hard try spellin it phonetically
If not then just let it be like Nina Simone
You probably (ably) don't listen B
Even when we suffer losses I count the victories
Sometimes it's far and between I'm sad to say
It got my brain crowded like sunset on a Saturday
I know my son wept cause his dad's away
Stop cryin be strong for your momma is what I had to say

To my little man named Amani (mani)
Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
Who make you rock your body (body)
Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli

I remember when it all started
Back in the day when me and moms first parted
Hi-Tek from the beginnin I stayed advanced
A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game nigga never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused, while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high I stay lower
Stacking my chips to get a foreclosure
This shit ain't over
Going for the gusto, keep getting that provo
It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flo Jo
Bet you ain't even know I had flow though

Yo, make you rock your body (body)
Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli

Keep on dancing, ya gotta keep on dancing
