You hurt me time and time again
I lived in sadness
You walked away and didn't care
Just look inside me
You knew that I'd be there
Always around you
And now the sides have turned
To understand me

You used to be all out of love
Now I can't stand you
You called me twice to say you're wrong
What do you want from me?
Just try to make it on your own
You're fine without me
Cause now the sides have turned
To understand me

I lost the spirit in my life, and now you know just how it feels
I lost the spirit in my life, the day that you walked out on me

I lost the spirit in my life, and now you know just how if feels
I lost the spirit in my life, but I'll come back again
