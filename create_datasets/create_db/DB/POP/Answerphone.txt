I tried all night, I tried calling you up
But it just ring, ring, rings and you never pick up
So what's up, what's up, what's up
I thought that we were ok

I left a message but I messed it right up
I tried to do it again but it just ain't long enough
So pick up, pick up, pick up
And hear what I gotta say

After the beep, beep, beep
I'll say

My heart beats louder when you're coming close
And you've got this power that won't let me go
It's the best thing
Tell me it's the best thing
Say you feel the same thing
Say you feel the same thing

And I count each hour until we're alone
And I keep on checking, keep checking my phone
I'll be waiting
Waiting for your call
You're just too amazing
Waiting for your call

I keep on trying but I'm all out of luck
But I still ring, ring, ring 'cause I'm not giving up
I'll wait up, wait up, I'll wait up
'Cause it's all I can do

I'll say

My heart beats louder when you're coming close
And you've got this power that won't let me go
It's the best thing
Tell me it's the best thing
Say you feel the same thing
Say you feel the same thing

And I count each hour until we're alone
And I keep on checking, keep checking my phone
I'll be waiting
Waiting for your call
You're just so amazing
Waiting for your call

I never thought, I never thought to check my phone
I never thought, I never thought to try and see
But when I was trying to call you
You were trying to call me

She said

My heart beats louder when you're coming close
And I've got this power that won't let her go
It's the best thing
Tell me it's the best thing
Do you feel the same thing
Say you feel the same thing

And she counts each hour until we're alone
And she keeps on checking, checking her phone
She'll be waiting
Waiting for my phone call
'Cause she's so amazing
Waiting for my phone call
