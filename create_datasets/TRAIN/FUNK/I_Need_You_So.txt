I need you so
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on

I need your arms
Around me tightly
I need them nightly
When you're not at home

When the day is done
I need you so
I long 
To hear you knock
On the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you, need you so

When the day is done
I need you so
I long
To hear you knock
On the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so
I need you so
I need you
I need you so
