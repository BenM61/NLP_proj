When you're half way from a dream
Is it hard to work out what is real?
Is the real over there more vivid than here ever feels?
We could love
We could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love, elevation
Outside fresh avaricide
But inside our love you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love, celebration
Cop car burn
Reason turn
But it'll bring you up
You'll be alright

Is the Blackpool bright light
Brighter than the light in your home?
Were you born to be loved but nobody else seems to know?

We could love
We could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love, elevation
Outside fresh avaricide
But inside our love you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love, celebration
Cop car burn
Reason turn
But it'll bring you up
You'll be alright

We could love
We could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love, elevation
Outside fresh avaricide
But inside our love you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet sweet love, celebration
Cop car burn
Reason turn
But it'll bring you up
You'll be alright

Sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet love
