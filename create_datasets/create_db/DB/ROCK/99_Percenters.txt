[Chorus]
99 Percenters!
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 99 percenters!
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 99 percenters!
Hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey hey

Let's put em all away
Let's put em in handcuffs
Throw away the keys
Cause enough is enough

[Chorus]

Hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey hey

Let's occupy Wall Street
Let's occupy Oakland
Let's occupy Chicago
Let's occupy London

How much do people need?
They have to lie and cheat?
But the 99 percenters will not be beat

[Chorus]
