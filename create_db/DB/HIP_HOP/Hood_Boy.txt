Yeah
Ya gotta understand what I'm talkin' about
I'm talkin' about on this one
Sexy
Sexy as hell to me
Yeah

So let me tell ya 'bout a nigga I know
Six foot four
Two twenty-five
He's all the way live
See, where I come from
We like 'em like that
He don't talk smack
He just twist caps off
See, that's the only kinda dude I'm demandin'
And let the girl like me understand it
And the ones that ain't
They still gotta have it
They don't know why
But they stay chained to

[Chorus]
I need a hood boy
Wife beaters and jeans
Always in the trap
And he looks so mean
I need a hood boy
Go' on head, pretty nigga
We don't like them there
Need somethin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy
Hot boys, rock boys
Street boys, B-boys
Man, I love them boys
Go on say

He knows how to treat a lady
But he won't let you get too rowdy
He stands up for himself
That's what I like most about him
He's all I see and all I need
And all that I want
And all that I'm used to
I swear that my man's the truth
I said I swear that my man's the truth

[Chorus x 2]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Big boi]
B A double d
Why say bye
Been fly
Ever since a nigga started sayin' bye
That's right, stand by
'Cause we about to take flight
Not a seven forty-seven
But the music and the microphone
Phone home
If you want someone waitin', baby
Go on home
Don't wanna jeopardize your safety
Maybe later
We shake the haters and gets busy
You say you wanna do same thing
Then get wit' me
If not, then hit me
I know you know the history
Last nigga ridin' 'round lookin' real crispy
Ridin' round town, top down
On the grizzy
Grind all the time to stay hot
Or even sizzlin'
I thought I told ya niggas
We run stop signs
'Cause we don't stop
Till the cops come knockin'
For two block signs
Not mine
Toine gone right
Like sunshine and cold north through summertime
Now, bow down

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, shorty wanna rock with you
Shorty wanna rock with you
Wanna bop with you
I wanna ride with you
