It's only four degrees, it's only four degrees
It's only four degrees, it's only four degrees

I wanna see this world, I wanna see it boil
I wanna see this world, I wanna see it boil
It's only four degrees, it's only four degrees
It's only four degrees, it's only four degrees

I wanna hear the dogs crying for water
I wanna see fish go belly-up in the sea
All those lemurs and all those tiny creatures
I wanna see them burn, it's only four degrees

And all those rhinos and all those big mammals
I wanna see them lying, crying in the fields

(I want to see them burn)

It's only four degrees, it's only four degrees
It's only four degrees, it's only four degrees

I wanna burn them, I wanna burn them
I wanna burn them, I wanna burn them

I wanna burn the sky, I wanna burn the breeze
I wanna see the animals die in the trees
Oh let's go, let's go it's only four degrees
Oh let's go, let's go it's only four degrees
Oh let's go, let's go it's only four degrees
Oh let's go, let's go it's only four degrees

I wanna burn them, I wanna burn them
I wanna burn them, I wanna burn them
