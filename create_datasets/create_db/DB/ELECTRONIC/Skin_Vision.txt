I'll kill myself today
If you choose devotion over low life
I'll kill myself today
If you put direction into a world with no daylight

Violent role play
Codeine champagne
The brainwash came free
Love you, leave me

Skin vision, oh, and your leatherette eyes
You make me come
There's glitter in the gutter
And silence what we come from

Skin vision, oh, and your leatherette eyes
You make me come
We glitter in the gutter
And silence what we come from

I'll kill myself today
If you pull the punches and the sex drive
I'll kill myself and name
Make the cut to castrate and send me to the front line

Berlin, Tokyo
Blood lust, tight rope
Ghost of parties
Need you, hate me

Skin vision, oh, and your leatherette eyes
You make me come
There's glitter in the gutter
And silence what we come from

Skin vision, oh, and your leatherette eyes
You make me come
There's glitter in the gutter
And silence what we come from

I know who you are
I know who you are
We can keep a secret
I know where you come from

I know who you are
I know who you are
We can keep a secret
I know where you come from
