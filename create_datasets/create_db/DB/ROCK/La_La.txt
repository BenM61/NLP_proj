La la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la, come on, come on, come on, come on

Make yourself free, make yourself grow
Come on up into the attic, come and see the glow up
Pretty Adiel kissing everyone she doesn't know
And the pigs are eating popcorn, selling tickets to the show

Give yourself away, feel the wind blow
Watching movies on the ceiling, all the R.E.S we know
If there's someone you don't like you don't have to say hello
There's no reason you should leave, there's no reason you should go

La la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la, come on, come on, come on, come on

Take yourself out here to Tambourine
We have bloated up your eyes and fetching tenderines
If you open up your box you'll find a time machine
If you'll try to find a scratch, there'll be no signs where you have been

Give yourself up, make yourself seen
Don't tell us that you can't believe is sampling

La la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la, come on, come on, come on, come on

La la la la, la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la, come on, come on, come on, come on

La la la la, la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la, come on, come on, come on, come on
