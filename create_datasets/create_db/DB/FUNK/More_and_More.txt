The temperature between us two is steady climbing
The rhythm of our hearts suggest there's perfect timing
My intuition says tonight's the night
Everything's gonna be alright for sure
I'll be loving you more and more

The heart is beating through my chest
Can you feel it pounding
You whisper in my ear, I like the way its sounding
Girl you know what happens next
I think its gonna be the best for sure

I'll be loving you more and more...more

I don't want this night to ever end
I don't know where I end and you begin
I wish I could make time suspend, cause were doing fine

I've got your tiny hand in mine and it feels like heaven
Can't count how many times for 5 or 6 or 7
Girl you know what happens next
I think its gonna be the best for sure

Ill be loving you more and more.
For sure, ill be loving you more and more, more
