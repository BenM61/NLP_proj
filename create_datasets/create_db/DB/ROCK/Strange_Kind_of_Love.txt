She's like a mermaid
Locked in the dungeon of a sunken ship
She thinks she's happy
Though she's been drawn in by shallow things

She closes her eyes
And he keeps all the treasure he finds
In the back of my mind
I hear the devil sing

It's a strange kind of love
A strange kind of love
It's a strange kind of love
That keeps me hanging on

She sees the future
Built on promises and dreams
Some people
Could see you anything

Angel, 
Don't let him clip your wings
He may give you what he has
But I'd give you anything

It's a strange kind of love
A strange kind of love
It's a strange kind of love
That leaves me so alone

In every second car that passes there's a man like him
At ease in the world of television and magazines
Trampled and broken;
What once was a timeless thing
In the heart of the night
I feel the Winter sting

It's a strange kind of love
A strange kind of love
It's a strange kind of love
That keeps me hoping still

She's written my story 
For the whole world to see
In the lines beneath my eyes
She bathes me with pity

I could never be your friend
If I could never by you King
I'm wide open
Can you hear the devil sing?

It's a strange kind of love
A strange kind of love
It's a strange kind of love
That keeps me hanging on

I hear the devil sing
