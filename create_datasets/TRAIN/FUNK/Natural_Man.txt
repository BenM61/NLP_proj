You know, there was a time when
If someone told you to do somethin'
You did it. Bam! Right on! 
No questions asked
It was "Yes, sir" and "Yes, mam"
You never said no. You know? Huh?
But, you know
Things are changing nowadays
It's a new day babies
Folks want to take their own lives into their hands 
And make their own choices
No longer do they want to go along with the program 
'Cause everybody say it's right
You know what I mean?
Let me tell ya what I'm talkin' about, ya see, 'cause...

I don't want no gold watch for workin' fifty years from nine till five
Awhile the boss is guzzling champagne 
And I'm beltin' beer in some dive

'Cause I want to be happy and free
Livin' and loving for me
I want to be happy and free
Livin' and lovin' for me
Like a natural man (Like a natural man)
A natural man (Like a natural man)

Well now, I refuse to listen to people's thinkin' that I live too high
I'm gonna taste it now before my one life streaks on by

'Cause I want to be happy and free
Livin' and lovin' for me
I want to be happy and free
Livin' and lovin' for me
