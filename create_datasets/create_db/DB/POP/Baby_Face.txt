Baby face you've got the cutest little baby face
There's not another who can take your place
Baby face my heart poor heart is thumpin' you sure have started somethin'
Baby face I'm up in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace
Uh well I need a shove because I'm in love with my pretty baby face

Yeah now baby face you got the cutes...

Baby face I'm up in heaven...

(Repeat)
