I want to stay south of the river
With the chains and the gold
We could be out here together
But, you have places to go

Watching the sunshine blaze the gray
I don't know why you wouldn't stay
You should come south of the river
Where the loving is gold

You should come south of the river
This is where it all starts
I think that we could stay here forever
Lie on the roof 'til it's dark

And when the last bus pulls away
I swear that I almost heard you say
"I should move south of the river"
I want to get to know
I want to get to know, oh

I want to stay south of the river
