I've been livin' in this lonely world
Wishin' I could find someone to love
Hopin' someone would come from above
Change my life

Yeah

Then I noticed you there
You were my angel sent from my despair
I know that you are the lady who cares
Whoa yeah yeah

I want to spend my life with you
Yeah yeah
I want to spend my life with you yeah yeah, with you

I think of all of those sleepless nights 
Its like the earth was standing still
You know I hardly had the will
To survive

Yeah

Then I noticed you there
You were my angel sent from my despair
I know that you are the lady who cares
Whoa yeah yeah

I want to spend my life with you
Yeah yeah
I want to spend my life with you, baby
My lady
You're true

Whoa yeah yeah

I want to spend my life with you
Yeah yeah yeah
I wanna spend my life with you yeah yeah
Only with you baby
I want to spend my life with you
You know you're my little angel
I want to spend my life with you

Oh don't you know
I want to spend
All of my life with you babe
'Cause you gave me all your lovin' 
And baby I know its true
Yeah
'Cause you're the only one for me
Baby I'm the one for you
