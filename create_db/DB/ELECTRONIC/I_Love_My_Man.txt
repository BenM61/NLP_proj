I love my man
When he is good or mean
I love my man
That's easily seen

Some folks will never know
They will never understand
What it means to a woman
To love her man
I love my man

There ain't nothing gonna change this
I love my man
With each new kiss
More and more

I'll be there when he wants me
I'll be there when he needs me
I'll find him
I'll always stand
Cause I love my man
I love my man
