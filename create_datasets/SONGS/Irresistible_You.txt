Your magic hands
Your loving eyes
Your kissable lips
Make my heart realize

I'm in love, I'm in love
And I know, it's true
'Cause who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you

Well, I don't know
What you've got
But it's got me
And, baby, I'm hooked

Like a fish in the sea
You make angels call from above
You could make the
Devil fall in love
And who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you

Oh, come on
Let's dance awhile
I wanna talk
I wanna talk to you, child

You've been blessed
And you're much, too much
Well, there's a wonder of a love
In your touch

Now, don't you fret
Ah, doncha worry about me
'Cause I'll never forget
How much you mean to me

I love you, I love you
My whole life through
Tell me, who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you

Let's twist awhile

Ah, don't you ever fret
Ah, don't you worry about me
I'll never forget
How much you mean to me

I love you, I love you
My whole life through
But tell me, who wouldn't fall
For irresistible you
