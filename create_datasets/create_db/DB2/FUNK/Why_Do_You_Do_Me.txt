Why did it happen this way?
Someone has taken my place
No one to share my embrace
Oh, why do you do me like you do?

I give my heart to you
Like no one else could do
I'm just-a lonely and blue
Oh, oh, why do you do me like you do?

Way down inside me
There is no one else but you, oh
Deep down inside me
There is no one else but you

I give my heart to you
And no one else could do

I'm just-a lonely and blue
Oh, why do you do me like you do

Way down inside me
There is no one else but you
Deep down inside me
There is no one else but you

I give my heart to you
But no one, no one else could do
I'm just-a lonely and blue, oh yeah
Why do you do me like you do?

Yeah, yeah
