Trouble sleeping
Trouble
Dreaming of you
Trouble speaking
Trouble
Thinking of you

Something strange has happened,
I just can't get myself
Together
No kind of way
For you

Must have put a spell on my mind
You must have put a spell on my mind,
And turned me around

Trouble seeing
Trouble
Visions of you
Trouble thinking
Trouble
Control my will to

Take a bow if you want to,
I still can't get myself
Together
No kind of way
For you

Must have put a spell on my mind
Oh, spell
Must have put a spell on my mind
You made a new man of me
Now I feel heavenly
For you

Must have a put a spell on my mind
Must have put a spell on my mind
I'm under your power baby
Oh, spell
Must have put a spell on my mind
I'm under your power baby
Oh, spell
Must have put a spell on my mind

You see, I gave you everything I had,
But you just pushed me away,
I tried so hard to break loose,
But you gained control everyday
Spell on my mind
I watched you take my whole world from me,
and there was nothing I could do
A secret word, a hidden touch
And I belonged to you
Spell

Must have put a spell on my mind
I'm under your power baby
Must have put a spell on my mind
Oh, spell
Must have put a spell on my mind
I'm under your power baby
Oh, spell
Must have put a spell on my mind
I'm under your power baby
