When I'm upside down, you turn me right side up
By the simple words you say
When I'm south of you, well your north of me
And I know your here to stay
Well your fingers walk and your body talks to me
Sweetly night and day
My life was meaningless, until we kissed
May you never go away

Angel, I figured it out you've got to be an
Angel, you must have come down to earth to tell me

There will be no tears in heaven
Love's a gift that we've been given
Baby when I see you shine
I thank the lord that you are mine
Heavens here on earth together
May it always last forever
Angel sometimes I
Swear that you have wings and you can fly

When I'm on my own, well your in my head
And in everything I do
Well your protecting me, watching over me
I can always count on you

Angel, I figured it out you've got to be an
Angel, you must have come down to earth to tell me

Fly, fly over me
Fly, fly under me
Fly, fly close to me
Fly, fly, fly to me

Angel, I figured it out you've got to be an
Angel, you must have come down to earth to tell me

...angel sometimes I swear that you have wings and you can fly
