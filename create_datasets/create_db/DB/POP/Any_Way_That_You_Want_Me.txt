If it's love that you want
Baby you've got it
From the depth of my soul
Baby you've got it

But I've been watching you
And I don't think that you're game
Girl there's no need to explain

Anyway that you want me
Anyway that you'll take me
Anyway that you'll make me be part of you
Anyway that I know

There are dreams in your heart
Where love lasts forever
From the depth of my soul
I'll make them come true

But I've been watching you
And I don't think that your're game
Girl there's no need to explain

Anyway that you want me
Anyway that you'll take me
Anyway that you'll make me be part of you
Anyway that I know

Anyway that you want me
Anyway that you'll take me
Anyway that you'll make me be part of you
Anyway that I know

Anyway that you want me
Anyway that you'll take me
Anyway that you'll make me be part of you
Anyway that I know..
