Oh yea
Oh yea
Oh yea
Listen

If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long
If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all night long

It's amazing baby how we let it go
On and on for this long
You blaming me, I'm blaming you
I can't say your right
But I sure ain't wrong
Girl lately I, I been thinkin'
And my thoughts are telling me, I'm trippin'
You used to say I didn't care
Now your bags are packed upstairs
With all that talking tough
I'm 'bout to lose you

If this is my last chance to love you
I'm going to play it like a grown man or two
If I only got one shot to win you
Then call me Jordan, 4th quarter in '92
(I'm gonna do it) No matter what your girlfriends say
(I'm gonna do it) Don't leave me baby talkin' about that kind of change
(I'm gonna do it) From a boy to a man, Like Barack and his plan
(I'm gonna do it) If this is my last chance, yea

The things I said, I can't believe it
But I swear to God, I didn't mean it
But it takes a lot from me, to admit I'm wrong
But I'll do whatever to save my home, cause
I keep going back, back, and forth
In and out, out the door
Don't want to fuss and fight no more
Don't give a damn about the score, cause I, I'm a different kind of man
I'm the kind that understands, what I got inside my hands
So

If this is my last chance to love you
I'm going to play it like a grown man or two
If I only got one shot to win you
Then call me Jordan, 4th quarter in '92
(I'm gonna do it) No matter what your girlfriends say
(I'm gonna do it) Don't leave me baby talkin' about that kind of change
(I'm gonna do it) From a boy to a man, Like Barack and his plan
(I'm gonna do it) If this is my last chance, yea

Sometimes I try to front like it don't matter
If you leave or stay, like I could find better
But the truth be told, I know your the one
Girl it's plain to see that, I ain't nothing without cha
And it seems like every song on the radio is about cha
Girl, so stay on home
Where you belong
So I can try to make some right out this wrong
Listen baby

This your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long
This your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all night long
This your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long
This your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all night long

If this is my last chance to love you
I'm going to play it like a grown man or two
If I only got one shot to win you
Then call me Jordan, 4th quarter in '92
(I'm gonna do it) No matter what your girlfriends say
(I'm gonna do it) Don't leave me baby talkin' about that kind of change
(I'm gonna do it) From a boy to a man, Like Barack and his plan
(I'm gonna do it) If this is my last chance, yea

Yea yea
