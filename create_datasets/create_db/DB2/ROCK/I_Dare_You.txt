I'm in love with it
Intoxicated
I'm enraptured
From the inside I can feel that you want to
Wake up high on it
Feel it suspending
I'm enamored
Way up in the sky I can see that you want to

I've been a romantic for so long
All I've ever had are love songs

Singing oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you

I get chills
Heartbreak multiplies
I'm on a different kind of high
A rush of blood is not enough
I need my feelings set on fire
Now I'm deep in it, infatuated
Strong attraction
Side by side, and I know that you want to

I've been a romantic for so long
All I've ever had are love songs

Singing oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you

I can hear it now like I heard it then

Singing oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you
