Everybody says "Be strong" but I just can't take it 
Every time I look at you, I feel funny inside, yeah 
I've been meaning to ask you this for such a long long time 

Can I get to know you better? 
Got to get to know you better 
Can I get to know you better tonight? 
I know that you think of me as just a friend 
But you don't know how friendly I can be, yeah 
I want so much to prove my love; baby, give me half a chance 

Can I get to know you better? 
Got to get to know you better 
Can I get to know you better tonight? 
I know that you think of me as just a friend 
But you don't know how friendly I can be, yeah 
I want so much to prove my love; baby, give me half a chance 

Now I don't think I can go another day without you (Without tou) 
One little kiss will tell me what I wanna know 'bout you 
It ain't gonna hurt you; come on baby 

Can I get to know you better? 
Got to get to know you better 
Can I get to know you better tonight? 
I know that you think of me as just a friend 
But you don't know how friendly I can be, yeah 
I want so much to prove my love; baby, give me half a chance
