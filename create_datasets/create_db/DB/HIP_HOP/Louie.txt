This it right here homie!
7 8 7 haha!
They told me to get my swag up!
Blood raw is that you?
I dun see no other way
Ah OK Bro
Na what I'm talkin' bout

[Chorus: x2]
One thing bout me, yeah I got swag
The way I count it up and throw it in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag

[Blood Raw]
One thing bout raw, raw got swag
Raw hit the mall and I don't pop tags
Raw stay clean, raw stay fresh
You know those must be 87's in them jeans (i guess)
I Bought 'em in Miami ship 'em hoes up to Duval
Must of had 20 chicken-heads up in that u-haul
I move so smooth, cause them jack boys back track
Half a quarter mill in the brown Louie nap-sack

[Chorus: x2]

[Young Jeezy]
Now these sant pata, cost me a lot of
Pasta spaghetti's you can send 'em we ready!
Same color as huaraches, countin' the karate
Make the doors spin around and round house somebody
Shoes by Louie, sippin' on Louie
Look I cant even lie all my bitches know I'm Louie
One thing about young, young swag with it
The only nigga in the drought with a 19 ticket, lets get it

[Chorus: x2]

[Young Jeezy and (Blood Raw)]
One thing about young, young got swag
(One thing about raw, raw got swag)
The one thing about me, yea I got swag
(The one thing about me, yea I got swag)
Now lemme see it
(Swag swag swag swag)
Now lemme see it
(swag swag swag swag)
Now lemme see it
(Swag swag swag swag)
Now lemme see it
(Swag swag swag swag)

Haha!
