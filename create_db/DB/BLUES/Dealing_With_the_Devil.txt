I used to live with the whiskey
And the good time and the ladies of the night
Then the whiskey took control
Left me waltzing with the witches in my mind

But imaginary bottles won't be everywhere
To haunt me like before
'Cos I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

So, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

It don't matter where you came from
All I know is that you gave me back my pride
You reached out your hand and saved a man
Who strayed about as far as he could slide

And you probably came from heaven
Who else could've sent you but the Lord
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

So, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

Yeah, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore, yeah

Yeah, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
And I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore
