I been walkin' all night down the railroad track
Wonderin' if my baby 'll be comin' back
Hung like a monkey in a coconut tree
I'm so shook up, I got the heebie jeebies
My head goin' 'round like a spinnin' top
I wanna sit down, but I just can't stop
When I get home, I'm gonna pull off my shoes
Get on the floor and dance away my blues
Ah-ha, and do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, do the barefoot rock
I'm gonna dance away all my blues

Some people say I'm about to lose my sense
Howlin' like a tomcat sittin' on the fence
Callin' for my baby high and low
Searchin' for that girl, 'cause I love her so
Lookin' at the moon up in the sky
Thinkin' about that girl and I almost cry
When I get home, I'm gonna pull off my shoes
Get on the floor and dance away my blues
Ah-ha, and do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, and do the barefoot rock
Ah-ha, do the barefoot rock
I'm gonna dance away all my blues
