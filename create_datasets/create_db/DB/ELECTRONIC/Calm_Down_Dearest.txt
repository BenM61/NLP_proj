Bang, where we going, what we doing this night 
I feel drunk already, maybe drink got spiked 
But more like the other like that I'm just a lightweight 
But I don't care, man, I been drunk forever I sedated 
Hatred, I sedated, pages, I sedated 
Worthwhile cages, stages, and all of my rage 
This is a good time to start dancing to this song man 
The good one, dj, play that record of mine 

So where be joey, get us a drink of dimple whiskey 
Look at the lady she be shady but we maybe 
What you doing where you going to their after? 
She said get the f*ck out man you seem to be so plastered 
We been all the night kicking and staring at girls alike 
It's all good man what goes on? 
Drink your can, walkin' it drunk down the strand 
And talk about how we missed the whole club queue 
Who the f*ck are you? 

It's heavy, it's on my mind 
You just says you feel just fine 
Rackin and stackin them lines 
I say, calm down dearest 

It's heavy, it's on my mind 
You says you feel just fine 
Rackin and stackin your lines 
I say, calm down dearest 

I remember shootin' shit down down the old alleyways 
Talking tragedies and music like old holiday 
I remember what we're doing then but I don't remember now 
It's the past, it's the future 
I don't know how to carry on through the rights and wrongs 
Kick it like we know the songs already 
Before we rock steady down and on the dancefloor 
And I don't get no fights when I get angry drunk 
Sit down in the corner, man, I'll soak my fuckin' socks off
So who the f*ck are we just the boys in the city 
It's all been done before and we'll do it again so 
We'll see you later you alligators 
We'll be back I'm sure next week and sit in the bar you know
So good bye, bye we'll try never to die but
We are so young we don't understand if we cannot fly
So we're here now but we'll be gone soon 
Not today, not tomorrow, not the next two 

Heavy, it's on my mind 
You says you feel just fine 
Rackin and stackin' them lines 
I say, calm down dearest 

It's Heavy, it's on my mind 
You says you feel just fine 
Rackin and stackin your lines 
I say, calm down dearest 

It's Heavy, it's on my mind 
You says you feel just fine 
Rackin and stackin your lines 
I say, calm down dearest 

It's Heavy, it's on my mind 
You says you feel just fine 
Rackin and stackin your lines 
I say, calm down dearest
