You give me eyes though she's by your side
Can't get last night out my mind
I'm getting caught up in all your lies
So hard to see you on this all alright

If you say you don't know
Maybe it's time for me to look away
She don't love you like me, but there's no guarantee
I'm always gonna be your getaway

She won't love you like I can
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
I need you to understand
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
Oh no no, she won't love you like I can
Oh no no, I need you to understand
She won't love you like I can
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby

I need some action, I don't need lights off
Think that's the least I deserve
Putting my heart out, for what it's worth
You better stop pulling me first

If you say you don't know
Maybe it's time for me to look away
She don't love you like me, but there's no guarantee
I'm always gonna be your getaway

She won't love you like I can
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
I need you to understand
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
Oh no no, she won't love you like I can
Oh no no, I need you to understand
She won't love you like I can
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby

If you say you don't know (If you say you don't know)
It's time for me to look away
She don't love you like me, but there's no guarantee
I'm always gonna be your getaway

She won't love you like I can
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
I need you to understand
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
I wanna be your, wanna be your baby
She won't love you like I can
I wanna be your, your baby
Let me be your baby, I need you to understand me
