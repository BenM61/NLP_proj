Time after time you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you

Time after time, I tell myself
That I'm so lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be the one you run to see
In the evening when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you

Time after time you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you
Just you, just you
