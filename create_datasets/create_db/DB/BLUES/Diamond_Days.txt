Some days you get diamonds
Some days nickels and dimes
Some days life's a poem
Some days nothing rhymes
Some days you're a winner
Some days you lose
Some days all you're doing is paying dues

On a Wednesday I was playing in a biker bar outside Topeka
On that Friday I was playing on a blues cruise, going to Dominica
Ebbs and flows, like the tide
Some days you get diamonds
Some days nickels and dimes
Some days sparkle
Some days nothing shines
Some days you're given
Some days you choose
Some days all you're doing is paying dues

Tonight I'm sleeping in a 5-Star hotel, Wouldn't ask for more
But I remember I wound up many a night sleeping on a stranger's floor
Sometimes you walk, sometimes you ride

Some folks treat you like something under their shoe, ain't nothin' new
Others greet you like a holy prophet, now what you gonna do'
You try to take it all in stride
'Cause some days you get diamonds
Some days nickels and dimes
Some days you're out of tune
Some days it all chimes
Some days you're grinnin'
Some days you're frownin, ' the blues
Some days all you're doing is payin' dues
Some days all you're doing is payin' dues
