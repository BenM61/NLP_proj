So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Back where I belong

Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected

So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said darling, won't you please

I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong.

Adventure grabbed my heart
And took me away from you, honey
I met all kinds of pretty girls
In every town that I passed through

But that fiery senorita
Burned me down in Mexico
And I got kisses cold as ice
From my Alaskan Eskimo

I feel guilty and ashamed
But I'm gonna say it just the same, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, yeah
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms

Now yes says senorita
She gave me I'll just si ya!
While kissing in the igloo
My Eskimo said no no!

Yeah, baby
So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
It's great to be here
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ow!

It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms, yeah
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
