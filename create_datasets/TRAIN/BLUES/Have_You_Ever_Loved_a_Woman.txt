Have you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?
Yee-es!
Have you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?
Yee-es!
All the time you know
She bears another man's name

You just love that woman
So much it's a shame and a sin
Yee-es!
You just love that woman
So much it's a shame and a sin
Yes, you know, yes you know
She belongs to your very best friend

And yee-es!
Have you ever loved a woman
One that you know you can't leave her alone?
And yee-es!
Have you ever loved a woman (sing!)
Onet you know you can't leave her alone?
A- yee-es!
But there's something deep inside a-you
Won't let you wreck yo best friend's home.

Yea-ay-ay-ay.
