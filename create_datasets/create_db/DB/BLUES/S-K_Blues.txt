Well, come to me, pretty baby
Put your fine mellow body on my knee
Please come to me, baby
And put your fine mellow body on my knee
I wanna whisper in your ear
Until you think it keeps bothering me

You and me mistreat her, baby
Don't mean no one man no good
Yes, you and me mistreat her
Don't mean no one man no good
'Cause all you do, woman
Is raised in my neighborhood

I did more for my baby
Than the good Lord has ever done
I did more for my baby
Than the good Lord has ever done
I, I went down town and bought her some hair
And the good Lord never gave her enough

I gave you back that wig I bought you, baby
And let your hair go bald
? back home, baby
And let your hair go bald
Because if you keep on mistreating me, baby
You won't have no hair, no hair at all

No hair, no hair
What's the matter now?
