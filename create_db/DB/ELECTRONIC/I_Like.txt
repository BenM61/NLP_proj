It makes you wonder just who they really are
They say money is no object and we've got a car
They kidnapped Tony where did they go
They went to get it done before he got too old

They're incognito, they're into fame
They think they know it all you know their family's to blame
Isn't it funny, isn't it sad
You come up empty thinking bout the good times that you had

But...
I like, when they talk really loud trying to tell you what they know
I like, when it blows real hard and it doesn't even show
They say: It's plain to see, life is not a mystery to me

I say: That's plain as day I hope you've got yours right anyway
They say: It's plain to see, life is not a mystery to me
I say: That's plain as day I hope you've got yours right anyway
It makes you wonder 'bout the things they say

We are never gonna leave, we are never gonna stay
They talk for nothing, they talk for free
They talk behind your back and to you're face they're really sweet
Check out the language, check out the clothes

Their mother buys them shoes 'n where she get's them no-one knows
They go to parties to steal the show
By talking really loud 'n try to tell you what they know

But...
I like, when they talk really loud trying to tell you what they know
I like, when it blows real hard and it doesn't even show
They say: It's plain to see, life is not a mystery to me

I say: That's plain as day I hope you've got yours right anyway
They say: It's plain to see, life is not a mystery to me
I say: That's plain as day I hope you've got yours right anyway
I like when they talk really loud trying to tell you what they know

Say, I like when it blows real hard and it doesn't even show
Say, I like when they haven't seen a thing and try to tell you where to go
Say, I like when they talk really loud trying to tell you what they know
What do they really know?
