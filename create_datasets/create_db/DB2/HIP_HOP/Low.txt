Mmm did I see you planting seeds in the forest
Is it for the green of the dollars
Now don't go telling me it's for the needs of the poorest
Now Imma take a shit in your palace
I just want to make life easy on your eyes
You just want to ease me with your lies

Last from the convoy playing with the old toys
Instant tomorrows handcrafted sorrows
All star bravery imaginary jargon
Crypted by business I'll see you in hell
Sipping on a quick fix elasticated dimwit
Sucking on a thumb marching to an old hit
Tiger in an envelope paper boy puppet rope
Scratchings on a blank tape stealth like utopia
Marriage in a gas mask little girl black clad
Drugs for the lawyer cause we appreciate
Cut to the chase twelve grand in the case
Testing out the cannons the evidence is damning

You lied to me me me

TV news said keep you head above water
My willingness choked in my sleep
Tell-tale shoes won't get me home in an hour
The further I go I could freeze

The shine is truly faded relieved of his duties
Behind the veil is fury, unadmittent optimist
Undercover pessimist
Baby showered in my fathers sins but I was born to be the better part of him
That was always on the checklist
Take my humanity end up like a mannequin thinking like a charlatan was easy now its challenging
So take my humanity end up like a mannequin thinking like a charlatan was easy now its challenging
