Song of Solomon
I hate heaven! I hate it! I hate it!
I hate heaven! I hate it! I hate it!
My lover calls my teeth an invitation to my soul
But he does not understand the depth of my black hole
Fed by brothers basking in the season of the sick

My love is like a deadly poison lying on my lips
I feel the darkness of the doorway into my mothers room
Every time they beat my body underneath the moon
I hate heaven! I hate it! I hate it!
I hate heaven! I hate it! I hate it!
