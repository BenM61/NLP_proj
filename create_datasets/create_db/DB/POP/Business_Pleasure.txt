It's only her second day
Speeding down the motorway
Tired of child's play
Growing up another way

'Cause she knows, she knows
She knows she can do it well
'Cause she won't, she won't
She won't follow down to his bed

Why does it hurt so bad
Begging them back?
Why does it feel so wrong
Just trying to be strong?

It wasn't going anywhere
Now the wind's in her head
She knew she had to get ahead
She was right when she said

I'm not your girl in the machine
Business pleasure, business pleasure
I've come too far to take it away
Business pleasure, business pleasure

I'm not your girl in the machine
Business pleasure, business pleasure
I won't give up on my daydream
Business pleasure, business pleasure

Lost in the city with no power, hour after hour
She's in the city with no power, hour after hour
Lost in the city with no power, hour after hour
She's in the city with no power, hour after hour

Hour after hour, hour after hour
Business pleasure, business pleasure
Business pleasure, business pleasure

Hour after hour, hour after hour
Business pleasure, business pleasure
Business pleasure, business pleasure

It's only her second day
Speeding down the motorway
Tired of child's play
Growing up another way

I'm not your girl in the machine
Business pleasure, business pleasure
I've come too far to take it away
Business pleasure, business pleasure

I'm not your girl in the machine
Business pleasure, business pleasure
I won't give up on my daydream
Business pleasure, business pleasure

Lost in the city with no power, hour after hour
She's in the city with no power, hour after hour

Hour after hour, hour after hour
Hour after hour, hour after hour
