There's a part of me that just wants to do everything you say
There's an other part that just wants to turn around and slap your face
'Cause everytime I think you understand the way that it should be
You end up hurting me

I don't want to fight I don't want to lose everything we had
But you that know sometimes the good side loses to the bad
And everytime I walk away we end up shouting in the street
It may be bittersweet

'Cause I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
'Cause I every time I walk away the devil takes over in me
and then I hear you speak
I get weak 

Feels like time is standing still right here when you're touching me
And it feels like there's no place that I would rather be
But if it doesn't feel the same to you, then I'm not getting through
I've got to know the truth

'Cause I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
'Cause every time I walk away the devil takes over in me
and then I hear you speak

I get weak 
You know that I get weak
Really I get weak

I'm not waiting anymore this is how I feel
I'm tired of excuses I've got to know it's real

'Cause I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
'Cause every time I walk away the devil takes over in me
Yeaaah
I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
Weak, think I will be stronger then before
and then I hear you speak
I get weak
