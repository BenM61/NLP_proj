I've seen all your movies, at least 3 or 4 times.
And have on my wall, a large picture of you.
And you were that pretty young star, so long ago.
I'm born out of time with you.
What can I do?

Maybe, I'm silly to think we'd have made it.
But what I'd had given to at least had a try.
Oh take me back with you 1939,
'cause black and white movies
are making me cry.
And born out of time, we slipped hopelessly by.

Sophia Loren, Bridgett Bardot, Jean Harlowe,
Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Deitrich.
But Greta, you're better than any I've seen.
Yes, you were a real beauty queen.

Oh listen people, has it happened to you yet?
The feeling that someone was born out of time?
Will you love someone, physically much too young for you?
Either way, it's a shame, time was so cruel.
But it's nice that that, generally, isn't the rule.

Sophia Loren, Bridgett Bardot, Jean Harlowe,
Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Deitrich.
But Greta, you're better than any I've seen.
Yes, you were a real beauty queen.
And Clark Gable's who I should have been.
