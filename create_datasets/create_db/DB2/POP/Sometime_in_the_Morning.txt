Sometime in the morning
A simple thought may occur to you,
And you hold her,
And tell her all the things you never told her
Your love has shown me things 
I never thought I could see
I didn't know (I didn't know)
It could be done so easily now I know (now I know)
You're where it is for me

Sometime in the evening
You're sitting there by the fireside
And she'll touch you
And you'll realize how much you never knew before,
How much you couldn't see
You didn't know (you didn't know)
It could be done so easily now you know
She's all a girl could be

Now in her childlike eyes
You see the beauty there
You know it was always there
And you need no longer wear a disguise

Sometime in the morning
You'll just reach out and she will be there,
Close as the summer air

Sometime in the morning (she will be there) she will be there
Sometime in the morning (she will be there) she will be there
