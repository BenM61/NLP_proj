Every time I see your hair
Falling across your face
I want to get down on my knees
Pray to you

Every time I see you hands
Hanging loosely at your side
Ten long fingers
I just want to run and hide

Is that the way it feels for you
Is that the way it feels for you
That's the way it feels for me
Every time I see your lips
Every time I kiss your cheek

I know that soon you'll be gone
And I won't see you for weeks
How do you think that makes me feel
Knowing that you're out there
Wondering where you're going

Wondering who you're seeing
Sometime I get like a restless dog
I wander the streets
Looking for someone who can

Block you out of my mind
Sometimes I wish I'd never
I wish I'd never heard your name
I wish I'd never felt your legs
Wrapped around me
