Just like I told you  you must learn 
It's calm yet wild the style that I speak 
Just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart 
In fact you'll start to illuminate  knowledge to others in a song 

Let me demonstrate the force of knowledge  
knowledge reigned supreme 
The ignorant is ripped to smithereens 
What do you mean when you say I'm rebellious 

'Cause I don't accept everything that you're telling us 
What are you selling us the creator dwellin' us 
I sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us 
I failed your class 'cause I ain't with your reasoning 

You're tryin' make me you by seasoning 
Up my mind with see Jane run, see John walk in a hardcore New York 
It doesn't exist no way, no how 
It seems to me that in a school that's ebony 

African history should be pumped up steadily, but it's not 
and this has got to stop, See Spot run, run get Spot 
Insulting to a Black mentality, a Black way of life 
Or a jet Black family, so I include with one concern, that 

You must learn 


I believe that if you're teaching history 

Filled with straight up facts no mystery 

Teach the student what needs to be taught 

'Cause Black and White kids both take shorts 

When one doesn't know about the other ones' culture 

Ignorance swoops down like a vulture 

'Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor 

No one told you about Benjamin Banneker 

A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac 

Can't you see where KRS is coming at 

With Elie Whitney, Holly Selosy, Grand Bill Woods 

made the walky-talky 

Lewis Latterman improved on Edison 

Charles Drew did a lot for medicine 

Garrett Morgan made the traffic lights 

Harriet Tubman freed the slaves at night 

Madame CJ Walker made a straightin' comb 

But you won't know this is you weren't shown 

The point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh 

'Cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed 

So what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man 

we need the 89 school system 

One that caters to a Black return because 

You must learn
