What would you have me do
Just turn and walk out on you
And leave you standing there
Pretending I don't care
When you know as well as I
That would be nowhere
Shouldn't I be with you

What would you have me say
After I walk away
Would it be the end
Or just a second wind
For the good old song that we use to call pretending
Shouldn't I be with you

It's not the first time that you had me turn away
I don't know it won't be the last time
But you got to say you got to

Should we make a brand new start
Or are you gonna break my heart
And leave me standing there
Pretending I don't care
When you know as well as I
That would get us nowhere
Will it be the end
Or just a second wind
For the good old song that we use to call pretending
Shouldn't I be with you
Shouldn't I be with you
