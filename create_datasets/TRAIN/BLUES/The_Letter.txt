Yes, I want to write a letter
But I don't know just where to begin
Yes, I want to write a letter, people
But I don't know just where to begin
Well, I tell you, it's a sin, people
The way I've been treated by my so called friends

Yes, if I got a dollar
They want to borrow half a buck
Whoa, and if I want to gamble
They want to jinx me and give me bad luck
So, I tell you it's a sin, people
The way I've been treated by my so called friends

Yes, they say friends
They're the greatest thing in the world
Yes, they say close, close friends
They're the greatest thing in the world
But I think that's all wrong people
Because my best friend have taken my girl
