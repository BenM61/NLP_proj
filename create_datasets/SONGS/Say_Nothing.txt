With you by my side
I felt like I'd arrived
I was lost and found
I feel kinda selfish
And selfish is helpless
I dragged you down

We somehow delayed it
I played it so basic we fooled our crowd
So nice on the surface
But somehow we burnt it
Now words don't mean a thing

You don't have to say nothing
Say nothing
'Cause your eyes do the talking
You don't have to say nothing
Say nothing
'Cause your eyes do the talking

I get home at half five
We fight til the sunrise
We won't back down
The subjects worth hiding
It's high stakes we're riding
It all falls down

Twice strikes the lightning
The night had me high under its dark spell
Now I fight back, you fight back
Won't wave your white flag
Our words don't mean a thing

Don't speak
Don't speak no more
'Cause your eyes do the talking
Don't speak
Don't speak no more
'Cause your eyes do the talking

You don't have to say nothing
Say nothing
'Cause your eyes do the talking
You don't have to say nothing
Say nothing
'Cause your eyes do the talking

(Let's talk)
We used to have our eggs sunny side up
But the fun dried up
And now I feel like our time's up
I can see you wanna talk but your tongues tied up
Gotta wise up
Cant keep hiding, cant keep sliding
Down that one way road to oblivion
I've told you a million times where my heads at
But it's all arguments and who's winning em
Sometimes the right words don't surface
Shut up pretend it's all perfect
Brain short circuits so
I look into your eyes and I don't feel worthless
What I said you know I never meant it
Like somebody keeps finishing my sentence
No more tears, no more lies
I know what you want when you say it with your eyes

Don't speak
Don't speak no more
'Cause your eyes do the talking
Don't speak
Don't speak no more
'Cause your eyes do the talking

You don't have to say nothing
Say nothing
'Cause your eyes do the talking
You don't have to say nothing
Say nothing
'Cause your eyes do the talking
