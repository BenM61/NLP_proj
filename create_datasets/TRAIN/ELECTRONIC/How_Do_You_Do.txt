How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again

When you wake me in the morning
That is my favorite thing
The party is so warming
As a strikes a chord upon my skin
Now you sing in the evening
With the voice that's bouncing like a spring
A heart is not for breaking
It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin
It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin

How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again

Have we taken all we're good for?
Have we registered our love in vain
A church is not for praying
It's for celebrating the life that bleeds through the pain
(It's for celebrating the life that bleeds through the pain)
It's for celebrating the life that shines through your veins
(It's for celebrating the life that shines through your veins)
It's for celebrating the life that bleeds through the pain

How do you do it?
You make me want to live again
How do you do it?
You make me want to live again

If you won't answer you sure are ours
You make me want to live again
If you won't answer you sure are ours
You make me want to live again
If you won't answer you sure are ours
How do you do that thing you do?
If you won't answer you sure are ours
