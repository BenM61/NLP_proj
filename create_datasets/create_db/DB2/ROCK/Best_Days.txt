Every time I look at you
You always look so beautiful
Driving on the road again
The Chevy's packed, and it is dusk
And I will take some photographs
So I can dream of you

Can't say I've felt such twisting in my heart this way
We pitch a tent and everyone's sleeping
I just stay awake
The fire's burning 
Softly singing songs
So close to you

Do you believe
In love at first sight?
I think you do
We're hanging out with one another
Those are the best days of my life

Can't take away those times
We stayed up and talked all night
Chain smokes of cigarettes and
Three bottles of red wine
Falling asleep together
Holding your body close to mine

Oh, and in the morning
Your eyes opened so innocent
The sun is blazing; we are sweaty
You look lovely
Nothing else matters anymore 
Cause you're in my arms again

Do you believe
In love at first sight?
I think you do
We're hanging out with one another
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my...
Those are the best days of my life

Oh, I'll never wanna be without you
So just stay with me
I will love you endlessly

Oh, oh darling, darling
Oh, oh darling, darling

Do you believe
In love at first sight?
I think you do
We're hanging out with one another
Those are the best days of my life

Do you believe
In love at first sight?
I think you do
We're hanging out with one another
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my life
