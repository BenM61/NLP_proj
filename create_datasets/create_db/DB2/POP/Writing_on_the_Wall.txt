I try to reach out but all I can see
Is the writing on the wall which tells me
You're trying too hard to play someone's game
so who's to cry or who's to blame
Don't pretend it's such a shame

You're flying high but on your own
not on wings but dreams alone
but don't be sorry
come on come on now
Be aware the game will never share
The burden you seem to bear

Somehow, sometimes or somewhere
You will be there
The mountain is high and I'm far from the top
But miles behind I see the wall still saying stop
Don't pretend it's such a shame

You're flying high but on your own
not on wings but dreams alone
but don't be sorry
come on come on now
Be aware the game will never share
The burden you seem to bear

Somehow, sometimes or somewhere, 
you will be there
It's time to wake up
And I'm the only one to stop
Face the world a new tomorrow
Forget about a play of illusions
and go back to the wall

You're flying high but on your own
not on wings but dreams alone
but don't be sorry
come on come on now
Be aware the game will never share
The burden you seem to bear
