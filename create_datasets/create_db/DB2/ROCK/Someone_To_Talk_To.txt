I watch your eyes, across the room
And I see how much they've changed
From what I knew
Things seem so different now
In your life
But I never wanted more that you could find

And the sun won't shine, into your room
And the love you thought you felt
Was never true
Things seem so different now
In my life
And you know I felt the emptiness of time

It took me so long...
to find myself...Someone to talk to

You say the world is wide
And your thoughts are deep
And the wind will carry
Everything you keep
Things seem so simple now
In my life
Now I've found someone
Who makes it all seem right

And it took me so long...
to find myself...Someone to talk to
