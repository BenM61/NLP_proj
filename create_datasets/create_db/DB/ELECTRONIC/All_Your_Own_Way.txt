How is your head these days?
How does it feel?
Are you all over the place?
Deeply confused

You wanted it all your own way
Your ear won't buy all the hearsay
You wanted it all your own way
Your ear won't buy all the hearsay

What lurks in you shadows? Dark
Do you see?
What once was once innocent
Now conspiracy

You wouldn't listen for your own sake
You went along by all the hearsay
You wouldn't listen for your own sake
You wanted it all your own way

You could do a synapse through my brain 
Put fire on my wounds and do it again
You could change the times with a miracle
Even if I die, I'd do it again

I'd do it again
I'd do it again
I'd do it again

I don't recall too much
Some faces stay...
It doesn't seem part of my life
Feel like a dream

You wanted it all your own way
Your ear won't buy all the hearsay
You wanted it all your own way
You went along by all the hearsay

You could do a synapse through my brain 
Put fire on my wounds and do it again
You could change the times with a miracle
Even if I die I'd do it again

Even if I, even if I, even if I
Even I die, I'd do it again
Even if I, even if I
Even if I, even if I

I'd do it again
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
