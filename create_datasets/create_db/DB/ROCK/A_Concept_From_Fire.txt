Lets march through the gates and burn alive
I'm afraid of the ending, but I'm reckless
I've torn apart my inner binding now
That's what it takes to turn myself around
To be become a new project

And that's more than I need right now
And my thoughts convey deception
And my wall I'm building
The want, the pain, the urge, the concept will last forever
It won't be destroy

Were exposed here and I will never grow (I will never grow)
All I've learned erased the will to know
Where I belong

This blood, my life, disarray inside
To hell for the way I live
To shred on the guilt I feel
I'm afraid my open heart is ripe

And that's more than I need right now
My hopes are bleak and numb
And my wall I'm building
The want, the pain, the urge, the concept will last forever
It won't be destroy

Were exposed here and I will never grow
All I've learned erased the will to know
Where I belong

The fire awaits us
Don't look back
Hide your weakness
Your weakness, your weakness
Burn
