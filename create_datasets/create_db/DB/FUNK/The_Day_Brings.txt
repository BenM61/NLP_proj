Hold up your end
And I'll hold up mine
Dancin' all the time
Dancin' all the time

And too late father
You know that that's for sure
You never find a way
Never find a way
So gather around

And see what the day brings
And see what makes you laugh
And see what makes you sing
And never, nevermind

The thing that people say
You'll never go away
You'll never go away

Who knows where the storm will take us
Who knows when the pain will break us
When will all the g's be given
Another chance to live in freedom

Hey now
Get your heart, get your heart
Off of the shelf
Make the grey sky blue

Yeah, I'm talkin to you
And nevermind
The sick and the afraid
Askin' out today to see a brighter day
So gather around

And see what the day brings
And see what makes you laugh
And see what makes you sing
And never, nevermind

The thing that people say
You'll never go away
You'll never go away

Who knows where the storm will take us
Who knows when the pain will break us
When will all the g's be given
Another chance to live in freedom

So gather around
And see what the day brings
And see what makes you laugh
And see what makes you sing
And never, nevermind

The thing that people say
You'll never go away
You'll never go away
So gather around

And see what the day brings
See what makes you laugh
And what makes you sing
