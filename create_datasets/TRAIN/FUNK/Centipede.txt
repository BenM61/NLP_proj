Centipede
Centipede

Your love
Is like a ragin' fire, oh
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire

But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire, huh
And when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire

I feel, oh, yeah
A longin' for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love, ho

Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Just like a centipede you've got
A lot of lovin' to touch

Don't you know in the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears
And you're crawlin' like a centipede

Centipede

You came, oh
To strike him with your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To bite him with your love

Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Just like a centipede you've got
A lot of lovin' to touch

Don't you know in the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears
And you're crawlin' like a centipede

Centipede

In the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears

In the quiet of the night
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'
And the moon starts to glow then disappear
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawlin'
You'll be crying in the night so many tears
And you're crawlin' like a centipede

Centipede
