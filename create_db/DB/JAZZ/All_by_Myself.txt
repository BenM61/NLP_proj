All by myself in the mornin'
All by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there 
Playin' solitaire.
 
All by myself I get lonely
Watchin' the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head
On somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older 
All by myself.

All by myself in the mornin'
All by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there 
Playin' solitaire. 
 
'Cause I'm all by myself and I get lonely 
Watchin' the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head 
On somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older 
All by myself. 
 
All by myself in the mornin'
All by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there 
Playin' solitaire.  
     
And I'm all by myself so I get lonely
Just watchin' the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head  
On somebody's shoulder  
I hate to grow older
All by myself
