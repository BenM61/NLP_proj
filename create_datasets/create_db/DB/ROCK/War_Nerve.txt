Truly, f*ck the world, for all it's worth, every inch of Planet 
Earth, f*ck myself, don't leave me out, but don't get 
involved, don't corner me 
Inside, ulcer, unjust bastards, file out face first 
Meet the lies and see what you are 

It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you 
Let the war nerve break 
 
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and 
judges what I am in one paragraph - Look here - F*ck you all 

Expect the worse, you bleeding heart, but kill me first 
before it starts, yes my cock is getting hard, we are 
born different after all 
Invite mayhem, produce weapons, shoot out, burn down 
No CNN or media now

It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you 
Let the war nerve break 
 
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and 
judges what I am in one paragraph - Look here - F*ck you all 

All the money in the fucking world couldn't 
buy me one second of trust or one ounce of faith in anything you're about 
F*ck you all

Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost 
Apologies unacceptable now 
A blistered revenge awaits in me 
This is fucking loveless 
Hate 
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead 
Hate 
The Lord knows, there's worse 
Ignore, this curse 
Hate
