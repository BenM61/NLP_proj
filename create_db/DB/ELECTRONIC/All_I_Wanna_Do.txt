Looking through your window
Maybe you're not home
I tried to call your number
So now I leave another message on your phone

I'm not a stalker I just gotta know
How it feels when I hold you close
So tell me what you likes
'Cause I'm runnin' out of time
Promise you I'm not insane
Something about you that I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind

Yeah, all I wanna do, is make love to you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right
All I wanna do, is stay the night with you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah

Staring at your picture
It's hanging on my wall
Yeah I even called your mama
To ask her how to get through to your heart
And I said

I'm not a stalker I just gotta know
How it feels when I hold her close
So tell me what she likes
'Cause I'm runnin' out of time
Promise you I'm not insane
Something about her that I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind

Yeah, all I wanna do, is make love to you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right
All I wanna do, is stay the night with you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah
