Clever lier, fooling us all, never thought I'd work it out
How could I have known it was ever about you boy?
Now there's nothing to say, there's no words and we're not talking anyhow
You must have known I was never to doubt you boy

If it was so fine, it was so good, oh you're unbelievable
All this time I've been living without you boy, not your lying
It felt so good, the world don't know, now they'll never find out
All these years she must've been beside you boy

Don't forget that I was the one that you found
And if I know you, you'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

We're a waste of time
And if I know you, learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

Go and explain, explain it again, boy that this all started
Found you lying in the arms of another girl so stop your crying
Day after day, year after year, far too long and lost it
Must have thought I was nothing without you boy

Don't forget that I was the one that you found
And if I know you, you'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

We're a waste of time
And if I know you, learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

And tonight if we learn that the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

I've failed to fight, so hard to fight
And I can find a way for you and I to go on like this
I'm always learning things the hard, hard, hardest way

'Cause I was the one that you found
And if I know you, you'll find me someplace new
I hope you never, I hope you never get to

Tonight, if we learn that the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to
