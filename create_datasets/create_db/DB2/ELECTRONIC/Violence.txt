Break it down like you know it's loaded
I got it cocked and loaded
I got a sickness to feed

So break it down like you're undevoted
Don't need a fucking motive
I hope you're ready to bleed

Everybody down on the motherfucking floor right now
I ain't messing around motherfucker, now
Everybody down on the motherfucking floor right now

I want your violence
Motherfucker show me your violence
Give me your violence
Motherfucker show me your violence
YEAH!

Break it down now the blood is flowing
The body count is growing
I love the sound of the screams

So break it down with the system blowing
And feel the sickness growing
It's like a fucking disease

Everybody down on the motherfucking floor right now
I ain't messing around motherfucker, now
Everybody down on the motherfucking floor right now

I want your violence
Motherfucker show me your violence
Give me your violence
Motherfucker show me your violence

So break it down!
Motherfucker break it down!
Motherfucker break it down!
Motherfucker break it down!
