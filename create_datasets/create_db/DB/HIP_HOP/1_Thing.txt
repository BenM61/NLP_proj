Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na

Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't want to tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I want to set it off, but

It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (you did)
This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing don't want to admit it
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh oh oh

Hey, we don't know each other well
So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door.
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

Maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
I can't deny, tired of trying
Open up the door, but just keep on seeing you
I'm hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Na, na, na, na, na oh
Oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na

This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh

Oh oh, oh oh
