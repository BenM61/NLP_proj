I keep using my energy
Pushing in, shoving my way to peace
Almost there , almost there
Do not leave Getting nowhere

Almost there
Almost there

Electronic world
Supersonic girl
We keep moving on to nothing
We keep typing, we're not thumping

World won't get by me
I feel like I'm on to something
We keep moving
We're not searching

I keep using my energy
Pushing in, shoving my way to peace
Almost there, almost there
Do not leave Getting nowhere

Enigmatic stream
Consciousness unleashed
Drew the inch so Magnetic
Tell me you can't forget it

Running out of time
Visions hold my mind
But I'm still holding on to nothing
Lord I hope you show me something

I keep using my energy
Pushing in, shoving my way to peace
Almost there, almost there
Do not leave Getting nowhere

Nowhere nowhere nowhere
Nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere
Nowhere

I think I'm gonna get there
Gonna get there
Almost there
Feel like we've been getting nowhere

I keep using my energy
Pushing in, shoving my way to peace
Almost there, almost there
Do not leave Getting nowhere

Almost there
