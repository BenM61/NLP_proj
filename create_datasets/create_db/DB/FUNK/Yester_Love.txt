Ooh  
Yesterday we made future plans 
She loved me I could tell 
Can today be that tomorrow that we planned so well? 

Yester baby I'll never forget her 
Though tomorrow might bring me one better 
Today I go on my way to love my yester love 
Today I go on my way to love my yester love, oh oh 

Yesterday I felt a tender kiss upon my face 
Now the day is gone and there's a teardrop in its place 
Oh, yester kisses that I used to treasure 
Now you're given some other lips pleasure 

Today I'm on my way dreamin' of my yester love 
Today I'll go on my way dreamin' of my yester love, oh 

Yester is, the prefix that we fix to things that have gone by 
Forever they seem, yeah even though my yester love 
Has slipped through my fingers, I find it still lingers 
In my heart today 

Yesterday I thought I had a love to call my own 
No one could have told me that today I'd be alone 
Yes the sweetness today has gone sour 
Seemin' further away with each hour 
Today I go on my way dreamin' of my yester love 
Today I go on my way dreamin' of my yester love 
Today I go on my way dreamin' of my yester love
