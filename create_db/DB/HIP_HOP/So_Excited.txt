Breathe

You get me so
Get me so excited

[Chorus]
I'm hot, come on, so get it ready
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Act bad
Don't hurt me
Look sexy
Talk dirty 
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
Get me so excited

For some reason it might be the money that really turns you on
But for me it's an attitude that keeps me tight on the floor
And no words are suitable to describe your swagger, babe
And my body is in overdrive when I have you inside of me

Do you like it when I do it?
I go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word no
So forget about them other girls, baby
'Cause now you're rollin' with a woman, baby
I'm a keep your body thumpin', baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

[Chorus]

So amused by mind control that I wanna get two steps up
As for me, I'm a let you know that my body's smoking hot
Throw me up against whatever's close and get to bossin' me around
And every time I give you the assist, you know how to slam it down

Do you like it when I do it?
I go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word no
So forget about them other girls, baby
'Cause now you're rollin' with a woman, baby
I'm a keep your body thumpin', baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

[Chorus]

Is ya, is ya, is ya hungry?
I gotcha
I gotcha
I gotcha licking on my...
Licking on my...
Licking on my body, body, like it's something to eat 
So you can
Act bad
Don't hurt me
Look sexy
Talk dirty
Get me so excited

[Chorus]
