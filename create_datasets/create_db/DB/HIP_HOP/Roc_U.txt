Momma in tears again, I guess death is the number one fear of men; But I ain't scared, I can tell its commin', I can feel it
in the air; I can smell it commin, fully prepared to meet the fuckin' man in the trench coat, I ain't hiding, but tryna duck
him long as I can though; They say i'm flirting with the devil talkin blast with me cursin out the reet between the gate,
until I see the light, shootin everything in sight, worn every other day bodies every other night (thats right) Death is the
only thing for sure in life (thats right) Young Gunz get em real nice
