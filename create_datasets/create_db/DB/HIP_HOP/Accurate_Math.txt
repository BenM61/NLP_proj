Go bananas if you lickin my split with the lavender six
Sexier than calendar chicks my voice is orgasm to mix
Have my money accurate
I don't want my cats to flip they clap and shit
Real nails, no tips, lips you love to kiss
And for Amereda sour get my thugs to crisp
Front row cheering the Knicks illegal pit
Stack my arithmetic, ridiculous
I like hard and stiff can you handle it?
Sole' burn tracks like candle wit
Independent woman so you don't have to trip
Baby we can go dutch half pay for it

 [Kandi Burruss]
1 - We can do anything that you want to do
 Go any place that you want to go
 I ain't no money hungry hoe
 Sole' don't need ya dough no no

[Sole']
Yo we number one for months
You tryin to catch up like hunch
Yo we up front and personal
I heard ya label jerkin you
Feel like hurtin who
Lord have mercy on you
Only female out the crew
5'6" and petite rockin baby blue and the navy two times two
With twenties on it, get up on it
You want it but they ain't no how
Bitch brigade, I'm fittin' Cal
Have you hoes feel trapped when faced with hot tracks
I take my hails off, you takin dirt naps, I heard that
Make you work pass ATL home of the lats
Bringing real Hip Hop back now who can top that
Need to stop that we top cats where my niggas at

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Sole']
You don't really want to face me
I had to smack a bitch in the dressing room of Macy's
You don't want to make me put my hands up
Get yo man what?
You know we buck misery, pull the truck up
He ran like a duck, now it's me and you boo
And you shit out of luck
Open up and meet these nuts
Now you lumped up for what
Talkin out ya lip now the next thing you kiss is peroxide Miss
Rappin ain't yo style you need to switch
Read your top ten list Sole' on top of this
What what yo yo and you know that I'm the soloist
I'm rollin dice make 'em clap to this

Repeat 1 (4x)
Make 'em clap to this 
Make 'em, make 'em, make 'em clap to this 
(repeat till fade)
