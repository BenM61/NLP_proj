Tryin' to find a reason for love
I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I know is for me and you
The only things I'm doing from myself
Diggin' holes in my brain tryin' to hide away
You know when it gets bad for your health
Things have gotta change 'cause they're not same

But it's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold brown mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
I don't even get to be alone

Talking ain't as easy when you're down
I know you know I'm tryin' to find the words to say
You told me you would always be around
But now you're gone, I know that we are not okay
I'm so afraid of growing old 
So don't you go and leave me on my own
Baby, what the hell you acting so cold?
I guess I'll never know, guess I'll never know

'Cause it's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold brown mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold brown mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold brown mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind

I don't even get to be alone
So I'm tryin' to find a reason for love
I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I knew was for me and you

But it's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold brown mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
I don't even get to be alone
