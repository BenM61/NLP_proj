If I could, I would
Do it again, I?d do it again
I wouldn?t change a thing
We have love, and lose love
And do it again, and do it again
But that?s how we are
We come back just to throw it all away

(Chorus)
Tell me it?s over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love
Tell me you miss me
And I will come back for one more day
I?m addicted to this elevator love
Elevator love

We laugh, we cry
And do it again, do it again
We go to hell and back (Oohhh)
But there?s something ?bout you
I can?t keep away
Just can?t keep away
We know we?ll crash down (crashin', crashin')
But I don?t want it any other way

(Chorus)
Tell me it?s over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love (yea)
Tell me you miss me
And I will come back for one more day
I?m addicted to this elevator love
Elevator...

Over and over and over we fall
We go up to come down, just to turn it around
And face it all again

Tell me it?s over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love (yea)

(Chorus)
Tell me it?s....over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love (yea)
Tell me you miss me
And I will come back for one more day
I?m addicted to this elevator love
Elevator love
