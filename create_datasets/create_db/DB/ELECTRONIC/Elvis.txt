Look into the darkness
I'm dancing in the shadows with you
There's a world waiting out there for us to see

And beneath the starlit blanket
Dreams are made of solid gold
I just wanna be the one to hold you there
When you're cold

With so many pictures on the walls
Of five billion minds
We just need to take them out sometime
Y'know and start living the good times

Decent dreams and pictures make you airborne
When you close your eyes

That's why I wanna fly with you tonight
No one else, no one else can make the flight like you
So I wanna fly with you tonight
And no one there, oh lord oh lord

I'm obviously indebted to you
By the way that you make me feel
Those ice cold warm heart
Is always gonna be able to turn a dream to real
I say
I'm touching all horizons with you
I got my sights on solid gold
I feel superhuman baby
Y'know like the way the marvel make man feel in their shows
Now check out what my mind say
Check out what my words say
Check out all my actions
I just want your satisfaction

You know cause I wanna fly with you tonight
Oh no one else, no one else can make the flight like you
So I wanna fly, oh, with you tonight
And make dreams, make a dream a real life
I can oh

You got to take my hand lady
Oh yeah
Then you'll understand what I'm saying
And you know we gonna find the ideal destination
I say I say
I, I wanna fly with you tonight
