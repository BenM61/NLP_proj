Pour another drink, I don't wanna think
Oh, it's been a long day
Get out of your head, smoking on my bed
Put that song on replay

Don't worry now, look what we found
We don't have to go all-in
Head in the clouds, both looking down
Doesn't mean that we're falling, oh

We can keep it simple, baby
Let's not make it complicated
Labels are so overrated
Let's not make it complicated
Rules are meant for breaking, baby
Let's not make it complicated
Why don't we just go get naked?
Let's not make it complicated

Let's not make it complicated
Let's not make it complicated

Skinny dip at night, I can see your eyes
Searchin' through the shadows
You don't have to fight, I'll let you decide
I can help you let go

Don't worry now, look what we found
We don't have to go all-in
Head in the clouds, both looking down
Doesn't mean that we're falling, oh

We can keep it simple, baby
Let's not make it complicated
Labels are so overrated
Let's not make it complicated
Rules are meant for breaking, baby
Let's not make it complicated
Why don't we just go get naked?
Let's not make it complicated

Let's not make it complicated
Let's not make it complicated

Let's not make it complicated
We can keep it simple, baby
Let's not make it complicated
Labels are so overrated
Let's not make it complicated
Rules are meant for breaking, baby
Let's not make it complicated
Why don't we just go get naked?
Let's not make it complicated

Let's not make it complicated
