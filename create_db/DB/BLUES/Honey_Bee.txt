Sail on
Sail on my little honey bee, sail on
Sail on
Sail on my little honey bee, sail on
You gonna keep on sailing
Till you lose your happy home

Sail on
Sail on my little honey bee, sail on
Sail on
Sail on my little honey bee, sail on
I don't mind you sailing
But please don't sail so long

All right, little honey bee

I hear a lotta buzzing
Sound like my little honey bee
I hear a lotta buzzing
Sound like my little honey bee
She been all around the world making honey
But now she is coming back home to me
