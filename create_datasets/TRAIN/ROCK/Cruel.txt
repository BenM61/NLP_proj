Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

Forgive the kids, for they don't know how to live
Run the alleys casually cruel
Cruel, cruel

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
For you could want that, too
They could take or leave you
So they took you, and they left you
How could they be casually cruel?
Cruel, cruel, oh
Cruel, cruel, oh

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too, then you'll be happy

You were the one waving flares in the air so they could see you
And they were a zephyr, blowing past ya,
Blowing fastly so they can see ya
Cruel, cruel, oh
Cruel, cruel, oh

Cruel, cruel, oh
Cruel, cruel, oh
