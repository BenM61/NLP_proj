You were young and you'd start
With a reverence unimpaired
There was an echo far and faint
Beneath the air remained
You were young and you'd stare
Where my limbs hung far and fair
Make a ladder of what folds
And climb up in the air

You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go

There was no light and I swear
I could see your raring fear
I heard the plains moaning back
I saw the thunder roll o'er black
There was no light and I swear
We sat still in our fear
Make a ladder of what folds
And climb up in the air

You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go

(And I)
I carve out the spaces (and I)
Imparted graces (and I)
I couldn't shake it (and I)

I built a constellation lair
Out of the moles that hovered there
A fever billowed with the wind
And I bade the sky therein
I built a constellation lair
Out of the moles that hovered there
Make a pardon of what knows
And climb up in the air

You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go

You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go
