Love this place, but I gotta keep moving
You got the best thing right now, it's no illusion
It's time for fun, love's so new and young
The time has come for new movements

And we'll be singing this song when you're out
Everything will be better when you come out, out of it
Come out of it
Yeah everyone wants you out here

I want in, ride all night LA calling
Bathed in sunlight
Cold as cash is, hot as lust is
I don't want them, I want you
I want you

Thought it was all gonna end
I didn't want it to end
'Cause I was feeling on top
I was feeling on top of the world
Thinking about you girl

And we'll be singing this song when you're out
Everything will be better when you come out, out of it
Come out of there
Yeah everyone wants you out here

I want in, ride all night LA calling
Bathed in sunlight
Cold as cash is hot as lust is
I don't want them

I want in, ride all night LA calling
Bathed in sunlight
Cold as cash is, hot as lust is
I know where my heart is
I want you
I want you
I want you

Thought it was all gonna end
I didn't want it to end
Cause we're feeling on top
Cause we're feeling on to' of the game
From now on it's never gonna be the same

Everywhere, everyone gather round the world,
And give thanks throughout the world
Everywhere, everyone gather round the world,
And give thanks throughout the world

I want in, ride all night LA calling
Bathed in sunlight
Cold as cash is, hot as lust is
I don't want them,

I want in, ride all night LA calling
Bathed in sunlight
Cold as cash is, hot as lust is
I know where my heart is
I want you
I want you
