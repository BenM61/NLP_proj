Cry, whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Cry, whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh

There is a story
That I must tell
Of two lovers
That I knew well
Now they must cry, cry, whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Their blues away
(Cry cry cry their blues away)

Her name was Sue yeah
His name was Earl
His love was Lorraine
Such a wonderful girl
But they must cry, cry, whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Their blues away
(Their blues away)

Love will make you happy
And love will make you cry
Love will make the tears fall
When your lover says goodbye

And they must cry, cry, whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Your blues away
(Cry cry cry their blues away)

This story ends yeah
It was no lie
Names have been changed dear
To protect you and I

But we must cry, cry, whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our blues away
(Cry cry cry)
(Our blues away)
And we must cry cry, whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Our blues away)
Our blues away
(Cry cry cry, our blues away)
We must cry, we must cry, oh my darling
(Our blues away)
