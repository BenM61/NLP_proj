You were the one
Who I could tell my deepest fears
And you were the one
Who always wiped away my tears

When he hurt me you were my prince
Sent straight from above
Like a fool I never saw
You were falling in love

So now I've lost everything
Cause now you say
You're gone forever more
So who will I

Who will I run to
Who will I turn to
Now that you left me behind
Who will dry my tears
When I cry
Who will I run to
And who will I turn to
Now that you're not here
In my life

You were the one
I took for granted all those years
And you were the one
I should've known
It was so clear

How could I be so blind
Not to see what's before my eyes
I'll get you back here with me
If it takes the rest of my life

Cause I would do anything
Cause I want you back forever more

Who will I run to
Who will I turn to
Now that you left me behind
Who will dry my tears
When I cry
Who will I run to
And who will I turn to
Now that you're not here
In my life

I will gladly journey
Across the deep blue sea
If I could know
That I would have you here with me
I realize that I was blind
But now I finally see
I need you back here in my life
Oh baby can it be

Who will I run to
Who will I turn to
Now that you left me behind
Who will dry my tears
When I cry
Who will I run to
Who will I turn to
Now that you're not here
In my life

Who will be there for me
Who's gonna rescue me
Who's gonna share my dreams
Who's gonna mend this broken heart
