Are you breathing what I'm breathing?
Are your wishes the same as mine?
Are you needing what I'm needing?
I'm waiting for a sign
My hands tremble, my heartaches
Is it you calling?   
Is it you calling?
I'm alone in this I don't think I can face
The consequences of falling
The consequences of falling

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Does your pulse quicken like mine?
Are you dreaming what I'm dreaming?
I can't read your mind
One step towards you, two steps back
Feels like I'm crawling
Feels like I'm crawling
If I'm alone in this I don't think I can face
The consequences of falling
The consequences of falling

I cannot sleep, I lie awake

My hands tremble, my heartaches
Is it you calling?  
Is it you calling?
If I'm alone in this I don't think I can face
The consequences of falling
The consequences of falling
The consequences of falling
