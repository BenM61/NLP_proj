You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And a find you swimming round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of Champagne

Yes I think I'm going out of my head
I think I'm going out of my head
Over you, over you

I want you, I need you
I want you to want me 
I can't think of anything but you

Yes I think I'm going out of my head
Cause I can't explain the tears that I've shed
Over you, over you

I see you each morning 
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Going out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head
Day and night, Night and day
It's wrong, Wrong or right

I must think of a way into your heart
Ah, there's no other reason that we should be apart

Yes I think I'm going out of my head
I can't explain the tears that I've shed
Over you, over you
I see you each morning but you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Going out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day it's wrong
Wrong or right
Going out of my head 
Day and night, night and day
It's wrong, wrong or right
Going out of my head
Going out of my head.

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and then it eased my pain
Now the dark days are gone and bright days are here
My Sunny once shined so sincere, Sunny once so true
I love you I love you
