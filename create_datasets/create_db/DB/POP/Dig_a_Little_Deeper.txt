You think you've got it made
I'm trying to have some fun
You think you know it all
I've only just begun
You're sliding on the surface
I'm reaching for the bottom
The past is
The future fades away
And if you think your brain is hollow
You just have to scream
And dig a little deeper.

All art has been contemporary
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

You enjoy the silence
When I want to discuss
You like to keep it tidy
I wanna mess it up
I defy definition
Of what's supposed to be
I don't want recognition
If you don't recognize me
And if you think your brain is hollow
You just have to scream
And dig a little deeper.

All art has been contemporary
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

Oh-oh, oh-oh
