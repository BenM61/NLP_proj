I bust to the scening cuss to the scening 
I admit a little bit I lust for the crideam
Everytime you see me see me biggin up my teaming
on the dream of winning trying to make crideam
Thugged out even when you catch me in the cuisine
my clan mad dirty yall too cliddean (clean)
Hennessey and Smirnoff make a nigga middean (mean)
I need two more like I was a fiddean (fiend)
Drinks galore everytime I'm in the citting (city)
0 to 60 didn't want a sixteening
You see it in my coats or you see it in my jizzeans (jeans)
you can't tell you should know the way I lizzean (lean)
Water so clear I think I'm in Carribbing (Carribbean)
everybody gone like we straight clipping
you better watch out when we start flipping
seen you fuckin and you know we're not slipping

Ohh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT
Ohh Oh No NO WHAT WHAT WHAT
Ohh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT
Ohh Oh No NO WHAT WHAT WHAT

Ayo verse 2 coming with my Heineken brew
N O R putting people back in I C U
You ain't even thiddink that I need a driddink
hit you up quick before you could even bliddink
Give you a splitting cut you up with the shiddank
tell your accountant to go and just check the biddank
I damn near broke you and I ain't even thiddink
I gotta churrda lurrda girls like Shabba Riddanks
Guaranteed to be there just like Fed Ex
We write our own rhymes kid you can check the credits

yo the hood baddest the bitches pussy is the fattest
Smack Smack Smack Smack peep Gladys

I'm gonna get me some head right after the show
you can meet me at the room shit 664

Oh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT
