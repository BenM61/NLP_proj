I always stayed away from love
Afraid of what might might happen
Till I thought I heard a sound above
Singing through my very own heart
Was a melody I'd never heard
Like birds singing loud to the sky

Never dreamed that true love would help me find my way
Didn't know how deep I'd fallen
Until you rescued you rescued me
When suddenly strings began
I heard the melody again and again and again
The sound of music flowing through my head
So rare, I'm walking on air

Melody of love, sing that song for me yeah
I want to hear somebody sing
(Wanna be loved)
Melody of love, take me away

One lonely night you up and danced into my dreams
Baby you set my heart on fire
So I've been burning and burning ever since yeah
When suddenly strings began
I heard the melody again and again and again
The sound of trumpets flowing through my head
So rare, I'm walking on air

Melody of love, sing that song for me yeah
I want to hear somebody sing
Melody of love, oh take me away

Melody of love, set me free yeah
I want to hear somebody sing
Melody of love, oh take me away

Melody of love
Sing that song for me
I want to hear somebody sing
Melody of love
Oh take me away yeah

Melody of love
Oh set me free yeah
Somebody sing
Melody of love
Oh take me away

Melody of love
Sing that song for me
I want to hear somebody sing
Melody of love
