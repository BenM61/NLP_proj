We walk the streets
In tattered armies
We got the lion in our heart
We're not lookin' for trouble
Just for some fun
But we're all ready if you wanna' start

So just remember the,
The kids are back
The kids are back
Oh, watch out
The kids are back

Well, can you blame us
For living our dreams?
Just look around and you'll see why
We don't want to follow
That same routine
Maybe it's for nothin', but we gotta try

So just remember the,
The kids are back
The kids are back
Oh, watch out
The kids are back
Look out

Now there's no problem
No need to fuss
We ain't out to stop your fun
Don't mind us askin'
'cause we gotta know
How can we stop it when you're havin' none?

So just remember the,
The kids are back
The kids are back
Oh, watch out
The kids are back
So just remember the,
The kids are back
The kids are back
Oh, watch out
The kids are back
The kids are back
The kids are back
The kids are back
