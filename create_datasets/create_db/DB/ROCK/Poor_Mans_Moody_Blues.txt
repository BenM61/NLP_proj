All the nights that I've missed you
All the nights without end
All the times that I've called you
Only needing a friend

Now your eyes shine with beauty
That I missed long ago
Guess the truth is I love you
I can't say any more

'Cause I need you
Yes I want you
Yes I love you 
As I look from my window

To the streets where you stand
I am gazing through dark glass
We can't walk hand in hand
Though your friends try to tell me

Though your friends you defend
They keep my heart from your heart
We must be in the end

'Cause I love you
Yes I need you
Yes I love you 

All the nights that I've missed you
All the nights without end
All the times that I've called you
Only needing a friend

Now your eyes shine with beauty
That I missed long ago
Guess the truth is I love you
I can't say any more

'Cause I need you
Yes I want you
Yes I love you
