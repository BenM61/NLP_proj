Look at me
I have fallen so in love with you 
Please don't leave
Stay around 
Let me tell you all 
The things I feel 
Won't you please

Let me be your angel
Let me be the one for you 
Let me be your angel
Let me be the one you believe in 

You might think
I am much too young
To understand
Don't be fooled 
Like a child
I look into your eyes
And know someday 
I'll make you mine

Let me be your angel 
Let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel
Let me be the one you believe in

Let me be your angel 
Let me be the one for you 
Let me be your angel
Let me be the one you believe in
Yeah, oh
