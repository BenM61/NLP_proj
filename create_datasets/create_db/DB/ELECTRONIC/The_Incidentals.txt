It's just the little things, the incidentals, 
It's like you wouldn't even notice when you really turn me on, 
It's the little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite, 
It's just, it's just the simple things, pure incidentals, 
It's like stayin' up 'till midnight and talkin' about absolutely nothing 
It's the thought that it'll always be as wild as I expect it to be, yeah 
Oh, you know it's la la la la love, when you dream, 
A monster just swallowed you up and you don't wanna be saved
Oh and I am crazy about you babe, 
You satisfy me in so many ways, so many ways

But it's just the little things, the incidentals (bada ba bup) 
It's like you wouldn't even notice when you were really turnin' me on, 
It's those little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite, 
It's just, it's just the simple things, pure incidentals, 
It's like breathin' on the back of my neck and makin' me feel weak inside. 
It's no, no matter how scared I, scared I am (I'm safe) I know I'll be safe tonight (yeah yeah)

Oh, you know it's la la la la love, when you dream, 
A monster just swallowed you up and you don't wanna be saved
Oh and I am crazy about you babe, 
You satisfy me in so many ways, so many ways, 
Mmm, so many ways, I can't count the ways. 

(Oh, oh) 
(Bada ba bup) 
(Oh, oh) 
It's the thought that it'll always be as wild as I expect it to be 
And it's just the little things, pure incidentals, 
It's like you wouldn't even notice when you were really turnin' me on, 
It's those little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite yeah, (yeah yeah) 
It's those little sparks that fly and then land like dynamite, yeah
