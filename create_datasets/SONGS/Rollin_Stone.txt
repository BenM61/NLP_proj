Rollin stone
Nothin' but a rollin', rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone 
One day you'll be all alone 

Rollin' stone 
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone 
One day you'll be all alone 

You'll never gather moss 
You'll win a love and gain a loss 
You will look all around
And that lost love can't be found 

Rollin' stone 
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone 
One day you'll be all alone 

You're out with one girl tonight 
And then you've changed before daylight 
Your heart is always in flight 
Now ask yourself, is that right

Rollin' stone 
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone
One day you'll be all alone 

When you're old and all alone 
With no one to call your own 
Maybe then you will see 
Just how wrong you can be 

Rollin' stone 
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone 
One day you'll be all alone 

Don't make your life one big fling 
Give wedding bells a chance to ring 
Why wait too late too late 
Both candle ends you just don't burn 

Rollin' stone
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone 
One day you'll be all alone 
Rollin' stone, just a rollin' stone 
One day you'll be, you'll be, all alone
