Hit up the bottom
Hearts will melt like ice
As the lights keep falling
Makes you feel so small again
As we walk in circles, 
The blind leading the blind
No way of hiding, oh, 
Our heart is all we've got
I'm hungry for you, my love
So come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough out in this war of needs

Drag your heart to the place where it belongs
While it's underwater, 
Where my love will fill your bones
The clouds are shaking, 
And your palms begin to crack
Hands against your eyes 
See this love is all we've got
I'm hungry for you my love
So come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough out in this war of needs
It's a hive of honeybees trapped inside of our skin
Growing faster
Stinging harder till we all give in

Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh

I'm hungry for you my love
Love is just not enough
I'm hungry for you my love
Love is just not enough

I'm hungry for you, my love 
So come out and rescue me
Love is just not enough out in this war of needs
I'm hungry for you, my love 
So come out and rescue me
If love is just not enough out in this war of needs

I'm hungry for you my love
Love is just not enough
It's a hive of honeybees trapped inside of our skin
Growing faster
Stinging harder till we all give in
Ey yeah yeah yeah
