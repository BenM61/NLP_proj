Can I steal your mind?
Can I crawl down inside?
And when I am your child
Can I feed in your eye?

Can I drink the air in your lungs?
And can I breath your sweet thick blood?
My love is everywhere
My love will never escape

I love your body and mind
I will never escape
My love is everywhere
My love is everywhere
My love will never escape

My love is everywhere
No it will never escape
And can I take out the claw?
And steal the fruit in your hair?

And throw my body inside?
Down where it's dark and it's grey
I love you more than you like
I love your body and mind

I love you more than you like
And it will never escape
My love is everywhere
No it will never escape

Our love is everywhere
I will never escape
