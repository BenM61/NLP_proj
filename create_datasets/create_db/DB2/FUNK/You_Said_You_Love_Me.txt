You said you love me, how come you treat me like you do?
You said you love me, how come you treat me like you do?
You're acting, baby, like you'll find somebody new

I give you all of my money and all my loving too
I give you all my money and all my loving too
Now tell me, baby, tell me, what more can I do?

You got me worried, you got me worried over you
Yes, you got me worried, you got me worried over you
If you don't come back to me, I don't know what I'm gonna do
