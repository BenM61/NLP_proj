You're goin' away, away from me
But here in my heart is a memory
Of the way we met, the way we kissed
The way we fell in love

Oh, the little secrets that we shared
When I was sad, the way you cared
To let me know you'd understand
The way you'd hold my hand

Cherished memories
The things that a fella can't forget
Cherished memories
You're leaving but I love you yet

And now you say that we must part
And even though it breaks my heart
There's one thing you can't take from me
That's my cherished memory

Cherished memories
The things that a fella can't forget
Cherished memories
You're leaving but I love you yet

And now you say that we must part
And even though it breaks my heart
There's one thing you can't take from me
That's my cherished memory

Cherished memory
Cherished memory
