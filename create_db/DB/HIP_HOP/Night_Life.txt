"We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn"
Outsidaz' Night Life
"Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon" 
Outsidaz' Night Life

This rap hell has got skells and mac twelves
Over past gels, crack sales, and blackmails
When your people get clocked it hurts
They quit thuggin, run and join a baptist church
We pushin white see-3's with five TV's
The Outsidaz, its on the Night Life EP

See, Axe the trife type, live the Night Life
Amongst dark alleys and bright lights
A heist might, end it all for the right price
Guess who's back in the house, Axe and the Outs
The wack crap you yappin about get you cracked in the mouth
Want to be president, put me in office
My old ??? ran for European horses
Skiing off cliffs, G'ing off this
Rob banks, clearin Porsches
Me and Nawshis, y'all shoulda been being cautious

My Night Life'in, make cats get liars
When Axe pass the striker, I rapid fire
Nauseous, I'm main coursin', no appetizer
The emcee sacraficer, like a rap messiah
Run up on you, 'specially if that balls sellin
Catch him on stage, get put in a full nelson
This the O-you-T flow, for rappers finito
But'cha girl could get the EP tho'

Outsidaz' Night Life
"What'choo want, what'choo want, what'choo want, what'choo want?"

You corn like the cereal Pops
Get ripped torn over my stereo box
Ya'oufits on like stretch and pops weapons cocked
Get skipped like records, then I'm stretchin ya drop
Out's, we love cream, guns, and bitches
Don't trust fiends, nuns, and snitches
Want funds and riches, bombin sisses
Plus we out for fame like Bonnie and the Pointer sisters

You could feel it
The floors is shakin, wars is wagin'
Across the northern nations
All before daylight savings
The Night Life on location
Gun and smoke risin' like undertoe lake reservations
Under y'all faces, its hip hop John Wayne ?Gaisees?
With laced weed and bass beats
We got grow six, explosives, and overdoses
For you and your associates
While we sweep the coast'es's
Outsidaz transendin
The hip hop world as you know it, is now at an endin'

This rap hell has got skells and mac twelves
Over past gels, crack sales, and blackmails
When your people get clocked it hurts
They quit thuggin, run and join a baptist church
We pushin white see-3's with five TV's
The Outsidaz, its on the Night Life EP

Roll up the crime crime, organized crime dime
Between love and hate there's a fine line
Some people hate how we gettin it, some people ride mine
Cheer for me like they got pom-poms in the nine-nine
We straight rockin it, two G, we lockin shit
Outsidaz' Night Life a gift to the provocative

Where I'm from we miss Biggie
Flip keys, so if you stick with me
Its strictly bright lights and big cities
No dough, its a lotta caffeine, gotta have cream
That's why we run this rap scene like a Carl Lewis track team
D-you'a, representin New Jay-ruz
Pump six holes in you like pool tay-bles

Yeah, we stack dough get wet like tadpoles
Y'all fags though nigga, all pussy like black gold
With the mack fold, punk you ain't gon' do shit
Don't pull it out if you ain't gon' use it
These are the last days before I get cast weight
Its a must, I have to Rock Hard like Cafe
Mother

Outsidaz, Night Life, urban brew
Why try, we murda you
Drive by's in convertible
Lex, stretched like your grandmothers chest
Yes sir, plus higher than your pops blood pressure
