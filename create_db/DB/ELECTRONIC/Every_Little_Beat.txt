Every little beat of your heart
You get a little closer to me
You've never been so happy since I've been around
I don't want to tear your world apart
But that's how it's going to be
Your head's in the sky but I'm on the ground

Words come slow to me
Silence easily
But the world spins round and round
My heart is breaking
The mess I'm making

Every little beat of your heart
You're painting a picture of me
You put me on a pedestal I can't climb down
Every little beat of my own
Takes me further from you
I've run out of heaven and I'm closing down

There's an actor in this town
And he follows you around
He gets his line right every time
But his heart is breaking
He's tired of faking

Every little beat of your heart
You're painting a picture of me
You put me on a pedestal I can't climb down
Every little beat of my own
Takes me further from you
I've run out of heaven and I'm closing down

Every little beat of your heart
You're painting a picture of me
You put me on a pedestal I can't climb down
Every little beat of my own
Takes me further from you
I've run out of heaven and I'm closing down
