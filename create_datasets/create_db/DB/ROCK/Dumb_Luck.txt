Just don't forget
That it's dumb luck that got you here
Don't fool yourself
Misfortunes waiting for the best time to appear
To make it clear
That all the courage and the talent that you had
Was just in dreams
And when you wake up
You will beg to get it back
To get it back

You interest your friends
They will betray you
With the love that's blinding
And then at the end they may admit
That you were missing something
And no one remembers even one word that left your mouth
All the melodies were stolen
From songs by someone else

You're out of time
And inspiration filled with self-pity and fear
And all the dreams that haven't dried up
Are slowly drowning in your tears
In your tears

Just don't forget
That it's dumb luck that got you here
Don't fool yourself
Misfortunes waiting for the best time to appear
To make it clear
That all the courage and the talent that you have
Was just in dreams
And when you wake up
You will beg to get it back
To get it back
