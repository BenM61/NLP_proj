Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?

Ah, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real?
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?

Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone (Can't ever keep from falling apart)

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone (Can't ever keep from falling apart)

Who do you need?
Who do you love? (Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you love?
When you come undone
