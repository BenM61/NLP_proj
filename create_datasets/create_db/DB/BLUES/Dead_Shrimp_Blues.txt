I woke up this mornin' and all my shrimps was dead and gone
I woke up this mornin', ooh, and all my shrimp was dead and gone
I was thinkin' about you, baby, why you hear me weep and moan?

I got dead shrimps here, someone is fishin' in my pond
I got dead shrimps here, ooh, someone fishin' in my pond
I've served my best bait, baby, and I can't do that no harm

Everything I do, babe, you got your mouth stuck out
Hole where I used to fish, you got me posted out
Everything I do, you got your mouth stuck out,
At the hole where I used to fish, baby, you've got me posted out

I got dead shrimps here, someone fishin' in my pond
I got dead shrimps here, someone fishin' in my pond
Catchin' my goggle-eye perches, and they barbequin' the bone

Now you taken my shrimps, baby, you know you turned me down
I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound
You taken my shrimps, ooh, know you turned me down
Babe, I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound
