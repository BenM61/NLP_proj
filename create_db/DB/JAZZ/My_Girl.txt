My girl is violin and candlelight,
My girl is star-shine on a summer night.
Lucky heart to be part of a love like this,
Where every single kiss is a short-cut to heaven.
Heaven knows, she's everything that's dear to me,
She smiles, and cloudy days are clear to me.
Yes, the world is my oyster and I got the pearl,
And I'm happy 'cause I got my girl.
My girl is autumn days and skies of gold,
A fire to dream by, when the night is cold.
Yes, the world is my oyster and I've got the pearl,
I'm happy 'cause I've got my girl.
