Since I've been here or what I think is me
I can't remember how I thought it would be
And this feeling I know so well
You've taken it and that's ok

Baby you should know this time
That every thought you have is mine
Those ideas that I knew so well
You've taken them and that's ok

[Chorus]
That's what I see when I see in your eyes
That's what I see when I see in your eyes
That's what I see when I see in your eyes
I see right in your eyes

Gained my balance you cut me off
I was falling
You're falling too and that's ok

Baby you should know this time
That every thought you have is mine
And this feeling I know so well
You knew it too and that's ok

[Chorus]
