Could it be I'm alive after all that?
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold, cold hands

Look at me no hands, ain't it cool yeah?
Look at her falling out of a taxi cab

If you really want some understanding
You will learn it can be quite frustrating
If you really want to understand it
You will learn it can be quite demanding

You and me trying hard to remember
How we ever started out with our sights so high

Looking down, seeing your yellow fingers
And if you don't understand then at least that's why

If you really want some understanding
You will learn it can be quite frustrating
If you really want to understand it
You will learn it can be quite demanding

Could it be I'm alive after all that?
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold hands

Look at me no hands, ain't it cool yeah?
Look at her falling out of a taxi cab

If you really want some understanding
You will learn it can be quite frustrating
If you really want to understand it
You should talk to Mr Understanding
