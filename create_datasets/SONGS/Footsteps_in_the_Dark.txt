Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I, really care? Hey, hey
Let's talk about the distractions goin' on elsewhere

I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark

My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

I, I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark

Honey, now lets stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
And you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?

Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey
Let's look at what's been happenin' and try to be more aware

I, I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark

Yeah, lets stop walkin' around
Well when there's love lost, lost to be found
Honey, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?

Honey, lets stop walkin' around and around and around
When there's no love to be found
Baby, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?
