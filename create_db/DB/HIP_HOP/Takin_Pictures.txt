Feds takin' pictures on me 
Nigga's still snitchin' on me 
900 for the sip 
Whatchu think I'm smokin' homie? 
Oh whatchu think im jokin' homie? 
Blue rims, yeah da coupes crip walk 
Certified platinum think id rather make hits? 
Between me and you yeah I'd rather flip bricks 
So tell me whats wrong wit' glass pots and a scale 
Holes fo dem bitches like da double XL 

Homie we ball til we fall 
Magic City we da law 
Tryna stay out of reach of the long arms of the law 
I'm calm like snowfall through preliminary hearings 
They indictin' niggas fa boots and some for raqatering 
Prolly got me on the camera while I'm copin' out the car lot 
I'm comin' out the banks, big cribs with the card box 
Its Willie 
My futures bright like a highlighter 
They takin' pictures cause I'm fly like a skydiver

You ain't seen money 
Until you seen me 
220 for Bentley G.T.C. 
And the money ain't a thing like J dupri 
When you ballin' round the country like the major league 
So peace up, A town down 
Tear ya streets up with them A-K rounds 
Now wutchu know about that? 
I know all about that 
3 birds, 3 nights can make a 100 thousands stacks 
And man they got it on camera 
The Feds been watchin' since the boy touched Atlanta 

I'm da biggest mobster to eva' hit da pop charts 
I'm a easy target they know a nigga rock hard 
Get a clean check cut slip it in my account 
Write ? china white a lil' ? will wipe em out 
I ain't wit' the rappin boy, im puttin in the work 
In these niggas wit the rapid legs ? in the shirts 
Get some information for you informants I got the yay
AND I'm sellin' them cheaper than yesterday so whatchu say?

Whether you know me as T.I. or u can call me T.I.P.

And you kno when I b high when im n da V.I.P

Young, rich, and famous wit a pistol you can call me Cheeali 
But I'm da greatest n Atlanta dey be callin' me Ali
