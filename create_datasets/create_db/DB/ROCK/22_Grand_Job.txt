[Chorus: x2]
22 grand job
In the city it's alright
22 grand job
In the city it's alright
22 grand job
In the city that sounds nice,
It's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

Come from the work, looks alright
Put the lattitude right
Different sails lots of tunes
What am I supposed to do?
But he's only 28
No more 22
It's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

[Chorus]

Dancing up street Thursday night
In the city that sounds nice
Looking sharp in my (calise?)
Did we do the same degree?
I've said less to me all week
Got to go on Emily
That's alright, that's alright
If the money is alright

[Chorus]

22 grand job
22 grand job
22 grand job
22 grand job
In the city that sounds nice
