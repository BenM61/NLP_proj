This is not helping me at all 
What you are doing here 
In the name of god and love 
It's the distribution of fear 

Pyramids  healing wires  analysts with fame 
I haven't got your degree 
And I forgot your name 
Pick me up and put me on the ground 

Set me up and spin me all around 
No  you are not the one I wish to see 
This is not helping me at all 
Where did we get this plan? 

That you could give to me 
What I might already have 
Pyramids, healing wires, a musician's fame 
I volunteered you my eyes 

In place of facing me 
Oh Hitler, in a robe of truth 
My emptiness has built your altar 
And I've worshiped myself in you forever 
Until now!
