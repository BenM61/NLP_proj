Love, you're in pieces
There's no one left to lay you down
Or say it's okay
On the worst night, of the worst year
Though we might fall, we'll go out punching

You hit me like a subway train
And I will never be the same
And darling I'll follow you down to the ground
Even when you fall apart, I'll pick up your bloodstained heart
And darling I'll follow you down to the ground

In the gutter
Where you're starless, and blind to dreams
We can dream each other
To a new day
Where the good guys always win
And heaven still means something

You hit me like a subway train
And I will never be the same
And darling I'll follow you down to the ground
Even when you fall apart, I'll pick up your bloodstained heart
And darling I'll follow you down to the ground

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Love, when you're in pieces
There's no one left to dry your eyes

You hit me like a subway train
And I will never be the same
Oh darling I'll follow you down to the ground
Even when you fall apart, I'll pick up your bloodstained heart
Ooh darling I'll follow you down to the ground, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
