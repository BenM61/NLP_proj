My baby wakes in the deep of the night
She doesn't need it
But she says it's all right
My baby digs it, just a Rollin' away

My baby gives it up every day
My baby gives it, she gives it away
My baby gives it up every day
My baby She just gives it away

When you're alone in some city hotel
You can get company by ringing a bell
You might go pick up a girl
On the street

But my baby gives it up totally free
My baby's counting' on, 'cause you alone
My baby's brother never break a your arm
My baby ha, ha, I love her

She's cheep
Ooh yeah
My baby
My baby

My baby
My baby
My baby

You better buy yourself an new pair of shoes
And walk for a lifetime on that bad news
You better buy an electric guitar
There's no better way to beat the blues, I beat 'em

My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby

My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby

She give it way, every day, every way
My baby just gives it away

My baby's momma is a singular girl
She brought up her daughter and brought her up well
I'm breathing no more
'Cause she took it away

My baby gives it up every day
My baby gives it
She gives it away
My baby gives it up every day

My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby

My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby

My baby
My baby

How I love her, yeah
My baby, my baby, she just gives it away
My baby, my baby, she just gives it away
My baby, my baby, gives it away

Let me tell you, my baby, she just give it away
My baby, every day
My baby gives it up every day
My baby give it
Just gives it away
