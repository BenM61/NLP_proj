How we go from friends, to lovers
How we go from friends, to lovers, tell me that
How we go from friends, to lovers
You kiss me first and I discover
And from now, there is no other

Started as friends, but now my heart says different
All week and all day long we kick it
How did we go from there to here?

Now you can say what you want, but I know you feel it
Truth be told, you and me, we'd kill it
Now I'm really tryna find my way to you baby yeah

When I reach out for your hand, girl you'll be right there
Oh, and baby, that's all I know I am

I'm almost there
Close to your heart, baby
I'm almost there
I was never too far from it
I'm almost there
I'm almost right where I wanna be, yeah
I'm almost there, almost, almost there

Whatever you ask, then you know I'm with it
If I ain't home then I'm with you chillin'
How did we go from there to here?
And my homies say 'Yo, homeboy, you trippin'
But they ain't the ones that gon' love u different
Girl I really tryna find my way to you baby

When I reach out for your hand
Girl you'll be right there (I know you will be there)
Oh, and baby, that's all I know I am

I'm almost there
Close to your heart, baby
I'm almost there
I was never too far from it
I'm almost there
I'm almost right where I wanna be, yeah
I'm almost there, almost, almost there

Hey, cause shawty you're my baby
We done been through thick, and thin in the rain together
And girl, I'd be crazy to not have you around
And let another man just get ya
Oh girl, call me your heart reader
I can read the pages of your heart
And baby, step by step I'm a climb your stairs
Don't worry baby
Baby, I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there, almost

Almost there
I'm almost right where I wanna be, yeah
I'm almost there, almost, almost there
I'm almost there
Straight to your heart, baby
I'm almost there
I was never too far from it all
I'm almost there
I'm almost right where I wanna be
I'm almost there, almost, almost there
