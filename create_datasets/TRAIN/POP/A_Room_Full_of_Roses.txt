(Roses, roses)
If I sent a rose to you for every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white for every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

If you'd took the petals and tore 'em all apart
You'd be tearing half the roses just the way you tore my heart
And if some day you're feeling blue you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you

You'd have a room full of roses

You'd have a room full of roses

If you took all the petals and you tore 'em all apart
You'd be tearing half the roses just the way you tore my heart
And if some day you're feeling blue you could send some roses too
But I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you
