I was a paperboy back when there was paperboys
But stores and record shops
I made the conver but I can't pay the bank
What's more important is building a brand

Everybody clap your hands for the song and dance man
Everybody clap your hands for the song and dance man

There's a handful of pennies
Kickstart some things
If you can tweet something brilliant
You got a market in plan
Tingling and jingling
Living in a van
If we can just sell some t-shirts
We could pay for the gas

Everybody clap your hands for the song and dance man
Everybody clap your hands for the song and dance man
Everybody clap your hands, I'm a song and dance man

Man of the future has swallowed the past
There's one step forward and two steps back

Everybody clap your hands for the song and dance man
Everybody clap your hands for the song and dance man
Everybody clap your hands, I'm a song and dance man
Everybody clap your hands for the song and dance man

You gotta do what you can
When you're the song and dance man
