Lately, you don't even talk to me
And you don't need me, like you used to do
The only never ever was for me
I won't always hold my head up high

Oh, oh, I don't know why
Oh, oh, why don't you mind?
Oh, oh, I don't know why
Oh, oh, you must be blind

Ten miles from you and all I can do
Is wonder how we'll pull it through
Ten miles from you, it shouldn't be true
I don't know how we'll pull it through

I was, never, warned to be deceived
But with you, oh, I lose my mind

Oh, oh, I don't know why
Oh, oh, I lost my pride
Oh, oh, I don't now why
Oh, oh, you blow my mind

Ten miles from you and all I can do
Is wonder how we'll pull it through
Ten miles from you, it shouldn't be true
I don't know how we'll pull it through

Ten miles from you and all I can do
Is wonder how we'll pull it through
Ten miles from you, it shouldn't be true
I don't know how we'll pull it through

Ten miles from you and all I can do
Is wonder how we'll pull it through
Ten miles from you, it shouldn't be true
I don't know how we'll pull it through
