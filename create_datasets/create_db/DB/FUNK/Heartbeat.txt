When the whole world's got the wrong idea
Even though I made myself clear
In the past
I've been misunderstood
And haven't handled it well
The way I know that I could
But things are different now
Since I stopped caring
I don't worry about
What people saying
'Cause there's no way that I
Could stop them thinking
What they're thinking

I'm just listening to my heartbeat
To the tune
I've been singing from the start
Since I learned the truth
I gotta make my own decisions
'Bout what to do
Can't be changing up the rhythm
Just for you

When it looks like I've lost my way
Even though I'm saying I'm okay
Let me be
There's nothing no one can do
When all odds are stacked against me
My true colours shine through
The fog of deception
That's been clouding your perception
Of who I am
I'm ready for rejection
I'm not begging for acceptance

I'm just listening to my heartbeat
To the tune
I've been singing from the start
Since I learned the truth
I gotta make my own decisions
'Bout what to do
Can't be changing up the rhythm
Just for you
I'm just listening to my heartbeat
To the tune
I've been singing from the start
Since I learned the truth
I gotta make my own decisions
'Bout what to do
Can't be changing up the rhythm
Just for you

Yeah I did it just to prove 'em wrong
'Cause they said I'd never make anything of myself
I said I'd do it all along
Just kept on following my heartbeat and nothing else

I'm just listening to my heartbeat
To the tune
I've been singing from the start
Since I learned the truth
I gotta make my own decisions
'Bout what to do
Can't be changing up the rhythm
Just for you
I'm just listening to my heartbeat
To the tune
I've been singing from the start
Since I learned the truth
I gotta make my own decisions
'Bout what to do
Can't be changing up the rhythm
Just for you

I'm just listening to my heartbeat
I'm just following my heartbeat
I'm just listening to my heartbeat
I'm just following my heartbeat, yeah
