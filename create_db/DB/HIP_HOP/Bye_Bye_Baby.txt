At night  I can't seem to get no sleep  
Addicted to Indo and Hennessy  
I'm stressed on  got my vest on  
Let's hit the streets  time to put the vest on  
Friday night  and I'm chillin' with my baby 
In a black 600 Lorenzos on it  
And I'm all up on them thighs smokin' on doja  
So I guess I didn't see the niggas behind me ... 
We at the stoplight (get out yo car nigga)  
Before I exit (they start the pullin' triggas), 
So now I'm duckin' and I'm divin', 
Tryin' to survive and 
All I can hear is gunshots and cryin', 
In an instant (looks like the cryin' stopped) 
When I looked at my Benz, all my windows bucked out, 
I see my girlfriend layin' on the asphalt 
Bleedin' lookin' dead at me, 
And all I can say is ... 

[Chorus]
Bye bye, baby, I can't believe it, 
These niggas just shot my baby, 
The only thing that make me go crazy, 
Somebody gonna feel my .380, 
My, my baby, won't live to see it, 
It's gonna be murder, I guarantee it, 
They already had comin' 'fore they step into me, 
But y'all shouldn't have fucked with my baby  

Now I met her at the Beverly, 
As she was like the bombest, 
She had me goin', nigga I'm goin' be honest, 
She was stacked with big bags behind her, 
Matter of fact, she kinda looked a little like Tyra, 
All the niggas used to stop when they seen her, 
Dressed in black, laid back demeanor, Gone now 
And I'm all upset, 
I'm like a grown child, I want my baby back, 
But now it's on, pal 
All things behind us, 
I want to take you where no one can find ya, mind ya, 
I'm about to go crazy 
Gimme my baby ,Gimme my baby ... 

[Chorus]

Now I try not to think 
About all the things we did together, 
We made the bedroom walls 
Shake from in the living room, 
I was so infatuated with everythin' you do, 
Somebody took you away from me with a shell or two, 
And I'm gonna ride 'cause that's what the hell I do, 
Gonna be some madness, girl, I'm tellin' you, 
This shell's for you, what they want to do ... 

[Chorus: x4]
