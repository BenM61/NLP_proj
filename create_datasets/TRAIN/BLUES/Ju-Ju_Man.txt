I was just 16 years old,
And Maggie's hair was black as coal.
And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.
Now, her eyes were bright as the stars up above.

Every word Maggie spoke was love.
And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.
Falling in love again,
Falling in love again.

We don't care if we don't ever do
Fall back out again!
Time went on and my love it got stronger.
Me and Maggie couldn't wait any longer.

We had to go to town right away to see the Ju Ju Man.
I said, "Please please tell me, Mr. Ju Ju Man,
Read the cards that you've got in your hand.
I've got to make a plan for me and my Maggie love."

Falling in love again,
Falling in love again.
We don't care if we don't ever do
Fall back out again!

Maggie's Mama, she'd like to hang me.
Maggie's Pa, now, I know he'd like to chain me,
Cause he don't understand a word of what I said.
I said, "Please, Mr. Ju Ju Man,

Will I be holding Maggie's hand
When the robin sings again in the Spring, next June?"
Falling in love again,
Falling in love again.

We don't care if we don't ever do
Fall back out again!
