If you happen to read this, Rose was born
Child actress, on the fifth day of the snow
Be good or be gone
Be good or be, be gone

The range is staggering, movement and timing
Frame by frame it did unfold
Be good or be gone
Be good or be, be gone

I'll read to you on Saturdays, museum has closed down
Sell all your things at the end of the drive
Be good or be gone
Be good or be, be gone

I have become an aerial view
Of a coastal town that you once knew
Be good or be gone
Be good or be, be gone
