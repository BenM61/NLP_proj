I went to the party
It's never what it seems
I went to the party
Ya know what I mean?
I want to the party
Just me, a lonely MC
You can pop the cork,
Said you can twist the cap
I'm at this party
And I'm here to rap!

I went to the party, but I couldn't get in
I asked the bouncer if he knew my girl Hesta Prynn
He said, "I know that girl, are you in that band?"
I said, "I think I'm on the list, could you stamp my hand?"

He said, "Step inside girl, you look alright
Hold up - do you satisfy the minimum height?
You gotta be this tall to ride tonight"
I said, "I might be short, but I can still party
I can shake it on the floor like Melissa Alardi!"

I went to the party, but I'll never go back, yo
The speakers were shitty and the jams were whack
This girl at the bar said, "Northern who?"
I said, "It's Northern State, haven't you heard of my crew?

Yo we rock the stage anyway we want,
Hell I'll rock this party like a debutante
Riverdale's too Kiwanis
True party people want us, yo
Keep it real, I gotta break the seal

Close my eyes as I leave the house (close my eyes and i)
And then I'm at the party and I'm fillin out (im at the party and i)
And then I'm watchin my worries as they floatin by (watch all my worries just)
It's just, there they go, slippin away now (slip away)

It's alright if you're feelin bad (it's alright ??)
And then you're at the party and you feel so glad (im at the party and i)
And you wanna know if it's time to work or play (just don't know if)
It's just - should I go or should I stay now? (i should go or stay)

Yo, I called you
Yo, I didn't get it
I didn't hear my cell,
Didn't ring, so don't sweat it!

I went to the party
It's never what it seems
I went to the party
Ya know what I mean?
I want to the party
Just me, a lonely MC
You can pop the cork,
Said you can twist the cap
I'm at this party
And I'm here to rap!

I went to the party, a lonely MC
All the way from Avenue D
Lookin for Katie Cassidy
I noticed this guy was starin at me

He said, "Hi," I said, "Hi, do I know you?"
He said, "Yeah, don't you run in that girl rap group?"
Uh huh ho, you're the one with that liberal arts
Academic, literary kinda name, right?

I said, "Like Gorgeous George, my name is Hideous Hesta
Rhyme with pizazz, and I am the masta
Shout out to Cynthia plasta casta
Speed up the tempo and I'll go faster!"

Uhn! You wanna know what it's about?
I like to party but I never go out
Mailin' and I'm maxin', callin' and I'm faxin'
I need some more relaxin', 'cause my job is real taxin'!

I got the perfect party in my mind
Y'all out on the floor, relax and unwind
And the people at the party be the NSP
No drama at the door and the drinks are free!

Close my eyes as I leave the house (close my eyes and i)
And then I'm at the party and I'm fillin out (im at the party and i)
And then I'm watchin my worries as they floatin by (watch all my worries just)
It's just, there they go, slippin away now (slip away)

It's alright if you're feelin bad (it's alright ??)
And then you're at the party and you feel so glad (im at the party and i)
And you wanna know if it's time to work or play (just don't know if)
It's just - should I go or should I stay now? (i should go or stay)

Yo, ya know it
Yo, like Dolly said it
Workin nine to five'll
Make you crazy if you let it!

I went to the party
It's never what it seems
I went to the party
Ya know what I mean?
I want to the party
Just me, a lonely MC
You can pop the cork,
Said you can twist the cap
I'm at this party
And I'm here to rap!
