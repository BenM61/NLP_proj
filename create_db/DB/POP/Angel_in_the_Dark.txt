Angel
Of
My heart
Come back to me
Angel
Whoa 
In the dark
So I can see
’Cause I can’t live no more
Without an angel
Of love, so if you hear 

Come back to me, come back
Come back to me, come back
Answer my prayer
Come back to me, come back
Come back to me, come back
Answer my prayer

Angel
Hear my song
Because the night’s so long
Come back to me
I don’t know how
I don’t know where
I’ll be dreamin’ and on my feet
Again
'Cause I can’t laugh no more
Without an angel
So if you’re there

Come back to me, come back
Come back to me, come back
Answer my prayer
Come back to me, come back
Come back to me, come back
Answer my prayer

Answer my prayer
I can’t laugh no more
Without an angel
So if you’re there

Come back to me, come back
Come back to me, come back
Answer my prayer
Answer

Come back to me, come back
Come back to me, come back
Answer my prayer

Come back to me, come back
Come back to me, come back
