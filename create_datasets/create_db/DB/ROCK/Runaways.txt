Only a quitter,
Would let it go,
I'm your fool in a one-man show,
I was so bitter,
'Til you came along,
You set my sails when the tide was low,

We're going down this road,
With tears in our rear view mirror,
Far from home,
But in the dark you'll know,
With me you've got nothing to fear,

So let's run away
They will have to find another heart to break,
Why don't we just run away,
Never turn around, no matter what they say,
We'll find our way,
When the sun goes down,
On this town,
There'll be no one left but us,
Just like run-aways,
They will have to find some other hearts to break, hearts to break

Out in the distance,
Lost in the fold,
We trace our steps to a great unknown,
Bury our toes,
Where the ocean meets the sand,
We hide ourselves right where we stand,

We're going down this road,
With tears in our rear view mirror,
Far from home,
But in the dark you know,
With me you've got nothing to fear,

So let's run away
They will have to find another heart to break,
Why don't we just run away,
Never turn around, no matter what they say,
We'll find our way,
When the sun goes down,
On this town,
There'll be no one left but us,
Just like run-aways,
They will have to find some other hearts to break, hearts to break

They won't catch us in the dark,
Roll like thunder, burn like stars,

They won't catch us in the dark,
Roll like thunder, burn like stars,

Run away,
They will have to find another heart to break,
Heart to break

So let's run away
They will have to find another heart to break,
Why don't we just run away,
Never turn around, no matter what they say,
We'll find our way,
When the sun goes down,
On this town,
There'll be no one left but us,
Just like run-aways,
They will have to find some other hearts to break, hearts to break
