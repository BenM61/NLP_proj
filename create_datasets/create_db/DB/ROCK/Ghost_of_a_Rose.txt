The valley green was so serene
In the middle ran a stream so blue
A maiden fair, in despair
Once had met her true love there and she told him

She would say
"Promise me, when you see
A white rose you'll think of me
I love you so, never let go
I will be your ghost of a rose"

Her eyes believed in mysteries
She would lay amongst the leaves of amber
Her spirit wild, heart of a child
Yet gentle still and quiet and mild and he loved her

When she would say
"Promise me, when you see
A white rose you'll think of me
I love you so, never let go
I will be your ghost of a rose"

Ghost of a rose

When all was done, she turned to run
Dancing to the setting sun as he watched her
And ever more he thought he saw
A glimpse of her upon the moors forever

He'd hear her say
"Promise me, when you see
A white rose you'll think of me
I love you so, never let go
I will be your ghost of a rose"

Promise me, when you see
A white rose you'll think of me
I love you so, never let go
I will be your ghost of a rose

Ghost of a rose
