The cold has passed, the sun is shining
We're digging holes, we're gold heart mining
So here we stand, without a plan
The dream is here, surpass your fear

I said hey, you're a thousand miles away
I wish you weren't
I know we're set to overload
Your heart and my mind, it will explode again

The secret's out, your feet are singing
With colored face, tonight you're winning
So here we stand, without a plan

I said hey, you're a thousand miles away
I wish you weren't
I know we're set to overload
Your heart and my mind, it will explode again

Again
Again
Again

I said hey, you're a thousand miles away
I wish you weren't
I know we're set to overload
Your heart and my mind, it will explode

My friend, we can start again
Dreamers till the end
I know we're set to overload
Your heart and my mind, it will explode again
