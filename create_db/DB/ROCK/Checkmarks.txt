So there you are, and here I stand,
As far as I remember you weren't half bad.
Your bedroom behavior was never more then checkmarks on bedposts.
For I remember we never had.

[Bridge:]
You get me out of the rain, you get me out of my clothes.
You hope I don't make a sound, you hope that nobody knows.
You get me out of the rain, you get me out of my clothes.
You hope I don't make a sound, you hope that no one...

[Chorus:]
So suck your so called pity down.
Hey, that's not so bad, is it?
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
and don't forget to take deep breaths.
So suck your so called pity down.
Hey, that's not so bad, is it?
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
and don't forget to take deep breaths.

[Chorus]

So don't explain cause I know exactly what your going to say.
Big words, recycled phrases, and the bittersweet taste of other boys on your lips.
So now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all. 
So now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all. 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Do you miss looking up from the floor at my face on a stage in a crowded room? 
Well it's not the same. 
I bet you're still a sucker for those famous faces. 
Downtown, looking down, down, looking over the crowd, I hope you're out there, look at me now. 
Well it's not the same. 
Just look at how we've changed.

[Chorus]
