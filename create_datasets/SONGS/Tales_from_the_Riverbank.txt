Bring you a tale from the pastel fields
Where we ran when we were young
This is a tale from the water meadows
Trying to spread some hope into your heart

It's mixed with happiness, it's mixed with tears
Both life and death are carried in this stream
That open space, you could run for miles
Now you don't get so many to the pound

True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to, that I'll always run to
Won't you join me by the riverbank?

Paradise found down by the still waters
Joined in the race to the rainbow's end
No fears, no worries just a golden country
Woke at sunrise, went home at sunset

Now life is so critical, life is too cynical
We lose our innocence, we lose our very soul

True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to, that I'll always run to
True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia

But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to, that I'll always run to
Won't you join me by the riverbank?
Come on and join me by the riverbank
