I never knew that a kid like me
Could take his mic around the world and flash the big S.D.
And rock the masses, from Madrid to Calabassas
Tijuana, Mexico, bootleg demos in Tokyo
They know me though, 'cause I be puttin' in work
Commit my life to rebirth, well respected, 'cause that's my word
I'm sure you heard, about a new sound going around
She might have left my hood, but she was born in my town

You didn't know, thought we was new on the scene
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I know you know, I see you smiling at me
Well, it's alright! It's alright!

Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the Lasal
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
How you like me now?

We rep. the South, so what you talking about
I'm not running off my mouth, I know this without a doubt
Cause if you know these streets, then these streets know you
When it's time to handle business, then you know what to do
Me and my crew, we stay true, old school or new
Many were called, but the chosen are few
We rise to the top, what you want? Just in case you forgot
Rush the stage, grab my mic, show me what you got

You didn't know, thought we was new on the scene
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I know you know, I see you smiling at me
Well, it's alright! It's alright!

Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the Lasal
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
How you like me now?

Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the Lasal
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
How you like me now?

You didn't know, thought we was new on the scene
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I know you know, I see you smiling at me
Well, it's alright! It's alright!

You didn't know, thought we was new on the scene
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I know you know, I see you smiling at me
Well, it's alright! It's alright!

Is that all you got?
I'll take your best shot.
