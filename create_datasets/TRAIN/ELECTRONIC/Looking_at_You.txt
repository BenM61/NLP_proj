I was looking for you
Now I'm looking at you

When I come home at night
I look into the hallway mirror
and I'm looking at you
I can't escape your face
I see reflections in the water,
and I'm looking at you

But still I try
to get by
and I know I'll die
Looking at you

There is a hollow in the bed
Where you lie, slept, I took a picture
Are you laughing at me?
I scratched your records, dear
and threw them in the nearest river
Are you laughing at me?

Still I try
to get by
and I know I'll die
looking at you

Now I hear laughter
and no more pain inside
But sometimes I wonder,
whose blind eye's gazing at you?

If fame and fortune come,
I'll be looking forward to the future
And I'll be waiting for you
Somewhere a dizzy blonde
is staring into her cold coffee,
and she's looking at you

Still I try
to get by
and I know I'll die
looking at you

Still I try
to put you out of mind
but I know I'll die
looking at you
