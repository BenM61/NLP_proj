I read your mind like an open book
You lost the fire in your eyes
You turn to me with a different look
And then it's raining
looks like it's raining

Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling

Something is wrong as I hold you near
Somebody else holds your heart, yeah
You talk to me with your eyes in tears
And then it's raining
feels like it's raining

Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling (whoo oh)
Oh no, tears are falling (whoo oh)
I saw you cry

And now it's raining (yeah)
Looks like it's raining (someone stole your heart)
And now it's raining
feels like it's raining

Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling (whoo oh)
Oh no, tears are falling (someone stole your heart)
Oh no, tears are falling (they're falling from your eyes)
Oh no, tears are falling (no no, falling from your eyes)
Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, no, falling, oh, (they're falling from your eyes)
Oh no, tears are falling
