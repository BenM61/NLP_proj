Dear dream of mine
Am I wasting time
Thinking that you
Will be my dream come true
Dear dream I guess
If the answer is yes
What must I do
If I'm to get to you
It's not as though I haven't tried hard
Even had myself barred
From taking a rest
But like a lot of things in life
When your down
Nothing comes round
That isn't a mess
Dear dream I pray
That you will come my way
Give me a clue
Of how to get to
Of how to get to
Of how to get to you
[Solo]
You have no idea what its like to be told
Get out of clothes
You look too bizarre
The list of don't call us
And we won't call you
Has in my view
Become too Large
Dear dream of mine
Am I wasting my time
Thinking that you
Will be my dream come
Will be my dream come
Will be my dream come true
And he can't wait another day
Sometimes he thinks he'll go insane
How can he be so close and yet very far
Is there something that he should know
Some place maybe he can go to
In search of you
Dear dream of mine
Am I wasting my time
Thinking that you
Will be my dream come
Will be my dream come
Will be my dream come true
