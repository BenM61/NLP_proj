Tell me which way the wind blows
And of the song it sings
Tell me where did the time go n'
For who the bells ring
Baby, days are so empty now
No promises, no pain
I guess, I guess I realized
I overstayed my day

And I wonder now as I write this down
How it's gonna sound when I'm old
Did I learn to fly. Did I reach the sky
Am I goin' underground

But I know, I know
I can tell you pretty darlin'
What it means to be alone
I know, I know
I can tell you little darlin'
It's no good to be alone

Sometimes as the rain comes down
I feel it wash away my fears
And sometimes when the rain comes down
It's another veil of tears
And I wonder if I missed a turn
On the long and winding road
Did I lose my eyes. Did my radar die
Is it time to crash and burn
But I know, I know
I can tell you without lyin'
I don't want to be alone

And I know, I know
I know the sky is cryin'
And I don't want to be alone
And if I find you out there in the streets
Will you know me the moment our eyes meet
Will you find me. Will I know you
And I wonder if I missed a turn
On the long and winding road
Did I lose my eyes. Did my radar die
Am I gonna crash and burn

And I know, I know
I can tell you pretty darlin'
I don't want to be alone
I know, I know
I know the sky is cryin'
And I don't want to be alone
