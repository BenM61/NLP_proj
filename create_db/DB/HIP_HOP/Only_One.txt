Oh girl, you're the only one I'v ever loved
 And I want to share my life with you girl
 Never had it feel so right

 Thinking back when we were always on the phone
 It felt so good
 To think I'd never be alone

 Well you went your way baby, I went mine
 But I knew in time, I'd find you
 The thought of lovin' you would carry on
 And it kept me strong
 But here's where you belong

 Oh girl, you're the only one I'v ever loved
 And I want to share my life with you girl
 Never had it feel so right

 And it's all because of...
 You were there with a smile to keep me warm
 Girl losing you would leave me with a heart so torn
 Now what I'd give, to make you mine all mine
 For the longest time, ooh baby I
 I want to hold you baby endlessly
 You'll see the best in me
 Believe me you're the one

 Oh girl, you're the only one I've ever loved
 And I want to share my life with you girl
 Never had it feel so right
 X2

 Break it down
 All night long you got me going on
 All night long
 All night long you got me going on
 All night long

 Oh girl, you're the only one I'v ever loved
 And I want to share my life with you girl
 Never had it feel so right

 And I want to be good to you
 And I want to give you all my love
 And I want to touch you baby there

 Oh girl, you're the only one I've ever loved
 And I want to share my life with you girl
 Never had it feel so right
