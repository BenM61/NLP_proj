Hey
How did you make it
Make me go out of my mind?
Poisoned arrows
Burning fever
Strings in my heart.
Now my pulse is racing
Temperature is rising high

Poisoned arrows
Burning forever
Strings in my heart.

Symptoms of true love take my breath away

Make me shake

I cannot get enough of your kisses
Babe
Tender touch

The symptoms of true love.

I know what the cure is
I know a thing to take away
All the headache
All the heartache
All of my pain.
Give me all your lovin
Care for me all night and day

Do it quickly and I will be in recovery.

Symptoms of true love take my breath away

Put me on my knees night and day
I'm ready for take-off

Come and fly with me
Don't delay the symptoms of true love!

Symptoms of true love take my breath away

Symptoms of true love take my breath away

Put me on my knees night and day
The symptoms of true love

Come and fly with me
Don't delay the symptoms of true love.
Take my breath away
Baby
Oh
Darlin'
Take my breath away!
