Hear a haunting chant
Lying in the northern wind
As the sky turns black
Clouds of melancholy
Rape the beams
Of a devoid dying sun
And the distant fog approaches

Coven of forgotten delight
Hear the pride of a northern storm
Triumphant sight on a northern sky

Where the days are dark
And night the same
Moonlight drank the blood
Of a thousand pagan men

It took ten times a hundred years
Before the king on the northern throne
Was brought tales of the crucified one

Coven of renewed delight;
A thousand years have passed since then  
Years of lost pride and lust

Souls of blasphemy,
Hear a haunting chant  

We are a blaze in the northern sky
The next thousand years are ours
