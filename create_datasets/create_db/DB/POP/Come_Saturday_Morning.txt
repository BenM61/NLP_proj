Come Saturday morning
I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend till the end of the day
Just I and my friend

We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

You know what the trouble is?
Trouble is that probably all the good things in life
Take place in no more than a minute

I mean all I did, I, I bet you
At the end of seventy years should you lose someone
You can sit down, you can figure the whole thing out

You spent nineteen years sleepin'
You spent five years goin' to the bathroom
You spent thirty-five years doin'
Some kinda work you absolutely hated

Spent seven thousand eight hundred and
Fifty-three minutes blinkin' your eyes
And added to that, you got that one minute of good things
Then one day you wonder whether you're minute's up

And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone
