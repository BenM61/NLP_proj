Look at me, look at you, nothing to say
Everything I've owned, you've taken away
All I ever wanted was to get by
Now you wanna know the reason why

Don't believe in fate, I believe in bad luck
All the stories told are so trumped up
Wanna know why i'm so fucked up
Now you wanna know the reason why?

RAGE

RAGE 

Every waking moment has this strain on me
Can't unlock these secrets if I have no key
When I go blow it up you'll know it's my time
Now you wanna know the reason why?

Don't believe in fate, I believe in bad luck
All the stories told are so trumped up
Wanna know why i'm so fucked up
Now you wanna know the reason why?

RAGE
