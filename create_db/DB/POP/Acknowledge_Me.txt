Hey! 

Say baby, what you waitin' on? 
For you, uh, ain't no other fish in the sea 
What you waitin' on? 
Acknowledge me 

Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore 
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here 4ever more 
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend 
I can make you happy baby, over and over again 

Saw you at the party, you were lookin' so fly 
Everybody wanted your number, you wanted mine 
You came right up to me in one wink of an eye 
You told me that you think of me both day and night and that is why 

I've got to know how can you give your body to another 
When your mind is here with me? 
You need a friend much more than a lover 
That's all I ever said I wanted to be 

Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore (No baby) 
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more 
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend (Oh baby) 
I can make you happy baby, over and over again 

I'm waitin' for the phone call, but it just don't ring 
I'm lookin' for a letter or a sign from heaven or anything 
Everyday that goes by is another day I want you more 
I'd give a million dollars to see you baby standin' at my door 

I'll lay you down and tell you stories 
About the way that we could be 
And when you're ready to feel the glory (Feel the glory) 
I will only want to love you when it's somethin' that you need 

Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore (No baby) 
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more 
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend (Oh baby) 
I can make you happy baby, over and over again 

Not that you care for a silly rhyme frontin' an old clich√© (Yeah, yeah) 
But look at me baby, what can I say? 
There ain't another fish in the sea (Yeah) 
I could be singin' a song any style, any way 
Ain't nothin' but a trick to me (Blow) 
But I'm gonna blow this horn until you're on your knees 
Beggin' me please, please, please 
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme love I can count on 
Gimme, gimme body I can't go without 
Uh, slaves for one another (Hey!) 
Yeah baby, that's what I do believe I am talkin' about 
So let me know how you want to go? (Yeah) 
You want to get with that or this? (Yeah) 
Uh, acknowledge me, baby 
You got to or you can kiss 

How can you give your body to another? (How can you, baby?) 
When your mind is here with me (It's here with me) 
You need a friend much more than a lover (You need a friend) 
That's all I ever said I wanted to be 
(That's all I ever, ever want to be baby) 
(Acknowledge me, me, me, oh yeah!) 
Acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge me 

Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore (No baby) 
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more 
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend 
I can make you happy baby, over and over again 
(And over again, yeah) 

Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore (Don't ya dog me girl) 
(I'll be here, I'll be here to wipe away your tears) 
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend 
(Oh, don't ya worry about a thing) 
I can make you happy baby, over and over again (Oh, yeah) 

Come on pretty baby, sit your butt on the chair there 
And let me run a gender in and out of your hair fair 
A gender for the morning, noon and night, so prepare there 
You could come alone or tell a friend, I don't care bear 

This a funky party so you need to be open 
Givin' up all I need so I don't need to be hopin' 
And even if we're dealin' with that time of the month 
It's fourth and goal and I ain't about to punt 
'Cause as soon as you be strollin' in your Lagerfeld blazer
 
You need to know how many ways a brother can praise ya 
To bad four hell, to good to let heaven raise ya 
And if you want to see my dream, I need you for days and days 
Baby doll, can you get the hell away 
From that thing you call a man and then we can play 
The kind of music that'll make your big butt sway 
To the back, to the forth 

When it's all said a better brother should be more 
Thank the Lord 
Huh, four a body like that, titties swingin' like a door 
Gimme to times just to thank my Savior 
Girl, what can I say, you got the crazy flavor 
I'm givin' you plenty propers so you got to score 
The only one that's gonna make you holler for more 
Like a whore, I'm yours 
Acknowledge me, baby, what are you waiting for? 

Welcome, this is where I live
This is where I dream my dreams 
Tonight we'll make love until the world stops turning 
You're small but very strong, you move like a cat
