Walking down that same old street
I feel the same emotions
Stop in where we used to meet
To share our endless hoping

The ghosts here, they don't care
This place is dead and lifeless
What was it, you asked me
Somehow I can't recall

But I remember how it used to be
Before we walked away
The world is not a match for you and me
No matter what we used to say
If only we were smart enough to see
That we were truly free
Back in the day

Seeking what cannot be found
A fading echo of you
Flashing pictures with no sound
My only image of you

The twilight has questions
And whispers vague suggestions
A curtain is falling
Obscuring old connections

I remember how it used to be
Before we walked away
The world is not a match for you and me
No matter what we used to say
If only we were smart enough to see
That we were truly free
Back in the day
