Waited for you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sittin' Miss Alone
We should've did this already

Said I got an e-mail today
Kinda thought that you forgot about me
So I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you ? I get lonely

Baby I could really get to know you
Take my time to show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely

Take me to another place
Where I'll be into space
Just you and me wit no rules
Just like you ? I get lonely too

Just like you -- I get lonely too

Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't want to come on strong
?Cause too many people want to get me
But a girl will do what I gotta do
Just like you -- I get lonely

Baby I could really get to know you
Take my time to show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely

Take me to another place
Where I'll be into space
Just you and me wit no rules
Just like you ? I get lonely too

Just like you -- I get lonely too

Everyday I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait ?til the day I see ya
Know that you just might be the one for me

Everyday I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait ?til the day I see ya
Know that you just might be the one I need
