'Cause you make it feel
Make it feel like the first time feelin'
'Cause you make it feel like the first time
Like the first time, yeah

I never want to see you cry
Unless the tears are joy in your eyes
Like the first time we made love
And I said I love you

I never want to say good bye
You got to know my heart won't lie
The closer I get to you
I wanna have sex with you the whole night through

'Cause you give me all your lovin', baby
Girl, you're blowin' my mind
You don't need to hurry, relax, unwind
Give me all your lovin', baby
Girl, you're blowin' my mind

It feels like the first time
You make it feel like the first time
Feel like the first time
You make it feel like the first time
Feel like the first time

Can you come home with me tonight?
Can you do the thing you know I like?
Can you love me down from head to toe?
Wherever you lead me I will follow

Can you be sure to let me know?
I'm movin' too fast, I'm movin' too slow
I'm gonna give my very best
'Cause you deserve my all, nothing less

I know that you, give me all your lovin', baby
Girl you're blowin' my mind
You don't need to hurry, relax, unwind
Give me all your lovin', baby
Girl you're blowin' my mind

It feels like the first time
You make it feel like the first time
Feel like the first time
You make it feel like the first time
Feel like the first time

Give me all your love, give me all your love
Girl you're blowin' my mind just like that first night
Give me all your love

Give me all your love
Save you're time, do it right, don't need to hurry
Don't need to hurry, I'm going to give you my all

You make it, make it feel
Make it real, give me all your lovin'
Give me all your love, take your time
Do it right, you make it feel

You make it feel like the first time
Every time we make love
