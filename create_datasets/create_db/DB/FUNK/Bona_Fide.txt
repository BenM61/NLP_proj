I love you more today than I did yesterday
And that's more than a lot of couples can say.
And when my friends try to play to keep us apart
Its not possible cause we can never be torn apart.

Feeling that will never change
I want our relationship to be like the one in the old days.
Some folks say it could not be done 
But I hold my hand up and just walk on by.
