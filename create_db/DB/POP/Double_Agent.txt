What
What
What do you see when you see me?
You see my long blond hair and the particular way
That my lips are shaped
That my body takes when you talk to me
What do you know when you know me?
Don't file me under categories, you're deceived
You don't know me
I'm not only a surface, a country
What you don't know about me is, I'm a

[Chorus]
Double agent on my mama's side
The shit I hear you say just blows my mind
Every time, recognize
Though who I am to you is not a lie
I don't have to volunteer and say
That I was born a particular way
I got no uniform
I'm camouflaged in any light
Obviously you can't tell
I'm a double agent on my mama's side

And what do you hear when you hear me?
I hear you crank up Jay-Z, it's your favorite jam
And you talk with your hands like an MC
Betcha never get stopped by the police
You never ask me about me (no no no)
About how I feel when you call all your white friends
"Homeboy" and "nigga" and "homie"
Oh, please
It hurts me
And you don't see

What you don't know about me is
"I told you everybody's got a story"
I'm a

[Chorus]

I am invisible (I am)
Am I responsible (I am)
I'm in between it all
Who is the enemy?
I am part of no plan
My honesty is contraband
My blood is thicker than any mans

What do you like when you like me? (Don't you like me?)
I am ingredients far beyond flour and molecules
Calluses, family jewels
I'm no fool
We went to the same school
Some of your best friends are just like me
But when they're not around you make jokes and conspire
The fire gets higher and I feel the heat
Rising underneath
Who is more deceived?
What you don't know about me is, I'm a

[Chorus]
