I changed myself for you
I opened up all them doors I closed
To let you in and now I feel a fool

You played so many games
I was sitting in just blind to it
From the start I should have seen everything you did

Every time you smile I wonder why
Every time you say you love me, lie
Every time we touch I break inside

'Cause no one else could dry these tears
You left me broken with nothing more to give
When I kiss you on your cheaty lips
All I ever picture is you with him
'Cause no one else could dry these tears
You left me broken with nothing more to give
When I kiss you on your cheaty lips
All I ever picture is you with him

Does he feel the same as me
As you lay right there just holdin' in underneath the sheets
And do I need nothing,
Cause I gave you everything I could and you never gave a thing
Every time you smile I wonder why
Every time you say you love me, lie
'Cause every time we touch I break inside

'Cause no one else could dry these tears
You left me broken with nothing more to give
When I kiss you on your cheaty lips
All I ever picture is you with him
'Cause no one else could dry these tears
You left me broken with nothing more to give
When I kiss you on your cheaty lips
All I ever picture is you with him

So many nights I'm waiting for you
So many times I tried to do
Everything but to call you
But never call

'Cause no one else could dry these tears
You left me broken with nothing more to give
When I kiss you on your cheaty lips
All I ever picture is you with him
'Cause no one else could dry these tears
You left me broken with nothing more to give
When I kiss you on your cheaty lips
All I ever picture is you with him
When I kiss you on your cheaty lips
All I ever picture is you with him
