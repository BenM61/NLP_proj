(Peace!) Piece of what?
You can't mean P-E-A-see-E
Cause I've seen people on the streets
Shoot the next man and turn around and say peace
But that's leaving people in pieces
It's not what the meaning of peace is
To me it means the absence of all confusion
Not the oozing and brusing
That we're all so accumstomed to
Your friend got beef?  I'll bust him too
What a brother from a certain way of life explained to me once, dunce
He didn't realize the fact that
He and myself were brothers on the same rope
Now last month he got hemmed up, huh, that's all she wrote
So I can get up where she left the exclamation
Looking for an explanation
Little kids think that peace is a word that you use to sound down
And I frown
Cause that's what I was told at eaight years old
And now I'm trying to break the mold
So stop the dominoes
I think it's about time that everyone knows

The incorrect usage of the word "peace" has got to cease
Stop frontin (Stop frontin) Stop frontin, like you know what I'm saying
And on that note, I'll leave you with this
