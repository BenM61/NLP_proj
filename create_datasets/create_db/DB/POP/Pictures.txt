Look at me, eighteen and tanned, 
Behind the wheel of my old van,
"Hotel California" turned up loud,
No air-conditioning, windows down.
Look at you smilin' at me,
Don't know when I've been as happy,
As that weekend out in Joshua Tree,
When I got down on my knees.
An' I like lookin' at old photographs.
Reminds me of the way we've always made each other laugh.

Pictures of a life we've made together.
Memories of a love that just gets better with time.
So many good times,
There's no way I will forget.
They've got me thinkin' 'bout pictures,
We haven't taken yet.

Next year let's go to Disney world,
Can't wait to see our little girl,
Hold hands with Mickey Mouse,
Chocolate ice-cream on her mouth.
An' you'll get all upset when I,
Snap you comin' off that ride,
With that pasty white look:
You won't put that one in our book.
An' I like lookin' back at all the things we've done.
But I love dreamin' of the years yet to come. 

Pictures of a life we've made together,
Memories of a love that just gets better with time.
So many good times,
There's no way I will forget.
Not now I'm thinkin' 'bout pictures,
We haven't taken yet.

Someday I'll walk our daughter down the aisle,
And every tear and every smile,
Will be captured in color...

Pictures of a life we've made together,
Memories of a love that just gets better with time.
So many good times,
There's no way I will forget.
They got us thinkin' 'bout pictures,
We haven't taken yet.

Can you see us on that front porch swing?
