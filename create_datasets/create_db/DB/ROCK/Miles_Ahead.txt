You've tore me open
Left a mark on my heart
These memories leave me blank
Only three years ago we were as close as they come
But now you're gone
I stand alone
All i have left is this card from you
I question and ask myself why

Where have you gone?
Where are you now?
Curiosity has killed this cat

Now this time
One this second chance
You won't slip from my hands
So hold on tight
To what we have now
Don't look back
I won't
You won't slip away
And i won't let you slip away
