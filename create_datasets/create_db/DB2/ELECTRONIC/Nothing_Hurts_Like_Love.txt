Broken hearts, broken dreams 
They're just some things that love brings
When you learn that its all been a lie, you cry
You find that 

Nothing, nothing, nothing hurts like love
Nothing brings your heart so much pain
And you will never learn till you get burned
Till your burned by the flame

Nothing hurts so bad
Nothing hurts so much
No nothing, hurts, like love 

So you gave all you had
How this story turned so sad
Nothing left but the tears in your eyes
You die inside, cause 

Nothing, nothing, nothing hurts like love
Nothing brings your heart so much pain
And you will never learn till you get burned
Till your burned by the flame

Nothing hurts so bad
Nothing hurts so much
No nothing, hurts, like love 

So dry your eyes, its just your turn to learn
Your time to find that, nothing, nothing 

Nothing, nothing, nothing hurts like love
Nothing brings your heart so much pain
And you will never learn till you get burned
Till your burned by the flame

Nothing hurts so bad
Nothing hurts so much
No nothing, hurts, like love
