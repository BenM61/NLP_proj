Touch by touch, you're my all time lover

When I feel the time is right and you're staying by my side
And the love you gave to me makes my heart beat
When my fantasy flies away but my feelings make me stay
I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come under my cover

When my heart is full of love it makes me a turtle dove
Love's the game that we play night and day
When our love is clear and bright it's our way to see the light
There's a fire in our heart night and day
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come under my cover

Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come under my cover
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come under my cover
