The future's on it's way, the past is gone
Old and rusted with your busted bones
Break the crystal ball, you're on your own
Wipe away the fear of the unknown

Now here we go, on with the show
Makin' our way, just to live for today
It's in my sight and the time is right, 
For takin' a bow into the now

Guilty of communication crimes
Was it just a binge, or was I blind
Overcoming opened up my mind
Don't let the things from the past eat you up inside

Now here we go, on with the show
Makin' our way, just to live for today
It's in my sight and the time is right, 
For takin' a bow into the now

Is it love that you break 
Or is it love that you make
Is it love we're breaking
Or love we're making
Or love just wasting time

Now here we go, and it's on with the show
Makin' our way, just to live for today
It's in my sight and the time is right, 
For takin' a bow into the now

Now here we go, on with the show
Makin' our way, just to live for today
It's in my sight and the time is right, 
For takin' a bow into the now
