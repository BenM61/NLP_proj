Give me your mascara and your phosphorus
You and I are higher than the loft
Gliding through the snowdrifts in a miniskirt
Glistening and olive, yeah, but soft

Got a ripe tomato here in ecstasy
Got a little apple in your eye
As if you had it all
As if you had no belly
You are on my skin and so am I

Beautiful queen
With your beautiful gene
Beautiful queen

I'm not afraid to be the only person on the planet
I'm not afraid to be the only person in the world with you
Oh.

In between the different worlds I slip for you
You're the warm creation of a sigh
As if you had no will
As if you had just apples
Tumbling between you and the sky

Beautiful queen
With your beautiful gene
Beautiful queen

I'm not afraid to be the only person on the planet
I'm not afraid to be the only person in the world with you

Thrill me again
Won't you thrill me again?
Won't you thrill me again?

Every cloud is numbered in the library
So is every kiss and every fly
And when the thunder calls
It trembles in your belly
Vanishing above the letter "Y"

Beautiful queen
With your beautiful gene
Beautiful queen
With your beautiful gene
Beautiful queen
Oooh  Oooh  Oooh  Oooh Oooh Oooh  Ooo
