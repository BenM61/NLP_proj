Ah, be mad little girl
But not at me
Be mad little girl
But try to see.
That I can't let you stay
A minute more
Although you know
That I adore you so
Still ya better go.

And, be mad little girl
But not at me.

Ah, be upset little girl
But dry your eyes
Be upset little girl
But realize.

That there's nothin' that
I'd rather do
Than stay here and make love to you
The whole night long
Still I know it's wrong.

So, be mad little girl
But not at me.

Ah, not at me because
I'm not the guy who made the laws
Tellin' us what we got to do
And tellin' us what not to do
And, baby, I love you.

Be mad little girl
Be mad and blue
Be mad little girl
'cause I am too.

But the more you stay
The more I find
That makes me wanna
Change my mind
It's hard to fight, so please say, "Good-night."

And, be mad little girl
But not at me.

Ah, not at me 
Don't be mad at me 
Not mad at me
