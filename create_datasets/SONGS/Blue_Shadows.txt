I've been around the world
And every man bleeds the same
But when the lights are dim
You never know who's to blame
I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
No other place for me to go
No other place for dying slow
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

I've been around the world
I take credit for the things I've done
But when the lights are dim
I'm not the only guilty one
I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

I've been around the world
And every story ends the same
But when the lights are dim
You won't remember my name
I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
No other place for me to go
No other place for dying slow
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

No other place for me to go
No other place for dying slow
So I'll be killing, just killing time
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
