She was so young when she took the street
Born too late in the mid-day heat
Her parents said : "she went to America"
She wasted days and she wasted nights
Everybody's girl, nobody's child
Her mother said: "she went to America"
Another day and another time
Heaven is so hard to find
Sarah said : "hello America"
I don't care where I sleep tonight
I don't care if I'm right
I like to dance, catch the wind

When Sarah smiles, her eyes shining blue
I know she's smiling straight from her heart
When Sarah smiles, it means heaven too
I know her heart is breaking apart
When Sarah smiles

She was so young when she left her home
Back to things like a rolling stone
Rocky said: "she went to America"
She cried some tears, she said goodbye
Wants to go where the eagle fly
Her mother said: "she went to America"
She was alone in a lonely world
On l.a. drive, she met a girl
Sarah said: "hello America"
I like to see an ocean in the sky
Don't stop me, when I try
I like to dance, catch the wind
