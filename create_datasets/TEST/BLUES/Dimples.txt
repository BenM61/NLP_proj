I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
See everything you do
I got my eyes on you

I love the way you walk
I'm just crazy 'bout your walk
I like the way you walk
You made me ? stuff
I got my eyes on you

I had a dream last night that I held you tight
A dream to held you close
Well, it's only a dream but as strange as it seems
I thought that you belonged to me

I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
See everything you do
I got my eyes on you

I had a dream last night that I held you tight
A dream to held you close
Well, it's only a dream but as strange as it seems
I thought that you belonged to me

I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
I got my eyes on you
See everything you do
I got my eyes on you
