I wonder, my little darling
Where can you be this moonlit night?
Are you holding someone tight?
Oh, baby, I wonder

My heart is aching, I'm a fool
To let it go on breaking
Maybe I'll awake and find that I'm mistaken
I wonder

Baby, since we're through, I've been through lover's lane
But in my heart there's only pain
You went traveling, but will it last?
While I'm traveling nowhere fast, sweetheart, sweetheart

I wonder, well, well, well, little baby
If this new love dies, where will you be?
Will your heart come running back to me?
Baby, I wonder
