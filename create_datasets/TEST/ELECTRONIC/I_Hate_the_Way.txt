I hate the way I cry when you say you miss me
But I love the way you hold me when I sleep
I hate the way I bleed each time you kiss me
But you say "Hey, sleeping beauty, go back to sleep."

We had pennies in our pockets
We had hope in our eyes
He said "Girl, you've got a million different faces
So why'd you put on that disguise?"

Well, take what you want 'cos I have got nothing
Pass me some pills, I'll go to bed
But, however much I toss and turn
I feel a dark place up ahead

Some nights I just sit back here, I remember
I just remember, before it all got lost up in the mess
He said "Not all men are bad and I am not like your dad
And I will hold you even though you're slightly mad
Cos I am not a man who will ever break you."

We had pennies in our pockets
We had hope in our eyes
He said "Girl, you've got a million different faces
So why'd you put on that disguise?"

Well, take what you want 'cos I have got nothing
Pass me some pills and I'll go to bed
But, however much I toss and turn
I feel a dark place up ahead

Do do do do do do do do do
My doctor says I've got to sing a happy tune
Do do do do do do do do do
A do do do but my body gave up too soon

Do do do do do do do do do
You know what?
I am just fine until I'm on my own
Do do do do do do do do 
An do do do do oh somebody please come home

I hate the way I tremble when you touch me
You're like a needle slowly piercing my skin
I hate the my way stomach aches
and I really hate these loveless mistakes
Cos' I'm screaming for my rock who never picks up
Why do you never pick up?

We had pennies in our pockets
We had hope in our eyes
He said "Girl, you've got a million different faces
So why'd you put on that disguise?"

Well, you can take what you want 'cos I have got nothing
Pass me some pills and I will go to bed
But, however much I toss and turn
I feel a dark place up ahead

Do do do do do do do do
My doctor says I'd got to sing a happy tune

Maybe if I skip my dinner
Make myself pretty and thinner
Maybe then he'll love me and stop looking at the other girls
So you said I'm paranoid. I'm paranoid?
Well I nearly choked. And no more of that crap
You cannot break someone whose just been broken
You can't break somebody whose just been broken

So take me now I'm naked
As you watch, I'll let you take it
Maybe then you'll love me and stop looking at the other girls
So you said I'm paranoid. Well, paranoid?
Well, I nearly choked. And no more of that crap
You cannot break someone whose just been broken
You can't break somebody whose just been broken

Then I think he'll love me and stop looking at those other girls
