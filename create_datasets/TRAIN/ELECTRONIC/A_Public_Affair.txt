There go the street lights
The night's officially on
I got the green light
To do whatever I want
I'm gonna stand outside the box
And put the rules on hold

Tonight

Carte blanche, first class for the evening Ready, set, go...

All the girls stepping out for a public affair All night, let's rock Cause the party don't stop.

You know the cameras come out for a public affair Who cares, let's rock Cause the party don't stop.

Hey baby
I see you looking over here baby
Are you gonna keep looking or
Get up and talk to me
Here's an opportunity
That you don't want to miss

Tonight

Carte blanche, first class for the evening Ready, set, go...

All the girls stepping out for a public affair All night, let's rock Cause the party don't stop.

Do what you wanna do
Tonight the world does not exist
No no no no
Move how how you wanna move
All my girls work it out like this
Give me room to
Shake shake shake

All the girls stepping out for a public affair All night, let's rock Cause the party don't stop.
