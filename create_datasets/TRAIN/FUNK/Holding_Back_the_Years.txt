Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone
Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to me the sooner or later

Holding back the tears
Chance for me to escape from all I know
Holding back the tears
'Cause nothing here has grown
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could, yeah

I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on, so tight

Well I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all of those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
'Cause nothing ever could

I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on

Holding
Holding
Holding
Holding

I said

It's all I have today
It's all I have to say
