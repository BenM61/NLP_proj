Chooglin', chooglin'

Maybe you don't understand it
But if you're a natural man
You got to ball and have a good time
And that's what I call chooglin'

Here comes Mary lookin' for Harry
She gonna choogle tonight
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer
Lord, he gonna choogle tonight

Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin'
