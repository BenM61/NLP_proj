Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

[Chorus]
I don't care what they say I won't stay
In a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain clouds hide the moon
I'm OK, here I'll stay
With my loneliness

[Chorus]

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does I lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

[Chorus]

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does I lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

[Chorus: x2]
