In her own sweet world
Populated by dolls and clowns
And a prince and a big purple bear

Lives my favorite girl,
Unaware of the worried frowns
That we weary grown ups all wear

In the sun she dances to silent music,
Songs that are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head

One day all too soon
She'll grow up and she'll leave her dolls
And her prince and her silly old bear

When she goes they will cry
As she whispers "Good-bye."
They will miss her I fear
But then so will I
