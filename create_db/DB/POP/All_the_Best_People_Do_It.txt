You say that I am out of touch
To me that doesn't mean so much
You're tryin' hard to be so cool
But you will always be the fool.

All the best people do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Just keep turning every little thing into a lie.

You think you know just what to say
The words you use give you away
There's always something lets me know
That I'm up high and you're down low.

All the best people do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Just keep turning every little thing into a lie.

Why do you always just pretend
You're gonna lose out in the end
One day you'll wake up and you'll find
That I have left you far behind.

All the best people do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Just keep turning every little thing into a lie.

You say that I am out of touch
To me that doesn't mean so much
You're tryin' hard to be so cool
But you will always be the fool.

All the best people do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Just keep turning every little thing into a lie.
