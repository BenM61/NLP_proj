Why can't we do it tonight?
Don't wanna go home still a-knockin'
Tonight it wouldn't seem right
My thirst is a bitch
My side's got a stitch
I'm ready to drop
But I don't wanna stop

'Cause rockin' the the knocking
Of the beating in my vein
Is heightening the frightening
So life don't seem the same
Don't need the poking toking
Of the snuff-it-stuff-it game
To get a sheet of lightning
For the inside of my brain

It's only rolling while we can
I think I'm through with all the talking
My tongue's been getting out of hand
I tried everything
To make my nerves sing
Scientifically now
If you wanna know how

'Cause rockin' to the knocking
Of the beating in my vein
Is heightening the frightening
So life don't seem the same
Don't need the poking toking
Of the snuff-it-stuff-it game
To get a sheet a lightning
For the the inside of my brain

Just to hear my girl sigh
Makes me jelly in the middle
Better than any pill you buy
My thirst is a bitch
My side's got a stitch
I'm ready to drop
But I don't wanna stop

'Cause rockin' to the knocking
Of the beating in my vein
Is heightening the frightening
So life don't seem the same
Don't need the poking toking
Of the snuff-it-stuff-it-game
To get a sheet of lightning
For the inside of my brain

Wow-wow-wow-wow!
