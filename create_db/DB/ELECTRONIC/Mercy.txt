Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
Where did you read my story?
Pulled from the papers, desperate and hurting
Seeking a momentary fix

All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do
Is fall apart now
All I wanted to feel, I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy I fear

Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?

I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa

Fortress of daylight
Caught me on standby
Waiting to catch the quickest plane
To fly me to nowhere
It's better than somewhere
That's where I've been and nothings changed

All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do
Is fall apart now
All I wanted to feel, I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy I chose

Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?

I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa

I'm so lost in you
A tragedy, it seemed to be over now
A tragedy, it seemed to be over now

Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?

I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Oh oh whoa
I feel you
Oh oh oh
