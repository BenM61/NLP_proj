Like pieces of a dream
All shattered on a screen
Reflected in the shade
(Reflected in the shade)
Explore this new landscape

Like pieces of a dream
Disturbingly surreal
(Disturbingly surreal)
Comforting once and yet
The thing you can connect

Shake it up, shake it up
Shake it up, baby
Shake it up, shake it up
Shake it up, baby

Can't put my finger on it
Can't put this figure on me
Can't fix my mind upon it
This feeling's captured me
Like pieces of a dream
