We'll walk around pretending
We're all grown up -- hey rich girl
Well can you tell me why you're so stuck up?
When you act like you're so down 
Does paranoia come around 
And seize your mind? 
Now roll your eyes 

there's an investigation to be done 
Like who's been wearing what with who?
So what's been going on? 
You've got to know
You've got to know

I'll tell you everything I know 
Any little thing I know 
I'll tell you everything I know 
Any little things I know 
You've got a lovely way with words 
Must be the way you see the world 
Its just the way you see the world

we walk around pretending 
We're all grown up -- hey rich girl 
Well can you tell me why you're so stuck up? 
When you act like you're so down 
Does paranoia come around? 
Read your mind and take your eyes 
Investigation to be done 
Like who's been wearing what with who? 
Hey what's been going on around here?
You gotta tell me you
You got the know -- I'd like to know

I'll tell you everything I know 
Any little thing I know 
I'll tell you everything I know 
Any little things I know 
You've got a lovely way with words 
Must be the way you see the world 
Its just the way you see the world

oh what a lovely way with words 
Is that the way you see the world? 
Its just the way you see the world

I went down to your house last weekend 
You said, "come on man, you don't have to point out 
Everything that's bad. 
So there's a broken mirror on my bed 
I'll clean it up,so what? 
You don't have to be such an asshole all the time."
Aww don't be like that.
