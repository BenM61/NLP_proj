Thinkin' so much my crowded head became sore
Fell back into the place I was before
Reasons long enough to not let show
I follow through this once because I said so

I think I got it all figured out
I think I got it made
I think I got it all figured out
I think my plan is safe from laughter
From laughter, no
I'll wait
I'll wait the day

Slowly I begin to come around
I woke up to a soft and subtle sound now
Someone is speaking one room away
Just loud enough so i can hear what they're sayin'
Sayin'

I think I got it all figured out
I think I got it made
I think I got it all figured out
I think my plan is safe from laughter
From laughter, no
I'll wait
I'll wait the day

And I watch what I say and I
Watch what I do and I
Watch what I say and I
Watch what I

I think I got it all figured out
I think I got it made
I think I got it all figured out
I think my plan is safe from laughter
From laughter
From laughter (I'll wait)
From laughter (I'll wait)
From laughter (I'll wait the day)
From laughter
I'll wait
