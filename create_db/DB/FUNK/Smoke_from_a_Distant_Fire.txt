You left me here on
You're way, to paradise.
You pulled the rug, right out
From under my life.
I know where go, so I knew when
You came home last night.

Cause you're eyes had a mist
From the smoke of a distant fire.

Lord I was stung,
Should've seen it come a long time ago
When I realized the reality gave me a roll
If things are the same
Then explain why your kiss is so cold
And that mist in your eyes
Feels like rain on the fire
In my soul

This lying, and crying and setting
And get in the way
It dont stack up so slack up
And pack up I just dont care
(Dont let the screen door hit you)
On your way out
(Dont try to dream when your dream runs into the ground)

I'd just like to know
Do you love him or just making time
My feeling is glass when you're fast
Throwing bitter sweet lines
He'll face the aftertaste
When you come home late some night

With your eyes all a mist
From the smoke of a distant fire

Girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire
(Girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire)x2

Girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire
(Mist in your eyes from a distant fire)
Girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a dist, distant fire
