Do do do

Hey little girl won't you meet me at the schoolyard gate
I got back stage passes to the biggest show in town
So honey don't you make me late
If we leave really early and we hurry we can get in with the band
Cause little Tim Smitty's got his old man's van
So let's get to gettin' while the gettin' is right
And roll with the rhythm tonight

God knows that I love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't ya know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my tune

Hey little girl want to dance with you all night long
The music got me buzzin' and I feel pretty loose
I feel the rhythm and it's comin' on strong baby baby
Lay the rhythm on me baby, there's power in the sound
With everybody jumpin' we can bring the house down
So lets get to gettin' while the gettin' is right
And roll with the rhythm tonight

God knows that I love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't ya know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my tune

God knows that I love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't ya know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my

Do do do

Love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't ya know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my tune
