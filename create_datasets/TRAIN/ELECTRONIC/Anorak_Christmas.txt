The first time that I saw your face on a cold December night
It was a Tuesday on a gig with a band that we both liked
The first time that I heard you say your name and I said mine
I fell in love, and ever since you've been here on my mind

Please don't go
I love you so
I want to kiss you
I need to kiss you

The weekend's over and I feel the strangest way because
I can't remember my own name but I do remember yours
There are no words in any language for feelings just like this
Will I end up by myself or in the perfect kiss

Please don't go
I love you so
I want to kiss you
I need to kiss you

Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
