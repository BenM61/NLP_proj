You can't help all the feelings, 
You've been feeling about me, about me
Every man that I'm seeing, 
Ends up being so in love, so in love

Take one look at my body
And you'll keep on coming, I know what you want
Take one look at my body
And you'll keep on coming, I know what you want

I'm a heart breaker, a love taker.
I'm a heart breaker, don't go falling in love
Don't go falling in love

You want love but you're a dreaming, 
Stop believing, I'm the one, I'm the one
'Cause I'm just in a feeling
When you're feening over me, over me

Take one look at my body
And you'll keep on coming, I know what you want
Take one look at my body
And you'll keep on coming, I know what you want

I'm a heart breaker, a love taker
I'm a heart breaker, don't go falling in love
Don't go falling in love

Don't go falling in love
Don't go falling in love
Don't go falling in love (in love, in love)
Don't go falling in love (in love, in love)
