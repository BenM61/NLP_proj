yearning, keep from burning, keep 'em earning
    someones got to pay for all this television
    there's children singing, and church bells ringing
    and people skipping merrily to work, i'm dreaming

    i'm dreaming

    for maybe, you'll wind up crazy, and when you're drinking
    you may start thinking, that you're stupid and you're lazy
    well just keep earning, keep on yearning,
    and you will believe there are no gods and monsters

    gods and monsters

    so free of contradictions, no dereliction
    there are no gods and monsters
    so useless and so pretty and so good,
    so pretty and so good 

    gods and monsters

    now have I got you watching, for all the gods and monsters?
    are sitting, reclining in the back row of your mind,
    i think that's what you'll find

    yes, there are gods and monsters
    yes, there are gods and monsters
    yes, there are gods and monsters
