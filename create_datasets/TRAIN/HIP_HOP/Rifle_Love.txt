What's up sweet heart? 
What ever you did, 
You shot me straight in the heart.
I like it, I like the way you doing it to me doll.
Whatever you doing,
Just keep on shooting (Damn yourself girl),
Just keep on shooting, cause you shot me straight in the heart
Girl shoot me with.

Shoot me with your rifle love,
I heard it go bang, bang
Done stuck me up again (Girl shoot me with).
Shoot me with your rifle love,
I hold me hands up high,
And touch and reach the sky.

Is that your gun you shot me with, you know you are so wrong, 
I love the way you put it on me, got me wanting more, 
and every time I think about the love you've given me,
You shoot me with your rifle then you're all that I can see. 

Now all the other girls I thought I liked never had a gun like you,
The one you shoot makes me feel so happy, am in love with you,
See your rifle has a smoke with a stunner, automatic weapon got baby,
When I knew you were the one that could make me shine, 
I knew you had to be mine oh mine,
Shoot me

Shoot me with your rifle love,
I heard it go bang, bang
Done stuck me up again (Girl shoot me with).
Shoot me with your rifle love, 
I hold me hands up high,
And touch and reach the sky.

Say what done.

Put your hands in the air, surrender to me,
Better yet lay down on the ground, 
Let mama pat you down, I'll spin you all around,
My chambers full of heat.

It was the day you caught my eye.

I can't explain it

This body shot could hurt your eye.

Now let's get to it, 
Out of all the girls I thought I knew, 
Do ages just for you,
I even tried to keep one on the side,
Your love hit me right in my side. 

Shoot me with your rifle love,
I heard it go bang, bang
Done stuck me up again (Girl shoot me with).
Shoot me with your rifle love, 
I hold me hands up high,
And touch and reach the sky.

You're the first girl that I could never ever replace (Gunshot)
So come a bless me darling, (baby come' on now)
Cause your love is all I need
