Ooh, girl, I love you
Yeah, yeah, honest I do
But I'm guilty, baby
Of being untrue

What you heard
Through the grapevine
Every word is true
And the blame's all mine, y'all

I'm guilty, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm guilty, guilty, guilty
Baby, I'm, guilty of this crime

Don't condemn me
Or cast me aside
Cause I'm gonna be good to you

Loving you is more
More important than
Your foolish pride

Ooh, just put me on probation
Loving you is more
Yeah, than infatuation

I'm guilty, yeah
Ooh, I'm guilty
But listen

Don't condemn me
Baby, baby, baby
Or cast me aside, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Loving you is more important
Than your foolish pride

All you got to do is
Just put me on probation
Loving you is more
Yeah, than infatuation

Cause I'm guilty
I'm so guilty, guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty
Oh, oh, oh, oh
