Don't count on me 
I engineer on every move we make from here.
I'll take the lead
you take the pain
You see
I engineer this gain!

Who do you think you fool when you talk about us?
Why do you walk on glass when you know it cuts?
There must be a reason why you put my life in ovexdrive.
I'm up to here with push and shove

From here on in - I've had enough -

Don't count on me -

I'll leave it all behind in a cloud of dust

There's an even chance I'll shine or bust.
On my own I've got the time

There's a light ahead at the end of the line.
Seein' you leaves me no doubt

I'll take the wheel - from here all out -

Don't count on me - . . .

On my own I've got the time

Oh
there's a light ahead at the end of the line.
Seein' you leaves me no doubt

I'll take the wheel - from here all out -

Don't count on me - (3x)
