Caught the train on the later side
Looking for a place with a little bit of life
Been a tough week, can't deny that I thought about stopping
More than once or twice, oh no, some more advice
Keep your head up while you're pushed to the side
And maybe with a bit-bit more luck
You can get picked up from wherever you lie
I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's hard enough
To get a decent chance around these parts-around these parts
I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's far enough
That you can't get there on your own anymore

[Chorus]

Lately, I've been trying my best
But maybe it ain't good enough
Running in circles I guess, round and round, it never stops
It never stops, it never stops, it never stops just like a figure 8
It never stops, it never stops, it never stops just like a figure 8

[Verse 2:]

Hailed a cab on the early side, looking for a train to get uptown
Uh, think I wanna see home, don't pick up the phone
Can't hear a sound, search our whole lives up and down
For what can't be found instead of appreciating of what we have around
Or what we have now gets tossed to the ground
I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's hard enough
To get a decent chance around these parts-around these parts
I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's far enough
That you can't get there on your own anymore

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
Lately, I've been trying my best
But maybe it ain't good enough
Running in circles I guess, round and round, it never stops
It never stops, it never stops, it never stops just like a figure 8
It never stops, it never stops, it never stops just like a figure 8
It never stops, it never stops, it never stops just like a figure 8
It never stops, it never stops, it never stops just like a figure 8
