Coin operated boy, sitting on the shelf
He is just a toy but I turn him on and he comes to life
Automatic joy that is why I want
A coin operated boy

Made of plastic and elastic
He is rugged and long lasting
Who could ever ever ask for more?
Love without complications galore

Many shapes and weights to chose from
I will never leave my bedroom
I will never cry at night again
Wrap my arms around him and pretend

Coin operated boy
All the other real ones that I destroy
Cannot hold a candle to my new boy
And I'll never let him go

And I'll never be alone
And I'll never let him go
And I'll never be alone, go
And I'll never be alone, go

And I'll never be alone, go
And I'll never be alone, go
And I'll never be alone
Not with my coin operated boy

This bridge was written to make you feel smitten
And with my sad picture of girl getting bitterer
Oh, can you extract me from my plastic fantasy
I didn't think so but I'm still convincible

Oh will you persist even after I bet you a million dollars
That I'll never love you and will you persist even after I kiss you
Goodbye for the last time will you be trying to prove it, I'm dying
To lose it, I'm losing my confidence

I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I want a, I want a, I want a, I want a coin operated boy

And if I had a star to wish on for my life
I can't imagine any flesh and blood could be this match
I can even take him in the bath
Coin operated boy, he may not be real experienced with girls

But I know, he feels like a boy should feel, isn't that the point
That is why I want a coin operated boy
With a pretty coin operated voice saying
That he loves me, that he's thinking of me
Straight and to the point that is why
I want a coin operated boy
