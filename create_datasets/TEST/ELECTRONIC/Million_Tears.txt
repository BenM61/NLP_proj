I want to know where you belong,
I want to know why I sing this song.

I try to show how much I feel,
Is that a dream or is it real?

I never look where you belong,
Until I'm gonna sing my song.

Is it a lie or is it true?
So many tears I've cried for you

Oh ho oh ho a million tears for you
Oh ho oh ho a million tears for you
Oh ho oh ho a million tears for you
Oh ho oh ho a million tears for you

A million tears that I have cried
I wish you where right by my side.

I try to show how much I care
Believe in me I will be there.

I never knew where you belong,
Whenever you just hear my song.

Is it a lie or is it true?
So many tears I've cried for you.

Oh ho oh ho a million tears for you
Oh ho oh ho a million tears for you
