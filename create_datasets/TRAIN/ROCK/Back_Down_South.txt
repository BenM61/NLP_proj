Come on out and dance,
If you get the chance,
We're gonna spit on the rival.
All's I wanna know,
Is how far you wanna go,
Fighting for survival.

Underneath the stars,
Where we parked the cars,
Ain't showing signs of stopping.
Pretty little girls,
Naked to their curls,
Ready to lay in a coffin.
If you wanna go,
I'm gonna go,
I gotta fire burning.
Go on take my hand,
When we see the man,
Baby's gonna be a big one.
Baby's gonna be a big one.

When you see the lights,
And when we hear the fights,
It's gonna be a stunner.
I've got something here,
If you give me one more beer,
I'm gonna call a runner.
I don't want to say,
What I have to say,
If I'm kicking off now.
If you wanna go,
I'm gonna go,
I'm going back down south now ahh
I'm going back down south now ahh
I'm going back down south now.

If you wanna go,
I'm going back down south now.
Come on take my hand,
I'm going back down south now.
When we see the lights,
And we hear those fights,
I'm going back down south now.
All I want to know,
Is how far you wanna go,
I'm going back down south now oh yeah.

I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.
Oh, yeah.
