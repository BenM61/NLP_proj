People are queer, they're always crowing, scrambling and rushing about
Why don't they stop someday, address themselves this way?
Why are we here? Where are we going? It's time that we found out
We're not here to stay; we're on a short holiday

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

So keep repeating it's the berries
So keep repeating it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?
Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh at it all

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
At eight each morning I have got a date
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State
You'll admit it's not the berries
In a building that's so tall
There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this
Life is just a bowl of . . . aw, nuts!
So live and laugh at it all!
