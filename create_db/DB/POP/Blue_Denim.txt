I saw him the other day
I saw him again yesterday
I wonder if I'll ever see him again
He reminded me of Blue Denim

Blue-gray eyes they change with the color 
Change with the sun they run with the sight
They change with the wind but they're always bright
Bright eyes Blue Denim
Bright eyes Blue Denim

I knew him another way
I knew him another day
In some ways he'd forgotten me
In many ways he got to me
I turned away so he couldn't see
I turned away it could never be
I never thought he could walk away
But I lost him again yesterday

Understanding me understanding you
Is not an easy thing to do
Understanding me and understanding you
Is not an easy thing to do

And I will never forget 
The last time I saw you
Like a photograph so rare
Like a painting
No I will never forget 
The last time I saw you
Never to be not you not me
No no 

So I'm going away for a little while
To remember how to feel
And if I find the answer 
I promise you I'll come back and get you
I'll come back and get you
I'll come back and get you
