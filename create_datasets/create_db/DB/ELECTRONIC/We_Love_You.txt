Gotta get a message to the starg in our pockets for a rainy day
But here we are, in trouble like we always are
Just praying for a miracle
Reaching for the stars

We love you
Would die for you
We need you everyday

We've gotta get a message
We love you
Would die for you
We need you everyday
Oh, we love you
Wouldn't leave you
We miss you faraway

It's just another promise
Like we've heard before
Never really knowing what we're fighting for

We love you
Would die for you
We need you everyday
Oh, we love you
Wouldn't leave you
We miss you faraway

We love you
Would die for you
We need you everyday
Oh, we love you
Wouldn't leave you
We miss you faraway

We love you
Would die for you
We need you everyday
Oh, we love you
Wouldn't leave you
We miss you faraway
