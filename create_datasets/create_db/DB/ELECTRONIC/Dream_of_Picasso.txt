Tonight I shall sleep with the ghost of picasso
And I'll draw the arms of the city close around us
"that one, he died," I'll tell him
And he'll say:
"so did I, it's no big thing,"
And he'll paint a blue halo round my head
And then he'll slip cool and calm beside me in my bed
And he'll say:
"come on, come on,"

tonight I shall sleep with the knowledge and freedom
That the one who comes will be wanting only me
And when he does, that river will flow across the moon
A silent stream
And he'll tell me that he loves me just the same
And that he's dreamt about me dancing in the falling rain
And he'll say:
"come on, come on,"
