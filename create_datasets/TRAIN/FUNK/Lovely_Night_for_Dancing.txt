Such a lovely night for dancin'
And I get this feelin' (full of) song (note 1)
Love, sunset to sunrise
And I feel that the music turns me on
Love twilight (under) blue skies (note 2)
And I feel like dancin'
All night long

Such a lovely night for dancin'
And I get this feelin' (full of) song
Love, sunset to sunrise
And I feel that the music really turns me on
Love twilight (under) blue skies
And I feel like dancin'
All night long

Get up and dance with me
(Get up and dance)
Get up and dance with me
(Won't you dance with me)
Get up and dance with me
(Get up and dance)
Get up and dance with me
(Won't you dance with me)
Get up and dance with me
(Get up and dance)
Get up and dance with me
(Won't you dance with me)
Get up and dance with me
(Get up and dance)
Get up and dance with me
(Won't you dance with me)
