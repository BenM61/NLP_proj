Now honey, don't you love me any more?
Never saw you act like this before
Look as if we're unreal

Honey, don't you love me any more?
Would you, could you break up our romance?
Would you, could you give me just one more chance?
It's much pain, I can't take

Baby, don't you love me any more?
Oh, I know there must be someone else
If you can treat me so
But I don't care if there's another cat, baby
I ain't gonna let you go

And what you do is what you don't
And what you do is what you won't
Now baby, I'm going mad 'cause I

Baby, don't you love me any more? Yeah
Now honey, don't you love me any more?
Never saw you act like this before
Look as if we're unreal
