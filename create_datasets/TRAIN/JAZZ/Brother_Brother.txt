Oh, brother, brother, brother
I know you've been layin back a long time
But I love you like no other
Oh, brother of mine
I've been watching everything you do
And I've been wishing only good for you
All you've got to do is just want it to
And it's gonna - it's gonna come to you
Oh, brother, brother, brother
I know you've been hangin' on a long time
But I love you like no other
Oh, brother of mine
You have always been so good to me
And though you didn't always talk to me
There wasn't much my lovin' eyes could not see
and I don't believe you need all your misery
Oh, brother, brother, brother
I know you've been hangin' on a long time
You know I love you like no other
Oh, brother, brother, brother
Talkin' about you, brother
