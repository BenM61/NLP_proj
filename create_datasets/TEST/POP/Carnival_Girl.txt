And there were some that weren't so bad

Blink up and dream a living with the notion to
I'll give you the sun, the stars and the blue sky too
So come on a leasing want to pleasing you
Remember when we used to link up with the crew

Lovers may have tried to be 
Everything that's strange in me
Oh much deeper now, much deeper now 

Much deeper,

It used to be like a weekend everyday
Three times at night when I came every way 
Body to body make you scream and say
Physically dance

For again we are love, at one with the pope
And you stay on my mind,
