If I can't be a man, tell me what I am?
Tell me what I'm here for?
If I can't be the one, tell her what I've done
What good can I be?

Did I not do enough to save the two of us?
What more could I give her?
What more could I do to see her point of view?
Why can't I believe her?

You got to make the change
I can't take you no more
These things you know
Do go, oh, oh

Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away

Oh, oh

You got to make the change
I can't take you no more
These things you know
Do go, oh, oh

Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away
You can't come
Oh, oh
