(Denis LePage, Denyse LePage)

Baby, you're on top of the situation
As long as you're alive and well

(Verse)
Don't let them tell you all about damnation
Don't let them take control
Promises are promises and sweet salvation
Don't let them take your soul

Baby, you're on top of the situation
As long as you're alive and well

Baby, you're on top of the situation
As long as you're alive and well



(Break, Repeat 2x)
(Break, Repeat 2x)
Baby, you're on top of the situation

Baby, you're on top of the situation
As long as you're alive and well



Baby, you're on top of the situation
As long as you're alive and well



Baby, you're on top of the situation
As long as you're alive and well

Baby, you're on top of the situation
As long as you're alive and well
