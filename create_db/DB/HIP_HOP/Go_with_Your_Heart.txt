Let's go out
Turn it up and roll the windows down
Yeah we like our music
So damn loud
We'll be shaking the ground
Are you feeling it now, now, now

Ooh
All my people
Ohh
Where you at
Ohh
All my people, where you at, where you at, where you at, where you at

Moving up the speed of light
Shooting stars across the sky
Yeah you only get one life
You've gotta go with your heart
Go with your heart tonight

Praise them up
To the celing we gonna rock this club
Baby believe it
When you party with us
You'll be feelin' a buzz
You'll be falling in love

Hol' up
I don't wanna
Just go falling
And falling
In love
Girl I could hear
Ya heart calling
And calling
Pick up
Now they might've did
A lil' partying
But not partying this much
Girl there ain't
Stopping this
Ain't no stalling
Now drinks up
Now maybe
They won't
Ever feel this feel
Like were' in a dream
But it's real
Even though
We're standing still
We're still

Moving up the speed of light
Shooting stars across the sky
Yeah you only get one life
You've gotta go with your heart
Go with your heart tonight

Ohh

All my people where you at

Moving up the speed of light
Shooting stars across the sky

You've gotta go with your heart
Go with your heart tonight
