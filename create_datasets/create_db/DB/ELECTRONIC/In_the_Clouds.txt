I like the bullet in the water, yeah
I like the morning after pill, hello
Breath in
Lose control

I wanna f*ck ya in fire, yeah
I wanna hold ya till you breath no more
Can't hide, oh

Meet me in the clouds
Let me work it out
Don't you take it personal, personal
Don't you like the control? Oh
Don't you like the control? Oh

Let's tell the people what we have to say
Let's tell the people till they can't hear no more
Can't cry
More and more

We never tried to be the leading voice
We couldn't help it 'cause you gave us no choice
Can't fight, oh

Meet me in the clouds
Let me work it out
Don't you take it personal, personal
Don't you like the control? Oh
Don't you like the control? Oh
