I run after you 
Like a fool would do
But mama didn't raise no fool
And I should know
That baby you got it 
That's all I can say to you

[Chorus]
You got soul, too much soul
Foxy clothes, the cutest nose
The greatest shape
There's nothing fake about you 
Baby you got it

People can be cruel
They say I lost my cool
But it's very hard to keep my cool
When I'm around you 
'Cause baby you got it
That's all I can say to you 

[Chorus]

Now that I found you 
Gonna cling to you 
I'll give you lovin', money
Everything to you 
No matter what they say 
Doesn't matter what I do 
I'm never gonna love another girl but you 
'Cause baby you got it 
That's all I can say to you 

[Chorus]

My friends say no can be 
You're not the girl for me
But I see a lot of things 
In you that they can't see
Oh baby you got it
That's all I can say to you 
(Repeat Chorus)

You got soul,  too much soul, 
Baby you got it
Foxy clothes, cutest nose, 
Baby you got it
Greatest shape, nothin' fake
Baby you got it
Groovy lips, make me flip, 
Baby you got it 
Pretty eyes, hypnotize
Baby you got it
