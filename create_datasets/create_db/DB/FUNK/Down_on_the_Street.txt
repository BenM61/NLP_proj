Tonight's the night we've waited for
The time to sing and dance like never before.
The street's alive with such a carnival air
An all night dancing party everywhere.
You and I
We're happy to be just a part of this crazy scene.
Down on the street

Down on the street

Down on the street
Down. 
Tonight's the night you'll never forget
The best time in your life that you'll ever get.
New lovers meet as they dance through the night
The moonlight falls on this magical sight.
You and I
We're happy to be just a part of this crazy scene.
