Who has trouble? Who has woe? I have
Who bought trouble? Who brought woe? You did
Friends don't want me around anymore
'Cause I'm not the guy I was before

Once I didn't have a kid
And no despair ever came to me
Now I'm blue and the trouble with me is you

Yes, I know I was alone and on my own
Still my heart was green and blue
And the trouble with me is you

You took a heart, took it apart
You took a dream, threw out the scene
You took a fool, acted so cruel
You took the sun away, leavin' me a cloudy day

But I don't suppose you care
Our love affair wasn't meant to be
So I'm blue and the trouble with me is you

You took a heart, took it apart
You took a dream, threw out the scene
You took a fool, acted so cruel
You took the sun away, leavin' me a cloudy day

But I don't suppose you care
Our love affair wasn't meant to be
So I'm blue and the trouble with me is you
