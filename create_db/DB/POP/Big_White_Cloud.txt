When I stand, my back to the sea
A big white cloud, looking right down on me
Sound of sun, missing my eyes
Everything's clear, everything's bright

Big white cloud, big white cloud
Big white cloud on me
Big white cloud, big white cloud
Big white cloud on me.

Time to kill on the hill
Looking at bees, licking the trees
Looking for signs ....................

Oh how I love you,
Yes how I love you
Oh how I love you so.

Oh how I love you,
Yes how I love you
Oh how I love you so.

After all is said and done
Everything, is just like it began
Days that came, years again
Came in here once again

Oh how I love you,
Yes how I love you
Oh how I love you so.

Oh how I love you,
Yes how I love you
Oh how I love you so.
