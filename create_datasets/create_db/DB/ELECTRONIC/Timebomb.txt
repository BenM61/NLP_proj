Fast, time is ticking oh so fast
The sound is running quick right through our hands
Beat, feel the rhythm in my heartbeat
Why don't you move your body to my body
Before we disappear

Tell me now, woo
Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, woo
I wanna, wanna dance like it was the last dance of my life
I wanna woo, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, woo
Do you wanna, wanna dance, like it was the last dance

Wait, no, please don't make me wait
When walls are shaking, ground feels like a mind break
It's not the end of the world
It's just the start of me and you, yeah
So let's just take the moment
Boy let's move

Tell me now, woo
Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, woo
I wanna, wanna dance like it was the last dance of my life
I wanna woo, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, woo
Do you wanna, wanna dance, like it was the last dance

We're on a timebomb, you might not last long
So let's just do it right now, do it come on
We're on a timebomb, before the night's gone
Let's just do it right now, do it come on

Wait, please don't make me wait
Wait, please don't make me wait

Tell me now, woo
Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, woo
I wanna, wanna dance like it was the last dance of my life
I wanna woo, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, woo
Do you wanna, wanna dance, like it was the last dance

We're on a timebomb, you might not last long
So let's just do it right now, do it come on
We're on a timebomb, before the night's gone
Let's just do it right now, do it come on
