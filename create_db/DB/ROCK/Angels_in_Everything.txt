I've sat at the back of the line for years,
Wishing the world wouldn't spin,
I give in, alone again it appears.
There were pieces of me that lived in corners on a hard wood floor.
Until an Angel walked in through my door.

Time stopped, the arch of her back grew wings.
And pulling me further from a devil to a heaven, she said "Believe."
True peace as she looked into my soul.
She said "I'm here to show you faith, and to help you when you fall."

[Chorus]
Can you feel my heart,
Beating underneath these stars?
You're the Angel that came, and took these clouds away.
You made me believe!
Never be weak, be strong.
Live every moment like an Angel,
Flies

I'll whisper in your ear,
You are mine, and you will never have to be alone.
And when I pull you near,
You'll know I love you like I never loved anyone.
So let me be the one to lift you up,
I'll carry you home.
'Cause now I'm here to keep you safe,
And to catch you when you fall.

[Chorus]
Can you feel my heart,
Beating underneath these stars?
You're the Angel that came, and took these clouds away.
You made me believe!
Never be weak, be strong.
Live every moment like an Angel,
Flies

Only you can see the true me,
Through all the right, and wrong.
Take hold, the best has yet to come.
(Yeah)
You've given me the strength to believe in my heart again!
And now we're here to share this faith.
Stand together through it all.

[Chorus]
Can you feel my heart,
Beating underneath these stars?
You're the Angel that came, and took these clouds away.
You made me believe!
Never be weak, be strong.
Live every moment like an Angel,
Flies

Can you feel my heart,
Beating underneath these stars?
You're the Angel that came, and took these clouds away.
You made me believe!
Never be weak, be strong.
Live every moment like an Angel,
Flies

Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh.

That's who you are!
You're the Angel that came, and took these clouds away.
You made me believe!
Never be weak, be strong.
So really strong!

Ohohohoh,
Ohohohoh,
OooooooooooooooOooooooooh!

That's who you are
You're the Angel that came,
And took these clouds away
