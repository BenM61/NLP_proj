When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean.
When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean.
When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean.
When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean. 

Come so far I can't go back,
Come so far I can't go back,
Come so far I can't go back,
Come so far.

When will you wake up,
Up to my loving stuff.
When will you wake up,
Up to my loving cup.
When will you wake up,
When will you wake up,
When will you wake up,
When will you wake up.

I've been so far I can't go back,
I've been so far I can't go back,
I've been so far I can't go back,
I've been so far I can't go back.

When will you come clean,
When will you wake up,
Up to my loving cup,
Up to my loving stuff,
Clean and lean and mean,
Clean and lean and mean.

I've been so far I can't go back,
I've been so far I can't go back,
I've been so far I can't go back,
I've been so far.
