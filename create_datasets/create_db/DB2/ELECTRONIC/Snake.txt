You snake you crawled between my legs
Said want it all it's yours you bet
I'll make you queen of everything
No need for God no need for him

Just take my hand you'll be my bride
Just take that fruit put it inside
You snake you dog you fake you liar
I've burned my hands I'm in the fire
Oh 
You salty dog you filthy liar
My heart it aches I'm in the fire

You snake I ate a true belief
Your rotten fruit inside of me
Oh Adam please you must believe
That snake put it in front of me
That snake put it in front of me
In front of me
