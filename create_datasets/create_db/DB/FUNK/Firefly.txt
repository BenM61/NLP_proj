Firefly, firefly:
Shine your light tonight.
Assist the moon and stars
In helping us
To ease our troubled minds.

Firefly, firefly:
Golden night of serenity, yeah;
Show us the light naturally,
And maybe she won't worry
When there ain't nothing I can do.

When sea runs dry,
And the stars fall from the sky;
She's a vulnerable flower,
And she believes in me.

Even when I had to lie,
I shouldn't have lied
To make the world feel alright.
Firefly, firefly.

Um, um, um, sometimes I feel
I have the weight of the world
On my shoulders, But knowing the
Strength she sees in me,
I smile because she believes me.

Firefly, firefly.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, firefly,
You make the world feel alright.
