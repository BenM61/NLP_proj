I have a stinger, I am a honeybee
I am a razor, please cut your wrists with me
Your supercommon, you flaunt your pedigree
Your clear as water ohwuhuhoh

I'm already spinnin in my grave
I'm already spinnin in my grave ohwuhuhoh

I am the subject of your documentary
You have a question?  I am the third degree
I am authentic, I'm authenticity
I'm no such thing-a ohwuhuhoh comeon!

I'm already spinnin in my grave
I'm already spinnin in my grave ohwuhuhoh
(its a damn shame)

I'm already spinnin in my grave
I'm already spittin on your grave ohwuhuhoh
