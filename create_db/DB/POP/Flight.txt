I've lost my balance
I fell from the trapeze
This act isn't easy
I've been under water
This storm has been raging
These nights I'm not sleeping
My dreams are now strangers to me

And I need you now
There's too many miles on my bones
I can't carry the weight of the world
No, not on my own

Your eyes are like lightning
Your voice is like water
This place is a desert

I've been walking in circles
I'm screaming for answers
I might fall into pieces
Or maybe I'm finally breaking through

I need you now
There's too many miles on my bones
I can't carry the weight of the world
No, not on my own

No more running, no more hiding
No more hurting, no more crying
No more trouble, no more sighing
No more falling, no more striving
No more heartache, no more fighting
No more fears, only flying

No more running, no more hiding
No more hurting, no more crying
No more trouble, no more sighing
No more falling, no more striving
No more heartache, no more fighting
No more fears, only flying

No more running, no more hiding
No more hurting, only flying
No more trouble, no more sighing
No more falling, only flying
No more heartache, no more fighting
No more fears, only flying
