Inside my deepest feelings
I know you won't do wrong
Don't say that I believe you
Because you know it's true

You've looked for something greater than this
I promise you it doesn't exist
And I wouldn't trade places for what I know

But I'll do something for you
No one else is going to do
Amplify your expectations
Transfer all my fears to you

You've looked for something greater than this
I promise you it doesn't exist
And I wouldn't trade places for what I know

But I'll do something for you
No one else is going to do

You've looked for something greater than this
I promise you it doesn't exist
And I wouldn't trade places for what I know
No I wouldn't trade places for what I know
I wouldn't trade places for what I know

But I'll do something for you
No one else is going to do
