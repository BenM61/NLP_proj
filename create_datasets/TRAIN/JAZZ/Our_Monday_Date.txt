Don't forget our Monday date
Oh little baby, don't be late
I said don't forget our Monday date
At the same little place, about half past eight

Now I'm gonna press my suit
I'm gonna shine my shoes
I'm gonna spread the news
And I'm gonna chase away the blues
So don't forget our Monday date
Please, baby, don't be late
