War is all around
I'm growing tired to fighting
I've been drained and I can't hide it
But I have strength for you, you're all that's real anymore
I am coming home now, I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

States are crumbling, and walls are rising high again
It's no place for the faint hearted
But my heart is strong 'cause now I know where I belong
It's you and I against the world
And we are free

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

We've gone against the tide
All we have is each other now
I am coming home now
I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

From this moment
From this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone
