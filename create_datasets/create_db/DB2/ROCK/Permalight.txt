It is wrong
It is wrong
It is wrong
It is wrong
To turn yourself off tonight when you're still young

Turn the light on tonight
Permalight
Say goodnight
Turn the light on tonight
Permalight
Say goodnight

(Beat)

(Feel)
(Now)

Record
No reform
Reborn
From life to death we are reborn
Fuelled by some unwritten line
We steal the sun

Turn the light on tonight
Permalight
Say goodnight
Turn the light on tonight
Permalight
Say goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Say goodnight

Turn the light on tonight
Permalight
Say goodnight
Turn the light on tonight
Permalight
Say goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Say goodnight
