Anonymous, autonomous
Will likely get the best of us yet
Before you disappear
If you can lend me half an ear I'll regret

If I treat you like a number
It's because I can't remember your name
So have another cigarette
And help me to forget what I came

You run too fast, fly too high
Run too fast and fly too high

On dark and lonely nights I'm only
Right when things are bright on the floor
Dancing and romancing
Gallivanting with a handsome I score

And if you don't believe me, you should
See me when I'm ready to roar
Cause I'll lose my concentration
With a new infatuation, I'm sure

You run too fast, fly too high
You run too fast, fly too high
We got no past, no goodbye
You run to fast and you fly too high

Would you believe
I was once gonna be somebody' Yeah
I packed up my bags and I
Took what I had to the city, yeah yeah

Man, I was rough
To find the best I could be
Waiting for the limit
On a color TV

Now I've made it this far
Got a room on the park and a view
And you
Fly too high

You run too fast, fly too high
Run too fast, fly too high
We got no past, no goodbye
Run to fast and you fly too

Hanging around on the infield, what do you steal
But another feel at the top'
Making believe in the long run, when a shotgun
Is the way to get out of the shop

Hang tail in a new jail, you can go bail
You can dance until you drop
Cause there's no fool like an old fool in a new school
You just can't stop

You run too fast, fly too high
Run too fast, fly too high
Got no past, no goodbye
Run to fast and you fly too
