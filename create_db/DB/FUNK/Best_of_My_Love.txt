Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly
I like the way you make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see
 
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
 
Flowing in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way
Holding hands ain't everybody's thing
But with me it plants the seed
In my heart forever growing
The kind of love I know you need
 
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
