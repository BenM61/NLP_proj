Hold me down to anything 
Anything that you see 
I should walk away right now 
I'll be there  so never mind 
I'll be the one to fall 
Waiting for you to look up at me 
Oh I love you the most 
Always giving up the ghost 
In your own private conversation 
You're a sweet mystery 
There is nothing in between 
You and the Mona Lisa 

Nothing in particular 
And everything in between 
This is what you mean to me 
Only you and only me 
Climbing in the right direction 
On the way to everything 

We were walking up high 
And no one thought to try 
But I was the one to blame 
And it was just a mirage 
So I hid in the garage 
'Til somebody called your name 

Oh I love you the most 
Always giving up the ghost 
In your own private conversation 
You're a sweet mystery 
And there's nothing in between 
You and the Mona Lisa 

Nothing in particular 
Just you and the Mona Lisa...
