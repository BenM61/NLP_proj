Someday, sweetheart,
You may be sorry
For what you've done
To my poor heart;
And you may regret
Those vows that you've broken,
And the things that you did to me
That made us drift apart.

Oh, you're happy now,
And you can't see how
Those weary blues
Will ever come to you;
But as you sow,
So shall you reap, dear;
And what you reap
Will gonna make you weep,
Someday, sweetheart!

Someday, sweetheart,
Oh you're gonna be sorry, oh yes1
For what you done
To my poor heart;
And you may regret
Those vows that you've broken, oh-oh-oh-oh!
And the things that you did to me
That made us drift apart.

Oh, you're happy now,
And you can't see how
Those weary blues
Ever gonna come to you;
But as you sow-ho-ho,
So shall you reap,
And what you reap
Is gonna make you weep,
Someday!

Come on baby,
Have a heart!
Don't you tell me
That we have to part.
You know I've loved you
From the start,
You'll rue the day,
And blue is the day
You break my heart.
