(You're gonna) fix my heart, you're gonna free my soul, 
Not many learn what the two of us can do or what we do it for. 
(I'm gonna) sign my name, I'm gonna join your club. 
You give me love and there's two of us to feel, 
Just say the word and I'm giving my love to you. 

You got me backtafunk, and I'm still turning. 
Got me backtafunk, and I'm still turning. 
You got me backtafunk, I can't explain, no alibi, 
The rhythm got me paralyzed, you got me. 

You call it deja vu, of being there before, 
So many lose what the few of us can find, 
And never mention, 
You're gonna break my will, 
You're gonna take me down, 
So many pay when the two of us can steal, 
So give me what I want and I could be a king for you. 

You got me backtafunk, and I'm still turning. 
Got me backtafunk, and I'm still turning. 
You got me backtafunk, I was so disorganized, 
Rhythm cut me down to size, you got me. 

Help me I'm in trouble deep, as high as I can go, it's no crime, 
There may be love on the street, and I'm bad enough, 
You got me drowning in my sleep but I will find you when I wake, and it's time, 
You got me. 

Backtafunk, to back
Backtafunk, to back
Backtafunk, to back
Backtafunk, to back

Backtafunk, oh, oh I'm still turning. 
Backtafunk, oh, oh I'm still burning
