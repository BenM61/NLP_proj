When I get to Warwick Avenue
Meet me by the entrance of the tube
We can talk things over a little time
But promise me you won't step outta line

When I get to Warwick Avenue
Please drop the past and be true
Don't think we're OK just because I'm here
You hurt me bad but I won't shed a tear

I'm leaving you for the last time baby
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I've been confused outta' my mind lately
You think you're loving but I want to be free
Baby you hurt me

When I get to Warwick Avenue oh
We'll spend an hour but no more than two
Our only chance to speak once more
I showed you the answers now here's the door

When I get to Warwick Avenue
I'll tell you baby, that we're through

I'm leaving you for the last time baby
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I've been confused outta' my mind lately
You think you're loving but I want to be free
Baby you hurt me

All the days spent together, I wish for better
But I didn't want the train to come, now it's departed
I'm broken hearted, seems like we never started.
All those things here together, when I wished for better
And I didn't want the train to come

You think you're loving, but you don't love me
I want to be free.
Baby you've hurt me, you don't love me,
I want to be free, baby you hurt (heard) me.
