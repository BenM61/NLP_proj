The big dirty sky's gonna fall in on me
It's heavy from the ashes of my lamplight
And if it rains inside, does it wash it all clean
Away from the burden of sight

If I bear my fruit
And invite the world to see
If I bear my fruit
Would you tear it from my tree

I'm still running around in here
I'm still waiting to see
I'm still running around in here
I'm still looking for me

Now this big dirty cloud is gonna rain down on me
It's heavy from the red eye of sight
But I'm still running round inside me
Though I built a little castle for my lamplight

If I bear my fruit
And invite the world to see
If I bear my fruit
Would you tear it from my tree

I'm still running around in here
I'm still waiting to see
And I'm still running around in here
I'm still looking for me

Now my big, hollow sun is burnin' out of control
And love is rainin' down on my lamplight
If want is luxury and need is revenge
The need was burnin' holes in me last night

If I bear my fruit
And invite the world to see
If I bear my fruit
Would you tear it from my tree

I'm still running around in here
I'm still running around in here
I'm still running around in here
I'm still running around in here
