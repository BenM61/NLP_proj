Ma said, I ain't right
Clutching on you all night
But you're my, you're my guy, Elvis

Slice my starry eye
Light his coat in turpentine
Kill the bitch that bats an eye, Elvis

When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
Hold your frame, whisper your name
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
And you don't breathe, so you can't leave

And they're comin'
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no 

(Touch) Shackled arms are tight, cause' papa said I cross the line
Carve us in our special time, Elvis
Now it's five by five
Finger paint and circle time
I love you till the day I die, Elvis

When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
Hold your frame, whisper your name
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
And you don't breathe, so you can't leave

And they're comin'
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no 

When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
Hold you by the frame, whisper your name
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
And you don't breathe, so you can't leave

And they're comin'
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no 

And they're comin' (When I feel your velvet, I can't help it)
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no 

And they're comin' (When I feel your velvet, I can't help it)
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no
