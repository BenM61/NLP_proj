I don't like it on the outside
Got to get on the inside
Won't you let me into your world

You walk around
With your head up high
On the street I stop
But you walk on by

Oh, sophisticated lady
You know I love you
So why do you put me through
The changes that you do?

Won't you let me into your world, lady
Please let me into your world, lady

The experts say, on the milky way
There's a pot of gold there, everyday
But in my world that pot of gold is in your eye
And in your arms my happiness lies

Won't you let me into your world, lady
Please let me into your world, sweet lady

Life is too short to live it alone
So let me into your world
Let me feel the happy home

Won't you let me into your world, lady
Please let me into your world, lady

No, no

I don't like it on the outside
Got to get on the inside
I don't like it on the outside
Got to get on the inside

I don't like it on the outside
Got to get on the inside
I don't like it on the outside
