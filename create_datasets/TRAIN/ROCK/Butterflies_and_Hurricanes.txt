Change,
Everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights, battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead

Best,
You've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And you use this chance to be heard
Your time is now

Change,
Everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead

Best,
You've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And you use this chance to be heard
Your time is now

Don't,
Let yourself down
Don't let yourself go
Your last chance has arrived

Best,
You've got to be the best
You've got to change the world
And you use this chance to be heard
Your time is now
