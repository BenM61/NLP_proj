I drive a beat-up car, a caravan, the color blue
Reminds me of your eyes and all the places we've been to
We're tethered to the leather, searching for a better view
It's interstellar when it's me and you

We're taking off uh uh uh
We're taking off uh uh uh

This is what I live for
Baby, you're my open road
You can take me anywhere the wind blows
Right into the great unknown
We can throw our hands up out the window
This is what we live for

We look up at the stars, a perfect night to dream with you
Got nineties retro on the radio, our favorite tune
I put the pedal to the metal just to laugh with you
It's interstellar when it's just us two

We're taking off uh uh uh
We're taking off uh uh uh

This is what I live for
Baby, you're my open road
You can take me anywhere the wind blows
Right into the great unknown
We can throw our hands up out the window
This is what we live for

(Oh oh) this is what we live for
(Oh oh) this is what we live for
This is what we live for
This is what we live for
This is what we live for
This is what we live for
This is what we live for
This is what we live for

We're taking off uh uh uh
We're taking off uh uh uh

This is what I live for
Baby, you're my open road
You can take me anywhere the wind blows
Right into the great unknown
We can throw our hands up out the window
This is what we live for (this is what we live for)

(Oh oh) this is what we live for
(Oh oh) this is what we live for
(Oh oh) this is what we live for
(Oh oh) this is what we live for
