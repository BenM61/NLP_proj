There are times when you must beckon,
There are times when you must fall.
You can take a lot of wrecking,
But you can't take it all.

There are times when i can help you out,
And times when you must fall.
There are times when you must live in doubt,
And i can't help at all.

Two blue stars, shine o'er the hill.
Plead no more, now just be still.
Through the night, now safely there.
Show me something built to last.

Been held by the fire,
Yes and i'm, held by the ring.
You can walk on balls of fire,
But sometimes you might bleed.

There are times when i have begged you
And you do the same to me.
If you can't or won't admit it,
At least we pulled you through.

Three blue stars, set o'er the hill.
Call them back; you never will.
All these trials, soon be dead.
We all need something built to last.

Built to last 'till time of seven,
Falls tumbling from the sky.
Built to last 'till lightness fades,
And darkness falls on all.
Built to last 'till years roll back
Our couch perched in the sky
Show me something different,
Or something built to try.

There are times when you get hit up on,
Try hard but you cannot give.
Other times, you'd gladly go
With what you need to give.

Don't be afraid to save your face,
When you have done your best
Now i won't forget,
Next day try the rest.

All the stars, are gone but one.
Morning dreams, we found the sun.
Show me something built to last

Two blue stones, shine o'er the hill.
Call it back; you never will
All these trials, now are dead.
Show me something built to last.

All the stars, are gone but one.
Morning dreams. here comes the sun.
Through the night, now sinking fast.
Show me something built to last.
