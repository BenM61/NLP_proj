No one to love me, no one to care
It's mighty hard for me to bear
This seems to be my last affair
My gal is gone

Just as sure as the sun
Shine up in the skies above
Why you cannot be happy
When you ain't with the one you love

Now I'm as lonesome as I can be
Nothing else to live for, as I can see
My happiness is misery
My gal is gone

Baby, baby, baby
Please come back to me
If I been a bad fella
I did not intend to be

Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
Lord, my gal is gone

My heart is heavy and achin' so
I walk and I worry from door to door
But I don't feel welcome, no place I go
Lord, my gal is gone

I set a-waitin'
But I never do get no mail
I'm drifting and worrying
Just like a ship without a sail
