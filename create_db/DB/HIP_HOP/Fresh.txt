Wrist pinker than Miss Piggy the puppet, h*** love it
Kids love the ice, colors are Barney and Teletubbies
Chrome dubbies, diamonds in our charms are sour
Apple green, Jolly Ranch icon, paint the Tahoe

Snapple juice fruit, this what Drizzle used to
Know I burn calories, Caddy brown like booze do
I'm a lion, you moose food, tell you what I'm used to
Colorado cook a mountain of *** the truth, fool

Nothin' less than a deuce, fool, grind four ways
The back tires on the 5 turn 180 degrees, slide both ways
Show you how the mink on ***
Color orange'll drop a brown like a chico stick

You know I'm comin' back with 'Migo B***

That Regal watermelon red, rims watermelon red
They think I think I'm all that, I got a watermelon head
Big bank roll, heavy as a watermelon, weigh it
Do it after I say it, know the game when I play it

Know I'm runnin' wit Fed when he hit a hundred thousand
Through wit the regular cars, now the Feds browsin'
Grown man housin', they landed on my island
I'ma continue firin', wipin' 'em out like Thailand

Chevy guts gator, I'ma paint the Regal violet
Laffy Taffy, Polo clothes, Fabo, them be whylin'

All these n*** bitin' while these *** have sex with me
Knew I was a extra G when I pulled up wit extra heat
Yeah, I got a Charger, what about the Aqua Lexus jeep?

The block life finessin' me, caressin' me and hexin' me
Big birds, got 'em on the street, call 'em Sesame
The D.A. is ejectin' me, lawyer make 'em let me free
Big feet, eight pants started back in '73

Thought we paid 10 for the block, we paid 73
