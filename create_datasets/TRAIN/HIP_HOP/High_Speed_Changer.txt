Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to keep holdin' on and on
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to cling to nothing
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to keep holdin' on and on
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Don't you want to take your chances 

There's been times when I've been so close and held out
Fell down, lost count
When my own exhaust exceeds me and my drive is in doubt
I've been a host to failure
When I start to forget to remind myself of the reasons
And I hold my breath for too long 

Intention praises no one 
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to keep holdin' on and on
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to cling to nothing
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to keep holdin' on and on
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Don't you want to take your chances 

I've been told desisive isn't helpful but sometimes it cures
The slow into resourceful with reaction as the lure
Simple doesn't matter disguised as the complex
A fraction of disaster and we try to forget for too long 

Intention praises
Intention praises no one 

Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to keep holdin' on and on
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to cling to nothing
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Do you want to keep holdin' on and on
Do you want to watch yourself fly
Don't you want to take your chances
