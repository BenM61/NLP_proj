[ODB]
I ain't no nigga

My words can't be held against me
I'm not caught up in your law

All music must obey me
All pain must obey me
I cripple my enemies
Got that careful vocabulary
I can talk my way up out of anything
Nobody's words can go against me
I'm stingy, I want all that energy
Osirus, the best nigga in the place to be
I two hundred hot degree
Burning ya til you faint why'all
why'all niggas shooting blanks why'all
I'm fucking my vest, drive an armored tank why'all
I dead niggas like a dog buries a bone
You could never set me up I raise the pain volume
Nominate me, as presidential MC
My career so intelligent unique physique
A nigga please!

[ODB and RZA]
[Chorus]
You could never f*ck with the dog,
A nigga please!
Nigga I will bury ya bone
A nigga please!
I'm the one who burned ya home
A nigga please!

Watch your shit fall like Rome
I'm immune to all viruses
I get the cocaine it cleans out my sinuses
Just for slinging *nuh* I get a quarter a mil
I'll have it raining ice drops the size of automobiles
Kill all the government microchips in my body
I'm the paranoid nigga at your party
I kill all my enemies at birth!
Shut the f*ck up!
Bitch and let my slide my hands up your skirt
Nigga please!

[Chorus]
Nigga please! (You could never f*ck with the dog) [x5]
[RZA]
Straight up! ODB type shit
why'all watch out for the Abbott and Crazy Monk
Coming soon
Splashed why'all with the organic hip-hop spazola type
Naw mean
Straight up!
For born in on
