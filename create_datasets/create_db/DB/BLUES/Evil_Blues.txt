Yes, yes
Worst feelin' I ever had
Yes, yes
Worst feelin' I ever had
These old evil blues
Have treated me awful bad

I had the blues all night
I'll be glad when mornin' comes
I've had the blues all night
I'll be glad when the mornin' comes
I'm gonna have a talk with some gypsy
See what evil have I done

Play it one time, boy

These old evil blues
Have been followin' me all this week
These old evil blues
Have been followin' me all this week
I can't rest at midnight
And day, I just can't sleep

Take it boy, take it

Down in old Death Valley
Tombstones and old dry bones
Down in old Death Valley
Tombstones and old dry bones
These old evil blues keep followin' me
Death Valley gonna be my home
