I feel unhappy
I am so sad
I've lost the best friend
That I ever had

She is my baby
I love her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go

We're going through changes (ooh) 
We're going through changes (ah, ah, ah) 

We've shared the years 
We've shared each day 
I love you daddy 
But I found my way 

You know the world 
Is an evil place?
My baby is grown now 
She's found her way 

(Ah ah ah, ooh) 
We're going through changes (ah ah, ooh) 
We're going through changes
(Ah, ah, ah) 

It took so long 
To realize 
And I can still hear 
His last goodbyes (bye bye)

Now all my days (ooh)
I'm filled with fears 
Wish I could go back (come back)
And change the years (change the years)

We're going through changes (changes) 
We're going through changes (changes) 
We're going through

Changes 
Changes 
Changes
Changes
