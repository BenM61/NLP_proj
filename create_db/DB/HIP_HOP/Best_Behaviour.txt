Dragged my bags off the plane today a little to much fun on tour
Lord please help me find my keys or im banging down my own door

All the cheering and all the applause who could ask for more
Now I wouldnt mind finding a real thing ready when my bags finally jitneys floor

See I need some kinda lady
That would feed me daily
Everytime I come home she'd be waiting for me

Cuzz iv'e been thinking lately that life alone is crazy I wanna hold somebody when I sleep

Aaaaa Aaaaa
Who's gonna be the one to save me
Will I ever settle Down all I do is run around this is takin to long

Love is all I need (love is all I need)
I've waited all my life (waited all my life)    X2

You got me on my best behavior
Woahhh Woahhh

Woahhh Woahhh
How long before you save me baby

I've just finished the tour today and my bags dropped to my door I walked up to an empty room and I was crying on my own floor

All the bright lights and all the surprises tell me what they mean Cuzz if I'm standin on a stage in front of so many people and I feel like it's just me

See I need some kinda man that
That can understand that
The female boss is who I'll have to be
Cuzz sometimes I get lonely
I just need a homie
Then I might let em be the boss of me

Aaaaahh
Who's gonna be the one to save me
Will I ever settle down
All I do is run around
This is takin to long

Love is all i need (love is all I need)
Ive waited all my life (waited all my life).       X2

You got on my best behavior
