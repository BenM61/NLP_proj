My kinda love, your kinda love
Keeps me believing, although you're deceiving
My kinda love, one way to paradise

My kinda lips, your kinda lips
When love comes stealing, encourage that feeling
My kinda love, one way to paradise

Although you're happy today
You may be gone tomorrow
Love comes but once, don't be a dunce
When you need it, steal it, beg or borrow

I'm fond of you, you're fond of me
Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
My kinda love, one way to paradise

Although you're happy today
You may be gone tomorrow
Love comes but once, don't be a dunce
When you need it, beg or steal or borrow

I'm fond of you, you're fond of me
Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
My kinda love, one way to paradise
