Yeah man, I'mma get me a boat
I'ma Ride that bad boy down Nostradamus, man

Let it roll, coming at waves
Let it roll, coming at waves
Let it roll, coming at waves
Let it roll, coming at waves

Yo, I love the way it feels
Man, it feels good
Yo this track got a feel man its real good 
Got the ill melody but it's still hood
You know the deal
Yo, I never let up
Keep it flashier than old-school get-ups
Got it crackin' like old-school leather
Reminiscent of a more wholesome era
I would ask a little girl if we could go together
Little Stewie finish, red, the harmonica
Archie and Jughead, Betty and Veronica
I learned life ain't a comic though
No, put away the toys a long time ago
New name for the studio, it's Kweliwood
Jolly good flow, get all [?] of the [?]
Back and forth on the stage with Yasiin
Got a group with [?], he probably would

Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
Let it roll, coming at waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
Let it roll, coming at waves

All my language is romantic
So Latin, I don't even know Spanish
All I know is I'm scorched to the Puritans
Most tyranis rapper on the whole planet
I'm the one who was never supposed to be here
I'm the one the haters see, let's be clear
Bet now you remember me
Give you a reminder cause you act like your memory
Lost like Dory, while you off Finding Nemo
Talkin' you a boss you as soft as Brian Eno
Tellin' all these stories, why you lying to the people?
Why you frontin' like you wanna but you rhyming kinda emo?
Tryna find a needle in a haystack is easier than tryna find a leader in the mainstream media
Never knowing where we headed
Until we're following each other off the cliff like Lemmings

Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
Let it roll, coming at waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
Let it roll, coming at waves

Let it roll get bold, big daddy Kane style never gonna get old
Spit flows to leviticus at skid row
Tip toe when you entering the zip code
Pistols brandishing we never hand them in
Accessory to crime gotta handle the shenanigans
And a hand got rings like the mandarin
Ugly scents picking polo working piece the mannequin 
Now I'm feeling like the new wave
Like I'm two days deep into my blue phase
My baby hate that I'm living out a suitcase
Like I forgot to tie the knot like a shoelace 
Let me be your liberator
Get yourself together we gonna we each other later
You could be my lover you could be another hater
Why you frontin' trying to run from all the CVS behavior like

Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
Let it roll, coming at waves
Girl, I'd like to stay here, I would
But baby, you know I got to go get that paper
