Twenty years or more
We had a plan
To build the finest street ride
In the whole damn land

Some dip down for keys
Some cheetah slicks
Leather bars and the holly
Just for kicks

Happenin' since the dawn of time
Big block will shut you down, off the line
In California, there is no stopping
In California, the California crossing

We didn't know
Couldn't foresee
Cold blooded snake
Building up heat

Tries to fly but it's no use
Cobra's got the bird and it's loose
In California, there is no stopping
In California, the California crossing

In between runs
Through oil and smoke
Thought to myself
Did we ever choke?

Happenin' since
The dawn of time
Big block will shut you down
Off the line

Tries to fly but it's no use, it's no use
There is no stopping
California, the California crossing
In California, there is no stopping
In California, the California crossing
