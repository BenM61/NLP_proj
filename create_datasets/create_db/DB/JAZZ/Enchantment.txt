I wait for you
I don't know why
All I know is I can't hide
At this temperature you could take over my mind

Like gossamer, you softly touch
He draws me in, I'm powerless
He possesses an enchantment

Tell me I'm forgiven
He calls; don't know how I fell under his spell
Lately, I've been driven
He smiles an enchantment

I wait for you
I'm mesmerized
This love is like a potion in disguise
I'd tightrope walk with a blindfold on my eyes

I can't escape, or so it seems
I'd run away; he's in my dreams
He possesses an enchantment

Tell me I'm forgiven
He calls; don't know how I fell under his spell
Lately, I've been driven
He smiles an enchantment

It's the kind of sleepwalk that never ends
A type of loan with no dividends
It's a parlor game where you're giving chase
Guess it could be called an acquired taste
I know, he knows, he calls, I go, I know
This could be an enchantment

Why don't you tell me I'm forgiven?
He calls; don't know how I fell under his spell
I'm forgiven
Lately, I've been driven
(He smiles) and I give in
An enchantment
