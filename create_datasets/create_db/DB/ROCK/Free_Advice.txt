Woman says she loves me, she gives me free advice
Woman says she loves me, she gives me free advice
I wonder who it is she loves if she wants me to be so nice

Her friends, they are perfect but I'm always a fool
Her friends, they are perfect but I'm always a fool
She brings them all around to watch me blow my cool

The more she says she loves me the more she puts me down
The more she says she loves me the more she puts me down
It seems her head's caught up in some real fine merry-go-round
