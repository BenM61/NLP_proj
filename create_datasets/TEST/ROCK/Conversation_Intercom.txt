Time and time again
Translation seems to sabotage
The words
You know what is said
Is not what is heard
Damn this mean device
It makes a whispering man sound as if he cries
It's the pinnacle of what is cynical
CONVERSATION INTERCOM
You hear what I say but
It comes out all wrong
CONVERSATION INTERCOM
You say what I see still
You speak in different tongues
Don't act like a fool
It makes you so uncool and
That's what it does best
'cause if anything
It's just a temper-test
Fill in your own words
Yeah
1-800 Dial-to-be-heard
It's the pinnacle
Of what is typical
CONVERSATION INTERCOM
You hear what I say
But it comes out all wrong
CONVERSATION INTERCOM
You say what I see still
You speak in different tongues
...
Clap your hands and you know what to do...
My ears attend to you...
As people listen intently...
Can you copy?...
Do you receive?...
Do you receive?...
Damn this mean device
It makes a whispering man sound as if he cries,
Saturday
Saturday, oh Saturday
How cruel of you to go away
You turn us on and you don't even have the decency to stay
We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Walking like a chameleon
Turn around and turn me on and make that sound you do so well 'cause
I'm not dancing I'm just shifting weight
I thought that you could tell
We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Talking like a chameleon
SOMETIMES love KILLS TIME
IT JUST MIGHT TONIGHT
Neon claws and drama queens agree to like the local band
Everyone is smoking filter cigarettes all over again
We think that we're so cool
And make the others drool
Walking like a chameleon
SOMETIMES love KILLS TIME
IT JUST MIGHT TONIGHT
SOMETIMES love KILLS TIME
IT JUST MIGHT TONIGHT
SOMETIMES love KILLS TIME
IT JUST MIGHT TONIGHT
SOMETIMES love KILLS TIME
IT JUST MIGHT TONIGHT

When logics die
And the place of sadness
I occupy with dignity
Was left like a dream among stones
And the words that you spill
From the mouth that you fill
They abandon their grace and fatigue
Oh, to feel without touching
And speak without talking
You'll spill
The tissues of lies
How I wish we could mend this
Or learn how to throw away
As we look for someone to blame
Love's been denied
Don't be polite
I owe you nothing
When logics die
I'm the orgy and the distant cool
The friend you will never fool
I like the way you oppose me
Let the last thoughtd languish
And try and distinguish
You'll spill the tissues of lies
How I wish we could mend this
Or learn how to throw away
As we look for someone to blame
Love's been denied
Don't be polite
I owe you nothing
When logics die
Much against evryone's advice
I
Seem to have a history
At missing the point
At this stuff
Apparently
Very absentmindedly
I care
But never enough
For
...
You
TIIIIIIIIIME-to set the record straight
TIIIIIIIIIME-to stop communicating
Please anticipate
AND I'M TRYING TO COMPREHEND THE THINGS I WRITE
AND I'M LIVING THE LIE THAT I CANNOT SATISFY
MUCH AGAINST EVERYONE'S ADVICE
I'M STILL TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING
Faith
Cheated me of everything
But I laughed until
I stopped
Publicly
Very, very openly
I sat alone with my thoughts
For
...
You
TIIIIIIIIIME-to set the record straight
TIIIIIIIIIME-to stop communicating
Please anticipate
AND I'M TRYING TO COMPREHEND THE THINGS I WRITE
AND I'M LIVING THE LIE THAT I CANNOT SATISFY
MUCH AGAINST EVERYONE'S ADVICE
I'M STILL TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING
Overweight karate kid
Like an overweight karate
Kid you could moonwalk over my heart
Using candour as painkiller
Tastes like vanilla to me
Occasionally
Someone please make go home, I'm
The worst at being alone
Just tell me I ought to watch
INFOMERCIALS FOR LOVE
And buy all of their trust
Saturdays have shown us I'm not
The world's most talkative guy
You say it's fine
But I can always try and answer
With amplified anger, and
Then cry inside
Someone please make go home, I'm
The worst at being alone
Just tell me I ought to watch
INFOMERCIALS FOR LOVE
And buy all of their trust
Proverbial pants
Don't let this heart pollute you
Cross your legs and hope to die, 'cause
Saturday night was god's way
Of telling me I ought to
Know- proverbial pants
Please not again
Oh proverbial pants
Please not again
All I can do is warn you
In some stupid-half way
Please tell me that you love me
But not too loud
Oh-proverbial pants
Please not again
DON'T COME TOO CLOSE CAUSE YOU'LL RUIN IT
YOU'LL HOLD IT AGAINST ME
INEVITABLY
CONSEQUENTLY
Tell me what am I wearing
When you think of me?
This ought to be embarrassing
You- not me
Oh-proverbial pants
Please not again
DON'T COME TOO CLOSE CAUSE YOU'LL RUIN IT
YOU'LL HOLD IT AGAINST ME
INEVITABLY
CONSEQUENTLY
The salty knowledge of tears
Somebody,
Take this love and run away
'cause I don't care
It is all I can say
I KEEP ON LOSING YOU
AND FINDING YOU
Take me upstairs and
Into your arms
Do not be deceived by my charms
I KEEP ON LOSING YOU
AND FINDING YOU
That's why I fear
All the salty knowledge of tears
Just shut your mouth and kiss me
Just close your eyes
Punish yourself with a handkerchief
I don't reply
That's why I fear
All the salty knowledge of tears
Flying without wings
If love ever comes barging in like that again,
That's it, I'm calling security.
If time ever tries to pull one of those stunts again,
You'd better believe, it ain't me, it ain't me.
'cause everything you try to conceal
Is everything you want to reveal
Flying without wings
I wish I just couldn't feel a thing
It goes to show: you never know
More than this
Guess I had it coming
Ambition is my worst vice
Next thing I know
Time is having it's way with me
Working hard at putting skin on baloney
It all makes sense in some way I forget right now
Somehow I manage to fool
Myself and everyone else
That this is really just
Only, maybe, only,
Just the meantime
Meantime
Frequent liar mileage
As if I had a choice
Limp to the edge of patience
And let yourself fall
Wearing out mirrors
All over the world
I hope I can get far playing
Air guitar
In the meantime
Meantime
There has to be more than this
There has to be more than this
Somehow I manage to fool
Myself and everyone else
That this is really just
Only, maybe, only,
Just the meantime
Meantime
There has to be more than this
Too many DJ's
Everybody wants to be the dj
Everybody thinks it's oh so easy
You think you belong and you come on strong,
But I can still tell the right from the wrong.
I could never be that kind of girl
Nobody takes the time to turn
You always act as if it's understood,
But sweet revenge is finger-lickin' good
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
Something's got to give
'cause I don't know
Here's one thing how to understand me
Loneliness tastes like cotton candy.
You answer "I love you" with "I know",
Never check the messages on your answerphone
If only I could sell myself
The way that even I would buy
Something's got to give
'cause I don't know
Temptingly yours
Maybe I'm wrong
But I could've sworn
I saw your eye twitch.
Didn't object,
What did you expect?
Now I have to tell you:
Don't come back to tempt me.
I'm happy in my misery.
You asked what I did,
I did what you asked,
But I couldn't get it
Right from the start
You went for my heart,
Now I have to ask you
Don't come back to tempt me.
I'm happy in my misery.
It was your idea in the first place
And I know it takes two but on certain days
I try not to think of how it would be if...
I don't pretend
To know where it ends
Wish I could care less.
One time I cried more
In 1994
But that doesn't count I guess.
Scream
Like she was scream
I try to hear
What's in my dreams
I gotta fear
I cannot breathe
Please hold me tight
I try to feel
Don't talk so fast
This radioactive she
What she does to me
Caught her inside, cuts like a knife
She's like a scream to me
I'm not afraid
I cannot help
There's no disguise, no alibies
What do I think
I cannot say
Something about me
Like she was here
This radioactive she
What she
