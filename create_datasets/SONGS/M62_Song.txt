Moonshine 
I'm waiting for a love that never comes 
Moonshine 
Wishing for a time that never was 

I'm waiting for a time 
For truth to call 
I'm waiting for a sign 
To show me all 
I'm waiting for my love 

Moonshine 
Drinking to a love that's gone on by 
Moonshine 
Look into the stars as cars go by 

I'm waiting for a time 
For truth to call 
I'm waiting for a sign 
To show me all 
I'm waiting for my love 

I'm waiting for a time 
For truth to call 
I'm waiting for a sign 
To show me all 
I'm waiting for my love 
Waiting for my love 
Waiting for my love 

Moonshine 
I'm waiting for a love that never comes
