you know i'm not a single man 
but anyway you think you can 
come up to me and make a try 
by saying make this a night to remember 

what you said to me 
what you did to me 
what you wanted me to do 
what you said last night 
when you came up tight 
what was i supposed to do 

i don't know what made you believe 
my simple heart could be so weak 
that i could fall for your offence 
in saying make this a night to remember

what you said to me 
what you did to me 
what you wanted me to do 
what you said last night 
when you came up tight 
what was i supposed to do 

don't worry, don't worry 
you know my lips are sealed
