When I wake up in the morning time
I like to see you sleeping by my side
I think about the nights we had before
Wanna give you this and more
Let you know I truly adore you

Being with you, loving you this way is so sweet
The way you kiss me, you're making my knees go weak
We could be forever happy, through rain or whatever
Never gonna take the fantasy away from you

[Chorus]
I need to be everything you see in your dreams
It seems to me you'll never find another lover gold as I, 
To give you all that you need
And I'll be there to love you each and every night and all through the day

There was a time that I didn't have you around
Back in them days my heart never made a sound
Now it's beating like my head's in the clouds 
Never doubt that I'ma always be down to hang around you

You're making me feel so good inside
The way I feel when you love me makes me wanna cry
All these truffle of the things you do, make my love dream come true 
Moving me to tell you that I love you

[Chorus]
