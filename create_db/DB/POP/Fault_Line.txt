I feel safe when we are standing in the wreckage
Are we hopeless pulled in opposite directions
Just when I was thinking that I couldn't be lonely any longer
You start to pull me under when I try to keep my head above the water

Tremble and shake
We can't rewrite all our mistakes
Lovers on a fault line
The things we say
When we're both right
Will ricochet, lovers on a fault line
And we both know
You and I will never change
But we're holding on until we feel it break
It's too late to be the first to walk away
When we're lovers on a fault line

You kissed me too hard
I thought you had the best intentions
You took it too far
Always desperate for attention
Just when I was thinking that I couldn't be lonely any longer
You start to pull me under when I try to keep my head above the water

Tremble and shake
We can't rewrite all our mistakes
Lovers on a fault line
The things we say
When we're both right
Will ricochet, lovers on a fault line
And we both know
You and I will never change
But we're holding on until we feel it break
It's too late to be the first to walk away
When we're lovers on a fault line

I'm scared that I am drowning in an open sea
You're standing on the shore not even noticing
Just when I was thinking that I couldn't be lonely any longer

Tremble and shake
We can't rewrite all our mistakes
Lovers on a fault line
The things we say
When we're both right
Will ricochet, lovers on a fault line
And we both know
You and I will never change
But we're holding on until we feel it break
It's too late to be the first to walk away
When we're lovers on a fault line

I feel safe when we are standing in the wreckage
