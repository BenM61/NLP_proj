Loving you, is killing me
When you know it should be thrilling me

Loving you, is choking me slowly
When I'm with you I still feel real lowly

Loving you, is busting me
You don't ever put your trust in me

Loving you, should mean that I'm your king
You don't make me feel like anything

[Chorus]
Now I never knew you'd be so evil
How did you get to be so evil yeah
Now you telling me, that I'm bad to you
You don't know what your talking 'bout girl
Hear me when I say
You can't just do whatever you want, girl

Loving you, is killing me
When you know it should fulfill me

Loving you, is aching me sadly
You know that it should make me happy

Loving you, ain't worth all the suff'ring
In return you never give me nothing

Here's the news about loving you
Well it's something that I used to do

Stop children, whats that sound
Looking my heart all over the ground

Stop children, what you see
Why you keep shootin' at me

[Chorus]

I never knew you'd be so evil
How did you get to be so evil yeah

Now you telling me, that I'm bad to you
You don't know what your talking 'bout girl

Hear me when I say
You can't just do whatever you want, girl

Loving you 
Is killing me
Is killing me

Loving you 
Is killing me
Is killing me yeah

Loving you, is killing me
When you know it should be building me

Loving you, is holding me back
Why the hell you make me feel like that

Loving you, ain't worth all the suff'ring
In return you never give me nothing

Here's the news about loving you
Well it's something that I used to do

[Chorus]

I never knew you'd be so evil
How did you get to be so evil yeah

Now you telling me, that I'm bad to you
You don't know what your talking 'bout girl

Hear me when I say
You can't just do whatever you want, girl
