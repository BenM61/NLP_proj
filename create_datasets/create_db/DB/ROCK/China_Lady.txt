Sweet China lady, you dance all night 
I want you baby, so hold me tight 
C'mon, let's do it now, c'mon 
Too much time, c'mon 
Need you right now, c'mon 

Set me on fire the whole night long 
Feel my desire, or break this down 
C'mon, need you tonight, c'mon 
I'll be alright, c'mon 
(That'll be good) c'mon 

[Chorus]
Sweet china lady 
Don't bring me down no no no 
Sweet china lady 
It's time tonight, I want you 
Sweet china lady 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 

Just another one night stand 
I want to be free 
Then we're not free 

C'mon, just you and me, c'mon 
Give me your love, c'mon 
Kick it back, c'mon 

[Chorus]
