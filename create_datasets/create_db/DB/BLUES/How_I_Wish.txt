How I wish that you were here again
 How I wish that you were here again

If I could see you and touch you with my hand
If I could feel you, I know damn well I can't

How I wish that you were here again
How I wish I had you near again

If I could see you, Oh just now and then
If I could feel you, I'd do my time again

Oh Honey, honey, honey, Yeah

If I could kiss you, caress you now and then
Ooh just to thrill you, I'd do life again, Yeah

Oh Honey, honey, honey, Yeah

How I wish that you were here again
Oh Honey, honey, yeah
How I wish you were here again, Oh honey
