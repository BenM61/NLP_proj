I want to rock, just rock, if the feeling is fine
Wouldn't it be fun for each one to rock all of the time
I want to rock, just rock, it's a pleasure to swing
Come and join the crowd, shout out loud, rock is really the thing
You have to stomp your feet and clap your hands so come on, begin
We're gonna swing and sway till that great day
So lace up your shoes, throw 'way your blues

I want to rock, just rock, it's so easy and free
Take a little bow, step on out, come and rock it with me

Oh, rock it, rock it, rock it, brother Calloway
Hold the rock here (digthis little break then cut on out)
Solid, boys, that beat, I want to rock, just rock, yes, the feeling is fine
Wouldn't it be fun for each one to rock all of the time (beat that jam on out)
I want to rock it and a rock it and a rock it and a rock it, it's a pleasure to swing
Come and join me crowd, shout out loud rock is feeling the thing
(Oh, rock it, pa)
You stomp your feet and clap your hands so come on, begin
We're gonna swing and sway till that great day
Lace up your shoes, throw away your blues
Rock, rock
It's easy and free
Take a little bow, step up now, come on, rock it with me
