I'm never afraid to be the person I'm made to be,
And that's what makes me believe.
That somewhere inside of me is someone who longs to be
A whole lot more like you, a more convincing truth.

And I want to be caught up in you,
I'm standing on the edge of tomorrow.
And I want to live my life in your shoes.

For I am just a breath, breathe your life in me,
My soul longs to be with you.
And I am just a child, do your work in me,
Cause I want to be a fool for you.

I give you all my pride, Oh Lord please hear my cry,
And be acquainted with my grief.
A friend to the broken heart, you finish what you start,
And that's what makes me believe.

That I can be caught up in you,
Even when I'm standing in sorrow.
You help me walk each day in your shoes.

For I am just a breath, breathe your life in me,
My soul longs to be with you.
And I am just a child, do your work in me,
Cause I want to be a fool for you.

Even when my spirit grows faint,
Even when my soul is crushed.
Lord you never hesitate,
You've given me so much.
