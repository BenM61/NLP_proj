Bluebird you sing of happiness
Swinging in a blossom laden tree
But tell me bluebird
Will there be happiness for me?

Will I discover Someone to care for me?
A perfect lover to hold me tenderly?
Will someone ever sing me A love song while we dance?
Will the music bring me romance?

Will there be someone Whenever skies are gray
To kiss my lonely tears away?
And will that someone be all I dreamed my love would be
Someone to care for me?
