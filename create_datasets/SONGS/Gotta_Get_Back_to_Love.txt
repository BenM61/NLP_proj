Gotta get back to love
Gotta get back to love
Gotta get back to love and romance

What happened to that old feelin' we knew
Remember how my lovin' eyes would dance all over you
And when you touched my hand, makin' love was the plan
Stop that clock upon the wall and turn it back where we started

Gotta get back to love like how it used to be
Oh baby, think of all the memories
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance

Why can't we be like the rainbow sea
'Cause right behind the raging storm, the colors all agree
Uh, lay down beside me, boy, we'll talk about what went wrong
Take the shining from my love and let the bright light start shining

Gotta get back to love like how it used to be
Oh baby, think of all the memories
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance
All that time together, we gotta make the lovin' better

We can't turn back now at following a dream
We gotta keep reachin' for that higher star
Where you gonna run to if I turn and walk away
Don't give up on me, baby, when you know, when you know there's a way
Uh, I know, I know, I know, we can make it

Gotta get back to love like how it used to be
Oh baby, think of all the memories
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance

Gotta get back to love
Uh, I know, I know, I
Gotta get back to love
Like how it used to be
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance with you
