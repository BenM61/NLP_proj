Satellite in my eyes
Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite

Satellite headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle?

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite
Rest high above the clouds; no restriction
Television we bounce 'round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling
I laugh about this weatherman's satellite eyes

Satellite in my eyes
Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite

Rest high above the clouds, no restriction
Television, we bounce 'round this world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling
I laugh about this weatherman's satellite eyes
