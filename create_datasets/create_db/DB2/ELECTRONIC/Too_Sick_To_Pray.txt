I'm in a lonely room
Hank Williams sings a lovesick blues
Winter's walking up the avenue
But I ain't seen the sunshine since the 6th o' June
But i tell ya this

Don't call the doctor 
I'm gonna get better
don't run for the priest
I'm gonna find some faith
Just because I burned my bible baby
It don't mean I'm too sick to pray

I'm in a crowded place yeah
But i can't recognise a single face
And they say the thrill is in the chase
Well i ain't got the legs i ain't got the legs to run that race
But i tell ya this

Don't call the doctor 
I'm gonna get better
don't run for the priest
I'm gonna find some faith

Just because I burned my bible baby
It don't mean I'm too sick to pray

Better burn a candle bright 
Raise up some ghosts tonight

They say I made my money messing up young minds 
Stopped the congregation n i left em all cryin
In the rain, yeah left em with their pain
Exit your boy with his ill gotten gains
Well the blood runs deep and the blood runs cold
As the knife slits on another sucker is born
Thrown into this world alone
Doctor came a'knockin wasn't nobody home

Ease the pain

Don't call the doctor 
I'm gonna get better
don't run for the priest
I'm gonna find some faith
Just because I burned my bible baby
It don't mean I'm too sick to pray
