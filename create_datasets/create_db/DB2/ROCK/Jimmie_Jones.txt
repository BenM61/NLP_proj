Do you wanna feel good
Do you wanna feel anything
Do you wanna keep searching
Cause there's no other reason
Do you wanna feel small
Or do you wanna fight back
Or do you wanna new soul
To stop your heart attack
Do you wanna take a walk
Then come into the garden with me

They tell me jimmies seen a sign
Says he understand everything
They tell me jimmies got a line
To the man from the ministry
But jimmies on sale
He's got a mouth to feed
He's got a mission in life
A thousand lives to lead
Do you wanna take his hand
And come into the garden with me

Jimmie Jones and his soul clones will get you

There's a rumor going round
That the gardens not the place to be
And little jimmies in the dark
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
So we've all gotta change clothes
And we've all gotta change sides
We gotta love you leave you
Miles behind
But if you wanna take a walk
Then come into the garden with me

Jimmie Jones and his soul clones will get you

Heaven is, heaven is
Jimmie says, heaven is
Heaven is logical heaven is physical
Wonderful, beautiful, saleable, cynical
Heaven is the space between your eyes
Where you disguise your little lives
One step more, Jimmie Jones
