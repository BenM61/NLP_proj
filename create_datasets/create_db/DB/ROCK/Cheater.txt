If these are the rules
And if these are the laws
Then I will play falsely
Cause they're filled with flaws

I won't play your game
Cause I think that it's lame
And if you feel just like a do
Oh! You can become-come a chea-chea-chea-cheater too

Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
If you feel just like I do
You can become a cheater too, yeah!

I'm a brick through your window
A stick in your machinery
A time bomb ready to blow
I'm Friday thirteen on your diary

I won't play your game
Cause I think that it's lame
And if you feel just like a do
You can become-come a chea-chea-chea-cheater too

Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
And if you feel just like I do
You can become a cheater too, all along you cheater sing

Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
You can become a cheater too
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
You can become a cheater too
If you feel just like a do
Yeah! I promise that it's true
You can become a cheater too

Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
