She sees me, she understands
She helps, with all of my fears
When we stand, together for life
Who will hold, a child in her arms

She reaches out, so many friends
Who seek, to lift this world
When we stand, together for life
She will hold, a child in her arms

Without woman, earth would fade and die
Without woman, who am I
Who am I, on this island of faith
Who am I, on this island of life
You are the sea
You are the sky
You are the ocean
I am the earth
I am the island
Of your love

She listens, she understands
For those, searching for truth
We will stand, together for life
We will hold, a child in our arms

Without woman, earth would fade and die
Without woman, who am I
Who am I, on this island of faith
Who am I, on this island of life
You are the sea
You are the sky
You are the ocean
I am the earth
I am the island
Of your love

She sees me, she understands
She helps, with all of my fears
When we stand, together for life
She will hold, a child in her arms

Without woman, earth would fade and die
Without woman, who am I
Who am I, on this island of faith
Who am I, on this island of life
You are the sea
You are the sky
You are the ocean
I am the earth
I am the island
Of your love
