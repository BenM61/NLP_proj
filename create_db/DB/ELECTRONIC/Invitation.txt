Invitation to love again
Welcome to my heart, step into my love again
And you ready to love again
Welcome to my heart, step into my love again

I daydream about the first time
That I fell in love
I lived on a street called cloud nine
Among the stars above
And eve though you let me go
I never understood the game
For all this time I've cared for you
And still I have a burning flame

Invitation, welcome to my heart again
Are you ready, step into my love again

I used to watch sunshine on your lovely face
Our love was filled with emotion of a heated rage
But now that I have come of age
I recognize your quality
And now I feel deep down inside
That you were the one for me

Invitation, why can't we be more than friends
Are you ready, dance into my love again
Invitation, come on let the magic in
I know your ready, this is where our love begins
