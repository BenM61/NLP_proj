Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you,
Arm in arm with just another guy,
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly,
I look at you and the cars go passing by.

I understand that you used to love me,
Nothing much but it made you cry,
So here we are making pleasant gestures,
and I just can't see the reason why.

Me and you we never made it far girl,
Now I laugh at the promises we made,
and something went the first time that I hurt you,
the lights went out and the memories start to fade.

And all along on my trip to nowhere,
You annoyed me with your foolish games,
And how you teased when I first made love,
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame,
Burning flame, burning flame.

And all along on my trip to nowhere,
You annoyed me with your foolish games,
And how you teased when I first made love,
And I'm left so naked like a burning flame,
Burning flame, burning flame.

I felt the earth fall apart and crumble,
All my dreams down they fell,
And would an angel show mercy to the devil,
But you're under my skin and you know darn well.
