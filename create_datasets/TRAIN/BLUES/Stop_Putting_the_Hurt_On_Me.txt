You stole my heart away, baby
And you know you robbed me all my pride
You stole my heart away, baby
And you know you robbed me all my pride
Yes, I ain't got nothing left now, baby
But a great big heartache inside

My friends I used to have, baby
Everybody looked on me with shame
The friends, the friends I used to have, baby
Everybody looked on me with shame
They didn't understand it, baby
The way you've made change

I can't talk to nobody, baby
I have to keep it all to myself
Oh, I can't talk, I can't talk to nobody, baby
I have to keep it all to myself
I'm so in love with you, baby
I don't wanna share your love with nobody else

Maybe I'll get over one day, baby
Maybe someday I'll have peace of mind
Oh, I think I'll get over one day, baby
And maybe then I'll have peace of mind
Yes, I won't be hurting, baby
Yes, I won't have to do the things that you put on my mind, yeah--
