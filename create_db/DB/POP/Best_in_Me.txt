From the moment I met you I just knew you'd be mine
You touched my hand
And I knew that this was gonna be our time
I don't ever want to lose this feeling
I don't want to spend a moment apart
'Cause you bring out the best in me, like no-one else can do
That's why I'm by your side, (and that's why I love you)

Every day that I'm here with you
I know that it feels right
And I've just got to be near you every day and every night
And you know that we belong together
It just had to be you and me
