When I be coolin', man look
I just be coolin'
I ain't got nuttin' to prove
Or ain't nobody to be foolin', yo
Listen to the words that I be sayin'
'Cause, when I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin'
I say yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all
Look in here, everybody in the house, havin' a ball
Yo, I'm over here
Yo Diesel, I'm in the rear
Of the party, la-di-da-di
Catchin' the vibe from everybody
Feelin' alright again
Rollin with my buds, double I to the end

Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right

I said you ain't a really down, really down
You ain't down with my crew
You ain't down with my crew
Check it out
I said you ain't a really down, really down
You don't do what we do
You don't do what we do

Isn't it beautiful, lovely, the vibe that I'm feelin'
'Cause my style is so appealin'
Got you jumpin' to the ceiling
I'm back, in fact I never went nowhere, my man
This track, is Boogie's and he hand it down to Fam
You don't understand, you could never underhand
The wonder man
Comin' from the under land
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
It's a naughty rotten thing goin' on tonight
If you want to join in, everything's alright
I'm quite tight
Tip-top shape for the night
Nothing's gonna stop us now, no way in a right
Right you are
Who's gonna stop a shootin' star?
Whose aim is to go far
Like the mileage on a car
This is for all o' y'all to enjoy
Every man and woman, every girl and boy
Boy, oh boy

Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right

Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right

Yo, I got eight wheels
I want to roll
Or might go to the rink
And get my stroll on
K-Boggie is the man behind the scenes that makes you move
Ill Town, Ill Town, ain't got nuttin' to prove
Wake up every morning with my boom box blastin'
It's you that I'm askin'
"What the hell's been happening
What once was a fad
Blew up and goin' mad
Bart Simpson, even with it
Dropped a single with his dad
This is dedicated to the Hip Hop artist
Those who rock hardest
They're stuck in regardless
When the radio didn't want to play
What we had to say
Now things have changed
Just like a new day

Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right

Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
Hey alright, right, right
