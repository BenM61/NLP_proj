If you should be bored in California
I'm sure I'm not the first to warn ya
Don't read in too much to all the signs and turns
Keep your wits about you with your mind freedom

If you should be bored in California
I'm sure I'm not the last to warn ya
The natives scaled the mountains for the promise of the sea
But deem the land unworthy of theM evidently

We salute the sun because
When the day is done
We can't believe what we've become
Something else to pray upon
And evidently
It's just another vanity
Another something to believe
The curse of the contemporary

We salute the sun because
When the day is done
We can't believe what we've become
Something else to pray upon
And evidently
It's just another vanity
Another something to believe
The curse of the contemporary

(Curse of the contemporary)
