You write a list of things to do
To occupy the time that you could use
But, in my mind it's never final
And when you sleep, I try not to wake you as I leave

Oh, I waited up for you
But you didn't come back home
Oh, I waited up for you
Couldn't you come back home?

Someone gets run down
Karaoke plays somewhere in the background,
But there is no explanation
What makes a grown man cry?
Karaoke plays and someone gets run down

We never did want the dawn to break
Beside the crumpled sheets in which we lay
You know I've changed my ways forever
The North Sea crashes through your dreams as I leave

Oh, I waited up for you
But you didn't come back home

Oh, I waited up for you
Couldn't you come back home?

Someone gets run down
Karaoke plays somewhere in the background,
But there is no explanation
What makes a grown man cry?
Karaoke plays and someone gets run down

I came home--there were radio waves
I heard voices through the radio waves
I came home--you were nowhere to be found
The lights were on and the radio played
I came home--there were radio waves
A children's choir through the radio waves
Every night we've got so much to say
I want to hear all the things you did today

Someone gets run down
Karaoke plays somewhere in the background,
But there is no explanation
What makes a grown man cry?
Karaoke plays and someone gets run down
