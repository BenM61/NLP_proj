Fear, fills your heart
Rip, rip out your lungs
Burn, burning your soul
Conception is still unknown
Hostile, hostile reaction
Dangerous, dangerous retraction
?
Feel, feeling disease
(I'm not insane, do you hear me, I'm not insane)
Hostile, hostile reaction
Dangerous, dangerous retraction

The laws of nature
The laws of man
This volatile paradox will never stand
The laws of nature
The laws of man
This volatile paradox will never stand

Silence starts the rage
Illusion, illusions in vain
Existence, existence grows still
Shadow, shadow I kill
Hostile, hostile reaction
Dangerous, dangerous retraction

The laws of nature
The laws of man
This volatile paradox will never stand
The laws of nature
The laws of man
This volatile paradox will never stand
This volatile paradox will never stand

Release, release your pain
