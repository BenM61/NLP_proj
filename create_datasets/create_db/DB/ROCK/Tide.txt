Listen to the waves
Listen to the waves
I can't sleep tonight
So I'll let the full moon decide
Where I'm going, where I'm going
Just give me one little word
To get me through the night
'Cause I don't know where we're going

The tide is rising
Rising high
The tide is rising
I've never been anywhere this quiet,
But surely it's just a matter of time

Before the wave
Comes and takes me
I love you like the tide
Like the tide loves the shore
Too late to break away
So I'll sit here and listen
To the sound of the soft crash
Coming back, coming back
Soft crash
Coming back
Coming back

Listen to the waves
I can't sleep tonight
So I'll let the full moon decide
Where I'm going, where I'm going
Just give me one little word
To get me through the night
'Cause I don't know where we're going

The tide is rising
Rising high
The tide is rising
There's noone here with me
But the wild moon watching
The shining waters rise

Before the wave
Comes and takes me
I love you like the tide
Like the tide loves the shore
Too late to break away
So I'll sit here and listen
To the sound of the soft crash
Coming back
