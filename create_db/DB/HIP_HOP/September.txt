I can't believe that a year has passed 
It seems like yesterday in September 

We started off as the best of friends 
No intention of falling in love again 
He held me there in my time of need 
My heart was set free 
What a sweet memory 

[Chorus]
The day I fell in love 
It was so beautiful 
His hands, his tender touch 
I remember the day in September 
When we fell in love 

It was an unexpected night 
The sun was somewhere, but out of sight 
So familiar, yet unexplored and new 
We surrendered to our love in bloom 

[Chorus]

I couldn't believe it was love 
The passion we felt between us 
The warmth of your touch 
'Twas a night to remember 
On the day we fell in love in September 

[Chorus]

I couldn't believe it was love 
The passion we felt between us 
The warmth of your touch 
'Twas a night to remember 
On the day we fell in love in September 

[Chorus]
