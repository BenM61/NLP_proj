I'm gonna walk my faith
Gonna raise my song
I'm gonna fight my battle
Gonna praise my Lord

[Chorus]
It's getting heavy
But I'm ready
To take on this world and rock steady
So come on, bring it on

I'm gonna face my demons
Gonna turn them down
I'm gonna keep on moving
Gonna make my sound

[Chorus]

Bring it on [11x]
