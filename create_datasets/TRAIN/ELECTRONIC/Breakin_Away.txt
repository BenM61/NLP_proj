Breakin' away
Breakin' away
It's hard leaving
Walking away from someone just to start again
We are ever needing
Keeping that someone to care just to give us strength
So as life changes with every day
We got to move forward
There's got to be a better way
Start over with every chance
I will be there

Now I'm breakin' away (breakin' away)
All I needed was time and room to grow
I got something to say (breakin' away)
Now I know I can make it on my own
Now I'm breakin'away (yeah, yeah)

It's hard giving
Giving out all that you've got when there's no return
When you find you're living
Living for everyone else there's so much to learn
So as life changes with every day
We got to move forward
There's got to be a better way
Start over with every chance
I will be there

Now I'm breakin' away (breakin' away)
All I needed was time and room to grow
I got something to say (breakin' away)
Now I know I can make it on my own
Now I'm breakin'away (yeah, yeah)

Seems like I've waited
Seems like it's taken forever (just to break free)
It feels like I've wasted my life
Now that we're not together.
