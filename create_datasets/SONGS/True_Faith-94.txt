I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty

That's the way that we must pay
You got my time and you got my money
Now I feel you've started something
In a world that's so becoming

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see

That's the price that we must pay
Our valued destiny comes to nothing
I don't know just where we're going
I guess there's just no way of knowing

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of destiny

The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I think you've started something
In a world that's just begun

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
