Baby says she's dying to meet you
Take you off and make your blood hum
And tremble like the fairground lights

And baby says if ever you see skin as fair
Or eyes as deep and as black as mine
I'll know you're lying

Baby says a howl of romance I'll get
From all your sleeping dogs, you thugs of God
I'll get one yet

Baby says for all I've forsaken
Make something of all the noise
And the mess you're making
And all the time's it's taken

Baby says there's death in these silver curls
That break up in jails
Send you diving for pearls
Without a care in the world

Baby says she's dying to meet you
Take you off and make your blood hum
And tremble like the Crimbal Lights

Baby says a howl of romance I'll get
From all your sleeping dogs, you thugs of God
I'll get one yet
