Spring break's come around and
There's no heroes to be found
There's something major going down on Tracy Island
Weapons underground
Keeping our planet safe and sound

If someone evil's coming round they should be frightened
'Cause now the boys are back in town
No strings to hold them down

Don't be mad please, stop the hating
Just be glad that they'll be waiting
Friends we have are ever changing
Now the lid's about to blow
When the Thunderbirds are go

Kids are learning fast
They know the T-birds kick some ass
Be sure that there's no coming last
If your on their side
It always looks so cool
When spaceships come out of the pool
You know that you'd just be a fool
To be a bad guy

'Cause now the boys are back in town
No strings to hold them down

Don't be mad please, stop the hating
Just be glad that they'll be waiting
Friends we have are ever changing
Now the lid's about to blow
When the Thunderbirds are go

Thunderbirds are go
Don't be mad please, stop the hating
Just be glad that they'll be waiting
Friends we have are ever changing
Now the lid's about to blow
When the Thunderbirds are go

Thunderbirds are go
Thunderbirds are go
Thunderbirds are
Thunderbirds are
Thunderbirds are go
