I can't hold you like I want to
Can't hold you to the promises you make
You won't be here tonight or any other night

It would be a lie to say I'm not afraid
But to be afraid is something that I've always been
The difference is this time I'm not giving in

Yes, I am alone, yes, I'm on my own
But for the first time in my life
I'm gonna carry on, yes, I'm gonna ache

But I will not break, some things I can choose
And baby I refuse to be lonely to be lonely
I can't change you, I can't blame you

And this time, I'm not even gonna try
You do what you have to do
I'll do the same thing too

You've got a right to say good-bye
But I've got a right to take care of myself
I realize that I come first before anyone else

Yes, I am alone, yes, I'm on my own
But for the time in my life
I'm gonna carry on, yes, I'm gonna ache

But I will not break, some things I can choose
And baby, I refuse to be lonely
Lonely is a place I used to be
But I'm closing that door, I won't live there anymore

Yes, I am alone, yes, I'm on my own
But for the first time in my life
I'm gonna carry on, yes, I'm gonna ache

But I will not break, some things I can choose
And baby, I refuse to be lonely
To be lonely, to be lonely
