Hey, are you lonesome?
All alone?
Are you looking for someone
To call your own?

Hey, little honey
Don't be shy
Give me your body
I'll give you mine

I, I've never loved before
And I've been waiting for
There's no one close to you
You're the one that I adore
I need you more and more
Baby, come close to me

Hey, pretty blue eyes
Your heart is owned
By a nice intuition
I call my own

Hey, little honey
Don't be shy
Give me your body
I'll give you mine

I, I've never loved before
And I've been waiting for
There's no one close to you
You're the one that I adore
I need you more and more
Baby, come close to me
