On the streets
And everywhere
You're turnin' heads
You've got that laissez faire

You just smile, yeah
And walk on through, oh, oh
You've got that personality, babe
And it sure looks good on you, yeah

Not the ordinary
Anything you wear looks good on you, especially
Nothin' I can tell you
You haven't already heard a half a million times
But I'd still like to say

You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well (Ho)
You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well

There they go
They look so lovely too
But even so
They can't compete with you, no

You've got class
You're more than just a pretty face, no, no, babe
You've got that personality, babe
You've got exactly what it takes (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Not the ordinary
Anything you wear looks good on you, especially
Nothin' I can tell you
You haven't already heard a half a million times
But I'd still like to say

You wear it well (Ooh, sho' nuff)
You wear it well, you wear it well (Woo!)
You wear it well (Oh, yeah, baby)
You wear it well, you wear it well (You take my breath away)

You wear it well (Ooh, sho' nuff)
You wear it well, you wear it well (Ah, yeah, baby)
You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well

Wear (Ooh)
You wear it well, you wear it well
Just want to tell you, you wear it well
The way it looks on ya, you wear it well
Just want to tell ya, you wear it well

You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well (Go on with your bad self)
You wear it well (Ho)
