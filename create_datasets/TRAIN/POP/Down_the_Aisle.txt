Down the aisle I'll walk with you
Just to hear the words I do
All of my life I want to be
Good and sweet till eternity
I do thee wed this day
With this ring we go our way
For better or worse I take thee wed
By your hand I will be led
Through the years we'll live in bliss
Life will be full of happiness
Oh chimes from the church bells will ring
With each hour they'll be rippling
Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
I am yours to cherish and behold
With this little band of gold
