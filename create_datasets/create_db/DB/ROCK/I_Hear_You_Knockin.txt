You went away and left me long time ago
Now you come back'n knockin' on my door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
I begged you not to go but you said goodbye 
Now you come back tellin' all those lies
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been

If you had a lesson long time ago
You wouldn't be goin' from door to door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
You went away and left me long time ago
Now you come back'n knockin' on my door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
I begged you not to go but you said goodbye 
Now you come back tellin' all those lies
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been

If you had a lesson long time ago
You wouldn't be goin' from door to door
I hear you knockin' but you came from him
I hear you knockin' go back where you've been
