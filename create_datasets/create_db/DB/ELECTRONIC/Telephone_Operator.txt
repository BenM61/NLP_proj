Why can't I see you later
Telephone operator
Why can't I see you later
Tell me is it wine
That makes things so fine
Or is it 'cause you're mine

Telephone operator
You're my aural stimulator
Telephone operator
Ne see'est pas la raison d'etre
Tell me is it love
That I feel because
You're all I'm thinking of

Telephone operator
Phone you up an hour later
Telephone operator
Phoned you up an hour later
Tell me is it love
That I'm in because
I'm only thinking of you
