Each morning a missionary advertise with neon sign 
He tells the native population that civilization is fine 
And three educated savages holler from a bongo tree 
That civilization is a thing for me to see

So bongo, bongo, bongo I don't want to leave the Congo 
Oh no no no no no 
Bingle, bangle, bungle I'm so happy in the jungle I refuse to go 
Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords 
I make it clear 
That no matter how they coax him 
Yeeeah, I'll stay right here

I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed 
Magazine? What happens? 
I see how people who are civilized bang you with automobiles 
You know you can get hurt that way Daniel 
At the movies they have got to pay many coconuts to see 
What do they see Danny?) 
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me

So bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't want to leave the Congo 
Oh no no no no no 
Bingle, bangle, bungle he's so happy in the jungle he refuse to go 
Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis 
Noise in my ear 
So no matter how they coax him 
Yeeeah, I'll stay right here

They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train 
And though it's smoky and it's crowded 
They're too civilized to complain 
When they've got two weeks vacation 
They hurry to vacation ground 
What do they do Danny? 
They swim and they fish,
But that's what I do all year round 

So bongo, bongo, bongo I don't want to leave the congo 
Oh no no no no no 
Bingle, bangle, bungle I'm so happy in the jungle I refuse to go 
Don't want no jailhouse, 
Shotguns, 
Fish hooks, 
Golf clubs, 
I got my spears 
So no matter how they coax him 
Yeeeah, I'll stay right here

They have things like the atom bomb 
So I think I'll stay where I a-a-m 
Civilization, I'll stay right here
