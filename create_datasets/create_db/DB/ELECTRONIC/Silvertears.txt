Empty streets left alone 
Water drops falling down 
A gray and empty sky washes all your tears away 
See the stars hiding away 
From this vicious circle of drugs 

For life you are the looser with no second chance 
Fading hopes blown away 
You are waiting for the night 

You're playing hide and seek with the devil in the sky 
See the bright big city lights 
A colorful and fatal trap 

Left freezing on the pavement ? you never had a chance 
For another day 
Lost memories are calling 
For another day 
Your silver tears are falling
