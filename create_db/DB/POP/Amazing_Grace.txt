Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

â€™Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
It was grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Was blind but now I see
