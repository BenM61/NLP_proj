A company always on the run
A destiny, oh it's the rising sun
I was born, a shotgun in my hands
Behind the gun
I'll make my final stand, yeah
That's why they call me

Bad company
I can't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Until the day I die

Until the day I die

Rebel souls
Deserters we've been called
Chose a gun
And threw away the song

Now these towns
Well they all know our name
The death punch sound
Is the claim of fame
And that's why they call me

Bad company
I can't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die 

Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

"Eye for an eye"
"Tooth for a tooth"
"Blood for blood"
We've all gotta die
We've all gotta die

And that's why they call me
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die

Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die

Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
