Mirror, mirror
Do you like
What you see?
I'll dance for you
If you dance for me
Who says a woman
Cannot serve?
It would be my pleasure
Who says it is
Not my destiny
To let you control me?
Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feelin' all right
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego
Serve the ego

Two ships sailing
On a neon sea
Eat the flesh
Spit out the seeds
Feathered hair
And lame heels
What turns me on
Is so surreal

Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feelin' all right
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego
Serve the ego

Tut tut, oh, to discover oh
Oh no, you're yesterday's lover

Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feelin' all right
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego
Serve the ego
