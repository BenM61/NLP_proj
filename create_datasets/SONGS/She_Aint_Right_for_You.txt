Wrote me in a letter that she makes you feel better and all of the
Things you said to her but I feel what I feel, it's real.

She ain't right for you she don't know you like I do, no matter
What she do she ain't right for you, don't you want to be happy?
Baby you should stay with me 'cause she ain't right for you - she
Don't love you like I do.

Turn me around. Turn me upside down sporting the tears of a
Clown but I feel what I feel, it's real.

She ain't right for you she don't know you like I do, no matter
What she do she ain't right for you, don't you want to be happy?
Baby you should stay with me 'cause she ain't right for you - she
Don't love you like I do.

They will say that I spend all my days chasing a love that she
Took away but I feel what I feel.

You know baby I've been trying to tell you for a mighty long
Time now that you can keep looking you can keep searching all
Over the world. Trying to find a find a love like mine but the real
Thing is right here baby and no matter what she say no matter
What she do, she don't like you like I do.

She ain't right for you she don't know you like I do, no matter
What she do she ain't right for you, don't you want to be happy?
Baby you should stay with me 'cause she ain't right for you - she
Don't love you like I do.

They will say that I spend all my days chasing a love that she
Took away but I feel what I feel
