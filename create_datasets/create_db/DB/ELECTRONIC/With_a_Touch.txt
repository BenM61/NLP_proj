The night was young and wet that fateful day
You stepped out of the rain and looked my way
All of my cool disappeared
All I ever wanted was here
Gone is the time and the place
And every other face I've known
My life started the moment you said hello

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes 
There is nothing i can do
With a touch 
I am yours
With a kiss
You're breaking my heart
In a moment I'm lost
Now I succumb to you

Your conversation set me up to fall
We're through the door the streets
And over my walls
Your scent filled me deep, made me weak
I wanted you all over me

Gone is the time and a thousand reasons
You're a fantasy
Hearing my whispers turn into my screams

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes 
There is nothing i can do
With a touch 
I am yours
With a kiss 
You're breaking my heart
In a moment I'm lost
Now I succumb to you

all of my senses

In a different world I've known you for a thousand years
Now you're back in my life again
Forever we'll be here

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes 
There is nothing i can do
With touch I am yours
With a kiss
You're breaking my heart
In a moment I'm lost
Now I succumb to you
With a touch 
I am yours
With a kiss 
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes
There is nothing I can do

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes 
There is nothing i can do
With a touch 
I am yours
With a kiss 
You're breaking my heart
In a moment I'm lost
Now I succumb to you
