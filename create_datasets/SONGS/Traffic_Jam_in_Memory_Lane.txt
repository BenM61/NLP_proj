Sometimes I just don't know where I'm going to,
Yeah, will you help me pass away my time,
And sometimes I just can't see any reason to,
I have never been that wise,

So cast your eyes but it's over,
Saturday's, the day now,
You got it all wrong,
There's a traffic jam in memory lane,
I'm gonna try to trick myself out,
You got it all wrong,

and I find it hard to find my eccentricity,
Yeah, will you help me throw away my time,
You fire the cars that give you electricity,
I think you know it,
Hardly exercise its minds,

I just can't believe we're down this far,
I just can't believe we slipped this far,
I just can't believe I'm down this far,
In this memory lane, traffic jam,

So cast your eyes but it's over,
Cause Saturday's a day now, you got it all wrong,
And there's a traffic jam in memory lane,
I'll never try to trick myself out, you got it all wrong,
I'll never try to trick myself out, you got it all wrong.
