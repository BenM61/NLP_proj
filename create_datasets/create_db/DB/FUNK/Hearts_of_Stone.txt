Hearts made of stone 
Will never break
For the love you have for them 
They just won't take
You can ask them please
Please please please break
And all of your love 
Is there to take

[Chorus]
Yes, hearts of stone 
Will cause you pain
Although you love them
They'll stop you just the same
You can ask them please
Please please please break
And all of your love 
Is there to take

But they'll say 
no [Repeat: x12]
Everybody knows
I thought you knew
Hearts made of stone

[Chorus]

But they'll say 
no [Repeat: x12]
Everybody knows
I thought you knew
Hearts made of stone
