All's in fear is fear itself
Check out your own backyard before you check out someone else
Railroad track in my neighborhood
Ain't no trains around that part, just ain't no good

Wanna know, what's going down
And the pimp on the corner looks like the sharpest cat in town
Jungle rule, can't be no fool
Might get caught by the hook of a crook, call time for cool

Look out jay, what you say, what you carryin' brother
I hope you're clean 'cause the man is mean, oh, don't come another further
We all know the answer will come out in time
I might even carry some of your load, right along with mine

Thank you ma'am, mister, please
'Cause I must be Hercules
I must be Hercules

Like a bird, on the wing
I just wanna be free enough to do my thing
I can feel the pressure from every side
If you're not gonna help, don't hurt, just pass me by

No

Hercules
I must be Hercules

Jungle rule, can't be no fool
Devil is on the loose, no cool
Got your feet in the sand
Got to be down with the cats that around and still got the face the man

Talk about me if you please but I must be Hercules
Hercules
I must be Hercules

Duckin' rocks, catchin' stones
Mootin' how can I survive what's going on
Big steely borrow
Somehow I've got to make it till tomorrow

Can't depend on no one else
Comin' up the hard way I've got to save myself

Must be Hercules
I must be Hercules
Talk about me if you please
I must be Hercules
