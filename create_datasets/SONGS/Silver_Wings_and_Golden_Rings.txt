It was Friday night
And both of us were lonely
We seemed to meet as lonely people do
To fill the empty space till Monday morning
I never meant to fall in love with you

You came right out and told me
About your wife back home in Houston
You were just in town on business
And never tried to lead me on

But the time had seemed just fine
Simply love you for the moment
But Heaven help me, time ran out
And now the moment's gone

Silver wings and golden rings
Are taking you today
I'll be dying on the ground
While you are flying away

Silver wings and golden rings
Are shinning on and on
While the only love
I've ever known is gone

You made me feel like
I was something special
The way no other man had ever done
I knew last night would have to last forever
'Cause there's no way from holding back the sun

Now I guess it's time for me
To drive you to the plane
To hold back all my tears
And tell you it's been nice

If you come back to town again
You know I'd love to see you
But remember I'm not strong enough
To let go of you twice

Silver wings and golden rings
Are taking you today
I'll be dying on the ground
While you are flying away

Silver wings and golden rings
Are shinning on and on
While the only love
I've ever known is gone

Silver wings and golden rings
Are taking you today
I'll be dying on the ground
While you are flying away

Silver wings and golden rings
Are shinning on and on
While the only love
I've ever known is gone

Silver wings and golden rings
Are taking you today
I'll be dying
