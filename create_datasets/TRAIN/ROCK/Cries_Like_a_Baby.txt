She don't mind how I dress
Or how much I work, how much I rest
She don't mind how much I sleep
Never asks why I spend the night awaken

She don't ask for reasons why
I sometimes tell her lies
She makes no plans for my days
She don't try in any ways to trick me

She cries just like a baby
She cries just like a baby

She don't mind where I've been
Or where I go
She says it's best not to know
She don't mind where I've been
When the doorbell rings in the morning

She cries just like a baby
She cries just like a baby

It's summer, but it's so cold
Silhouettes and shadows dancing
On my window

She cries just like a baby

She don't mind if, or where, it ends
She always says it's just started
I want to know her deepest feelings
Would they comfort me
Or hurt me

She cries just like a baby
She cries just like a baby
