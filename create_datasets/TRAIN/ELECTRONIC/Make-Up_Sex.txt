Sex (Sex)
Sex (Sex)

Her heart is on her sleeve and it is looking right through me
You gently vicious slowly never felt so naked
So break me down until I fall but stop before you break it all
I never thought you'd cry, I thought that you would make it 

Stop me
Not for long
Dancing from below
Stop me 
Not for long
I think I might have let you go 

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care 
Sex, not love 
It's only make up sex 

Breaking up the silence with the things she knows
I think I might have pushed to hard for her to go
I can hardly take what my voice will make
I can't believe the time I almost had to let her know

Don't stop just get it on
Don't stop just get it on 

Stop me
Not for long
Dancing from below
Stop me 
Not for long
I think I might have done you wrong 

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care 
Sex not love 
It's only make up sex 

I think I've got it right
I think I've got it right 

So stop stop me you know I cannot breathe I cannot breathe
Into your heart I cannot see
So stop me now
I think I might have let you down 

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care 
Sex, not love 
It's only make up sex

Sex (Sex)
Love (Love)
Sex (Sex, sex, sex)
Love (Love, love, love)

Sex, not love
I taste it in your make up
Sex, not love
I taste in your lips
For the girls in the back while they're messing up their hair
And the boys breaking hearts pretending that they care 
Sex, not love 
It's only make up
It's only make up
Sex
