She likes what she sees
Starts to drop to her knees
Gazing with an appetite
Licks her lips in sheer delight
She's one of a kind
A sight for sore eyes
It's all the needs to be happy
I bet she never knew
It would taste so good

No she's in love
I knew she's in love
Oh no she's in love
Oh yeah she's in love

She just loves to please
Kiss of life her specialty
Oh how well she knows
Just how to make it grow
She's one of a kind
A sight for sore eyes
It's all she needs to be happy

No she's in love
I knew she's in love
Oh no she's in love
Oh yeah she's in love
