Hm, hm, hm, hm
Something ain't right, hm, hm-uh
Something just ain't right
Lord have mercy babe
Listen here
Tell me when was the last time
You brought her roses home from work
Tell me when was the last time
You rubbed her feet when she said they hurt, hm
Tell me when was the last time
You bought a card to tell her how you feel
Don't even know when was the last time
You lit a candle for a late night meal
Tell me

How long will it be 
Before you treat her like your queen?
And how long will it take 
Before she starts coming home too late?
And how long will it be 
Before she starts running in the streets?
You better take the time to treat her like your lady

You probably don't know when was the last time
You stopped to open her car door
And tell me when was the last time
You heard say baby do it once more
Tell me when was the last time
You didn't have an argument
Don't even know when was the last time
You told the truth about where you been

Now if this don't apply to you
(If this don't apply to you)
Keep doing what you do
(Keep doing what you do)
But if this shoe fits you well
Take a minute just to ask yourself
(Just sixty seconds now)

How long will it be 
Before you treat her like your queen?
And how long will it take 
Before she starts coming home too late?
And how long will it be 
Before she starts running in the streets?
You better take the time to treat her like your lady

Now see what's old to you
Is just like new to the next man
What you don't do for her
She'll find somebody else who can
If you don't want to lose out 
On the best thing you ever had
You better take it from me
You'll only end up just a lonely man
See I know what I'm talking about

How long will it be 
Before you treat her like your queen?
And how long will it take 
Before she starts coming home too late?
And how long will it be 
Before she starts running in the streets?
You better take the time to treat her like your lady
