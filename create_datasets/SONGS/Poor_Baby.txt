Glittery eyes; witchy smiles 
A good time is all you are after 
Skin tight thighs; little white lies 
Put you in the center of the laughter 

But your reign of queen is over 
Your fortress has been broken down 
You're still the center of the laughter 
But your role has changed to the clown 

Ooh poor baby 
Someone broke your heart in two 
Ooh poor baby 
Who would have thought it could happen to you 
Poor baby 

A pretty face; sweet talkin' ways 
Got you a part of the action 
A come-over-touch, glances and such 
You always had to be the main attraction 

Now you're the one who's crying 
You lost at your own lonely game 
You're still the center of attraction 
But now I'm gone, you've got yourself to blame 

Ooh poor baby 
Someone broke your heart in two 
Ooh poor baby 
Who would have thought it could happen to you 
Poor baby 

Ooh poor baby 
Someone broke your heart in two 
Ooh poor baby 
You let someone get much too close to you 
Poor baby 
Poor baby,poor baby 
Poor baby,poor baby
