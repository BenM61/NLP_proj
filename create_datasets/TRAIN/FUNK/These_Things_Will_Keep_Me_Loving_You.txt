Oh and I know these things will keep me loving you dear
Say it again
These things will keep me loving you dear

A gentle touch upon my face baby
A tender kiss and a warm embrace honey
Oh a few kind words
Spoken so sincere
And I know and I know
These things will keep me loving you dear
These things will keep me loving you dear

Give me your shoulder so I can cry on it baby
Oh give me advice that I can rely on honey
Oh say you love me every day of the year
And I know and I know
These things will keep me loving you dear
Say it again
These things will keep me loving you dear

Oh and I know these things will keep me loving you dear

Oh baby baby
Call me each night on the telephone baby
Oh send me a card when you're far from home honey
Oh hold me close to you baby every time you're near
And I know and I know
These things will keep me loving you dear
Oh, loving you dear
