Listen to me woman, 
I just think it's a sin. 
I know you hear me knockin', 
But you won't let me in. 
Might be fine for you 
Just to keep me hangin' round. 
But if you don't open up this door, 
I'm gonna kick it down. 
 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the streets again. 
Sometimes I feel like 
There's nowhere to go. 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the streets again. 
 
Listen, you've been telling me to short 
For much too long. 
But now I'm gonna put you back 
Where you belong. 
Might be fine for you 
Just to keep me hangin' round. 
But if you don't open up this door, 
I'm gonna kick it down. 
 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the street sagain. 
Sometimes I feel like 
There's nowhere to go. 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the streets again. 
Sometimes it's the only place that I know. 
That I know. 
 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the streets again. 
Sometimes I feel like 
There's no place to go. 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the streets again. 
Sometimes it's the only place that I know. 
 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the streets again. 
Sometimes I feel like 
There's no place to go. 
Sometimes I feel like 
I'm back on the streets again. 
Sometimes it's the only place that I know. 
 
Only place that I know 
Yeah.
