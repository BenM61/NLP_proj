[Pastor Troy]
O.K., O.K., O.K.
Give and give in give, but that don't mean receive
The shit don't be no game, 'cause the shit that we believe
Tricks be up our sleeve, to sure to get ya weavin
This is Monday morning, found em Friday evenin'
Found em face down in the bot-tom of a creek
With shackles and handcuffs around his hands and feet
But that be too unique, so cops don't pursue me
I got millions of bodies floatin' round this Chattahoochie
Nigga arms and legs be spread out across that bitch
I'm lookin fo' head because i done lost that shit
So if you find a finger, or a leg, or a nose
See because I know where it goes
'cause I'm the muthafuckin killa

Chorus: Baby D (2x)
Nigga ran up, got fucked up
Fucked around got tossed up
F*ck around get crossed up
We burnt his as the f*ck up
