I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight
And all that you mean to me
I used to think I would never fall in love again
I guess I was wrong

When your heart was broken
When your wounded pride was laid to rest, baby
You'll never open your heart to anyone else, you said
But you lied, I know you're lyin', babe

You see your mind might be made up, mmm
But your heart has got its own plans
There's no one to blame the false pride, tellin' lies, tryin' to hide
From feelin' the pain, I know you don't wanna feel

There's nowhere to hide when love is callin' your name, yeah
From the dark, nowhere to hide, baby, yeah
There's nowhere to hide, so let love have its way with your heart
When love calls, love calls, love calls your name

It's on my lips
And I wish that you were still here
To take me away with your kiss
And take me away from all this crazy, crazy

'Cause too many words have been spoken
Too many lies have been told, baby
You'll never do it again, you tell yourself over and over and over
But you're wrong, dead wrong, babe, yeah

There's nowhere to hide, mmm, when love is callin' your name
From the dark, baby, nowhere to run, girl
There's no where to hide, yeah
So let love have its way, girl, with your heart, babe
Love calls, love calls

There's nowhere to hide, yeah, when love is callin' your name
You fall apart, baby (Incomprehensible)
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run, when love is on its way, girl
To your heart, baby, when love calls, love calls your name, babe

(Incomprehensible) love's callin' your name, hey hey
It's callin' out for you, callin' out for me, babe
Love's on its way, baby, yeah, yeah

I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight and how you make me feel
The sweetness of your touch, the softness of your voice
You make me wanna be a better man, baby
And I wanna thank you for calling me into your life
Into your arms, into your love
