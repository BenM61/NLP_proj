You mean the world to me
Being my everything
I don't understand it
Yeah hey
You mean the world to me
Huh-uh
You was my main one.
Ooo ohhh
Huh-uh
Huh-uh
I want to be with you 
For the rest of my life
you're the only one that
Means the world to me
(Means the world to me)
I don't need a fancy car
Pearls or diamond rings
The love you had meant 
Everything to me
(Me yeah)
I want to be with you
And no time to waste
You put a smile on my face
Everytime I'm with you
It feels like I'm in heaven
I want to be with you
And no time to waste
You put a smile on my face
And baby don't you know now
I just sit and think of you
God only knows you take
Control of my soul
And you take me for a ride
Every time you're with me
(When you're with me)
You are warm in spirit
You are warm at heart
Why did you have to leave?
Why did we ever have to part?
Time came and took you away
I thought you were here to stay
Why did you have to leave me
Why did you have to leave and 
Go away
Time came and took you away
I thought you were here to stay
Why did you have to leave me?
Why did you have to leave and 
Go away
(I don't know why)
I want to be with you
And no time to waste
You put a smile on my face
Everytime I'm with you
It feels like I'm in heaven
I want to be with you
And no time to waste
You put a smile on my face
And baby don't you know now
I just sit and think of you (2x)
Ooo?Ooo?ohhh?Ooo?Ooo?ohhh
Why did you have to leave and 
Go away
I want to be with you
And no time to waste
You put a smile on my face
Everytime I'm with you
It feels like I'm in heaven
I want to be with you
And no time to waste
You put a smile on my face
And baby don't you know now
I just sit and think of you (4x)
