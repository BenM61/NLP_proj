Let your mind go
Put you in the mood
Let your body groove
Let it soothe
Feel the funk now
Feel the funk
Feel the funk now
Feel the groove

Let the music
Take your mind
Into a place
You never been before
Take the time
To think about memories
Of you and I
It's alright for you to be
Next to me
So I can hold you tight
Girl the mood is right
Oh yeah
Let's take a stroll
To the park or to your house
Trying to do my thing
Let the music play

Let your mind go
Put you in the mood
Let your body groove
Let it soothe
Feel the funk now
Feel the funk
Feel the funk now
Feel the groove

Feel the funk
Yeah, yeah
Let the rhythm take you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel the funk
Feel it
Let the rhythm take you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Focus on the flavor of the beat
I say the rhythm
So take a little time and let your mind relax
To this phat track
Reminiscing on yesterdays
And feeling kinda crazy
Take out my pen and I think I'm gonna write
Nothing else to do on this crazy filled night
But to feel the funk
But to feel the funk
Yeah uh yeah

Let your mind go
Put you in the mood
Let your body groove
Let it soothe
Feel the funk now
Feel the funk
Feel the funk now
Feel the groove
