There's a light, when my baby's in my arms,
There's a light, when the window shades are drawn,

Hesitate, when I feel I may do harm to her,
Watch it all, cause this feeling we can share.

And I know she's reached my heart, in thin air.

Byzantine is reflected in our pond,
There's a cloud, but the water remains calm,
Reaching in, the suns fingers clutch the dawn to pass,
Even out, it's a precious thing to bear.

And I know she's reached my heart, in thin air,
Yes I know she's reached my heart, in thin air.

It's not in my past to presume,
Love can keep on moving in both directions.
How to be happy and true,
Is the quest we're taking on together,

Taking on, on, on, on,
Taking on, on, on, on, on, on.

There's a light, when my baby's in my arms,

And I know she's reached my heart in thin air,
And I know she's reached my heart in thin air,
Yes I know she's reached my heart in thin air,
Yes I know she's reached my heart.
