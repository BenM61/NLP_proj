When shades enfold
The sunset's gold
And stars are bright above again
I smile, sweetheart
For then I know I can start
To live again, to love again

When day is done
And night comes on
Until the dawn
What do I do
I clasp your hand
And wander through slumber land
Dream-dancing with you

We dance between
A sky serene
And fields of green
Sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime
Whenever I spend my time
Dream-dancing with you

Dream-dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through
So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career
Dream-dancing
To paradise prancing
Dream-dancing with you
