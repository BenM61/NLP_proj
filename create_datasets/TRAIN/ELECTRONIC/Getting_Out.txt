So you think you found yourself the girl
You want to spend your life with
How come that girl's got my eyes and my curls
And how come I never was asked

'Cause I've been trying desperately to give you all the clues
But if you stay asleep like this it won't be any use
'Cause I've been trying desperately to give you all the clues
But if you stay asleep like this it won't be any use

'Cause I'm sort of very slowly getting out
'Cause I think I finally know what you're about
Yes I'm sort of very slowly getting out
And I think I finally know what you're about

So you think you found yourself the girl
Who wants to hear your stories
They're probably great but you told them too late
And I've got a few of my own
