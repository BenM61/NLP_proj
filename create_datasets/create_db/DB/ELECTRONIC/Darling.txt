Postcards from Amsterdam,
Phone calls from Birmingham,
To tell me only how you miss me
Received your telegramm
Now you say, here I am
Oh, the way you hold, and kiss me.

Oh, darling, darling, darling,
Leave a little love for later on
Darling, darling, darling,
So that you can come back when you've gone
I idolize, your magic eyes, and I imagine
All the good things we can do, we can do
Oh, darling, darling darling,
Leave a little a secret on the shelf
Darling, darling, darling
So that you can come back in for more.
My fantasy runs fancy free, and I imagine
All the good things we can do, we can do

It's been a long, long time,
And you and me will climb
The mountains and the hills of passion.
Soft certain skin to skin,
Oh, what a mood I'm in
Bewitched by heart aggression

Oh, darling, darling, darling,
Leave a little love for later on
Darling, darling, darling,
So that you can come back when you've gone
I idolize, your magic eyes, and I imagine
All the good things we can do, we can do
Oh, darling, darling darling,
Leave a little a secret on the shelf
Darling, darling, darling
So that you can come back in for more.
My fantasy runs fancy free, and I imagine
All the good things we can do, we can do
