When he comes home intoxicated from the club
All the kids they go and snuggle up to mom
He starts shoutin' again, and they start runnin' again
This ain't no life for them to lead

In her mind she knows she has to let him go
In the children's eyes she sees the fear inside
How does she tell him, he won't take nothin'
This ain't no life for them to lead

Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye
Now's my time to go
Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye
Now's my time to go

In the morning when he wakes up from the couch
Not recallin' what had happened the night before
He starts askin' questions, he don't get no answers
What the hell's goin' on in here

Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye
Now's my time to go
Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye
Now's my time to go

Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye
Now's my time to go
Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye

But it's too late, too late, baby, bye-bye
Now's my time to go
Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye (I just got to let you know)
Now's my time to go (Yeah, yeah)

Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye
Now's my time to go
Too late, too late, baby, bye-bye (Bye-bye)
Now's my time to

Too late (Too late), too late, baby, bye-bye (Too late, yeah)
Now's my time to go (I don't want to be around you)
Too late, too late (I just got to take the kids and go), baby, bye-bye (Oh, no)
Now's my time to go
