Can't you feel it can't you see it
The promise of prosperity
It's overwhelming you and me
It afflicts us like a disease
Ubiquitous compelling too

We cling to you like crazy glue
And inject such a potent seed
It's best for all humanity

The spread of culture
The sword of progress
The vector of suffrage
A warm and septic breeze

The pomp and elation
The duty and vocation
The blood of the hybrid
It's just a recipe

Re-living our ancestry
The frightful lack of harmony
Our fore-fothers who led the way
Their victims are still here today
Now it's time to erase the story

Of our bogus fate
Our history as it's portrayed
It's just a recipe for hate
