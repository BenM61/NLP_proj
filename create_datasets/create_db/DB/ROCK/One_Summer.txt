Started out last night,
I was thinkin' of days gone by
Of the times I've had,
And the things that I've left behind

Some change,
Some die,
Still we manage to survive
It's knowin' when and what to do
It's up to you
Don't know what's goin' on,
I can't wait 'til

One summer,
I'll find a way
One summer,
Will always remain
One summer,
Remember the way

Hauled down
Turned around,
Find myself facin' the wall
I think back to school,
It's all the same,
Slightly different rules
Outside on your own,
Watch yourself 'cause you're all alone
I know what's going on,
I can't wait 'til

One summer,
I'll find a way
One summer,
Will always remain
One summer,
Remember the way
One summer,
Never the same

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I think back not far, 
Drivin' down the beach in my car
Another place,
Same time,
Icky runs along a fine line
Down there,
No chance,
He's trapped in a different romaance
He's life a fait accompli,
He never did see

One summer, 
I'll find a way
One summer, 
Will always remain
One summer, 
Remember the way
One summer, 
Never the same

One summer, 
I'll find a way
One summer, 
Will always remain
One summer, 
Remember the way
One summer, 
I'll find a way
One summer, 
Will always remain...
