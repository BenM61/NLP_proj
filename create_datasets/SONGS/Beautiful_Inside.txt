Doesn't matter 'bout the clothes that your dressed in 
It doesn't matter 'bout the colour of your skin 
All that matters is you're beautiful inside 

Uhah yeah 

Just because you've got the looks and the body 
Just because you've got the time and the money 
Still remember to be beautiful inside 

Looking from the inside out 
Tell me what you find 
Nothing means a thing if your not, beautiful inside 

Try givin' up 
The make up 
Try givin' up 
The dressin' up 
Try givin' up 
The pushups 
And try livin' up 
To higher aspirations 

You don't have to be a victim of your ego 
No you don't have to be self centered or decietful 
You'll make it happen if your, beautiful inside 

Lookin' from the inside out 
Tell me what you find 
Nothing means a thing if your not, beautiful inside 

Try givin' up 
The make up 
Try givin' up 
The dressin' up 
Try givin' up 
The pushups 
And try livin' up 
To higher aspirations 

Try living with a heart to give instead of always taking 
Respect each others right to be because we should be making 
Little time in all our lives is full of inspiration 
Keep reaching for 
Higher Aspirations 

Try givin' up 
The make up 
Try givin' up 
The dressin' up 
Try givin' up 
The pushups 
And try livin' up 
To higher aspirations 

Try givin' up 
The make up 
Try givin' up 
The dressin' up 
Try givin' up 
The pushups 
And try livin' up 
To higher aspirations
