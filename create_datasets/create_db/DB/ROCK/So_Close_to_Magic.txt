Wouldn't you like to know
Just how I'm doing
It's been so long
This place feels just the same
Old and forgotten
This frozen sound

And the fire burns with great desire
As the stories start to flow
And we'll be drinking through memories and laughing with enemies
We made back when we were so young

As I'm so close to magic
So close to home
Yeah, I'm so close to magic
So close to home

So won't you take the time
Try to remember
It's all in me
It's not hard for me to see
Just how forgotten
These days can be

And the fire burns with great desire
As the stories start to flow
And we'll be drinking through memories and laughing with enemies
We made back when we were so young

As I'm so close to magic
So close to home
Yeah, I'm so close to magic
So close to home
