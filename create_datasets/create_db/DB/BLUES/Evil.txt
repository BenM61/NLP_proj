If you're a long way from home,
Can't sleep at night.
Grab your telephone,
Something just ain't right.

That's evil,
Evil is goin' on wrong.
I am warnin' ya brother,
You better watch your happy home.

Well, long way from home and,
Can't sleep at all.
You know another mule,
Is kickin' in your stall.

That's evil,
Evil is goin' on wrong.
I am warnin' ya brother,
You better watch your happy home.

You better catch him,
Cause somethin' wrong,
In your home.

Well, if ya call her on the telephone,
And she answers awful slow,
Grab the first train smokin',
If you have to hobo.

That's evil,
Evil is goin' on wrong.
I am warnin' ya brother,
You better watch your happy home.

If you make it to your house,
Knock on the front door,
Run around to the back,
You'll catch him just before he go.

That's evil,
Evil is goin' on.
I am warnin' ya brother,
You better watch your happy home.
