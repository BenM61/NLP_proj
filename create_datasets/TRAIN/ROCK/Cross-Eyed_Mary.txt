Who would be a poor man, a beggar-man, a thief 
If he had a rich man in his hand
And who would steal the candy
From a laughing baby's mouth 
If he could take it from the money man
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contract but she always plays the game
She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel
And the jack-knife barber, drops her off at school

Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys 
Would rather make it with a letching grey
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung 
Who watches through the railings as they play
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along
She's a poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song
She's the rich man stealer but her favour's good and strong 
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate, helps the poor man get along

Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys 
Would rather make it with a letching grey
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung 
Who watches through the railings as they play
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contract but she always plays the game
She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel
And the jack-knife barber, drops her off at school

Cross-eyed Mary

Oh Mary
