Taking islands in Africa 
Watch the slow boat hit and run 

Outside there's a world waiting 
I'll take it all by storm 
And when the sunset finds me 
I'm coming home 

Taking islands in Africa 
Watch the slow boat hit and run 

Every day the sun beats down 
I pull away from shore 
The wind blows hard into my sails 
Now I know I'm out of touch 
And times they could get tough 
But I'll move on so how could I fail? 

Taking islands in Africa 
Watch the slow boat hit and run 

When the evening fires burn 
The daylight dead and gone 
With you beside me we can run 

Outside there's a world waiting 
I'll take it all by storm 
And when the sunset finds me 
I'm coming home 

Taking islands in Africa 
Watch the slow boat hit and run 
Every day the sun beats down 
I pull away from shore 
The wind blows hard into my sails...
