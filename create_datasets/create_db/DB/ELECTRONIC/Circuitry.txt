Through waves 
they shift 
Below they hide 
Corporate killers 

Side by side 
Process this signal 
Final post 
Global defiance 

No hope for most 
Inform of liquid 
sliding through air 
Tracking this existence 
Killer hardware 

As the sun burns out your eyes 
A new world will now arise 
Out of the ashes new life appears 
A final conquest without any tears 

Massive violence 
The slaughter begins 
Future collisions 
This nightmare now begins 

Lying faces 
Bastards are cold 
Self annihilation 
This feeling's growing old 

As the sun burns out your eyes 
A new world will now arise 
Out of the ashes new life appears 
A final conquest without any tears 

This burning sensation 
won't last long 
Eternal peace you must be strong 
Ashes to ashes dust to dust 

A metaphor will never trust 
Progress reactions 
the action (unknown)
Dark disformation 

The time crawls near 
Through waves 
they shift 
Below, below they hide 
Corporate killers 
Side, side by side 

As the sun burns out your eyes 
A new world will now arise 
Out of the ashes new life appears 
A final conquest without any tears 

This burning sensation 
won't last long 
Eternal peace you must be strong 
Ashes to ashes Dust to dust 

A metaphor will never trust 
A metaphor will never trust 
A metaphor will never trust 

This persecution 
This final solution 
No, no resolution 
This, this persecution 
This persecution
