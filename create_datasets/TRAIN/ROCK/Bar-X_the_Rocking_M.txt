Come big slide across bitter by hiding hold a hail
Sit down and hold this town in fever
This mind is most of all, like a vulture on a nail
And now he knows distorting feeler hell
This time he knows distorting

Be now the first of all, by the low end on avoid
It's a pig, it's an eye, it's a soul, it's a seether
Big eye and hold it all, by the riding on a head
Dig down the voice distorting feeler hell
Chicks hide the most distorting
