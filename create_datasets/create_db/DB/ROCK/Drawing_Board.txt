I can recall only this one time
This kind of control the girl had on my mind
I'm falling deep, I can't get out
I've never acted this way before

I spent days and nights in my bedroom
Trying to write the perfect song to sing to you
Write a song a day but she won't like it anyway
Back to the drawing board 
With the words you've heard a million times before

Feeling alone, and she's on my mind
Try to erase all the pain from that time
She's breaking up, and I'm breaking down
Now I'm headed out of this fucked up town

I spent days and nights in my bedroom
Trying to write the perfect song to sing to you
Write a song a day but the band won't like it anyway
Back to the drawing board 
With the words you've heard a million times before
In your head

So love me, so I can be myself again
Now hate me, so things seem normal in my head
I'm trying, to break away this ball and chain
So hate me, so things seem normal in my head
Things seem normal in my head

I spent days and nights in my bedroom
Trying to write the perfect song to sing to you
I spent days and nights in my bedroom
Trying to write the perfect song to sing to you
Write a song a day but she won't like it anyway
Back to the drawing board 
With the words you've heard a million times before
In your head I am dead
