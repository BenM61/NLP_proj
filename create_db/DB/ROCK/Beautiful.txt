Beauty over wisdom to fit in with their style
Your Cinderella story's for a price
Vanity's a business built to fleece the unique
Silicon and stars collide, the rest will fall in line

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along

Visually you're stimulating to my eyes
Your Cinderella syndrome's full of lies
Your insecurities are concealed by your pride
Pretty soon your ego will kill what's left inside

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along
It's so pitiful what you are
As beautiful as you are
You should have seen this coming all along

You're everything that's so typical
Maybe you're alone for a reason, you're the reason

It's so pitiful what you are, you should have seen this coming all along

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming all along
It's so pitiful what you are
As beautiful as you are
You should have seen this coming all along
