From the album love is only feeling

She came with her blue jeans on
Wanting to star in a song.
Get you with your ins and outs of it,
You're coming on strong, so strong
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna make love to you.
She lifted my spirits high,
I noticed the dream in her eye.
Softly I entered her garden
Parting her veil with a sigh.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'm going to give my love to you.
I tidied up my last affair,
I lost so much I don't care
Felt like a fool in a foolery,
But I'm well on my way to repair.
I know you ain't no hanger on,
Baby, you can star in a song.
I took a look inside her head,
I saw a Victorian bed.
I took her to the fair green country,
I'm so weary of the life I've led
I'll tell you what we're gonna do,
We're gonna live and love so true.
