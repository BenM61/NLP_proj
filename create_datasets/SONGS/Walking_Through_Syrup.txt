You should wish me luck
I've taken my own head off
It was not my idea of fun
It was not my idea of fun

So here's the prediction, you get an affliction
You gain an addiction, you grab what you can
Get introduced to some good lady bubble head
While she's seducing some old man

Tell them who is boss
They think I've buckled, they think I've gone soft
But this ponytail is not for life
It suits me while it suits the wife

So here's the prediction, you get an affliction
You gain an addiction, you grab what you can
Get introduced to some good lady bubble head
Who thinks she's seducing Peter Pan

So here's the prediction, you get an affliction
You gain an addiction, you get an affliction
You gain an addiction, you get an affliction
You gain an addiction, you get an affliction
You gain an addiction, you get an affliction
