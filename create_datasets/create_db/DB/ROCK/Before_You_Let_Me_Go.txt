Stay tonight
Let me hold you like I never did before
Take my arms
And let me hold you like I never did before
And I should have tried just to talk about this
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know that I'm
Still here
So before you let me go

Take my hands
Let me touch you like I never did before
Take my heart and let me love you
Like I never did before
Like I never did before

And I should have tried just to talk about it
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know
That I'm still here

But we waste it every time
Now my heart is on the line
And we see ourselves no more
When we're closing every door
It's so much harder than before
So before you let me go

Before you let me go

Save the dance and let me spin you
Till your world is turning round and round
Round and round, round and round
Save the chance and let me show you
Just like you need a little more
Just like you need a little more

And I should have tried just to talk about it
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know
That I'm still here

But we waste it every time
Now my heart is on the line
Until we see oursleves no more
When we're closing every door
It's so much harder than before
So much harder than before
So before you let me go

Before you let me go

But we waste it every time
Now my heart is on the line
Until we see oursleves no more
When we're closing every door
It's so much harder than before
So much harder than before

But we wast it every time
Now my heart is on the line
And now we bruise with every step
When we're closing every door
Can we make it easier
Some time?
Some time
