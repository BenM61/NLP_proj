Slow down heart, you're beating much too fast.
Why don't you, slow down heart
As she goes walking, past you
When I first saw you (hey)my heart stood still (hey)
Down my spine (hey) I felt cold chills (hey)
My head started spinning (oh, oh)my knees got weak.
Aw, I couldn't even speak.
When my heart started pounding,(heart started pounding, like a)
Like a, mallet of a judge.
I couldn't budge (i couldn't budge)
I couldn't budge (i couldn't budge)
I couldn't budge (i couldn't budge)

So I said, slow down heart,
A, slow down a heart
You're beating much too fast.
You know that you're beating too fast
Slow down heart
As she goes walking past you

Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey.

Everyday I wait outside my door.(hey)
(hey) hoping you'll come by just once more (hey)
That's when in a distance (oh, ho)i can see it's you
Aw, what could I do oh,
When my heart started pounding,(heart started pounding)
Like a, thousand drums (oh, oh)
Here she comes (oh here she comes)
Oh, here she comes (oh here she, comes)
Oh, here she comes(oh here, she comes)

So I said, slow down heart,
Slow down heart
You're beating much too fast.
You know that you're beating too fast
Slow down heart
As she goes walking, past you
Why don't you, slow down heart
