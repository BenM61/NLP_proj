No words explain it
But I know my heart is safe
Know how to say
That there ain't no words for this
Gonna shout it out

I'm hesitating
Don't know how to tell you
That I'm contemplating
Walking out on you
But it's so hard
There's so much that I like about you
At the same time, I hate ya
You're always putting me through
Changes
And all your rages
Is more than love
I don't know what to call this

No words explain it
Oh baby
I don't know what to say
I'm gonna shout
Don't know how to say...
Baby, ain't no word for this
I'm gonna shout it out

You finally say that you need me
Before I leave you
Oh, my heart can't take it
I'm running after you
It's so hard
There's so much
That I wanna do to you
At the same time
You're always puttin' me through
Changes
And all your rages
More than love
I don't know what to call it

No words explain it
Oh baby
I don't know what to say
I'm gonna shout
Don't know how to say...
Baby, ain't no word for this
I'm gonna shout it out

Baby, I've taken
Whatever its name is
It's blowin' up my heart
Changes
Baby, I'll take them
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Ain't no word for this

No words explain it
Oh baby
I don't know what to say
Don't know how to say...
Baby, ain't no word for this

No words explain it
Oh baby
I don't know what to say
Don't know how to call it
Baby, ain't no word for this
