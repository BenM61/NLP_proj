Quite

I go where I want and I do as I please
Got the freedom to choose
Who I'm going to use
Don't spy on me ain't living for free
What's your address D: H: S. S.
Cause I'm quite disappointing
Yes I'm quite disappointing

Quite disappointing, it's a disease of the neighborhood
Quite disappointing, north west east and south of here
Quite disappointing, quite disappointing
Quite disappointing, quite disappointing

I don't need to pretend, I'll win in the end
I'll get my name in the news
And my point of views
Don't give me your rules cause I'm no fool
I'm out on my own so just leave me alone
