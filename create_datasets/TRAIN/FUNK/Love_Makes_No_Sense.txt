I'm no psycologist, 
there's some who will insist it makes the world go round.
There many questions out there that I don't know 
but I figured out that:
Somebody told me foolish people fall in love
Heartache and heart break, to play the game is not enough 
I paid my dues when it comes to love 
and I get so confused but I'll never give it up. 
No way, no way I lay my heart on the line, 
although sometimes I don't know why, I don't know why.
 
I'm no psycologist.
There's some who will insist it makes the world go 'round
There many questions out there that I don't know 
but I figured out that:
 
Love makes no sense 
Be it emotional or if it's physical, how does it take control.
Why does it make us do the things we do.
I don't have a doubt that:
Love makes no sense
I just don't know how it takes control. Love makes no sense 
Oh, I really don't know how it takes control
 
When love is good
It's really good
And when it's bad, it's oh so bad
 
Come what may
I'll never stray 
Through all the joy
And all the pain, I'll stay the same
 
Love makes no sense 
Be it emotional or if it's physical, how does it take control.
Why does it make us do the things we do.
I don't have a doubt that:
Love makes no sense
I just don't know how it takes control. Love makes no sense 
Oh, I really don't know how it takes control
