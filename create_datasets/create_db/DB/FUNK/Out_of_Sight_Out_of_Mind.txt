Out of sight, out of mind
So the story goes
You forgot I exist
My broken heart knows
Out of sight, out of mind
You found someone new
But I can't change my love
The way that you do
I sit around a wondering
About your new affair
I should forget to remember
And remember not to care
I'd forget if I could
But my heart is blind
You are gone out of sight
But not out of my mind
