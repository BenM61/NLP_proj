I'm a Punk Rock Prom Queen
Brown paper magazine
Hotter than you've ever seen
And everywhere and in between

I'm a ten-ticket thrill ride
Don't ya wanna come inside
A five-star triple-threat
Hardest of the hard to get
No one's little red Corvette
Ain't seen nothing like me yet

Six whole hours and five long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words, were way too late
'Cause you can't see that I'm the one

I'm your late-night head rush
Ace-high royal flush
Red velvet orange crush
You just don't impress me much

A glossy double-cover spread
Opened up inside your head
A black-cherry paradise
Half the sugar twice the spice
I don't wanna treat you nice
Come on baby, roll the dice

Six whole hours and five long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words, were way too late
'Cause you can't see that I'm the one

It took six whole hours and five long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words, were way too late
'Cause you can't see that I'm the one

It took six whole hours and five long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words, were way too late
'Cause you can't see that I'm the one
