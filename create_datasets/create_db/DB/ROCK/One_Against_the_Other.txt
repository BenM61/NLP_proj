People, stop your pushin' and try to learn
That nothin' can be gained by tryin' to hurt
We never seem to think about brothers workin' together
We always find ourselves at odds, one against the other

We got to lend a helping hand
And learn to lead with the other
We got to change this to a better world
And live in peace with one another

Worry's a state that's so unkind
People, try to find some peace of mind
I wish we'd find a way to get everyone together
It doesn't seem to help, we can't seem to help each other
Yeah, yeah

We got to work together, find a way
To help our friends and neighbors everyday
We never seem to think about brothers workin' together
We always find ourselves at odds, one against the other
