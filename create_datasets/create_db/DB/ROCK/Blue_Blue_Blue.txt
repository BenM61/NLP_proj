There's no view outside my window
There's a chill upon my killin' floor
No smoke pours from my chimney
'Cause all my fire has been spoken for

Nobody comes a knocking
There's no food to eat my cupboards bare
House full of nothing
What you left me when you left me here

I know that lonely's a waste of time
It's got me hurtin' deep down inside
But I don't have the will to change my state of mind

I've talked to friends who say they understand
But there's no sympathy for a lonely man

What am I to do?
Left me all alone and I'm feeling like a fool ya'll
What am I to do?

Thought that we would be forever
Then I wake up and it's all gone
What am I to do?
Except be blue

Now days most conversations bore me
And too much is not enough to drink
My friends, all most forgotten
Have stayed away to give me time to think

About my shiny future
Alone to live the life of luxury
In my house full of nothing 'cause
Nothing's what you left of me

I need somebody to ease my mind
Turn to the bottle to help me understand
There's no salvation for a drunken man

What am I to do?
Left me all alone and I'm feeling like a fool ya'll
What am I to do?

Thought that we would be forever
Then I wake up and it's all gone
What am I to do?
Except be blue

Took my car, my dancin' shoes, even took my attitude
Stripped the sheets from the bed
Stole the grease right off my head
Won't somebody please ease my mind

I've asked the heavens, "What am I to do?"
But there's no answer just the color blue
