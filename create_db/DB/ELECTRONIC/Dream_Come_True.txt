There will never be a time
when I'm true to you Yeah
You, you're always on my mind
Tell me what can I do
I've been in a strained of affaires
Til I met you
You, you're always on my mind
Tell me what can I do

Is it a dream come true
Above a love I once new
Was it all in my mind
I feel I dream on the time

You don't have to prove your love
Cause it's plain to see
And life, life is a mystery
Until you came to me
And we'll have high hopes
But if it don't work out
We won't need this may
Cause love got in force
And it will remain

Is it a dream come true...
