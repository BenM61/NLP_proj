On a summer day you can hear her call
But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall

Through the fields an' the streams an' the lakes an' the trees
And the grass and the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again

In the summer autumn air
You can see her smile
But in a funny way she reminds you of a child

In the autumn air
You feel her soul unfold
And in a funny way you feel your own explode

Through the fields an' the streams an' the lakes an' the trees
And the grass and the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again
Through the fields an' the streams an' the lakes an' the trees
And the grass and the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again

On a winter day
You can hear her call
But in a funny way when the snow begins to fall

On a winter day
You can hear her call
And in a funny way
You love her even more

Through the fields an' the streams an' the lakes an' the trees
And the grass and the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again
Through the fields an' the streams an' the lakes an' the trees
And the grass and the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again
