All these bruises keep me awake
I guess I'm just too tired to sleep
And God only knows I'm too lost to cry
For kissing liars has kept me true

I'll fall (hold me tight)
But I'll heal (hold me tight)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

I'll fall (hold me tight)
But I'll heal (hold me tight)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

He hates so much his love he says
Inside it's dark, I need to smile
He shouts so loud I never hear
That's why the truth's always abused
As I slip into unconsciousness
I never felt so much to blame

I'll fall (hold me tight)
But I'll heal (hold me tight)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

I'll fall (hold me tight)
But I'll heal (hold me tight)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

As I slip into unconsciousness
I never felt so much to blame

I'll fall (hold me tight)
But I'll heal (hold me tight)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

I'll fall (hold me tight)
But I'll heal (hold me tight)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

I'll fall (another day another night)
But I'll heal
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

I'll fall (another day another night)
But I'll heal
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

I'll fall (another day another night)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely

I'll fall (another day another night)
So hold me tight
Cause I'm so lonely
