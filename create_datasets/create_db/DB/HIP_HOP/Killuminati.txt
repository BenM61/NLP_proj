Let it be prophesized; n****s'll die because ya crew's goon
Around the way n****s get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
N****s is bold and they choose to roll
I kill em all, watch now n**** truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
N****s dyin' by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these n****s cross me
I'm certified crasy, so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, everytime I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a n**** cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a n**** breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' n****s watch they every step
Label me a threat
And I ain't even got started with this s*** yet
Thug style baby, hands on my pistol, listen I'm a rida'
Every n**** breathin' pay attention
Bout to show you motherf***ers how it feel, to drop a body
The simple gun to my lifestyle, Killuminati

Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you

After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustas
Similar to, b****es that scary, get too near me we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and n****s thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It's like I'm, dreamin, see in season me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
C*** the c***ed fo'-five, snatchin' n****s pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder s***
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
N**** got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati

Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you

I spend most of my time bankin' n****s
Because they hate a n****, comin' across fake n****s
But we made n****s, old school and I'm thinkin'
Y'all some b**** made n****s and you steadily sinkin'
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z ain't nuttin' f***in' with that
We bustin' back comin' back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin' them f***ers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill steal and peal quickly
The boss n****s, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati

They got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustling's my only fate
Toppin' grams on the kitchen plate, tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is rollin' three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer c***ed back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's simpin' naughty thangs
Real as these tatt's on my body, and it's Killuminati

Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
Hold it down
Killuminati and we got you, got you
