Do you love me, do you hate me
Do you love me, do you hate me
Do you love me, do you hate me
Yeah, yeah

This world loves me, this world loves me not
I'm torn between the best of both cus I'm hot
In this game so brittely, literaly
I got niggas wanna riddle me, get rid of me
R-U-L-E, need I say more?
World, hope y'all prepared for the chaos
Cause y'all want the beast in me, so I'ma give it
Paint pictures vivid, live high as a spirit
Y'all can all jump in it
That's what you might as well do
If you gonna live life timid
And I ain't never been intimidated
Believe me, and I don't wanna fuckin' breath easy
I wanna make it hard for these niggas
So when they can't stand me
I'ma make it so these niggas can't feed they family
Now do you love me, or do you hate me?
C'mon and get me, I keep it off safety

Do you love me
Do you hate me
Ready or not
Here I come

There's nothin' but love spread between me and my niggas
We bust guns together and f*ck so many bitches
But I know that Hell is callin'
In the name of the lord just let a nigga in
Cause I ain't done nothin' wrong, but love thy self
And harm other niggas that wanna stop my health
Is that healthy?
Cause love'll never be hand over hand
It's man versus man
It's Murda
If I'm gonna be hated or to be loved
I prefer ta live wild and die from slugs
What you want from me?
Lord I'm only a human
Tho I bear your name, I'm a devil in chains
Release me, cause Lord only knows it ain't easy
When I'm scarred for life, I know that he sees me
Now do you love me nigga
Or do you hate me nigga
C'mon and get me
I'm waiting nigga

Do you love me
Do you hate me
Ready or not
Here I come

Y'all just wanna watch me rise, then watch me fall
Before it's all done I'ma die from it all
I might OD in a club off drugs like River Phoenix
Or get shot down like BIG and Pac for my genius
I know this worlds seen it before, and here I come
I know y'all fiendin' for more, and I'm not done
As long as I can run through current like state times
Keep up a sane mind, and hand on my iron, I'ma blast off mine
Look in the eyes of a nigga who seldomely cries
I got a beautiful wife and kids, why me?
Y'all cats choose cash and cribs, why me?
If this good livin' Lord, why me?
When I live so dirty yet I'm worthy to be
Number one, the world's only begotten son
Here I come

Do you love me
Do you hate me
Ready or not
Here I come

Do you love me
Do you hate me
Ready or not
Here I come

Do you love me
Do you hate me
Ready or not
Here I come

Do you love me?
Do you hate me?
Do you love me?
Do you hate me?
Here
I
Come
