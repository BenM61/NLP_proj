I'm feeling good I'm having fun
This is the best night of my life
Girl can I be real?
I just wanna feel
on your booty that's not a big deal
Shawty you drinkin' gon' that Martini (Martini)
I wanna see you in a bikini (bikini)
Or better yet a thong, baby what's wrong?
Tryna tell your girls it's the purpose of this song
Ooh, I want you closer
You look like a model off a poster
I wanna get ya to the car to the crib up the stairs to the bed
In the morning you'll be cooking us set
Ooh baby, I love the smell of your perfume (perfume)
And if we were kids I'd be breaking curfew to stay out with you

You gon' need a scarf?
Wrap your head cause it's gon' get wild
If we keep lovin' like this, we might make a child
A daughter, a son, whichever one, girl your second to none

I'm feeling good, I'm having fun
This is the best night of my life
We off the Patron and both of us gone
Girl this gon' be the best night of my life
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're right here with me girl
And if we go home and make love
This could be the best night of your life (of my life)

So girl let me ask you a question while we're sipping bud
Are you going home with me after the club
That's a yes or a no, I'm just letting ya know
Where this night can go
And girl I'm hoping you see things my way
'Cause I just want your love to stay tonight, tonight

I could be your bartender, tell me what you're sippin' on
Girl, I'm not a travel agent so what you trippin' on
You say I think I could make it happen cause I'm famous
Nah, I'm just tryna get it cracking 'cause we faded
Get you to my crib, spend some time alone
Barely over 21 that mean you kinda grown
Umm, and I'm tat tat tatted up come down to that bread
I'ma stack it up where you goin'? Baby girl back it up

You gon' need a scarf?
Wrap your head cause it's gon' get wild
If we keep lovin' like this, we might make a child
A daughter, a son, whichever one
Girl your second to none

I'm feeling good, I'm having fun
This is the best night of my life
We off the Patron and both of us gone
Girl this gon' be the best night of my life
You coulda been anywhere in the World
But you're right here with me girl
And if we go home and make love
This could be the best night of your life (of my life)
