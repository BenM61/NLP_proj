When I feel left out
I feel run over
I know it's in my head
But I feel dead
When I'm not invited

Will I always be the one left behind the door?
Could I ever be the one you will open for?

Whenever you need me
I'll forget it all
Whenever you need me
I'll believe that I belong
Whenever you need me
Whenever you reach out
I'll be there
Whenever you change
Your mind I'll forgive
You made me wrong

Sometimes I feel ashamed
That I am longing
To be a part of you
One of the few
Why is it so exciting?

Who am I to always preach on equality?
When all I really ever am is a wannabe

Whenever you need me
I'll forget it all
Whenever you need me
I'll believe that I belong
Whenever you need me
Whenever you reach out
I'll be there
Whenever you change
Your mind I'll forgive
You made me wrong

Whenever you need me
Whenever you need me

Whenever you need me
I'll forget it all
Whenever you need me
I'll believe that I belong
Whenever you need me
Whenever you reach out
I'll be there
Whenever you change
Your mind I'll forgive
You made me wrong

Whenever you need me
