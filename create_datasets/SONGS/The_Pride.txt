I am
What you fear most
I am
What you need
I am
What you made me
I am
The American dream

I'm not selling out
I'm buying in

I will not be forgotten
This is my time to shine
I've got the scars to prove it
Only the strong survive
I'm not afraid of dying
Everyone has their time
I've never favored weakness
Welcome to the pride

I'm not selling out
I'm buying in

I will not be forgotten
This is my time to shine
I've got the scars to prove it
Only the strong survive
I'm not afraid of dying
Everyone has their time
I've never favored weakness
Welcome to the pride

Since the dawn of time
Only the strong have survived
I will not be forgotten
Welcome to the pride

I'm not afraid of dying
Everyone has their time
I've never favored weakness
Welcome to the pride
