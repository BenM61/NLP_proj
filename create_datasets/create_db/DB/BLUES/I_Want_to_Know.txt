I want to know what promises to keep
I want to know how guilty people sleep
I want to know if willows really weep
I want to know where's my reward to reap
I want to know why the devil's not run dry
I want to know why politicians lie
I want to know why nobody gets high
I want to know why they don't even try
I want to know if all you need is love
I want to know the word from up above
I want to know what you're thinking of
I want to know when you have had enough
I wonder why we think we're doing well
I wonder what time will be able to tell
We're waiting for someone to turn on the light so we won't be wrong about everything right
I want to know what it feels like to be king
I want to know if children they don't sing
I want to know if birds should lose their wing
I want to know if we'd do anything
I want to know how we could make ends meet
I want to know when i should stomp my feet
I want to know why history repeats
I want to know how you turned out so sweet
