Love can bring sorrow
Love can bring joy
To every girl and every boy

Love makes you happy
Makes you cry
Love is a miracle
That money can't buy

If I had a treasure
And fortune untold
I'd trade all my diamonds
I'd trade all my gold

I'd trade them for love
Without any doubt
Love is a miracle
You can't live without

Now only your love
Can make me a king
I'd pay any price
I'd give anything

If there is a Heaven
Somewhere above
Please bless this miracle
When we fell in love
Please bless this miracle
When we fell in love

A miracle
A miracle of love
