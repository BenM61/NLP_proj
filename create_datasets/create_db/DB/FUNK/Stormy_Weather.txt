Dont know why theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I aint together,
keeps on raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining all the time.

Life is bare, gloom and misry everywhere
Stormy weather
Just cant get my poorself together,
keeps on raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining all the time.
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin chair will get me.

All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Cant go on, evry thing I had is gone
Stormy weather

Since my man and I aint together,
keeps on raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining raining all the time.
