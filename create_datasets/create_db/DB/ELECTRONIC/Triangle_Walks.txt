An apple and a berry plant
Comes with a house
On the grass, who is that
To come by my house

Stands outside my window
Sucking on the berries
And eats us out of house and home
Keeping us awake, keeping us awake

Can I come over, I need to rest
Lay down for a while
Disconnect the night was so long
The day even longer
Lay down for a while recollect

Five A-M out again
Triangle walks
Magpies, I throw sticks at them
They laugh behind my back

Getting a feeling
Maybe I will dream again
Having that feeling
When there's no one awake
No no one awake

Can I come over, I need to rest
Lay down for a while
Disconnect the night was so long
The day even longer
Lay down for a while recollect
