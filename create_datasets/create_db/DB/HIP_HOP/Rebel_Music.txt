"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride" 
Hell Razah, Get Large Productions
Revolution music, Rebel Music, baby

[Chorus]
It's Rebel Music, put your mind into it
Right hand in the air, before you solemly sware it's
(rebel music)
The next rap level to music, step your paint game up
And if not, then keep moving
"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride" 

Rebel Music free the pain inside, until this day in my ghetto
I hear echoes, where anger cry, feel me?
I bring tears to the angel eye, and paint pictures
With a pen, for the saints that die
Why you happy go lucky, off of record label lies
I make, rebel music, verse the devil's illusion
This time, they can't pacify the revolution
Even if they plan to pay us back, retrobution
I revoke to be part of their couch, 'cause we don't own
Enough boats, to be shipping in no bundles of coke
I can't advertise, on killin' my folks, who dead broke
While I'm thinkin' of my ancestors, hung on ropes
Black queens havin' seeds while she's strung on dope
I resurrected Nat Turner with this song that I wrote wrote

[Chorus]

"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride" 
Rebel Music on my side always, this be the theme for the UBP's
O.G.'s, and they young seeds
"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride" 
Rebel Music on my side always, I rebel against the true system
A young man givin' old wisdom, over soul witness

I try to stay out of drama, give my life to the heavenly father
'92 had a fetish for them heavy revolvers
We die as martyrs, underground, call me Osama
Plant seeds like a farmer, off of positive karma
Spiritual armor, bring me more medals of honor
I'm not your average M.C., son, my level is sharper
The ghetto is smarter, children of them biblical authors
Abraham, lost sheep, must continue the saga
Revelations, 2 and 9 prove that Christ was darker
Than the paintings on your walls, and your living room halls
Tatooed on your arms, and you chains and charms
Tell moms that I love her, God, for singing me songs

[Chorus]

"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride" 
Rebel Music, Rebel Music's on my side always (it's what I keep by my side)
Live in the ghetto, and I die in the ghetto, ghetto
"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride" 
My mind be crumb, the revolutionary seven needs
They raised up in the eighties, with these crack babies

Rest in peace on my project walls, a young drug lord
It's either rap now, or basketball
Everybody gotta jersey on, thinkin' they be murdering songs
Same hoes that put burberry on
You only learn when your hustle is wrong, you stepped your game
Shooters miss, when they aim up, Bush applied and they blamed us
Do a coke bust, hit the crib, say Bin Laden blew it up
Locked up, half of my raise, until we wise up
Rise up, and master our faith, word up, son
I'm a true black brother, ask Angie Stone
Papa was a rolling stone, Razah be the heir to the throne
Now I got check writers, ears to the phone
Meetings with big businessmen in other timezones
Chrome registered guns, two educated sons
Goons ready to ill when the revolution comes

[Chorus]

"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride" 
Rebel Music on my side always
You'll be back like young black geronimo jacks
With a calico, trenchcoats and godfather hats
"I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"
Afro picks, black leather gloves and Cadillac's
Marvin Gaye tracks, straps like Ron O'Neal

Rest in peace, Bobby Seals, Bobby Seals
Lived to die, for revolutionary music, rest in peace
Tupac Ashata Shakur, get up, stand up
Lived to die, for revolution music
Rest in peace to all the brothers in the ghetto
Didn't make it, get up stand up, don't give up the fight
Lived to die, for revolution music
Said get up, stand up, revolution to the only black
Sun of Man, the son of god
Get up, stand up, rest in peace, to all my brothers Tard and Clint
Cousin Jason, Ghetto Government Officials, died for rebel music
Signed, sealed and delivered
"I'm lettin' on the side, and waitin' forward, to
Lettin' the music, will let me ride"
