I ain't never been to San Francisco
But I believe a thing has happened there
All them things I'm hearin'bout San Francisco
And all them childrens with flowers in their hair

Seems like everybody has got a new Bag
Some o'them childrens seem to have some to say
Wearin' beads and all kind of funky clothes
And there's a thing they had in Monterey
Was a thing

Soul Francisco 
Soul Francisco 
Soul Francisco

Some o'them people are wond'rin' what it's all about
Don't seem to Be nobody that really knows
But from the way that all o'them chillun are doing
Could it be that some o'them got a little more soul

Soul Francisco
Soul Francisco
