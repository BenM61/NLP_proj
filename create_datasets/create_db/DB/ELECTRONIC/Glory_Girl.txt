I heard a song today reminded me of Spain
We were the innocent in springtime
I never liked you much we never keep in touch
I know your stories from the grapevine

And though I found it strange
To watch the change
When what you couldn't say was
Look at me, look at me

My glory, glory girl, help me to find a way to know you
Let's show the world
My glory girl, hide not behind the words that bind you
You don't owe the world
My glory girl, let's show the world

I heard you say today, you've thrown your life away
But dreams of happiness aren't wasted
You tried to reach the moon, you grew up too soon
Denied the freedom that you tasted

But all the tragedy now helps me discover you

My glory, glory girl, help me to find a way to know you
Let's show the world
My glory girl, hide not behind the words that bind you
You don't owe the world
My glory girl, let's show the world
My glory girl, let's show the world

My glory, glory girl, help me to find a way to know you
Let's show the world
My glory girl, hide not behind the words that bind you
You don't owe the world
My glory girl, let's show the world

Let's show the world
My glory girl, let's show the world
