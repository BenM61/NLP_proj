The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
You'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
The thrill gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
The thrill away for good
All the thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open armed baby
Just like I know, I know I should

I'm free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Free, free, free now baby
Baby, I'm free from your spell
Now that it's all over
All that I can do is wish you well

The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away for good
You know you done me wrong baby
You'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
I'm free from your spell, baby
Yes, I'm free oh I'm free from your spell
