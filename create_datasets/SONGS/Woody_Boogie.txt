Every time she looks at me, 
I can feel electric heat, 
All right, all right, 
Shiny sparkle in her eyes, 
As she's moving in disguise, 
All right, all night... 

I am losing my control, 
May be time to take a hold, 
Tonight, all right, 
Body spinning all around, 
Don't know if I'm up or down, 
I'm on fire... 

Woody Woody Boogie, Woody Woody Boogie 
Woody get down tonight, Woody get down tonight 
We're on the go-o-o

Woody 

People jumping in the air 
Going crazy everywhere 
All right, all right 
I keep staring at her face 
When the clock begins to race 
All night, all night

Breaking up the night, oh-oh-oh 
Shaking up the night, oh-oh-oh 
Breaking up the night, oh-oh-oh 
Come on, it's time to hit the floor 
You can be sure you won't get bored
