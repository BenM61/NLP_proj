Darling, darling 
Oh turn the lights back on now 
Watching watching, 
As the credits all roll down
Crying, crying
You know we're playing to a full house, house
No heroes, villains one to blame 
While wilted roses fill the stage 
And the thrill, the thrill is gone

Our debut was a masterpiece 
But in the end for you and me
Oh the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd
And take our final bow
Oh it's our turn to go

But at least we stole the show
But at least we stole the show 
But at least we stole the show
But at least we stole the show 

At least we stole the show

Darling, darling
You know that we are sold out 
Kisses fading
But the band plays on now
Crying, crying
So let the velvet roll down, down

No heroes, villains 
One to blame 
While wilted roses fill the stage 
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece 
Our lines we read so perfectly 
But the show, it can't go on

We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh 
And wave out to the crowd 
And take our final bow
Oh it's our turn to go
But at least we stole the show

Least we stole the show 
Least we stole the show 
Least we stole the show 

Least we stole the show

At least we stole the show 

Stole the show

At least we stole the show
