So I found a reason to stay alive 
Try a little harder see the other side 
Talking to myself 
Too many sleepless nights 
Trying to find a meaning to this stupid life 
I don't want your sympathy 
Sometimes I don't know who to be 
Hey what you're looking for 
No one has the answer 
They just want more 
Hey who's gonna make it back 
This could be the first 
Day of my life 

So I found a reason 
To let it go 
Tell you that I'm smiling 
But I still need to grow 
Will I find salvation in the arms of love 

Will it stop me searching will it be enough 

I don't want your sympathy 
Sometimes I don't know who to be 
Hey what you're looking for 
No one has the answer but you just want more 
Hey who's gonna make it back 
This could be the first day of my life 

The first time to really feel alive 
The first time to break the chain 
The first time to walk away from pain 

Hey what you're looking for 
No one has the answer we just want more 
Hey who's gonna make it back 
This could be the first day of your life 
Hey what you're looking for 
No one has the answer they just want more 
Hey who's gonna shine alight? 
This could be the first day of my life
