Hey I said you're godless and
It seems like you're a soulless friend
As thoughtless as you were back then
I swear that you are godless

Hey I guess you're lonely when
I gave you all it took so then
Stranger then it's ever been
I guess, It's what you wanted

It seems, lonely I would be
I beg, I plead
But this is all that I have gotten
Hey as for the day my friend

To hope that you could ever bend
I swear you are
I swear you are
I swear

That you are godless
Hey I said you're godless
Hey and you're a soulless friend
Hey I said you're thoughtless

And I swear
I swear
Godless
Godless

God
You're godless
