Real talk, I'm a attracted to you, wanna do something to you
Wanna feel your body all over mine
Tell me what your feelin', can we make this happen?
We can get this crackin' in no time

But there's one condition before we get to smashin'
Promise me that you won't get too attached
Don't start catchin' feelings, wanna start having children
Baby, I'm the wrong for that

Real as I can be with you
I just wanna creep with you
I ain't tryin' to be your man
Girl, I hope you understand

When you wanna get broken off, girl
Need someone to call, girl, wanna be the one who fills that void
As much as I would like to, the one thing that I can't do
Is get in another relationship at this point

Let's just keep it simple and do out the dizzle
This way no one gets hurt, baby
At least I'm bein' up front, girl, tellin' you what I want, girl
Let me know if this works for you

Real as I can be with you
I just wanna creep with you
I ain't tryin' to be your man
Girl, I hope you understand

Real as I can be with you
I just wanna creep with you
I ain't tryin' to be your man
Girl, I hope you understand

Real talk this is
Real talk this is
Real talk this is

Real talk this is
Real talk this is
Real talk

Real as I can be with you
I just wanna creep with you
I ain't tryin' to be your man
Girl, I hope you understand

Real as I can be with you
I just wanna creep with you
I ain't tryin' to be your man
Girl, I hope you understand

Real as I can be with you
I just wanna creep with you
I ain't tryin' to be your man
Girl, I hope you understand

Real as I can be with you
I ain't tryin' to be your man
