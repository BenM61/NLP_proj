If it were left up to me
It would take more than a notion
If it were left up to me
We could put ideas in motion
Had it been left up to you
Would you try, would you try
If it were left up to me
I would try

If it were left up to me
We would live in a bubble
If it were left up to me or you
we would stay out of trouble
But it's the way that they do
Makes you cry, makes you cry
And still it's left up to you
Got to try

If it were left up to you
Would you sigh and forget it
And get some sleeping to see
If you live to regret it
Now that it's left up to me and you
Will you try, will you try
I promise from me to you I will try
