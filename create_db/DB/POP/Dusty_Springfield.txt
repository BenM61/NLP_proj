Dusty springfield, that's a pretty name
It even sounds like a game in a green field
Hobby horses play the dusty game when it's may

pink and paisley skies shining in green eyes
A magic pin wheel, london flowers in her hair

dusty springfield, silver starshine over crystal waters
Petals fall from her glance
Flowers sparkle with a dew of morning
Feathers float from her dance

suddenly the song's the thing
Fill your cup, come to the spring
And you'll stand so still and you'll feel the thrill
Dusty springfield, that's a pretty name
Pretty as a pearl
What a pretty girl
