You don't look like my baby
And you don't feel quite the same
You don't touch quite like my woman
But you got something
I can't explain

[Chorus: x2]
The way you wear your clothes drives me crazy
The way you walk around, just hanging 'round
I can't stand it, what you're doing
You got something
I can't live without
