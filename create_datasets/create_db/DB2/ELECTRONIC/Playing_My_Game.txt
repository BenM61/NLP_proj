 

Won't open my mouth  
You know what I'll say 
It hurts me that it's gotta be this way 
I can no longer hide 
God knows I've tried 
I held on as long as I could 
If I could change it  I would 
This is the way I am  
And this is what I do. 

I cry my tears 
But they're not for you 
Playing a game 
I know you've done too 
I shouldn't have waited  
But still it's all the same 
Cause you know  
I'm just playing my game. 

Close your ears if you don't like the sound of my voice 
You're acting like I 
Like I had a choice 
But to leave you behind well, 
I've made up my mind. 

I cry my tears 
But they not for you 
Playing a game 
I know you've done too 
I shouldn't have waited, 
But still it is all the same 
Because you know, 
I'm just playing my game. 

Don't hold me with your eyes 
The light in them I cannot see, 
No need to blind me 
There's this darkness where I walk 
You thought you had your future 
All figured out. 

I cry my tears 
But they're not for you 
Playing a game 
I know you've done too 
I shouldn't have waited, 
But still it is all the same 
Cause you know, 
I'm just playing my game, 
I'm playing my game.
