And then she holds my hand, mm
And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
 
And then he holds my hand, mm
And then I understand. mm
His eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then he dims the light, mm
And then he holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
