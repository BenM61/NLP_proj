Just when I thought that fate was unkind,
That happiness wasn't to be,
I got a shock and I changed my mind,
A miracle happened to me.

If the moon turns green and shadows get up and walk around,
And clouds come tumbling to the ground,
I wouldn't be surprised,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
If the stars turn blue and Willows that weep begin to sing,
And winter changes into Spring,
I wouldn't raise my eyes,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
I thought I was foolish to think of romance 
With someone so charming as you,
Thought I was hoping without any chance.
But ev'ry hope came true.

If the moon turns green and rivers begin to flow up stream,
And this is all a crazy dream,
I wouldn't be surprised,
'Cause anything can happen if you can fall in love with me.
