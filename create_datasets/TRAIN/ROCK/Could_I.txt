Your only try at love was through before it began
So now you're frightened of the thought of losing again
Would I be true to you; girl, if there's any doubt
Just ask me anything your mind is wondering about

Could I chase the bitter taste
Left in your heart by someone who said goodbye
Could I love? Give me love
I'm down on my knees, beggin' you please, Could I?

If I could get to you & prove the things that I say
You wouldn't compare me to the pain you knew yesterday
You've built a wall of ice I'm sure my lovin' will melt
Please let me hold you, love, instead of asking yourself

Could I chase the bitter taste
Left in your heart by someone who said goodbye
Could I love? Give me love
I'm down on my knees, beggin' you please, Could I?
