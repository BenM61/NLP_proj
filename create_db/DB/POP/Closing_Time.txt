This is the way we walk
This is how we walk
At closing time
These are the songs we sing
These are our songs
At closing time
And in the clear
Of this sweet moonshine
We'll walk back
To where we started
On our own again

This is my favorite time
Drink up now and move outside
It's closing time
My most favorite lips
Are on the girls that i kissed
At closing time
And in the clear of dear sweet moonshine
We'll walk back
To where we started
On our own again

When all the people are just
Shuffling home
When all the saddest things are
Said and done
And all the words are brighter
In the happy light of
Closing time

We took the shortcut home
Over the wood slat bridge
And stood and gazed and wished
Till all the clouds
Had vanished
Nothing could be missed
And only the river passed
And there at the back of eleven
In the late summer night
A leaf landed soft
Soft soft soft
And sorrowful
And your belly was warm
As the day was long
And night came upon us
So fast

Would you be poor
Not to be sure
That everything lasts for ever
Some things don't get better
Till you're on your own again

We took the shortcut home
Over the wood slat bridge
And stood and stared and wished
Till all the clouds
Had vanished
Nothing could be missed

And only the river passed
And there at the back of eleven
A leaf landed soft and sorrowful
And your belly was warm
And the day was long
And night came upon us

So fast
So fast
Came so fast
Came so fast
Came so fast
And all we said

Da da do do
All we said was
All we said was
Was da da do do
Was da da do do
Da da do do

And all we said
Do do
Do do
Do do
