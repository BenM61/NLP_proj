Who said that money was everything
Well, that's a crock, you know what I'm sayin'
When the well runs dry 
Say goodbye to your fair-weather friends
If I need a hug 
And I feel like crawling under a rug
If I fell on my face
I know that you'd be there to help me up

'Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Ain't nobody gonna make me live my life alone

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old

You know, lovers they come and go
Like ships to a dock, a bunch of heartbreakers they are
They blind you with their innocence 
Tie your heart in knots
If I need some hope
And I feel I'm at the end of my rope
You make that funny face
You're always there to cheer me up

'Cause it's you, only you to take me along
Ain't nobody I'd rather have to help me sing a song

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old

'Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Ain't nobody I'd rather have to help me sing a song

A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
A friend will always be there when I grow old
Won't think it's funny
Will stand for me when others call me a dummy
A friend will always be there when I grow
A friend will always be there when I grow
A friend will always be there when I grow old
