In the morning before he wakes up
She's collecting her clothes 'round the bed
Walking tip-toes and fixing her hair
Shuts the door and she runs down the hair

In her summer dress, she walks on home
All her winter clothes are gone or sold

There's no looking back and there's no fear
There's no reason for her to believe
That she needs to hang on to her past
It's so natural just to move on
And he doesn't know that she's really

Gone into her closet and her drawers
To throw out the things she can't ignore

In a summer dress she walks on home
All her winter clothes are gone or sold
