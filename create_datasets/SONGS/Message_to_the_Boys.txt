Well I met her in a bar
Like I always say
She was digging Tommy's cute
Way down in FLA

Wearing that vest with nothing underneath
Looking her best in the Florida heat
Sent a message to the boys
She was wearing that vest with nothing underneath
She be looking her best in the Florida heat, yeah
Sent a message to the boys

Well, she couldn't cut loose
With her mommy around
So she packed her pretty bags
Went to the run-away town

Used to call me late at night
Said she missed her little maid
I never asked twice how the bills got paid
She sent a message to the boys

Used to call me every night
Said she missed her little maid
Never ever asked twice how the bills got paid
Sent the message to the boys

She sent a message to the boys
She's gonna be there, if you need her
I can't forget her and her voice
And her voice

Was a lady to the end
Now to this I can attest
She knew how to move
Yeah, when she rock'n'rolled this

She sent a message to the boys
She's gonna be there, if you need her
I can't forget her and her voice

She sent a message to the boys
She sent a message to the boys
God, I miss her and her voice

She sent a message to the boys
She sent a message to the boys
Oh god, I miss her and her voice
