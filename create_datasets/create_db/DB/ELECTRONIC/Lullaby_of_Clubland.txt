How much of yourself do you give away
After someone's left your life in disarray?
It still hurts
But it won't show
Because I'm too proud
So you're never ever gonna know.

I'm on the dark side of the street,
Not the light side of the street.

It's packed at 2am.
I've got no coat,
Are you on your own?
I'm into you.
When are you going home?
Get into me.

How much of the day can you sit around
Letting all your feelings drag underground?
I don't care and I do care
Because I want it
If I know that it's out there everywhere. 

I'm on the dark side of the street,
Not the light side of the street.

It's packed at 2am.
I've got no coat,
Are you on your own?
I'm into you.
When are you going home?
Get into me.

I saw you standing at the bar,
Don't know your name or who you are.

It's packed at 2am.
I've got no coat,
Are you on your own?
I'm into you.
When are you going home?
Get into me.
