As I watch your face
I can see my life go by
You mean everyhing to me
Just can't take no more
Throw a smile my way
And the pain I feel inside
Turns to love for you
And I'm yours
Do lovers ever need to hide
The things they really fell inside
I simply need you yo need me
Can't you see
Once I hoped to be
Your lover and your friend
It just can't go on
Your love games
Your love games
Do lovers ever need to hide
The things they really feel inside
If you won't show your heart to me
Set me free
Now the time has come
To show you how I feel
The love I gave to you
I can't give no more
Even now I see
The salt tears n your eyes
But it can't go on
Your love games
