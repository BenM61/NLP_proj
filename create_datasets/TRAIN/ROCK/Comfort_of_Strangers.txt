I know the stars that shine on me
Are brighter than you and I may ever be
I know there's an answer to your question
But I don't know that I could word it right

Say what you mean don't tell it like it could be
I'm not sure, should I just say it out loud?
Say what you mean don't tell it like it could be
Alright this time I'm gonna keep that in mind

One love is better than not enough
I'd rather have no love
Than messing with the wrong stuff
It's just the comfort of strangers
Always the comfort of strangers...yeah yeah yeah

I know the sun that shines on me
On better terms than you and I may ever be
I know there's an answer to the question
But I'm not sure that I should word it right

Say what you mean don't tell it like it could be
Every time you're gonna set me free
Say what you mean don't tell it like it could be
Alright this time let's take it right home to see

One love is better than not enough
I'd rather have no love
Than messing with the wrong stuff
It's just the comfort of strangers
Always the comfort of strangers

Well some of those are like best friends
Best friends!
Ones that keep you coming round again
