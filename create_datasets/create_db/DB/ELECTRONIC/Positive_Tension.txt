He said you're just as boring as everyone else
When you tut and you moan
And you squeal and you squelch
He said you're just as boring as everyone else
Nothing ever happens

Things replace things
Days replaces days
Things replace things

She said I'm going to use my teeth and my claws
She said I'm going to use my teeth and my claws
She said I'm going to use my teeth and my breasts
I'm gonna make it happen
She said

Run run run run run run
And you cannot run or ever, ever escape
You cannot run or ever hide it away
Something glorious is about to happen
The reckoning

They go you're just as boring as everyone else
When you tut and you moan
And you squeal and you squelch
They go you're just as boring as everyone else
Stuck past timing

The fear and the yearning
The fear and the consumption
The fear and the yearning
It's gonna to eat you alive
They go

They go
They say
They go
They say
They go
Why'd you have to get so hysterical
Success, success, success is over
Why'd you have to get
So fucking useless

Play it cool boy
Play it cool
