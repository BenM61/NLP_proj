Now Jimmy was livin' in misery
The poor boy was livin' in sin
When Jesus gave His life on Calvary
It weren't to save Jimmy's skin
He didn't play by any rules
But one thing he knew for sure

There were a lot of changes coming
He'd best be payin' them some mind
There were a lot of changes coming
He knew he'd better take his time

Jehovah sent a bright light shinin' down
Knocked Jimmy to the floor
He knew the message well enough
He'd heard it all said before
The reverend told Jimmy when he was a boy
The preacher when he was a man

There were a lot of changes coming
He'd best be payin' them some mind
And there's a lot of changes coming
You know you better take your time

Jimmy went to a mountain top
He's livin' with the tree
He listened to the world as it grew
Remembers all he sees
He ain't a saint or a prophet, no
But one thing he knows for sure

There were a lot of changes coming
You've best be payin' them some mind
And there's a lot of changes coming
You know you better take your time
And there's a lot of changes coming
You know you better take your time

Hope you'd know that there's a lot of changes coming
You better take your time
And there's a lot of changes coming
You better take your time
There's a lot of changes coming
You've best be payin' them some mind
There's a lot of changes coming
You better take your time
