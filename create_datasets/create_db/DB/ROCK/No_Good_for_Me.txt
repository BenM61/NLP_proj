I see a home in a quiet place 
I see myself in a strong embrace 
And I feel protection from the human race 
It's not parental 
But it's a fantasy, not a reality 
And it's no good, no no good for me you have no idea 

That I'm walking through the clouds 
When you're looking at me 
I'm feeling like a child 
Vulnerability 
I am shaking like a leaf if you move beside me 
And you're all that I see 
But it's no good for me 

You have a home (you have a home) in a quiet place 
And someone else feels your strong embrace 
She is protected and she needs no chase 
And do you love her
You're a mystery, you are the heart of intrigue 
You're no good, no no good for me 
That you have no idea 

That I'm walking through the clouds 
When you're looking at me 
I'm feeling like a child 
Vulnerability 
I am shaking like a leaf if you move beside me 
And you're all that I see 
But it's no good for me 

No it's no good for me, yeah
No good for me
It's so make-believe
You have no idea

That I'm walking through the clouds 
When you're looking at me 
I'm feeling like a child 
Vulnerability 
I am shaking like a leaf if you move beside me 
And you're all that I see 
But it's no good for me 
No good, no good

Through the clouds 
When you're looking at me 
I'm feeling like a child 
Vulnerability 
I am shaking like a leaf if you move beside me 
And you're all that I see 
But it's no good, it's just no good for me
