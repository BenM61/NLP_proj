Pain in my heart, treating me cold
Where can my baby be, Lord no-one knows
Pain in my heart, won't let me sleep
I wake up at night in misery, yes I do
And when my days begin to get rough
Why don't you come back, come back, came back baby
I've had enough

Pain in my heart, won't let me be
Oh I wake up at night in misery
Pain in my heart, treating me cold
Where can my baby be, Lord no-one knows, no they don't
And when my days begin to get rough
Won't you love me, love me, love me baby
Cause I've had enough
