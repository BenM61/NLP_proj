You're jumping for your ladies lip
You're so addicted that you can't get clear 
And you're craving but makes you ill
You can't control it its doing your head in
Well come on over here
It's about time your ass was mine
Can't say no not until you've tried it

I can't give you what you want but I give you what you need
And I will take it to you
I can't give you what you want but I give you what you need
You know you're going to
Don't be stupid you're hanging on but you know its useless
I can't give you what you want but I give you what you need
What you need
What you need oh
What you need is

You're electric but she leaves you whole
You need the shocks she give you so you can't let go
And she a habit you learn to take her lip
And you can't help yourself you've got to scratch that itch
(Come on)
Well come on over here its about time I blow your mind
Don't you dare say no not until you've tried it

What you need is
What you need is
If you can't handle it
What you need is

What you need is 
What you need is
What you need is good
