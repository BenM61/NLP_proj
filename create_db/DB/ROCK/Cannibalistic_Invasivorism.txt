As populations explode
Sustainability and all hope will erode 
Its time we reset the clock before the hourglass implodes on itself and on us,
Its on us to adjust ourselves

Its time to dine on mankind

An invasive species corrupting entirely
Humanity, a civilized society, oh the irony
Self-righteous organisms salivating at the thought of slavery
Permeating, enslaving with audacious depravity

To recondition our eco-systems
To reposition - man is now the victim

Cannibalistic invasivorism
An indigenous reclamation

Through violence
Through hate
Through inhumanity
Au naturale

Its time we die for the love of life

An unnatural practice, to restore balance, to combat the malice
Introduced by man
Thinning the herders, culinary murder
Eco-crusaders, eating the invaders

To recondition our eco-systems
To reposition man is now the victim

Through violence
Through hate
Through inhumanity
Au naturale
