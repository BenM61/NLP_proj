I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, bow! What up homie?
My watch saying, "Hi shorty, we can be friends?"
My whip saying, "Quit playing b**** get in"
My earring saying, "We can hit the mall together"
Shorty, it's only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things y'all n****z y'all know my style
Ya wrist bling bling, my s*** bling blow

My pinky ring talk it say, "50 I'm sick"
That's why these n****z is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits
Flex my man, he gon' bump my s***
See I'm alive, man I really don't care
I tell them hoes whatever they wanna hear
You try and play me I'ma blaze it in
My chromes cost more than the crib ya Momma raised ya in

F*** around we crip, walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no f***ing bama
I'm from the wild whody, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, n****z go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, rollout I'm done
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump?

Don't make me hit ya up, 50 cent will split ya up
I lay you down, them carnids will come and get ya up
See 50 play fa keeps, and 50 stay wit heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real bloody man, the hood love me, man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bro-man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
See O screaming shut the f*** up in the pen

But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn s*** changed
