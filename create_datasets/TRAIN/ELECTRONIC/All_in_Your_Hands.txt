I've been so excited since I knew I was gonna be with you
Now everyday the sun will shine on me from your eyes
I'm on a train to you and it's just not fast enough
Every second takes an hour, I can't sit still
You waited so long and so patiently for me to be
Sure I could trust the light in your eyes that shine
Now it's all in your hands and it feels so beautiful
Now you can lay them all on me as much as you like
Hmm the things that you do to me make me tremble
Just one look from your eyes make me weak
There's no greater love than the way I feel
Now I've let myself love you
You waited so long and so patiently for me to be
Sure I could trust the way that you make me feel
Now it's all in your hands and it feels so beautiful
Now you can lay them all on me as much as you like
Now it's all in your hands and it feels so beautiful
Now you can lay them on me as much as you like
Now it's all in your hands and it feels so beautiful
Now you can lay them on me as much as you like
Lay them on me baby
As much as you like
Lay them on me baby
As much as you like
