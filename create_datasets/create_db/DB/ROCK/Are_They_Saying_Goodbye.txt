Are they saying goodbye
Or is it just like before
Could it be that I, made him love her more
Does he course upon my face
Do I symbolise this grace
Could it be that I, made him love her more

Well I refuse to go to deeper I choose to go blind
This trouble just shouldn't be mine
But its confusing my existence, it's contruding my mind
I guess this trouble is also mine

So I course upon his face
He's a symbol of my own mistakes
Could it be that she makes me love him more
I ah, oh, ah,

Well I refuse to go to deeper I choose to go blind
This trouble just shouldn't be mine
But its confusing my existence, it's contruding my mind
I guess this trouble is also ah, oh,
I refuse to go to deeper I choose to go blind
This trouble just shouldn't be mine
But its confusing my existence, it's contruding my mind
I guess this trouble, this trouble, this trouble is also mine.
