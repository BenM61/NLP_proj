[Intro] 
Uh uh 
Get Money all over again 
Get Money all over again 
Get Money all over again 
Get Money all over again 
'99  Double Up  uh uh 

Yo  when you look in my eyes what chu see? 
A sincere man or just a bunch of G 
Why second guess  the brotha would last 
They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave' 
The booties in Arbua  boats and hoover crafts 
So if Biggie could love the dough, Murda could love the cash 
Butter Benz, gave the Tahoe to my other half 
If she got the Benz then guess what mami have 
Why dread it, tell the waiter too much ice in the crib 
Blick's so drunk, he think we singing "Nights Like This" 
He say when he grow up he want a life like this 
Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this? 
While girls throwin' head I ain't even touch dice 
I ain't trust Don King, how i'ma trust Mike? 
I date bull daggers, and I don't trust Dykes 
Need a clearner nina, 'cause they don't bust right 
I ain't stingy, when everybody see the plush life 
Buy rims before the benz, so I look just right 
Girls love me, try to get the girls that love Mike 
All I need is a cup of cool-Aid, I got enough ice 

1- [Cheri Dennis] 
All I ever wanted was you for me 
'cause that nigga who I'm with don't give a f*ck about me 
And all I ever wanted was to be there for you 
'cause that girl who you with don't give a f*ck about you 

You unhappy, and I see it when you cry 
You look like your life has just been minimized 
I ain't your man, I'm your man on the side 
You just call me when you plan to slide 
And if you ever feel like you want to creep 
All you gotta do is just give me a beep 
Only way I won't call you back less I'm asleep 
Gettin' my money or layin' it wit' a piece 
We hit the block, shop a lot 
She see her man, but she don't want to drop the top 
And you know that don't really mean a thing to me 
Can't no girl ever run game with me 
You know Mase, got a lot of places to be 
Spots in Ohio, kick in NC 
And I be wit older dudes and know the rules 
So if a man pick up the phone I know the code to use 

Repeat 1 

If you cheat on me, I'ma cheat on you 
If you don't speak of me, I won't speack of you 
I'll tell you now, we wait about a week or two 
Then I know what we could do 
We could just get our food and stay in 
'cause people on the block is hatin' 
They know your man, and know we datin' 
So we gotta do this just stay friends 
(OK) Amen 

[Both] 
I lay back, I zone 
You say that it's on 

[Mase] 
Then the girl try to snatch the phone 
So I knew I was happier home 

Repeat 1 until fade
