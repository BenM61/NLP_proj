You hear me cry out, won't you save me
You smile to my face, yet still deprave me
I need proof
You're a mean old man all right

In this semi-mad world, it's best not to think
Roll in your boat and you're bound to sink
You laugh with your mouth but your eyes don't blink
You're a mean old man all right

But the lord above knows that you lie
And your false complexion just another alibi
You laugh with your mouth but your eyes don't blink
And I'm sure that I've seen through you
And it seems all my friends are coming too

You spell me green, though the colour's blue
The debt collector has his eyes on you
But the Lord above knows that you lie
And your false complexion just another alibi
You laugh with your mouth but your eyes don't blink
And I'm sure that I've seen through you
And it seems all my friends are coming too
