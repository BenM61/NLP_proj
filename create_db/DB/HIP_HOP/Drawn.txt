Shadow you're drawn, why don't you go?
In the corner babe, watching the snow
Moving afar, rolling away
You make the world believe, now won't you stay?
Won't you stay babe? Won't you stay babe?

Oh, I never know what come around, I never looked ahead
I'm breaking loose and it's pulling us down, the words I wished I'd said
Shadow you're drawn and you got your ways
Shadow you've painted red
Red
Moving afar, rolling away
You make the world believe, now won't you stay?
Won't you stay babe? Won't you stay babe?

It's drawn

One, two
Yo, I'm with the paper plate, hold
Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll
Food on the floor, not to be wasted
Or what's being pasted and know that it's not a copy
Eye on a prize instead of gas prices
Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest
Born in a generation that don't generate patience
I travel too fast for you to clock me (Time)
Not always a good thing
You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour
I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones
Had me like a fiend screamin' "What you got for me?"
Two words (I'm mortal)
But the fans slid 'em both together and removed the apostrophe
Hip hop's lords maybe but my ways needs laundering
Time's a-ticking, stop squandering!
