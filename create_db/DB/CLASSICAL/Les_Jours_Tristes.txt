It's hard
Hard, not to sit on your hands 
Burrow your head in the sand
Hard, not to make other plans
And claim that you've done all you can
All alone
And life
Must go on

It's hard
Hard, to stand up for what's right
And bring home the bacon each night 
Hard, not to break down and cry
When every ideal that you tried
Has been wrong
But you must
Carry on

It's hard
But you know it's worth the fight
Cause you know you've got the truth on your side
When the accusations fly
Hold tight
Don't be afraid of what they'll say	
Who cares what cowards think? Anyway 
They will understand some day
Some day

It's hard
Hard, when you're here all alone
And everyone else's gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivity's gone
And it's gone
But you still
Carry on

'Cause you
You are the only one left
And you've got to clean up this mess
You know you'll end up like the rest
Bitter and twisted, unless 
You stay strong
And you
Carry on

It's hard
Hard, when you're here all alone
And everyone else's gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivity's gone
And it's gone
But you still
Carry on

It's hard
Hard, when you're here all alone
And everyone else's gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivity's gone
And it's gone
But you still
Carry on
