I ain't sleeping, too much in my head
I've been thinking somethin's left unsaid
And in the morning feeling just the same
Boy, it's killing me

I ain't crying don't want to be alone
Just need lifting from my melancholic tone.
Make no mistake, a little too late is just too long
Don't ask me why this is goodbye
If you you do me wrong

So baby tonight, I might let you in
No need to fight I'm yours so let's begin
But baby I know, when you go
Your touch I'll miss

But starting tonight
If you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end
As a goodnight kiss

Boy you're dreaming
You don't know what to do
Don't be shy, stop I'm coming through
And in the meantime

If you have a little doubt
Make no mistake, it's never too late
What's done can't be undone
Don't be afraid to what I say
The best is yet to come.

So baby tonight, I might let you in
No need to fight I'm yours so let's begin
But baby I know, when you go
Your touch I'll miss

But starting tonight
If you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end
As a goodnight kiss

I'd rather be lonely
Than be with a phoney
If I'm not the girl in your head
I'd rather be wrong
If it doesn't feel right
'Cause boy you're killing me tonight

So baby tonight, I might let you in
No need to fight I'm yours so let's begin
But baby I know, when you go
Your touch I'll miss

But starting tonight
If you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end
As a goodnight kiss

A goodnight kiss
