Standing here on my own
Yeah, the first step's the hardest
When you're walking into the unknown
It's been dark, and it's been cold
Had my head in the clouds
Never knowing what lies down below

Then you spoke your truth with no secrets
Told me, "use your heart while it's beating"

When you're right here beside me
There's nothing else I need
Your eyes keep me reminded
That nothing's out of reach
When you're with me
It feels like I'm finally free
Feels like I'm finally free

I didn't know
Didn't know what was real
Had to go to the edge
And the ground just to see how it feels

Then you spoke your truth with no secrets
Told me, "use your heart while it's beating"

When you're right here beside me
There's nothing else I need
Yeah, your eyes keep me reminded
That nothing's out of reach
When you're with me
It feels like I'm finally free
(Woo, woo)
Feels like I'm finally free

I used to spend my nights looking at the stars
Wondering how to get there, is it just too far?
I used to spend my nights looking at the stars
Wondering how to get there, is it just too far?

But when you're right here beside me
There's nothing else I need
Yeah, your eyes keep me reminded
That nothing's out of reach
It's easy to believe
When you're with me
It feels like I'm finally free
(Oh yeah)
It feels like I'm finally free
(Woo, woo)
It feels like I'm finally free
