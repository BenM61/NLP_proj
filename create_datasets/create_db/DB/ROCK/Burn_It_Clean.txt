(Hey, jackass)

Got a burnin', it's so hot it shines
The road I'm on's got no signs
You say I abuse my only life
The fruit I eat is over-ripe
Yeah

Burn it clean
Burn it clean

Guitar-playin' loser, lose your turn
Got her up in the start, I'm itchin' to burn
Lost my turn and gained a sin
Got to see it, got to see it goin' in
Yeah

Burn it clean
Burn it clean

Burn it clean
Burn it clean
Burn it clean
Burn it clean

Wound up tied, hot under the collar
You'll do anything for a dollar
Burn everything, I can't aim
Got to see it, got to see it go up in flames

Burn it clean
Burn it clean
Burn it clean
