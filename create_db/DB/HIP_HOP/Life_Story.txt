The world ain't no different now 
The world ain't no different now... 

Never had a dime 
My life a crime 
Had be when I was nine 
Mom drunk off of wine 
Ran with all kind her mind stayed wit the stooper 
Till a point she paid no mind to the supper 
Stay mad but stay fronting with smiles 
Stayed on the groung once and a while 
First day of school 
Never had nutin to style 
Mister colondre stressin I ain't comin in a while 
It was a bummber 
Rocking the shit I rocked all summer 
On the first day I was feeling some kind of way 
And she wasn't trying to do nutin 
You would think for the sake of the kids she would enroll in school or 
Something 
Now I kno then was even harder 
Especially for a single mother 
Raising me with no father 
Shit living up in this tentament 
Eating stale m and m's 
Talking wild shit to spanish imigrants 
I speak in codes 
Man to sivrence 
Always quiet then ben dichon to my madre 
Even thought she did nutin for me 
Acknowledge me as I run down my life story 

You don't know how crazy it is outside 
I die inside 
Oh I've cried oh I've cried 
Do you forgive me?? do you forgive me?? 

Check the skit 
No body never gave me shit 
If anything a nigga frame me and make me get 
3 to 6 my first bid 
No doubt up in sparfard 
Had to be 12 son had to make a profit 
Remembering robbed my moms wit no guilt 
Eating pork and beans or corn flakes wit no milk 
In school I smacked cats in a hurry 
Moms didn't care she was getting drunk wit misses berray 
On the first floor 
I used to thrist for greenary 
Picking pockets wit seth and jay from hundred and sixth street 
Yo f*ck home 
I'm tired of geting punched in my dome 
Tired of this faggot ass nigga moan 
That's when I started roaming 
My hustling game is deep 
Cats ya heard 
Ran from san fran to manhat tan to newburg 
Notorious tell ya friends spread the word 
Glorious my life story is obsurd 


Chorus repeat 2x 


Home from elmira 

Got a little writer 

I'm gonna keep it real still a scheme man coniver 

Recognize the struggle live it like a thug do 

Hatred in my heart but inside I love you 

See no matter what I will extend my arms to hug you 

Knowing I am just like you, I am like the double 

All I want to kno is how you pound me down 

Yo this shit is real and you really jerked me around 

But any way I am geting paid wit puff now 

I can cop you a house I can send you some stuff now 

So many levels jail take you 

I appreciate jail because it made me appreciate you 

I've been through fire and birth stone 

Used to be ???? not I cop the gem stone 

I remembered when you rushed me 

The time you said you should of flushed me 

I forgive you ma trust me 


Chorus repeat till end
