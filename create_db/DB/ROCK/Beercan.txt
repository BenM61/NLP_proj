Alcohol on my hands 
I got plans 
To ditch myself and get outside 
Dancing women 
Throwing plates 
Decapitating their laughing dates 
Swirling chickens caught in flight 
Out of focus 
Much too bright 
Coming down 
Shiny teeth 
Game show suckers trying to bleed 
But I got a drug and I got the bug 
And I got something better than love 
How you like me now 
Pretty good 
Going on, feeling strong 
I quit my job blowing leaves 
Telephone bills up my sleeves 
Choking like a one man dust bowl 
Freedom rock slime ball 
Talking in code 
We went down 
Lit up the shack 
Grab me a beer out of the sack 
Everybody bent over twice 
Painting the walls throwing some dice 
Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief 
And they were singing like this 
Winos throwing Frisbees at the sun 
Put my soul between a bun 
Now I'm hungry now I'm drunk 
Now I'm running like a flaming pig 
Oh yeah 
Scraping off the attitude 
Old man eating all my food 
Don't be kind 
Don't be rude 
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose 
Oh yeah 
My goodness 
Fluffy clouds 
Jumping rainbows 
Fluffy clouds 
I'm sad 
Jumping rainbows 
A soft and snuggly place 
[repeat] 
Fluffy clouds 
I'm sad and unhappy 
Oh yeah, I like it like that 
Oh that is cold 
Somebody put a flame-thrower on that 
Oh my goodness 
Take me down to the depot 
Buddy put me down on the bus 
Oh yeah 
I like it like that 
Somebody bring me a plate of sassafras 
Hey hey hey 
Uh-huh 
What's happenin'
