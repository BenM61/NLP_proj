Since I've been gone you've had your number changed
But my love for you girl still, remains the same
Now I've been lovin' you, and you been lovin' me, so long
Baby, what's wrong
So I'm beggin'

Baby, baby, baby
Please let me have your number
Baby, baby, baby
Please let me have your number

I'm sorry you couldn't call me when you got home
But other fellahs kept on callin' while you were gone
So I had the number changed
But I'm not actin' strange
Welcome home
Nothin's wrong
So I'm saying

Baby, baby, baby
You can have my private number
Baby, baby, baby
You can have my private number

Baby, baby, baby
You can have my private number (thank you, baby)
Baby, baby, baby
You can have my private number (thank you, baby)
Baby, baby, baby
For giving me your private number (you can have it)
Baby, baby, baby
Thank you baby (you can have it)
Baby, baby, baby
Thank you honey (anytime you want it)
Thank you baby
You can have my private number (thank you Judy)
