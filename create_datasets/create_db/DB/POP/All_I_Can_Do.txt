Only I was left till morning
All I think about is how I can't replace you
I didn't head your thousand warnings
There's only foolishness that I have to escape to

I, I, I stepped away
I, I, I stepped away

Called you when I saw you leavin'
I didn't want it, just believe me when I say that
I could show you how I'm feelin'
You're the one mistake that I wish I could play back

I, I, I stepped away
I, I, I stepped away

All I can do since that boy left with you is I'm survivin'
Yeah I'm survivin'

All I can do since that boy left with you is I'm survivin'
Yeah I'm survivin'

Yeah I'm survivin'
Yeah I'm survivin'

Slowly now the sun is rising
Where I stood and watched you dive beneath the waves, yeah
Till it falls to the horizon
I've been dreaming 'bout the promises I gave you

I, I, I stepped away
Why, why, why, such a waste

All I can do since that boy left with you is I'm survivin' 
Yeah I'm survivin'

All I can do since that boy left with you is I'm survivin'
Yeah I'm survivin'

Ohh I'm survivin'
I'm survivin'
Ohh I'm survivin'
I'm survivin'

Ohh yeah
I'm survivin'
