Oh, Lilian
Look what you've done
You've stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Oh, Lilian
I'm a poor man's son
And precious jewels
Weren't found in schools
Where I came from

Pain and misery
Always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose
What you haven't got

Oh, Lilian
I should have run
I should have known
Each dress you own
Is a loaded gun

Oh, Lilian

Oh, Lilian
I need protection
I hear your voice
And any choice 
I had is gone

Oh, Lilian
Once I begun
I couldn't stop
Till every drop
Of blood was sung
Pain and misery
Always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose
What you haven't got

Oh, Lilian
Look what you've done
You stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Oh, Lilian
Oh, Lilian
Oh, Lilian
Oh, Lilian
