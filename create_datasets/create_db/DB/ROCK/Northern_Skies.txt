Above there are no stars tonight just northern skies
Reflected light upon your face
Some people think stars rule our lives,
Some people they think otherwise
They can be replaced.

Where did you go on that big black night?
Did you take the coast road back through your life?
See the sand, the moon, the stars that shine the light and say, well
They'll do all right for me

We shroud our lives in mysteries,
Shooting stars and storming seas, if we
Have any sense
Storm clouds roll, they're free to break
And we're free to make
The same mistakes again and again

Where shall we go
On that big, black night?
Shall we take the coast road back through our lives?
See the sand, the moon, the stars that shine the light and say, well
They'll do all right without me

Above there are no stars tonight, just northern skies
Reflected light and fields of snow.
Some people think stars rule our lives,
Some people they think otherwise
What does anybody know?

Where shall I go on that big, black night?
Shall I take the coast road back through my life?
See the sand, the moon, the stars that shine the light and say, well
They'll do all right for me

Where shall I go on that big, black night?
Shall I take the coast road back through my life?
See the sand, the moon, the stars that shine the light and say, well,
They'll do all right for me

See the stars and constellations
Sit beneath their congregation
