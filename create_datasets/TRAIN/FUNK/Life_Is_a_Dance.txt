Life is a dance, life is a dance
Life is a dance, life is a dance

Everywhere coast to coast
Around the land
We all have one thing in common
We all love to dance
In and out of discos, crazy lights
Keep on movin' all through the night

Life is a dance, life is a dance
Life is a dance, life is a dance

Why don't you listen
Listen to the groove
I am sure enough sure you'll find
Just the rhythm, the rhythm of your soul
Dance to the music keepin' steady time

Life is a dance, life is a dance
Life is a dance, life is a dance

Dance to the music, crazy lights
Dance to the music on crazy lights
Dance to the music, crazy lights
Dance
