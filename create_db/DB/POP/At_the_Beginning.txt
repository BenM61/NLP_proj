We were strangers, starting out on a journey 
Never dreaming, what we'd have to go through 
Now here we are, I'm suddenly standing 
At the beginning with you 

No one told me, I was going to find you 
Unexpected, what you did to my heart 
When I lost hope 
You were there to remind me 
This is the start 

[Chorus]
And life is a road and I want to keep goin' 
Love is a river I want to keep flowing 
Life is a road now and forever wonderful journey 
I'll be there when the world stops turning 
I'll be there when the storm is through 
In the end I want to be standing 
At the beginning with you 

We were strangers on a crazy adventure 
Never dreaming how our dreams would come true 
Now here we stand, unafraid of the future 
At the beginning with you 
(Repeat Chorus) 

Knew there was somebody somewhere 
I need love in the dark 
Now I know my dream will live on 
I've been waiting so long 
Nothing is going to tear us apart 

[Chorus] 

Life is a road and I want to keep goin 
Love is a river I want to keep flowin 

(Belldadny alone) Starting out on a journey 
(Both continue it) 
In the end I want to be standing at the beginning 
With you
