A kiss is the touch of summer's fingertips
A kiss means so much
When April rain is in your eyes
The autumn dies with no goodbyes to say

A kiss will stay with you
And what your heart has longed to touch
Two willing lips can tell so well
They tell how lovely love can be

Not in words but you'll see by a kiss
The reason story books must end with a kiss
It means that life has just begun
That love has won, that kissing's fun

We know but time will show
It's much more than this
It all depends on whom you'll kiss

But you'll see by a kiss
The reason story books must end with a kiss
It means that life has just begun
That love has won, that kissing's fun

We know but time will show
It's much more than this
It all depends on whom you'll kiss
