I was fourteen
She was twelve
Father traveled, hers as well
Europa
Down the beaches
Hand in hand
Twelfth of never on the sand
Then war took her away
We swore a vow that day:
We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country, Europa
I'll stand beside you in the rain, Europa
Ta republique
 
Nine years after, who'd I see
On the cover of a magazine?
Europa
Buy her singles and see all her films
Paste her pictures on my windowsill
But that's not quite the same
It isn't, is it?
Europa my old friend
 
We'll be the Pirate Twins again
Europa
Oh my country.
Europa
I'll walk beside you in the rain
Europa
Ta republique
 
Blew in from the hoverport
She was back in London
Pushed past the paper men
Calling her name
She smiled for the cameras
As a bodyguard grabbed me
Then her eyes were gone forever
As they drove her away
We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country, Europa
 
I'll walk beside you in the rain Europa
Ta republique 
We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country, Europa
I'll stand beside you in the rain Europa
Ta republique
