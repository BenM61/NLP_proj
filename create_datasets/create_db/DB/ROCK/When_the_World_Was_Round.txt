But the monsters won't leave them alone
You win some, you lose some, you ain't got much choice
But it's gotta be done, yeah it's gotta be done

'Cause everybody lies 'n' we're stuck in the middle
I think I liked it better when the world was round
There's too much information but not enough to go on
I think I liked it better when the world was round
I don't wanna put you off it
I don't wanna put you off it
But I think I liked it better when the world was round
And I wish that I could change it
Yes I wish that I could change it
I think I liked it better when the world was round

Is it my imagination

When I look back thru the ages
Is it my imagination

You win some, you lose some
You only got two shots, so you take one
(what have you done)

'Cause everybody lies 'n' we're stuck in the middle
I think I liked it better when the world was round
There's too much information but not enough to go on
I think I liked it better when the world was round
And I don't think we deserve this
No I don't think we deserve this
I think I liked it better when the world was round
Give me a reason to believe in
Give me a reason to believe in
I think I liked it better when the world was round
Maybe we can make it better
Maybe we can make it better
I think I liked it better when the world was round
