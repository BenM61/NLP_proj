[Chorus]
Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight
Hey world, you rumble in the jungle tonight
Hey world, keep bringing it the rest of your life
You got to put up a fight.

Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight
Hey world, you rumble in the jungle tonight
Hey world, you're running for the rest of your life
You got to put up a fight.

Boom, boom!

There's a battle going on in this earth
Everyday. Work, school, death, and birth.
There are 6 billion people on this earth,
Can you tell me what every single life is worth?

Toke a spliff, look around and see history.
My weapon and my method is no mystery.
I didn't come here to chill. I came here to rock,
To smash the empire with my boom-box.

You got to let go of remote control!

[Chorus: x2]

You know you got to put up a fight.
On a universal mission like a meteorite.
Satellite, laser beam with you in their sights.
And with the patriot act they took all your right.

Don't ever doubt the power of just one mind.
Or the world-wide power of just one rhyme.
Don't ever doubt the force of the baseline.
Or a record gone round to burn the house down.

(You got to let go of remote control.)

[Chorus]

(All rebel rockers!)

There's a bullet with your name, it's a sign of the times.
It takes nine hundred ninety nine criminal minds.
You got to let go of remote control.
You got to let go of remote control!

[Chorus]
