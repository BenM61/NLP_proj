I take it in stride, one day at a time
If I ask no questions I?ll hear no lies
How come blessings only come in disguise?
Try that on for size as I vocalize

Ain't nothing gonna get in between me and my flow
Ain't nothing gonna come between me and my afro
My man just left me, what do ya know?
Easy come, easy go

He came out of the blue and went right back into it
Had to forfeit 'cause he couldn't get with it
Called it quits and when he split
He said he didn't have time for my juvenile bullshit

I've had a lot of failed relationships
I don't get involved because I'm not equipped
I believe that the world should revolve around me!

I don't see the point of a partnership
It won't be long until they start to trip
Yes siree, the whole world should revolve around me!

There's only one me in the galaxy
I am an endangered species
This kind of flower don't grow on Earth
Just lettin? you know for what it?s worth

This kind of knowledge can cause a depression
So I bide my time with philosophical questions
Not for nothing, but what came first?
The chicken nugget or the Egg McMuffin?

I got talent and I got tits
I know I?ll find another guy who wants to get with it
I'm not convinced that I'm a big fat whore
One man?s pleasure is another man?s chore

I've had a lot of failed relationships
I don't get involved because I'm not equipped
I believe that the world should revolve around me!

I don't see the point of a partnership
It won't be long until they start to trip
Yes siree, the whole world should revolve around me!

I know I rock and what I got is hot
And you know I got a lot
'Cause all that trippin' you gotta stop
Before you know it your ass'll be dropped

I ain't concerned with my biological clock
Since I never grow old, my money's always in stocks
Keep screwing that bitch from down the block
I don't need you around, I know I rock!

I've had a lot of failed relationships
I don't get involved because I'm not equipped
I believe that the world should revolve around me!

I don't see the point of a partnership
It won't be long until they start to trip
Yes siree, the whole world should revolve around me!

I've had a lot of failed relationships
I don't get involved because I'm not equipped
I believe that the world should revolve around me!

I don't see the point of a partnership
It won't be long until they start to trip
Yes siree, the whole world should revolve around me!
