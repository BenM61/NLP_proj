On no one left alive in 1985, will ever do
She may be right
She may be fine
She may get love but she won't get mine
'Cause I got you
Oh, oh I, oh oh I

Well I just can't enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind
(Shake it, baby, don't break it)

Oh my mama said the time would come
When I would find myself in, love with you
I didn't think
I never dreamed
That I would be around, to see it all come true
Whoa oh oh I, oh oh I

Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

Ah no one left alive in 1985, will ever do
She may be right
She may be fine
She may get love but she won't get mine
'Cause I got you
Oh oh I, oh oh I

Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady left behind
