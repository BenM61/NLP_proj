I've been on the road 
I've been on vacation 
I've been traveling light 
To reach my final destination 

Now I'm coming home 

So tell the girls that I am back in town 
You'd better tell them to beware 
Where they may go or they might try to hide 
I follow on and I'll be there 

So tell the girls that I am back in town 
And if it's true I do not know 
That every girl around had missed me since 
I decided to go 

I could be your friend 
I could be your stranger 
I could be the one your mother said would be your danger 
Now it's up to you 

So tell the girls that I am back in town 
You'd better tell them to beware 
Where they may go or they might try to hide 
I follow on and I'll be there 

So tell the girls that I am back in town 
And if it's true I do not know 
That every girl around had missed me since 
I decided to go 

Now I'm coming home 

So tell the girls that I am back in town 
You'd better tell them to beware 
Where they may go or they might try to hide 
I follow on and I'll be there 

So tell the girls that I am back in town 
And if it's true I do not know 
That every girl around had missed me since 
I decided to go
