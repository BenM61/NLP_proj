You once told me
I will know it enough
Oh let me tell you something
Yeah I do
You once told me
I won't feel enough
Let me tell you that
Baby I do

Sometimes I find myself in a sea
In a dream that's so far away
Sometimes
Tell me what's happened to me
Sometimes I see myself falling
Although I don't show it much
Sometimes I'm crazy for you
Well maybe I'm fine
And tell me you're mine
Sometimes I find myself
In a sea
In a dream that's so far away
Sometimes
Tell me what's happened to me

Tell me baby can you hold me now
We don't have to say it I feel it too
And maybe I'm falling or maybe
But I am not showing it much
Tell me baby
Can you see me now
Show me baby that I don't know how
How can I start to see inside the fall
But sometimes I find myself in a sea
In a dream that's so far away
Sometimes
Tell me what's happened to me

In a sea, in a dream that's so far away
Sometimes
Tell me what's happened to me
