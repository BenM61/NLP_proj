Bury me in fucking Vegas!

Bury me in Vegas
(Bury me in Vegas baby)

I want sex, I want cars
Want the drugs, grab the stars
Leave the past behind
With some drinks in those bars
Bling bling
I wear the biggest rolex baby
Lowride my car with slim shady

R.E.S.P.E.C.T
Girls make me going crazy
Lipstick
High-heels
Do you wanna f*ck me?

Take the money
Ride my cock
Bright light Vegas-rock
I fucked Jenny from the block

Take me by the hand
Turn off the lights
This star shines bright
Through the darkest night
Take me tonight

Take me by the hand
Let's take a ride everything is possible tonight
Take me tonight

Make your fucking hands (move!)
Bury me in Vegas! (Vegas)

I'll take my money back
You fucking slut ruined me
Fucking Vegas the place where you're calling me

Bitch! Whore! F*ck you!

(Knock knock) who is there on the door?

Now crank the music up
'Cause this is party time
Cumshot-glass with-tequila and lime
