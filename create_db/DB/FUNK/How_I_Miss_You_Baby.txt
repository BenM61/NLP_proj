Oh, how I miss you, baby
Oh, how I miss you, baby
Listen to me

It's only been a week ago
But it seems like years
And it's getting sort of hard
To see through tears

'Cause now you're gone
And I know for myself
That I can't find happiness
With nobody else

Oh, how I miss you, baby
Oh, how I miss you, baby
Listen to me

I find myself calling out your name
In the middle of the night
And I still hear you saying, darling
No, no, two wrongs don't make it right

I thought I could cope it all alone
But I was so wrong
'Cause it didn't gain me one solitary thing
But an unhappy home

Oh, how I miss you, baby
Oh, how I miss you, baby

I wanna say sorry
Oh, but it ain't a strong enough word
For once in my life I'm so sincere
And I mean every word

I listen to what my friends had to say
But ooh, they messed me up again
'Cause I haven't seen a good day, baby
Since you know when

I never thought it could ever
Affect me this way
But I'm drownin' in a sea of misery
And all I can think of to say

Oh, how I miss you, baby
Oh, how I miss you, baby

I've got to keep on singing
Oh, how I miss you, baby
I swear, I swear
