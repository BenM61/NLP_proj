I maybe getting old
But I got young fashioned ways
I maybe getting old
But I got young fashioned ways

But I'm gonna love a good woman
The rest of my natural days
If my hair's turning gray
I know you think the way I feel
If my hair's turning gray
I know you think the way I feel
There may be snow up on the mountain
But there's a thaw down under the hill

I maybe getting old
But I got young fashioned ways
I maybe getting old
But I got young fashioned ways

I don't worry about no young one
There'll be no one to take my place

A young horse is fast
But an old horse knows what's going on

A young horse is fast
But an old horse knows what's going on

A young horse may win the race
But an old horse stays out so long
