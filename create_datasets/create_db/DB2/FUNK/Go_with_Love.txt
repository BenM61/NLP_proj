This is the moment when we must say goodbye
As you walk away, I'll close the door
Here inside my room, I'll stay and I will wait for you
Forever more

Go with love, when you leave me you go with love
Oh my darling, you know I'm yours
If it takes my whole life through
Darling, I will wait for you

One bright tomorrow I know we'll meet again
What I wouldn't give to see that day
When the two of us can live
And here inside my arms you'll always stay

Go with love, when you leave me you go with love
Oh my darling, you know I'm yours
If it takes my whole life through
Darling, I will wait, so go, go with love

When you leave me you go, you go with love
Oh my darling, you know, you know I'm yours
If it takes, if it takes my whole life through
Darling, I will wait somehow

Go with love, when you leave me
