Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer

But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (No)
Make me cry? (No)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)

Well, let me see you put your hands up
Fellas tell your lady she's the one (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love (hands up)

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
Well, let me see you put your hands up
(Hands up!)
(Hands up!)
