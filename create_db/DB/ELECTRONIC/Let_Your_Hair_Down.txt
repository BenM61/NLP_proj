Let ya hair down
When you're up in the club and don't want to get crunk
Let ya hair down
When you think you're too cute to rock your own suit
Let ya hair down
Why you sittin' at the bar acting like you a star
Let ya hair down
Quit stressing your looks and rock to this hook

I see ya in the corner
(With your nose up high actin' all anti)
you're looking out of place
(What's the point why did you come to this joint)
Ya puttin' too much on it
(Your attitude ain't even wanted)
Just have a good time
(Relax and let the tension unwind)

Let ya hair down
Quit stressing your looks and rock to this hook

Look over your shoulder
(Everybody's sweating you couldn't be colder)
Did you wear the wrong shoes
(or is this party just too ghetto for you)
Acting like an outcast
(Frontin' like you just don't want to dance)
Why you trippin' when you
(Brought yourself on you-ain't nothing left to do but)

Let ya hair down
Why you sittin' at the bar acting like you a star
Let ya hair down
Quit stressing your looks and rock to this hook

We keep it moving- it's moving
We keep it jumping- it's jumping
It's non stoppin' - it's poppin'
Can you feel the heat
You need to get out your seat
You want to bounce to this beat
You need to get on your feet
And just join in with me
