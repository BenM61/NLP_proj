Coyotes tiptoe in the snow after dark
At home with the ghosts in the national parks
Mankind's behavin' like some serial killers
Giant ol' monsters afraid of the sharks

And we're in love with all of it
And we say, what can we say?

Walking with ghosts in the national parks
Coyotes tiptoe in the snow after dark

And we're in love with all of it
And we say, what can we say?

Another branch on the tinder-bound tree
Birds flying low, looking downwards to feed
Mankind's behavin' like some serial killers
Giant ol' monsters afraid of the sharks

And we're in love with all of it
And we say, what can we say?

And we say, we're in love with all of it
And we say, we're in love with everything
And we say, what can we say?

And we say, we're in love with all of it
And we say, we're in love with everything
And we say, what can we say?
And we say, we're in love with all of it
And we say, we're in love with everything
And we lie, we love to lie
