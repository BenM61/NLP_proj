Watch the early morning sun  
Drip like blood from the day  
See the busy people run  
So many games to play 
See the blue suburban dream  
Under the jet plane sky  
Sleep away and dream a dream 
Life is just a lullaby 

Oh, and everything will flow 
Oh, you know everything will flow 
Oh

Watch the day begin again  
Whispering into the night  
See the pretty people play  
Hurrying under the light  
A million cars, a million trains, 
Under the jet plane sky 
Nothing lost and nothing gained 
Life is just a lullaby 

Oh, and everything will flow 
Oh, I said everything will flow 
Oh, you know everything will flow 
Oh 

Oh, and everything will flow 
Oh, you know everything will flow 
Oh

The neon lights in the night tonight 
Will say "everything will flow" 
The stars that shine in the open sky 
Will say "everything will flow" 
The lovers kissed with an openness 
Will say "everything will flow" 
The cars parked in the hypermarket 
Know "everything will flow"
