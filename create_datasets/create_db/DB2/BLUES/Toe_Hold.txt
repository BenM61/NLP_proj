All my life I been a po' boy,
It's been hard to get a dime
Everythin' I got, umm, hmm
I had to pay for it on time, but that's all right

Long as I got a toehold
As long as I got a piece of you
As long as I got a toehold,
I can make it through.

Now listen
I said I went to my doctor,
First thing he talked about is malnutrition
I'm not tryin' to be a fatman,
I've got to look after my ambition.

Long as I got a toehold
Long as I got a piece of you
Long as I got a toehold,
I can make it through.

Oh, now give it to me baby
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
Oh!

So, baby!, if you're with me,
I'll let the whole world be against me.
I don't expect to ever get rich,
You may find me diggin' in a ditch.

Long as I got a toehold
Long as I got a piece of you
Long as I got a toehold,
I can make it through.

Oh, give it to me baby
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
Owwww!
That's all I want baby
I want a little little little little little little little little little toehold
I want a little little little little little little little little little toehold
Owwww!
