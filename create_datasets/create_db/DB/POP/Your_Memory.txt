Your memory, what was it doin' in Miami
I thought I'd left it far behind me
But I was wrong
'Cause it came along
Your memory, how come it followed me to Denver
Guess it forgot to remember
That we're all through
And I'm over you.

Your memory, your memory
Is something I'm not over yet
Your memory, your memory
Your memory don't know the word forget.

Your memory was not invited to my party
When it arrived the teardrops started
Reminding me, oh, I'm still not free
Your memory, what was it doin' in my dreams last night
You'd think by now that I would be all right
Guess it's still no use cause I still love you.

Your memory, your memory
Is something I'm not over yet
Your memory, your memory
Your memory don't know the word forget.
