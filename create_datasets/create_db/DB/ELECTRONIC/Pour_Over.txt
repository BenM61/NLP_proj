Turn the porch light off
So you don't think I'm home
I wish you'd taste your words
But you sit at your throne

Drop after drop
Keep filling me up
Keep twisting my arm
Try giving you up

You're pouring over
I'm breathing water
I'm keeping my composure
Your small sins blur togheter

They follow me home

Please don't make a mess
To prove you could
Should I clean it up
Like you thought I would
When you pour over

Pour over me
Don't let me breathe

Pour over me, oh me
Don't let me breathe

You can't hear me say
With your head in the sand
That you're taking too much
How are you like a friend?

I'm washing away
And you're giving me up
Drop after drop
You don't give a f*ck

Did you make a mess
To prove you could
Should I clean it up
Like you thought that I would
Did you write it down
Did you leave it for me
Did the words bend and blur
Make me weak in the knees
When you pour over

Pour over me, oh me
Don't let me breathe, oh me
Pour over me, oh me
Don't let me breathe

If I give you a flower
If I love you louder
If I give you an hour
You turn it sour
And I'm a coward

Did you make a mess
To prove you could
Should I clean it up
Like you thought that I would
Did you write it down
Did you leave it for me
Did the words bend and blur
Make me weak in the knees
When you pour over

Pour over me, oh me
Don't let me breathe, oh me
Pour over me, oh me
Don't let me breathe

Pour over me, oh me
Don't let me breathe, oh me
Pour over me, oh me
Don't let me breathe
