Hi
Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face

Take of the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
You decided to smile

Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that full-of-doubt look
Slap on a happy grin

And spread sunshine all over the place
And put on a happy face

Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana splits and licorice
And you'll feel fine

I know a girl so gloomy
She never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

So spread sunshine all over the place
And put on a happy, happy face
Put on a happy, happy, happy face
Oh, come on bubby, smile it's your birthday
