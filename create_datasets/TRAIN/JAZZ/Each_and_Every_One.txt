If you ever feel the time to drop me a loving line 
Maybe you should just think twice 
I don't wait around on your advice 
You tell me I can go this far, but no more 
Try to show me heaven and then slam the door 
You offer shelter at a price much too dear 
And your kind of love's the kind that soon disappears 

So don't brag how you have changed 
And everything's been rearranged 
I thought all that was over and done 
But I still get the same from Each and Everyone 
Being kind is just a way to keep me under your thumb 
And I can cry because that's something we've always done 
You tell me I'm free of the past now and all those lies 
Then offer me the same thing in a different guise
