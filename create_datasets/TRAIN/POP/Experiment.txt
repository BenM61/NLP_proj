Before you leave these portals
To meet less fortunate mortals
There's just one final message
I would give to you
You all have learned reliance
On the sacred teachings of science
So I hope, through life you never will decline
In spite of philistine
Defiance
To do what all good scientists do

Experiment
Make it your motto day and night
Experiment
And it will lead you to the light
The apple on the top of the tree
Is never too high to achieve
So take an example from Eve
Experiment
Be curious
Though interfering friends may frown,
Get furious
At each attempt to hold you down
If this advice you'll only employ
The future can offer you infinite joy
And merriment
Experiment
And you'll see
