Premise to interlude
Wait til all bones protrude
You're con-vexed, you're convert
There's a stain on your shirt
Semi-sweet, semicide
The remorse you can't hide
Now we molt past our skin
And make room to begin

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy

Down down cities fall down on me

The final chrysalis
Self-controlled consciousness
Now it feels imminent
Done for your benefit
Eat right out of their hand
Its concaved all your glands
We're encouraged to forget
Preference to be force fed

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy

Down down cities fall down on me

You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy
You must earn our empathy
