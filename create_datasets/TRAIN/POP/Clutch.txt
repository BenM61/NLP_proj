So there
You got me in your clutch again
So there
So there
I love your touch and that vodoo that you do so well
It's got me spinning around and round
So let me in your world
Let me in your world for a while
Let me in your world
So I can sing to you
Oh no
You got me going crazy for you baby
Oh no
You made me go insane for you baby
So there
You got me in your clutch again
And this living is strange
We count our feelings in yesterdays
But is that how you keep your clutch baby?
Is that how you keep it darlin'?
So Let me in your world
Let me in your world for a while
Let me in your world
So I, I can sing to you
Oh no
You got me going crazy for you baby
Oh no
You made me go insane for you baby
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Clutch Again
Oh
Oh
In your clutch again
Oh
Oh no
You got me going crazy for you baby
Oh no
You made me go insane for you baby
Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh No say
Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh No
You got me,
You got me in your clutch,
You got me
Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh No
Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh No
