I know I'm in over my head, I'm walkin' a fine line
Tryin' not to be the one who falls in and out this time
I'm just gonna hold my breath, close my eyes and pray
I'm not gonna worry now, tomorrow's too far away

When people say that it can never last,
heaven will just slip out of our grasp
People don't believe a day goes by,
we don't end up saying our goodbyes
What do people know, what do people know

There's always been a chance you and I won't last forever
We've been in and out of love before, I'll never say never
I'm just gonna hold my breath, close my eyes and pray
I'm not gonna worry now, tomorrow's too far away

When people say that it can never last,
heaven will just slip out of our grasp
People don't believe a day goes by,
we don't end up saying our goodbyes
What do people know, what do people know

What do people know,
what do people know,
what do people know
