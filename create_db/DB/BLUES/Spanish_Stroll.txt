Hey Mr. Jim I can see the shape you're in
Finger on your eyebrow
And left hand on your hip
Thinking that you're such a lady killer
Think you're so slick!
Alright

Brother Johnny, he caught a plane and he got on it
Now he's a razor in the wind
And he got a pistol in his pocket
They say the man is crazy on the West Coast
Lord there ain't no doubt about it!
Well allright

Sister Sue tell me baby what are we gonna do
She said take two candles,
And then you burn them out
Make a paper boat,light it and.... send it out 
send it out now..
