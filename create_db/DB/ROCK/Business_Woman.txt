Imagine her, all of her wealth
And in the arms of somebody else
I imagine her in bed
With her communication skills
Cabinet full of creams and pills
Paying the bills and beating the rent
You'll never understand
The wonderful mind of that woman
Powerful beauty in her eyes

[Chorus]
Look at that business woman
She's got a head on her shoulders
Look at that business woman
She's not that much older than you

And she reveals inner soul 
Stopped like the flutters in death's robe (Stock market flutters, index rolls)
When she reveals her secret life
All of the gifts come deep and swift
Promise her anything only if
You're going to have to leave your wife
She'll never understand
The wonderful mind of that woman
Beautiful power in her eyes

[Chorus]

And when she comes the stars explode
Exquisite results in input mode
Just when she comes she's suddenly gone
Maybe you'll find her, maybe you won't
Maybe she loves you, baby she don't
Maybe you'll find that you are alone
You'll never comprehend 
All of the means, all of the ends
Business woman in her eyes

[Chorus]
