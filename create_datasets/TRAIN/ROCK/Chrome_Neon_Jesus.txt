Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in that machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

My heart yields a motion chair (?)
This time death has nothing left to give
Have you forgotten what its like?
A phone call from another life
The pay phone is dead but you're still on the line
I guess we're all just killing time

Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in that machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

Your mother (?)
Your electric journey in the light
Forever alone but it's alright
But it's alright

Black out live
Dig up the bones nothing feels complete
I fade out with the morning light
Shake me down a nervous wreck
Your goodbye to me and much like to confess
I guess we're all just killing time

Chrome neon Jesus
You are the ghost in that machine
Come to receive us
Don't wait for me

Your mother (?)
Your electric journey in the light
Forever alone but it's alright
But it's alright
