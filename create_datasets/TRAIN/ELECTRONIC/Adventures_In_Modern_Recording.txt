There's a kid in a band
Got an axe in his hand
He's been learning all the chords
And he's writing all the words
Today you bought a new face
Tried it on for size
Now you see the world through
Different colored eyes
They're not playing
They're not playing
They're just having
Adventures in modern recording
Adventures in modern recording
Adventures in modern recording
So carefully directed
For modern mass appeal
Look just like a poster
Got yourself a deal
Let's begin promotion
This boy has got it made
Media exposure
It will make him all the rage
But he's not playing
He's not playing
He's just having
Adventures in modern recording
Adventures in modern recording
Adventures in modern recording
