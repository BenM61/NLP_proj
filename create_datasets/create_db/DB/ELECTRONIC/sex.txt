And I said, "what's up?
What you been thinking?"
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long I'd swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words
And now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down

'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards

'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
And we were just having sex no I would never call it love
But love

Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

So I guess it's...
Let die to let live

And what's good
When both choices I've got have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off
Like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you

No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

(No, I don't know how to forget you)
'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart

Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings and
I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

So I guess it's...
Let die to let live

No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
