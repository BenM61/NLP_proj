I'm comin' home,
I'm comin',
I'm comin' home,
I'm comin',

So wrap you hands around me darlin,
Just so you know,
I'm comin' down around you darlin',
We never looked this beautiful,

And though,
I'll be,
Your sweet,
December,
(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)
I don't need you when I've got my pride.

So can't you see,
Everything you are belongs
To me.

Hey!

The city lights were fading,
I saw her on the pavement,
Dressed in black and,
Writing wrongs,
The station played our favourite song,

She said,
I don't think I remember,
A taste as sweet as this December,
And I know,
I'm comin' home,
I'm comin' home,

So wrap,
Your arms around me,
I'm comin' home,
I'm comin' home,

To be,
Your sweet,
December.

(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh)

So can't you see,
Everything you are belongs
To me.

The city lights were fading,
I saw her on the pavement,
Dressed in black and,
Writing wrongs,
The station played our favourite songs,

She said,
I don't think I remember,
A taste as sweet as this December,
And I know,
I'm comin' home,
I'm comin' home!

Yeah!

Da-da-da-da-da

The city lights were fading,
I saw her on the pavement,
Dressed in black and,
Writing wrongs,
The station played our favourite songs,

She said,
I don't think I remember,
A taste as sweet as this December,
And I know,
I'm comin' home,
I'm comin' home,

I'm comin' home,
I'm comin'
I'm comin home,
I'm comin'

So wrap your
Arms around me darlin'
Arms around me darlin'

I'll be your sweet December.
