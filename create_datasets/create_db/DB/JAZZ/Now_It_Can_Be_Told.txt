Now it can be told
Told in all its glory
Now that we have met,
The world may know the sentimental story
The greatest romance they ever knew 
Is waiting to unfold

Now it can be told
As an inspiration
Ev'ry other tale of "Boy meets Girl"
Is just an imitation
The great love story has never been told before,
But now, now it can be told
