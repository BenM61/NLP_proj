You're browsing in a second hand book store
And you see him in non-fiction V-why
He looks up from world war two
And then you catch him, catch him, catch him in his eye

So you quickly turn away a wishful stare
And take a sudden interest in your shoes
If you only had the courage but you don't
And he turns and leaves and you both lose

And you think about the people that you never get to love
It's not as if you even had the chance
So many worth a second life but rarely do you get a second glance
Until fate cuts in on your dance

And you'll see him on a train that you just missed
At a bus stop where your bus will never stop
Or in a passing Buick when you've been pulled over by a traffic cop

Or you'll share an elevator, just you two
And rise in solemn silence to your floor
Like the fool you are, you get off
And he leaves your life behind a closing door

And you think about the people that you never get to love
That poem you intended to begin
The saddest that anyone has ever said are Lord what might have been?
But no one ever said you get to win

Still you'll never going to miss what you don't know
And you don't know who you'll meet at half past three
It could be a total stranger who looks just a little bit like me

One of the people that you never get to love
One of the people that you never get to love
The people that you never get to love
