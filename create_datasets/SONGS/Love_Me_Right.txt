I won't even think twice 
There's no reason to be shy 
Oh I 
I can't lie 

Don't mean to bother 
But I wish that you would give it to me right (right) 
I'm not the type to holla 
But somehow you know just what I like (what I like) 

Oh yeah babe 
Oh you babe 
You don't know how hard I try 
(Hard, I, try) 
Oh yeah babe 
Oh you babe 
Just come on and love me right 
(Love me right) 

Sometimes it's long before I'm home 
Spending late nights on the phone (phone) 
No castle waiting in the sky 
We make believe that we're alone (you and I)

Oh yeah babe 
Oh you babe 
You don't know how hard I try 
(Hard, I, try) 
Oh yeah babe 
Oh you babe 
Just come on and love me right 
(Love me right) 

I get caught up when I'm stressed out 
I need a place to unwind 
Some pushing, pulling anyway 
You had me dreaming all the time 

Oh I 
I never found someone 
Who'd fulfill my every need 
It's someone gorgeous 
It would be you, you 

Oh yeah babe 
Oh you babe 
You don't know how hard I try 
(Hard, I, try) 
Oh yeah babe 
Oh you babe 
Just come on and love me right 
(Love me right)
