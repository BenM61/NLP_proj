Bitter tea

I've got a special category business
Down by the multifunctional Dr. Sun yat-sen memorial rollerblade rink
Down by the home of bitter tea
Bitter, bitter, bitter tea
Bitter, bitter, bitter tea

I've seen you slinking off of snake alley
Why not come up through the hall of butterflies
And past lane 170
Into our dragon protector layout
And try some bitter tea
Bitter, bitter, bitter tea
Bitter, bitter, bitter tea

On the 13th day of the 5th lunar month
Outside a hot spring bath
The old banyan tree looked down on me

Aren't you curious
Aren't you curious
A little curious
About what the osmanthus blossoms taste like

I think you're curious
Yes, you're curious
A little curious
About what the osmanthus blossums taste like
With a cup of bitter tea
Bitter, bitter, bitter tea
Bitter, bitter, bitter tea

On the 13th day of the 5th lunar month
Outside a hot spring bath
The old banyan tree looked down on me

I am a crazy crane
I lost my true love in the rain
I am a crazy crane
I lost my true love in the rain
