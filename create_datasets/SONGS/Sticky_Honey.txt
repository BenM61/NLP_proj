Money, money, money, money
Sticky, sticky, sticky honey
Man lands on Mars
Man rips off his broken parts

And you're gone, and you're gone
Now you wanna get it on
And you won't, and you won't
Why you wanna do me wrong?

(Incomprehensible)

Woman, woman, woman, woman
You gotta let go your swollen tongue
Pleading, pleading, pleading with a man
Gave him birth to Aphrodite's son

And you're gone, and you're gone
Now you wanna get it on
And you won't, and you won't
Why you wanna do me wrong?

And you're gone, and you're gone
Why you wanna get it on?
And you won't, no, you won't
Why you wanna do me wrong?

You got the best damn blues that I've ever seen
And I'm swimming like a shooting star across the galaxy
You got the best damn blues

And you're gone, and you're gone
Now you wanna get it on
And you won't, no, you won't
Why you wanna do me wrong?

And you're gone, and you're gone
Oh, you wanna get it on
Get, get, get it on, get, get, get it on
