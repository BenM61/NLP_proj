When I hear children at play
Memories come from far away
Taking me, holding my hand
To the playground wonderland

See-saw, lifting you high
Swings that let you touch the sky
Then, whenever you're through
Painted ponies wait for you

It's a world, summertime free
Where else would you rather be?
With a friend there at your side
Up you climb and down you slide

When I hear children at play
(I love to play in the playground)
(Every time I go, I know that I'll find a friend)
Memories come from far away

Taking me, holding my hand
(I want to stay in the playground)
(When I'm there, I wish that it would never end)
To the playground wonderland

Taking turns, learning to share
Jungle Jim or teddy bear
Hide and seek, counting to ten
Oh, to play there once again

See-saw, lifting you high
Swings that let you touch the sky
Then, whenever you're through
Painted ponies wait for you

When I hear children at play
(I love to play in the playground)
(Every time I go, I know that I'll find a friend)
Memories come from far away

Taking me, holding my hand
(I want to stay in the playground)
(When I'm there, I wish that it would never end)
To the playground wonderland
To the playground wonderland
