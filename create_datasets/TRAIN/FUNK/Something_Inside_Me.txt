I call you up tonight,
But girl, we don't talk anymore.
Sometimes I fantasize
That you would walk right through the door.
When I wait, you're not there.
Still, I know that you still care.
Something inside of me
Tells me you want me, (tells me that you want me.)
Tells me you need me, (tells me that you need me,) baby girl.
Something inside of me
Tells me you need me,
Tells me you want me, baby girl.
How can I treat you right,
When you let my heart just slip away? (Slip away.)
So come and do me right, and I'll be the sun that shines your way.
I'll be there for you, baby, now I know that this much is true, baby.
Something inside of me... (Oh.)
Tells me you want me... (Tells me you want me.)
Tells me you need me, (tells me you need me,) baby girl.
Something inside of me, (something inside,) 
Tells me you need me, (tells me you need me,)
Tells me you want me, baby girl. (Tells me you want me, baby.)
Something inside of me, (something inside of me,)
Tells me you want me, (tells me that you want me, baby.)
Tells me you need me, (tells me that you need me, baby.) Baby girl.
Something inside of me, (something inside of me,)
Tells me you need me, (tells me that you love me,)
Tells me you want me, baby girl. (Tell me oh, oh.)
I spend my nights reading letters from you, going over and dawn in my mind.
I give my heart just for one kiss from you, 'cause I can't hide what's deep,
Down inside.
Something inside of me
Tells me you want me, (just tell me you want me.)
Tells me you need me, (just tell me you need me,) baby girl.
Something inside of me
Tells me you need me, (just tell me that you want me.)
Tells me you want me, (show me that you need me,) baby girl.
Something inside of me
Tells me you want me, (a little something, something.)
Tells me you need me, (a little something, something,) baby girl.
Something inside of me 
Tells me you want me, (a little something, something.)
Tells me you need me, (a little something, something,) baby girl.
