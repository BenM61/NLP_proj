Well, trust little you to take it to the level You want but don't understand
Back up the truck Joe, wheel out those excuses
You don't wanna dirty your hands
Napoleon complex, lower than low
High enough to think you can try
Over the side, the ship goes down
I'm still around to testify

So bring on the Sturm and Drang
I just wanna get drunk and headbang
So much for the ten year plan
You're just another company man

Well I must admit, some mornings when it hits
I don't wanna do it my way
I see you and your worthless crew
Fighting to get on the runway
Dizzy, dizzy heights, terrifying lows
Don't look around just climb
I'll see you later when you come back to me
'Cause everybody gets a little Judas sometimes

So here is the Sturm and Drang
I just wanna get drunk and headbang
So much for the ten year plan
You're just another company man

Well, trust little you to take it to a level
You want but don't understand
Back up the truck Joe, wheel out those excuses
You don't wanna dirty your hands
Cause you can't so bring on the Sturm and Drang
I just wanna get drunk and headbang
So much for the ten year plan
So much for the ten year plan
So much for the ten year plan
You're just another company man

You're just another company man
You're just another company man, man, man, man, man
