We are finally broken
It is finally true
All my scars are open
You met somebody new

Our mission is complete
I guess it is time
My heart is wide open
I'm ready to leave tonight

Any minute, any minute, any minute, any minute I go
All it takes is a shot and some love imagination in you
We will never be the same, but we are not coming home again
We don't know, where we go

Let's get high 
The dream machine takes all of us
Come on board and leave the rest behind
Let's get high, high, high
Let's get high, high, high

There's no resistance
I hang at the beach
No comitments
No need to remember me

Any minute, any minute, any minute, any minute I go
All it takes is a shot and some love imagination in you
We will never be the same, but when I'm coming home again
We don't know, where we go

Let's get high 
The dream machine takes all of us
Come on board and leave the rest behind
Let's get high, high, high
Let's get high, high, high

(High)
Let's get high
(High)
High, high, high

Your wild heart
The age of your soul
Is what makes you beautiful
Is what makes you beautiful
You can still be what you wanted to be
Don't believe what they say
Don't believe what they say

Let's get high, high
The angel in your soul
Is what makes you beautiful
What makes you beautiful
(I can feel the sky) you can still be what you wanted to be
Don't believe what they say
Don't believe what they say

(High)
Let's get high
(High)
High, high, high
