Oh oh oh release me!
You know not what you do
Oh release me!
You're splitting my head in two
Oh you tease me!
Do you know just what you do?
I have got to reach her
She knows just what to do

And you can do what you want
You always do what you want

Oh release me!
I am a walking Arab state
Oh release me!
I can't bear anything
I won't spare anything
Oh you tease me!
Do you know just what you do?
I have got to reach her
She knows just what to do

And you can do what you want
I have run out of words to give you
I have run out of things to say
But my heart still beats towards you
My heart still beats towards you

Oh release me!
Because my heart it beats for you
And I have lost the reason
Why you started that
Or why I followed it
Oh you tease me!
Do you know just what you do
I have got to reach her
She knows just what to do

You can do what you want
I have run out of words to give you
I have run out of things to say
But my heart still beats towards you
My heart still beats towards you

And you can do what you want
You always do what you want
