(...Inaudible...) 
(Further) we make claims on (our teas) 
(Dawn inner here) for we've nowhere to be 
Nowhere to be 
Nowhere to be

(Father stains), we're all on our knees 
Down on our words and we've nothing to be 
Nothing to be 
Nothing to be

Further down we're all on our (sails) 
(Paid to upheed) though we've nothing these days 
Nothing these days 
Nothing these days

(Further still, their stall in a daze) 
We're down on our knees and we've nothing to say 
Nothing to say 
Nothing to say...
