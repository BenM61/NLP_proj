I remember the feeling, not so long ago
The kids came dancin', their hearts were romancin'
And the music was live Poco
Some called it country, some called it rock and roll
But whatever the sound, it was sure to be found
With a heart, rhythm and soul

Do you remember then, how it was when it all began
Do you remember then, how the music made you feel,
when it all began
Ooh do you remember when, when it all began,
Ooh do you remember when

New York and Boston, yeah we sure had some fun
Summer nights in the park, and when the music would start
Ooh what a time and then some
We sang together, "a good feelin' to know"
Yeah we turned it up loud, gave our hearts to the crowd
But then came the end of the show

Do you remember then, how it was when it all began
Do you remember then, how the music made you feel,
when it all began
Ooh do you remember when, when it all began,
Ooh do you remember when

To capture the moment, to make it ours for all time
I know we can just remember how it was,
when it all began

Oh now do, do you remember when - how the music played
Ooh, do you remember when - when it all began
Oh now ooh, do you remember when, oh now ooh, do you remember when
Do you remember, do you remember when,
do you remember...
do you remember...
