When I think of all the good times that I've wasted having good times
When I think of all the good time that 's been wasted having good times
When I was drinkin'
I should've been thinkin'
When I was fighting 
I could've done the right thing
All of that boozin' 
I was really losin' 
Good times
Good times

When I think of all the good time that's been wasted having good times
When I think of all the good time that's been wasted having good times
All of my lying 
I remember her crying 
My useless talkin'
I couldv'e been walkin'
Instead of complainin' 
I couldv'e been gainin' 
Good times

Yes, here we all are having a jolly good time
And everything is working out fine, ha ha ha ha ha

Useless talkin' 
All that walkin 
All of my sinnin'
I could've been winnin'
I have it too easy
And its a beginning of good times

Good times
I said good times 
Talking bout good times
