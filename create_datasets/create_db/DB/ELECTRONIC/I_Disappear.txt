I disappear,
I lost control,
My body's moving,
All on it's own.
I watch myself,
Walk away,
A foreign spirit,
Took my place.

An empty stare,
Its eyes are dull,
So my essence, it's riding my pulse.
A Burst of black,
A Breath of smoke.
I disappeared,
I lost control.

I,
I disappear(x3)

I disappear,
I lost control,
My body's moving,
All on it's own.
I watch myself,
Walk away,
A foreign spirit,
Took my place.

I,
I disappear(x3)

How could I resist,
It's all I've wan-
Ted now I guess I've got it.
Why it happened, I don't know,
Hope this doesn't last forever.

I, disappear(x4)
