You're a heterosexual dream 
A super phallic machine 
Well, who do you think you are 
Well, you think you're a star 
Yeah, a rock'n roll star, you are 

Oh, you part your lips that way 
Do you care what people say 
The chicks know what you are 
Well, they think you're a star 
Yeah, a rock and roll star, you are 

Rock'n roll 
You're rock'n roll queen 
Don't you know what I mean 
Oh, you know 
You're a rock'n roll queen 
A young man's dream 

Given guitar's head 
In a silver stream of red 
Has it gone too far 
Then you know you're a star 
Yeah, a real superstar, you are 

Rock'n roll 
You're rock'n roll queen 
Don't you know what I mean 
Oh, you know 
You're a rock'n roll queen 
A young man's dream 

Rock'n roll 
You're rock'n roll queen 
Don't you know what I mean 
Oh, you know 
You're a rock'n roll queen 
A young man's dream 

You're a heterosexual dream 
A super phallic machine 
Who do you think you are 
Well, you think you're a star 
Yeah, a rock'n roll star, you are
