I was thinking I could wait until the work is done
But you'll only want to get back out and have some fun
Sun's lighting up the sky
And if it wasn't so bright
I'd come undone

Why can't you save time for me
There isn't much but it's all that I want from you
Why can't you save time for me
Without these moments there isn't much we can do
As victims of circumstance
Avoiding our every chance
We can't solve problems
Save time for me

I remember when you leaned on my experience
And I showed you what you had to do to make some sense
But time moves fast
And it doesn't last 
For everyone

Why can't you save time for me
There isn't much, but it's all that I want from you
Why can't you save time for me
Without these moments there isn't much we can do
As victims of circumstance
Avoiding our every chance
We can't solve problems
Save time for me

As victims of circumstance
Avoiding our every chance
We can't solve problems

Why can't you save time for me
There isn't much but it's all that I want from you
Why can't you save time for me
Without these moments there isn't much we can do

Why can't you save time for me 
Why can't you save time for me 
Why can't you save time for me
