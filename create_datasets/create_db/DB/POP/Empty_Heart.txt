What do you know
What do you feel
What do you give
When your heart is empty

What do you see
Nothing is real
How can you live
When your heart is empty

And the grass seems greener over there
The people stop, they stop and stare at you
And look right through
And what you get for just one night
To show them all you got some fight in you
The fight's still in you

Let's go back to the beginning
Let's go back to when we were winning
Is there a chance, a chance to start over
'Cause I got to believe that you and me
Can go back to the start and fill your empty heart

'Cause I got to believe
That you and me, that you and me
Can go back to the start
And fill your empty heart

I gave you love
I gave you blood
I gave it all
But your heart is empty

Round and round and round we go
Hoping for a chance to join the show
Will you let me know
What I get for just one night
To show them all I got some fight in me
The fight's still in me

Let's go back to the beginning
Let's go back to when we were winning
Is there a chance, a chance to start over
'Cause I got to believe that you and me
Can go back to the start and fill your empty heart

'Cause I got to believe
That you and me, that you and me
Can go back to the start
And fill your empty heart

So what do I give and what do you get
I don't think love is dead just yet
I'm holding on, I'm hanging on
I know that I can be so strong for you, yeah you

Let's go back to the beginning
Let's go back to when we were winning
Is there a chance, a chance to start over
'Cause I got to believe that you and me
Can go back to the start and fill my empty heart
Yeah, fill this empty heart

'Cause I got to believe (that you and me)
I got to believe
We can go back to the start (back to the start)
And fill my empty heart
