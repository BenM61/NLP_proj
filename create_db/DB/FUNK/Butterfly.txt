I'm taking a moment just imagining that I'm dancing with you
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
You got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you

And you have your own engaging style
And you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight
You may unfasten them if you like
That's if you crash and spend the night

But you don't fold, you don't fade
You got everything you need, especially me
Sister, you've got it all

You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk
Sister, you've got it all
You got it all

Curl your upper lip up and let me look around and
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip then bite down and
Bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
'Cause they're the perfect jumping off point
Getting closer to your butterfly

Will you float on by?
Oh, kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo, your nose real close to mine
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right

But you don't fold, you don't fade
You got everything you need, especially me
Sister, you've got it all

You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk
Sister, you've got it all

You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all, woo, hey baby, uh
You've got it all

Doll, I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Let me feel you upside down, slide in, slide out
Slide over here, climb into my mouth now child

Butterfly, well, you landed on my mind
Damn right, you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
And now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I want to fly with you and I don't want to lie to you

'Cause I, 'cause I can't recall a better day
So I'm coming to shine on the occasion
You're an open-minded lady, you've got it all

And I never forget a face
Except for maybe my own, I have my days
And let's face the fact here
It's you who's got it all

You know that fortune favors the brave
Well, let me get paid while I make your breakfast
The rest is up to you, you make the call

You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk
Sister, you've got it all

I can't recall a better day
So I'm coming to shine on the occasion
Hey sophisticated lady, oh, you got it all

You got it all, you got it all
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all, hey! You got it all, woo

You got it all, hey
You got it all
Butterfly, baby, well, you got it all
