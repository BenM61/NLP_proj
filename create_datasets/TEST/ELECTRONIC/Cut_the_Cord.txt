I watched you go, one foot out the door
But looking over your shoulder, shoulder
I lost control of everything I've known
But I just wanna hold ya, hold ya

Can't change it, can't make this nightmare go away
Cause I don't even sleep, I'm wide awake

I've just gotta do it, I shouldn't overthink it
On the count of 1, 2, 3, I'll go ahead and cut the cord
Maybe in the ruins, I'll finally see the reason
So on the count of 1, 2, 3, I'll go ahead and cut the cord

I've just gotta do it, I shouldn't overthink it
On the count of 1, 2, 3, I'll, I'll go ahead and cut the cord

Don't even bother, there's no in-between
So please don't make it harder, harder

Can't change it, can't make this nightmare go away
Cause I don't even sleep, I'm wide awake

I've just gotta do it, I shouldn't overthink it
On the count of 1, 2, 3, I'll go ahead and cut the cord

Go ahead and cut the cord

I've just gotta do it, I shouldn't overthink it
On the count of 1, 2, 3, on the count of 1, 2, 3
Maybe in the ruins, I'll finally see the reason
So on the count of 1, 2, 3, I'll go ahead and cut the cord
