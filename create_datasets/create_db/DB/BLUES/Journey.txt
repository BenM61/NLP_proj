Every now and then
I fall into deep thought and self-examination
Figuring out
If I really belong in this world

Who am I? What was I born to live
Will I succeed or will I fall short of my dreams?

I know, I've got to find a way to move on
Yeah, to a place where I can be stronger

On a journey
Deeper inside
On a journey
Deeper inside my mind

I know, I've gotta find a way to move on
Gotta move on to a place where I can be stronger
Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger

I'm on a journey deep inside my mind
To see if I can find the answers
To all the questions I've been asking myself
For a long time, a long time
A long time for a long time

I'm on a journey deep inside my mind
To see if I can find the answers
To all the questions I've been asking myself
For a long time, a long time
A long time, for a long time

I'm on a journey deep inside my mind
To see if I can find the answers
To all the questions I've been asking myself
