What's it gonna be?
Are you willingly walking away from this?
What's it gonna take?
Can you really break this love?

Where you gonna go?
Tell me do you know when does your heart emit?
'Cause if you leave, baby then leave
Make up your mind before you shut the door

'Cause if there's a chance we might've missed
And if there's a ray of light in this
Baby you should know that this is where my heart takes over, over over

Going back in time,
You know we have tried too hard to let this fade,
Almost disappeared, 'til we made it here, baby
And look me in the eye, promise I won't cry
This is your choice to make
'Cause if you go, baby then go
You change your mind I won't be here no more

'Cause if there's a chance we might've missed
And if there's a ray of light in this
Baby you should know that this is where my heart takes over, over...over...

And if there's a small piece left of us
Somewhere in the battles we have lost
Baby look at me 'cause this is where my heart takes over, over over

This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over

What's it gonna be?
Are you willingly walking away from this?

'Cause if there's a chance we might've missed
And if there's a ray of light in this
Baby you should know that this is where my heart takes over, over over

And if there's a small piece left of us
Somewhere in the battles we have lost
Baby look at me 'cause this is where my heart takes over, over over

This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
