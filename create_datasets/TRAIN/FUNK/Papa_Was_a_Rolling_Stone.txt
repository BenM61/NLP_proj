(Listen, we don't have anything other than that)
(The American dream)
(Just think about it, just think about it)

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never had a chance to see him
Never heard nothing but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said: Son

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Yeah, Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone, yeah

Where the hell are ya, daddy, that's what I'm sayin'
Down on my knees in tears and I'm prayin'
Wishin' and hopin' my dreams could come true
So I could feel like the other kids do
A young child but not complete as a whole
Before I was born you up and strolled
Mama was there but you was up in the wind
You never even knew my name, you didn't
You never wrote, called, let alone came by
As a youth it was hard to wonder why
But now I'm older and I don't dwell on self-pity
Thinkin' about the life you didn't give me
I remember when I used to tell lies
When people would ask I'd just fantasize
Makin' up stories to make you look good
But the real truth was you was never no good
People used to say I look just like you
But rest assured I don't act like you
I'm more than that, my mama raised me better
And you can best believe I'm much more together
So believe that

Hey mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life
And mama, bad talk goin' 'round town said
Papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right
Heard some talk about Papa doin' some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about savin' souls and all the time leachin'
Dealin' in debt and stealin' in the name of the Lord
(Ha ha ha ha) oh (mama just hung her head and said: Son) oh

Papa was a rolling stone (my son, yeah)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone (I'm a tellin' you)
Papa was a rolling stone, well
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone, yeah

It's been said, you gave me something you never had
But that's not always true and it's sad
To find myself missing you when I did
Well, who knows the reasons you did what you did
I can't help but to wonder why
You lived your life as a big fat lie
You act like you had no responsibilities
Cause if you did it's a bet that you wouldn't be
Stealin', beggin', hustlin' and schemin'
You coulda got a job but did you know the meaning of work
I'm talkin' 'bout an honest day's pay
But you was too lazy to be that way
Always tryin' to take the easy ride, that's what they tell me
So I don't doubt it for a moment, not for a sec
Because you lacked all your self-respect
But it's too late, for you, that is
Tomorrow I'll be goin' on about my biz
And so it's time to put the past behind
Erase the anger and clear my mind
I wanna forget the little bit I know
And make sure that I never sink so low
Cause I want my kids to grow up and know
That I was always there because I loved them so
And that's the least thing that I could do
But that's a lot more than I got from you

I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent Papa to his early grave
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal to pay his bills
Hey mama, folks say Papa wasn't much on thinkin'
Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'
Mama, I'm dependin' on you to tell me the truth, ooh

Papa was a rolling stone (well well well well)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home (hey yeah)
And when he died all he left us was alone (I'm a-tellin' you)
Papa was a rolling stone (yeah now)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone, lone, lone, lone, lone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
