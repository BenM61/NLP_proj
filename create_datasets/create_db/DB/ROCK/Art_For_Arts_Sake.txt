Gimme your body 
Gimme your mind 
Open your heart 
Pull down the blind 
Gimme your love gimme it all 
Gimme in the kitchen gimme in the hall 
Art for arts sake 
Money for Gods sake 
Art for Arts sake 
Money for Gods sake 
Gimme the readys 
Gimme the cash 
Gimme a bullet 
Gimme a smash 
Gimme a silver gimme a gold 
Make it a million for when I get old 
Art for arts sake 
Money for Gods sake 
Art for Arts sake 
Money for Gods sake 
Money talks so listen to it 
Money talks to me 
Anyone can understand it 
Money can't be beat Oh no 
When you get down, down to the root 
Don't give a damn don't give a hoot 
Still gotta keep makin the loot 
Chauffeur driven 
Gotta make her quick as you can 
Give her lovin' make you a man 
Get her in the palm of your hand 
Bread from Heaven 
Gimme a country 
Where I can be free 
Don't need the unions 
Strangling me 
Keep me in exile the rest of my days 
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays 
Art for arts sake 
Money for Gods sake 
Art for arts sake 
Money for Gods sake 
Art for arts sake 
Money for Gods sake 
Art for arts sake 
Money for Gods sake
