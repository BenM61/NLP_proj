There was a king with magic hands
There was a crown and a touch of gold
The crown was up in the game of chance
Welcome King Midas
King Midas oh the secret of your touch
King Midas oh I like your smile so much
King Midas oh the way you spin me round
I'm going down down down to Vegas
There was a heart of broken dreams
There was a town where the dreams came true
The golden touch of the disco beat
Welcome King Midas
We are the stars and we like the fame
We're the gamblers of Nevada
You know the rules and you know the game
The winner takes it all
King Midas I love your heart of gold
King Midas one look and I was sold
King Midas the way you spin me round
I'm going down down down to Vegas
King Midas oh King Midas oh King Midas oh
King Midas the way you spin me round
I'm going down down down to Vegas
There was a King with magic hands
There was a crown and a touch of gold
The crown was up in the game of chance
Welcome King Midas
We are the stars and we like the fame
We're the gamblers of Nevada
You know the rules and you know the game
The winner takes it all
King Midas oh the secret of your touch
King Midas oh I like your smile so much
King midas oh the way you spin me round
I'm going down down down to Vegas
The midas touch come hold me in your arms
Las Vegas night my dream will come true
