Rap 
2000 Jon be	 why'all, N.A.S. why'all 
To the def why'all, come on, get it right 
Look at them brown nosein' my click pullin' up with purple roses 
Purple diamonds pinky rings purple Dozia 
Heaven had to mold her, look at the earth she bangin' 
Gucci purse wondering what ghetto that she came from 
She gangsta from her head to her feet 
By birth I'm her soldier bet the pearl tongues sweet 
And I felt the world wind when we met 
She felt like something I'd never forget 
Something you had to witness 
Perfect physical fitness alerted all my 5 senses 
I said my name is Nas love and who's the girl next to ya 
This my man Boogotti I'd like to introduce ya 
Well for once in our lives 
Something we feel just might be real if we try 
If we try babe 
I know I'm giving you love 
But is it really enough for you to be satisfied 
You always know that you're beautiful 
Do you see the beauty that I see inside 
Inside you 
So much that I want to do 
Traveled the world to find the girl for sure was you 
Can I prove it to ya 
What if I show you the finer things 
La dee dah 
The finer things in life 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Mama just you and I (you and I) 
Hit you with some love tonight 
(Hit you with some love tonight) 
Hit you with some love tonight 
What if for once in your life 
Everything you want to feel is real in my mind 
Gotcha on my mind 
Like makin' love to ya right 
Your body is telling me everything I need to 
I want to do it tonight (all night) 
Baby, please say that you can stay a long time 
Please say that you can spend the night 
With me 
What's up with the house on the beach 
You're gonna sip a little apple martini 
I want you to just lay back and let me free 
Your insecurities 
Rap 
If I was you man, your knowledge would expand till we both were equal 
Chillin' on islands where the sand and the ocean is deep blue 
They're three things that I got on my list 
You qualify, you my Miss, I count em down like this 
Number one you got to be real 
Don't lie to me bout monogamy 
See hone get out of my grill 
Love me if I'm locked up or out on appeal 
Keep it tight when I'm in it ask me how does it feel 
Number two easy to do be who you are 
Be with me a real "G" with every beat of your heart 
And number three last but not least give me peace 
And I show you the world most girls ain't lucky to see 
Jon be	 
What if I show you the finer things 
La dee dah 
The finer things in life 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Mama just you and I (you and I) 
Hit you with some love tonight 
(Hit you with some love tonight) 
Hit you with some love tonight 
What if I show you the finer things 
La dee dah 
The finer things in life 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Mama just you and I (you and I)
