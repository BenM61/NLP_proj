I got a letter this morning, my wife had a brand new baby girl
When I got the news I was half way 'round the world
That's good news, oh boy that's good news
Oh boy that's good news, what my baby says

Well, you know I'm leaving in the morning, I'm on my way home
When I get there I'ma rock that woman in my arms
That's good news, oh boy that's good news
Oh, oh boy that's good news, what my baby says

Well, you know I'ma give away candy, I'ma have cigars for sale
I know she love me and boy, she wouldn't fail
That's good news, oh boy that's good news
Oh, oh boy that's good news, what my baby says

Well, you know soon as I get home I'ma rock that baby on my knees
Reach out to kiss her mother and say, "Girl, you can't be beat"
That's good news, oh boy that's good news
Oh, oh boy that's good news, what my baby says
