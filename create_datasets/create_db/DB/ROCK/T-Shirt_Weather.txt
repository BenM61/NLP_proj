She left me and said
Baby won't you come to bed
But I can not sleep
While the sun's awake

The nights been so long
You don't get me right, don't get me wrong
Now my head tells the tales
I hardly know

I remember T-shirt weather
I remember some days
We were singing our lungs out
in the backseat together
And the seatbelts were burning our fingers
In the T-shirt weather
I remember sleeping till the early afternoon

Drinks fly like birds
Across the kitchen trouble stirs
And I'm tongue-tied by words
I used to know

So we talk till we're sick
Seventeen went far too quick
And when my mind plays tricks
I have to go

I remember T-shirt weather
I remember some days
We were singing our lungs out
in the backseat together
And the seatbelts were burning our fingers
In the T-shirt weather
I remember sleeping till the early afternoon

It's going to be ok
It's going to be ok
It's going to be ok
It's going to be ok
It's going to be ok
It's going to be ok

I remember T-shirt weather
I remember some days
We were singing our lungs out
in the backseat together
And the seatbelts were burning our fingers
In the T-shirt weather
(Yeah) In the T-shirt weather
(Yeah) In the T-shirt weather
In the T-shirt weather
