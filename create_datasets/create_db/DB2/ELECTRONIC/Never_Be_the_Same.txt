I don't mind 
Suddenly, you came to life 
You were, astounding 
I was so mesmerized 

Heavenly, is all that, I could feel 
Now your here 
And left without a single feel 
From this day on

I'll never be the same again 
I'll never be the same again 
I'll never be able to live, my life 
I'll never be the same again 
I'll never be able to live my life 
Since you came along 

Heavenly, is all that, I could feel 
Now your here, there's nothing left, for me to feel 
From this day on

I'll never be the same again, I'll never be able to live my life
I'll never be the same again, I'll never be able to live my life
From this day on 

How could I ever get over you? 
How could I ever get over you? 
How could I
Since you came along 
How could I ever get over you
