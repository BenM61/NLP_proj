Well my love it's been a while
We're together once again tonight
Lying here in each others arms
Although we know it isn't right

I know that we're wrong
'Cause we've done it so long
That it's hard habit to break ooh ooh
So we walk up in line
It's just a matter of time
'Till we make our first mistake

Well the feeling is so hard to shake
I wonder what she'd do
If she only knew
There is more to what I'm telling
Between me and you
We are more than friends
There is nothing left to talk about
I know she'll be walking out
If she finds out
You and I are more than friends

Ooh ooh ooh ooh babe
More than friends
More than friends
Ooh ooh ooh

Can we be sure
That she doesn't know
Well it's starting to play in my mind
(Play in my mind)
How much longer can we keep taking chances

Believe it or not she's not blind
Yeah I'm committed to her
You're committed to him
And there is no breaking the way oh

So we keep tempting fate
Thinking it's never too late (never too late)
To go our separate ways

Well the feeling is so hard to shake
I wonder what she'd do
If she only knew
There is more to what I'm telling
Between me and you
We are more than friends
There is nothing left to talk about
I know she'll be walking out
If she finds out
You and I are more than friends

So let's slow down
Or somebody else will be hurt yeah
We better call and run
Oh it's easier said than done
Well I just keep thinking
There's more
So, so much more baby

I wonder what she'd do
If she only knew
There is more to what I'm telling
Between me and you

'Cause I'm committed to her
You're committed to him
And there is no breaking the way oh
Well I just keep thinking
I just keep thinking oh oh oh oh

I wonder what she'd do
If she only knew
There is more to what I'm telling
Between me and you

We're more than friends
There is nothing left to talk about
I know she'll be walking out
If she finds out
You and I are more than good friends

I wonder what she'd do
(what's she gonna do)
If she only knew
(If she only knew, all about us, all about us)
We're more than friends
There is nothing left to talk about (There is nothing left)
She'll be walking out
Yeah if she finds out
You and I are more than good friends

I wonder what she'd do
If she only knew
We're more than friends
