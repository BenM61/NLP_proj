Welcome once again to the ceremony
Briefly, this is my testimony
I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
Where you come from really makes no difference to me
Whether country or just another lonely city
Like a lotus you process the ability
To produce flower and fruit simultaneously

So drop your pebble in the mainstream
Start a ripple
It will buzz you like a tweak on your nipple
Tickle your sensibility speak just a little
The words have enough weight to turn rock to metal

Like a tweak on your nipple

I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
But your individuality overflows with quality
It manifests solidly
If you believe
A rich creativity, fever pitch energy
And crazy synchronicity
If you believe

So drop your pebble in the mainstream
Start a ripple
It will buzz you like a tweak on your nipple
Tickle your sensibility speak just a little
The words have enough weight to turn rock to metal

Like a tweak on your nipple
