If this should end tomorrow
All our best laid plans
And all our typical fears
Am I running out of lifetimes
This is not the first time
Something ends in just tears

but tomorrow I can't imagine
How am I supposed to know
What's yet to go down
Is there only one religion
The kind that whispers
When nobody comes around

the world can wait
The world can wait
I want to drink the water from your well
I want to tell you things I'll never tell

The world can wait
The world can wait
I'm wide awake
And the world can wait

I want to feel and then some
I have five senses
I need thousands more at least
Every day a page of paper

every night a photograph
A moveable feast

So fade to black and white now
Roll the movie of my life
Inside of my head
'Cause like all true believers
I am truly skeptical
Of all that I have said

The world can wait
The world can wait
I want to drink the water from your well
I want to tell you things I'll never tell

The world can wait
The world can wait
I'm wide awake
And the world can wait

Haven't I said enough
Haven't I said far too much
Haven't I done enough
Haven't I done far too much
Far too much
The world can wait
