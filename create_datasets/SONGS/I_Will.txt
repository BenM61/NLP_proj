All I notice is the red in your eyes
A hidden secret
We are not supposed to cry
Feeling the need to express

Only in order to find
How similar we are!
Possess yourself
Or somebody else will

And when you're yourself
You might find you're someone else
If the love doesn't set you free
Then I will

The pleasure of life
Is the pain of living
What we take out
Is replaced by "giving"

If the love doesn't set you free
Then I will
If the love doesn't set you free
Then I will

If you can contain
Your own emptiness
Then life is forward
No idle regrets

If the love doesn't set you free
Then I will
If the love doesn't set you free
Then I will

If the love doesn't set you free
Then I will
If the love doesn't set you free
Then I will
