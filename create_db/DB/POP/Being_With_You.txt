Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

Hold me in your arms
Tell me that this love
Will always be

Whisper in my ear
Things that only you and I
Should hear

Through the storms of life
We toss and turn
Tryin' hard to break us down

But I could face the hurt of anything
Just as long as you're around

'Cause being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my mind

Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my eyes

All I ask of life
Is to let me near you
Con-stant-ly

Only in my dreams
Had I known how good
Real love could be

Through the storms of life
We toss and turn
Tryin' hard to break us down

But I could face the hurt of anything
Just as long as you're around

'Cause being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my life

Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my eyes

You make me feel so good
why'know it baby
Like only lovers should
Come do it baby

Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my life

You are an angel in my life
Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my eyes

You are an angel baby
Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my life

Even the rainy days
You are an angel baby
Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my eyes

Even the rainy days
Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
