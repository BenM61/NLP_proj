Cupid don't love me like he used to do
'Cause I'm broken-hearted way too soon
I let my guard down
The devil's gone and left me a bruise, mmm
Rocks at the bottom, will I try again?
Romeo still lives in my head
Thought I would settle down
When happy ever after'd been said, mmm

Six, five, four, three
Too many times I wish I'd never cared
Been torn and twisted, oh I swear
Too many nights crying that it's not fair
If I get hurt again
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair

They told me stories and they got me good
Who's sayin' fairytales aren't true?
If he saves me from the dragon
Well for that lovin', I'd be a fool, mmm
I'd overlook the stupid things he does
Straight up forgive him when he's wrong
When he's fallen off the wagon
We'll still dance to our favourite slow song, mmm

Six, five, four, three
Too many times I wish I'd never cared
Been torn and twisted, oh I swear
Too many nights crying that it's not fair
If I get hurt again
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair

They say that love is everywhere
But it's a game of truth or dare
Gimme that guarantee and I'll be there
Heaven knows I tried my best
Now I'm swimming in the sea of loneliness
Wanna take that chance and wanna say yeah

But too many times I wish I'd never cared
Been torn and twisted, oh I swear
Too many nights crying that it's not fair
If I get hurt again
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
