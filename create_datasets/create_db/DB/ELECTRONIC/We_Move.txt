We move, in mysterious ways
We move, slip and slide cut through the haze
And even as I stand in the room
Listening to all of the silence around
I feel disco and not so some tune
Beating inside make my feet touch the ground
Then we move

We move, as the music sways
We move, like the good book says
I feel my face reflected around
Hot on my heels closing in more and more
The piper plays a beckoning sound
Leading them on 'til their feet reach the floor
The we move

We dance, we dance, ...
Then we move
