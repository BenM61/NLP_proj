Let it begin, let Adam in
Step one: original sin
Underneath the leaves, Adam found Eve
Both of them found something sweet under the apple tree
Then it was over, roads divide
Step two: learning how to lie
Let me ask a question to present day
How the hell did Eve end up with all the damn blame?
All the damn blame

To all the dirty looks, the kitty cat calls
To the ones who try and throw us up against the back walls
Let me tell you something you'll understand
Only the little boys tell you they're a big man
To all my sisters and all our friends
We have to thank them, please
Strength means blessed with an enemy

All my, my, my, my armor comes from you
You make me try, try, try, try harder
Oh, that's all I ever do, ever do
Oh, no no, my, my, my, my armor comes from you
You make me stronger, stronger
Now, hand me my armor
(Hand me my armor, hand me my armor)

Step three: I see
The unforgettable, incredible ones who came before me
Brought poetry, brought science
Sowed quiet seeds of self-reliance
Bloomed in me, so here I am
You think I am high and mighty, mister?
Wait 'til you meet my little sister

All my, my, my, my armor comes from you
You make me try, try, try, try harder
Oh, that's all I ever do, ever do
Oh, no no, my, my, my, my armor comes from you
You make me stronger, stronger
Now, hand me my armor

What you didn't do to bury me
But you didn't know I was a goddamn seed
You don't scare me, I am of the earth
So tired of your empire
Blind men only set the world on fire
Sad you can't see it
You brought the flame, here comes the phoenix
You make me try harder
Oh, it's all I ever do, ever do
Oh, no no, my, my, my, my armor comes from you
You make me stronger, stronger
Hand me my armor

All my, my, my, my armor comes from you
You make me try, try, try, try harder
Oh, that's all I ever do, ever do
Oh, no no, my, my, my, my armor comes from you
You make me stronger, stronger
Hand me my armor

(Hand me my armor, hand me my armor)
(Hand me my armor, hand me my armor)
Hand me my armor, hand me my armor
Hand me my armor, hand me my armor
