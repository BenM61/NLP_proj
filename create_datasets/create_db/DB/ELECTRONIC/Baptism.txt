Hold my head under water
Take a breath for the Father
Learn to love. Lessons repeating
The Chronicles are so misleading

This is your baptism
And you can't forgive em
This is your baptism
And you can't forgive em

Hold my head under water
Take a breath for the Father
Learn to love. Lessons repeating
The Chronicles are so misleading

This is your baptism
And you can't forgive em
This is your baptism
And you can't forgive em
