Love is being a chair that a tired man can sit on
Love is being a shade from the sun and heat to rest in
Love is being a soldier fighting for what you believe in
And love is giving
Love is being a fountain in a desert for you to drink from
Love is seeing a storm and offering protection
Love is the giving of both hands to catch the tears in motion
And love is open

-Chorus-
Love is deep as is wide, and taller than tall
Love is stronger than steal
Still the bad through it all
It's everything
A wounded hearts wing
Love is, Love is, Love is
All of those things

Love is being a candle that will chase away the darkness
Love is being a strangle to someone that is defense less
Love is praying for those who are searching for forgiveness
And love, love is children

-Chorus-
Love is deep as is wide, and taller than tall
Love is stronger than steal
Still the bad through it all
Well It's everything
A wounded hearts wing
Love is, Love is, Love is
All of those things

Ohhh wooowwoo yeahhh

-Chorus-
Love is deep as is wide, and taller than tall
Love is stronger than steal
Still the bad through it all
Well It's everything
A wounded hearts wing
Love is, Love is, Love is
All of those things

All of those things
All of those things
