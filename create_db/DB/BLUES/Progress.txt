If not today
Maybe tomorrow
If not tomorrow
Maybe in a week
No matter how far I push it
It needs to find me
Progress 

I see out 
From the top of my apartment
Oh on the screen
On my TV
Out in the street
Oh in the bedroom yeah
In all the closets
It surrounds me
We're making progress
(Together or on our own)

Progress

Cold grace

Progress
