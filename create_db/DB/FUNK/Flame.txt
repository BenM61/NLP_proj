Find me, you can always find me,
Lovin' you so kindly, your life is like candlelight,
And darlin' no one told us,
No one every told us, 
What this love could hold for us,
Maybe we were meant to find it, faithfully,
There is always a sun that's rising,
When I know in your heart you're there for me,
And from now on,
Your flame just keeps me burnin' on,
Know you, no one knows like I do,
There's one thing I'm sure is true,
That we were meant to share our whole lives through,
There is always a sun that's rising,
When I know your heart you're there for me,
And from now on,
Your flame just keeps me burnin' on,
There is always a star that's shining,
Whether you're far away or near to me,
And from now on,
Your flame just keeps me burnin' on,
There is always a star that's shining,
And from now on,
Your flame just keeps me burnin' on.
