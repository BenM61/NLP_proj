I can't hear what you're saying
Just keep the music playing
It all sounds the same to me

Good God please have mercy
Let's kick the machine till it's working
Everybody's got a great idea
Do you own the one you're encouraging
There's a first time for everything
After that it starts to get confusing
Hold onto your identities loosely
At least the revolution will be amusing

Word of mouth
This is what everybody's talking about
So you can tell somebody to tell somebody
That the next new thing is the same old thing

We came and we quickly left
We took what we could get
I guess we weren't impressed
We bored ourselves instead
What's after what's next
What's left to get off your chest
Walking in circles retracing steps
How many ways can we package the concept
Mundane it's all the same
Remind me later when nothing's changed
Time will tell let the future explain
Until then we''ve got history to make
Trend-setters real go-getters
Closed-minded free-thinking hipsters
Instant classics adored by critics
It's just music for the kids

Word of mouth
This is what everybody's talking about
So you can tell somebody to tell somebody that
What''s happening has already happened again

Of course you've heard this before
What are you trying to figure out
Too much time on your hands
To analyze what doesn't count
What's wrong with everyday people
They make the best crowd
It was never that important
And the future doesn't care about your

Word of mouth
This is what everybody's talking about

Word of mouth
This is what everybody's talking about
