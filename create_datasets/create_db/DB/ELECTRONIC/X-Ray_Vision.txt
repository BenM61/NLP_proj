You think your clever words will fool me baby 
And the magic in your smile will sooth me lady 
How long can we go on pretending baby 
Your eyes can't hide the lies, you make me crazy 
Well its getting kinda raw 
Your words are not enough 
No matter what you say 
I'll just turn away 

X-ray vision, baby I can see through you 
X-ray vision, baby I'm in love, that's true 

I'm looking out my room the world is turning 
And there's a lesson that you should be learning 
Love is not a game is what I'm saying 
My passion burns for you, so stop your playing 
Stop playing with my heart 
It's tearing us apart 
Just hear the words I say 
Don't throw it all away 

X-ray vision, baby I can see through you 
X-ray vision, baby I'm in love, that's true 

X-ray vision, baby I can see through you 
X-ray vision, baby I'm in love, that's true
