Hey you don't realize your strength
Sweet enough as you are don't change
To tell the truth
When I'm with you
Ain't nothing ever gonna let you down
The way you do the things you do
Ain't never ever gonna let you down
The way you do the things you do

I've got a feeling you could be sweetest operator
I've got that feeling
That's what you are
I've got a feeling you could be sweetest operator
I've got that feeling
That's what you are

Hey I don't recognize a soul
So I'll stick to the things I know
But I'm still looking for a way
To break the pattern of the everyday
And you could prove the very thing
The way you operate is such a relief now

I've got a feeling you could be sweetest operator
I've got that feeling
That's what you are
I've got a feeling you could be sweetest operator
I've got that feeling
That's what you are

It's effortless the way you make perfect sense
Of every word I ever spoke
And you refine the bitterness
Now I got a reason
