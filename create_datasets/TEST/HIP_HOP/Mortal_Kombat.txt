Perverted monks style
'99 style, know what I'm sayin'?
Comin' at cha, this how we do

Paraplegic, my fightin' stance, too strategic
No shadows on my kicks too much chi-horrific
To be specific, I'm comin' threw with Jiu-Jitsu
Bone crushin' bone breakin' as I get into

Scorpion styles, with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be
The blaster, iron palms is elemental
Combinations damagin' nations in the mental

Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you try to test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains readin' scrolls

Holdin' it down, iron shirt chi-gung
Apprentice in the temple with guang-jung-nim
I went through torture deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinnin' kicks, side kicks, and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin' two styles on the Mic with Masta Killa

The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seein' through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell keep it movin' factor

Sword swing it to the temple, mental state
Danger chamber, eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bedstuy

Wang Chung from Lafayette, stuy versant and Malcolm X
Fifty seven park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featurin' Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one

Young Chun, prodigal son, killa bees disease
Home grown, flown from over seas, city under siege
Ya eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinnin' roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin' two styles on the Mic with Masta Killa

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin' two styles on the Mic with Masta Killa
