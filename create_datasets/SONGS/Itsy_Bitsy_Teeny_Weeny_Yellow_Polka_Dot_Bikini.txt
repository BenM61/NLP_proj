She was afraid to come out of the locker
She was as nervous as she could be 
She was afraid to come out of the locker
She was afraid that somebody would see
Two, three, four, tell the people what she wore!

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini
That she wore for the first time today.
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini
So in the locker she wanted to stay.
Two, three, four, stick around we'll tell you more!         

She was afraid to come out in the open
And so a blanket around her she wore. 
She was afraid to come out in the open.
And so she sat bundled up on the shore. 
Two, three, four, tell the people what she wore!

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
That she wore for the first time today.
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
So in the blanket she wanted to stay.
Two, three, four, stick around we'll tell you more!
         
Now she is afraid to come out of the water. 
And I wonder what she's gonna do.
'Cause she's afraid to come out of the water. 
And now the poor little girl's turning blue.
Two, three, four, tell the people what she wore!

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
That she wore for the first time today.
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
So in the water she wanted to stay.

From the locker to the blanket, 
From the blanket to the shore,
From the shore to the water
Guess there isn't any more.
