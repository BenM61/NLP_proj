I betcha, a nickel
I bet you I win
I betcha, a nickel
That you will give in

What'sa matter honey?
'Fraid you'll lose?
Do what you wanna
And say what you choose

I still betcha, a nickel
That you will be mine
I betcha, a nickel
Even raise it a dime

I always win my money
You can bet on that
I always take a tip
And keep it under my hat

You've got yourself to yourself
Come on, get off that shelf
You can fool some of the people some of the time
But you can't fool all the people all of the time

That's why I betcha, a nickel
That you will be mine
I betcha, you'll sign on, the dotted line
I don't see no sense in wasting all this time
Cause whatever you bet, your bet is gonna be mine

You've got yourself to yourself
Come on, get off that shelf
You can fool some of the people some of the time
But you can't fool all the people all of the time

(we betcha, a penny, we ain't got a dime)
Say that ain't no money, you're wastin' my time
I don't see no sense in all this rhythm and rhyme
Cause whatever you bet, your bet is gonna be mine
