When the leaves fell down you were my lover
Winter taught me you were my friend
When the spring came 'round I'd often wonder
Would the summer bring you back again
But now I know

With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me

I try to find a new direction
You wait on every corner turned
But the minute I ask your attention
You turn on your heels and I get burned
At least I know
At least I know

With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything, getting anything, getting anything from me

Like day and night I know this much is true
(With you it's about the chase)
Still every path it leads me back to you
(With you it's about the chase)
It's like a disease, I don't wanna get well
(It's like a disease)
I know it's not easy, but it's easy to tell
It's easy to tell, it's easy to tell with you

With you it's about
With you it's about
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything from me
With you it's about the chase
You're not getting anything, getting anything, getting anything today

With you it's about the chase
