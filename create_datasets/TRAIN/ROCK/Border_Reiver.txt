Southern bound from Glasgow town, she's shining in the sun
My Scotstoun lassie, on the border run
We're whistling down the hillsides and tearing up the climbs
I'm just a thiever, stealing time
In the Border Reiver.

Three hundred thousand on the clock and plenty more to go
Crash, box and lever, she needs the heal and toe
She's not to cold in winter but she cooks me in the heat
I'm a six foot driver but you can adjust the seat
In the Border Reiver

Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
She's an Albion, she's an Albion

The ministry don't worry me my paperwork's alright
They can't touch me, I got my sleep last night
Its knocking out a living wage in nineteen sixty nine
I'm just a thiever, stealing time
In the Border reiver.

Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
She's an Albion, she's an Albion
