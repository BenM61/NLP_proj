Uh ah ah 
Baby baby baby 
Uh ah ah 
Baby baby baby 

Every time I see you close the door 
I wish I could believe that you would never lie 
As I see you walking down the street tonight 
I ain't so sure that you'll be back again this time 

(aah) Every time that you are by my side 
Deep inside I know you'll never be my guy 
(aah) Yet I think you've never really been in love 
Baby won't you tell me now the reason why 

(aah) But I can't forgive your eyes 
Memories will never die 

Baby baby baby (ooh) don't you want me 
Don't you need me (aah) by your side (baby baby baby) 
Baby baby baby (ooh) don't you want me 
Won't you hold me (aah) one more night (baby baby baby) 

Every time I see you've got the blues 
There's a reason to be always by your side 
But when I feel that you can tell me only lies 
There's no chance for me to keep you satisfied 

(aah) If you look into my soul 
(aah) You could see a perfect world 
(aah) But I can't forget your eyes 
Memories will never die 

Baby baby baby (ooh) 
Oh baby (aah) 
Baby baby baby 
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby) 

Don't you want me (ooh) 
Don't you need me (ah) 
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby) 

(ah) If you look into my soul 
(ah) You could see a perfect world 
(ah) But I can't forget your eyes 
Memories will never die 

Baby baby baby
