Something went wrong
You are not laughing
It's not so easy now to get your smile
You gotta be wrong
To walk these streets
And keep from falling
But when you're not, just let yourself cry

You've been working hard
Just trying to pay the rent
Tryin' to draw the line between who you are
And who you invent
But if you throw a stone
Something's gonna shatter somewhere
We're all so fragile
We're all so scared

You say you want to learn how to live your life
Without tears
But we've been trying to do that for thousands of years
So go on and cry Ophelia
It's the only thing to do sometimes
You know I'm crying too
Right there with you
It's alright Ophelia
Everybody cries

Thank god for my bad memory
I've forgotten some of the stupid things
That I've done
I've come to a little wisdom
Through a whole lot of failure
So I watch more carefully what rolls off my tongue

You pray for rain
But you don't want it from a storm
You find a rose
And cut your finger on a thorn
So go on and cry Ophelia
It's the only thing to do sometimes
You know I'm crying too
Right there with you
It's alright Ophelia
Everybody cries Ophelia
