Ba Ba Ba Ba (repeated)

Time's Up
Get on the way can't be right now
Something's got me started but I can't turn around
It just took down ties to take what I've become

These ties wrapped in knots and its only just begun
Look out now
To see wheat fields and vacant bats, (??) and complaining cats
This is all I see [Repeat: x2]
