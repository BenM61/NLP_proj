Did you ever see a dream walking? 
Well, I did. 
Did you ever hear a dream talking? 
Well, I did.
 
Did you have a dream thrill you 
With "Will you be mine?" 
Oh, it's so grand, 
And it's too, too divine!
 
Did you ever see a dream dancing? 
Well, I did. 
Did a ever see a dream romancing? 
Well, I did!
 
Did you see heaven right in your arms, 
Saying, "I love you, I do!" 
Well, the dream that was walking, 
And the dream that was talking, 
The heaven in my arms was you.
