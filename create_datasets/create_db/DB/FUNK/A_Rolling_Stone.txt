I've been (?) my life just a rolling stone,
When I needed your love, baby, your'e always gone.

In my life I know that something is missing,
Grains of sand is really all you've been giving.

I need more loving baby, I need more (?kissing?),
Now I want (?) that you got.

They say a rolling stone never gathers no moss,
One day we will slow down and find that love is lost.

In my life I know that something is missing,
Grains of sand is really all you've been giving.

I need more loving baby, I need more (?kissing?),
Now I want (?) that you got,
Now I want (?) that you got.

(?).
Now I want (?) that you got.
In my life I know that something is missing,
Baby, grains of sand is really all you've been giving.

I need more loving baby, I need more (?kissing?),
Now I want (?) that you got,
Now I want (?) that you got.
