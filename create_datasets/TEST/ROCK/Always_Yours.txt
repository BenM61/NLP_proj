I know, you know,I'll never, never let you go
Oh, you know, I know,I'll never, never let you go

Always yours!

I know, you know,I'll never, never let you go

Always yours!

You know, I know,I'll never, never let you go!
Oh, you will always find me here
Cause I'm always, always yours

Never known such a romeo
But I'm always, always yours
That's me! that's me!
I'm still your blue-eyed boy

Please don't cry if I pass you by
Cause I'm always, always yours

Please don't mind if I take my time
Cause I'm always yours

Put me down if I run around
Cause I'm always, always yours

It's no fun when I kiss and run
But I'm always, always yours

That's me! that's me!
I'm still your pride and joy

Take me home if I start to roam
Cause I'm always, always yours

I got you and you got me to, and I'm always yours

I know, you know, I'll never, never let you go
Oh, you know, I know,I'll never, never let you go
Oh, I know, you know,I'll never, never let you go
Oh, you know, I know,I'll never, never let you go!

Just be cool if I play the fool
Cause I'm always, always yours

I'm a scream, I'm a teenage dream
But I'm always, always yours

That's me! that's me!
You're sneaky, cheeky boy

Here I come with a special love
And it's always, always yours

I've been round with the best in town
And it's always yours

I know, you know, I'll never, never let you go
Oh, you know, I know, I'll never, never let you go
Oh, I know, you know, I'll never, never let you go
Oh, you know, I know, I'll never, never let you go!

Always yours!

I know, you know
