Timber shakes these trails they all derail
Phony, false and frail
An empty ocean lost our way with no direction home
Golden needles names we take in vein
Find it harder to remain
And nothings sacred still waiting on that explanation

Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh

Hold your dirty hand over the flames
Getting pleasure from the pain
Softly screaming the pistol that you raise has spoken
Golden needles names we take in vein
Find it harder to remain
Well nothings sacred still waiting on that explanation

Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh

Everything I thought I knew fell to the side
Time went on and on I couldn't see past my on eyes
Past my eyes
Past my eyes
Past my eyes

Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh
