Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call
Well, you ain't so big, you're just tall, that's all

Got me working, boss man, working 'round the clock
I want me a drink of water, but you won't let Jimmy stop
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's all

Well, I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right
Work hard in the day time, rest easy at night
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you're just tall, that's all
