He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
And then he lies awake and he wonders
Why can't that be me?

'Cause in his life he is filled
With all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things
He'd rather not mention right now

Just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me
And he says

If I could be like that
Well I would give anything
Just to live one day in
In those shoes

If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

Now in dreams we run

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dreams
Is that too much to ask?

With a safe home and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold on to
That's all she needs

Yeah, if I could be like that
Well I would give anything
Just to live one day in
In those shoes

If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do? Yeah yeah yeh oh oh

I'm falling into this 
In dreams we run away

If I could be like that
Well I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes

If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes

If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes

If I could be like that?
What would I do?
Lord what would I do? Yeah yeah

Falling in
I feel I am falling in
To this again
