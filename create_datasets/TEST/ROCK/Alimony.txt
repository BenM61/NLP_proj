You can take anything you think you deserve, whoah
You can take all the records you said you'd never heard
I can't bring myself to care anymore, whoah
I will avert my gaze as you walk out the door

Please don't make me pay alimony
Please don't make me pay alimony
Oh alimony, Oh alimony

I guess I always knew that things would have to end, whoah
But then you always could see right round the bend
I feel kind of sad to think that you're alone, whoah
But then I always knew you'd find another home

Please don't make me pay alimony
Please don't make me pay alimony
Oh alimony, Oh alimony

You can take anything you think you deserve, whoah
You can take all the records you said you'd never heard
I can't bring myself to care anymore, whoah
I will avert my gaze as you walk out the door

Please don't make me pay alimony
Please don't make me pay alimony
Oh alimony, Oh alimony
Ah, ah, ah, ah
