The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there so warm and fair 

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled on golden sand
Two friends
And the summer wind 

Like painted skies, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the bright blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
That piper man
One day, it called to you
And I lost you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter winds
They have come and they have gone
And still those days
Those lonely days
They go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
To all the nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
