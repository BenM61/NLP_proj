Sittin' in the park, 
Waitin' for hooo-hoo-hoo-hoo sha-la

Waiting for you my dear 
Wondering if you ever 
Wanna show up

My darlin' I got to go 
But nevertheless I staying 
You got to be waiting 

Sittin' in the park, 
Waitin' for hooo-hoo-hoo-hoo sha-la-la 

Sitting here on the bench 
With my back against the fence 
Wonderin'-a-if I 
Have any sense 

Something tells me I'm a fool 
Let you treat me so cruel 
But nevertheless I say again

Sittin' in the park,

Sittin' in the park, 
Waiting for hooo-hoo-hoo-hoo sha-la-la 

Sittin' here on the bench 
With my back against the fence 
Wonderin-a-if I 
Have any sense 

Something tells me I'm a fool 
Let you treat me so cruel 
Nevertheless I say it 
You gotta be waiting 

Sittin' in the park, 
Waiting for hooo-hoo-hoo-hoo
