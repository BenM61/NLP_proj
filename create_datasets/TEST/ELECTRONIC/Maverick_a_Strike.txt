Yes eyes
Pick up
Bubble that, yeah
When I come again to take away the pain
Lift up your heart
When I come again to drive away the pain
Lift up your art - I must know
If it ain't of no flower dew
It sure ain't for you
Lift up your art
If it ain't of no flower dew
It'll sure make you blue
Lift up your art
If you don't know
Which way the wind is blowing
Wicked gravity
If you don't know by now
You may never know
When I come again to drive away the pain
Lift up your art
If it ain't of optimism
I will pay no attention
If you should know
I really need you
You would overcome
