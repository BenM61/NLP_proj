Hello there my it's been a long time
How am I doin'? Well, I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
It ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
What if I remember that's the same thing that you told me it was lonely yes
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you somewhere around
You don't know, you'll never know, we don't know, you can't know when
I'll be back in town
Maybe tomorrow, please remember
What I told you, told you, that entire time you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time slips away

Oh, what I want you to do is just remember, just remember, what I told you
And time, time, you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

One day I want you to do
Just remember, remember, what I told you
And time, time
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slipped away

It's the same thing, same thing, that you told me
It seems like just the other day
It ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

It's a funny thing about the time
It's funny baby, how time slips away
