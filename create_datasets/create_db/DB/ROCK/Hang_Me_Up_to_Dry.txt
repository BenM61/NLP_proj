Careless in our summer clothes splashing around
In the muck and the mire
Careless in our summer clothes splashing around
In the muck and the mire

Fell asleep with stains
Cake deep in the knees
What a pain

Now hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Now hang me up to dry
I'm pearly like the whites
The whites of your eyes

All mixed up in the wash
Hot water bleeding our colors
All mixed up in the wash
Hot water bleeding our colors

Now hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Now hang me up to dry
I'm pearly like the whites
The whites of your eyes

Now hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Now hang me up to dry
I'm pearly like the whites
The whites of your eyes

Now hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Now hang me up to dry
I'm pearly like the whites
The whites of your eyes
