Please stop pretending we're not the same
That you don't feel no pain when I know
And don't try to turn away, cover up when you're afraid
Don't be afraid, 'cause I know

Sometimes it's hard to tell
That it's ok, yes, it's ok, baby, with me

You can cry, baby, it's alright
Let them fall and I'll dry your eyes
Don't you feel no shame, 'cause I love your weakness
You can cry, baby, it's alright
When you hurt, you don't have to hide
Just let down your guard, 'cause I love your weakness
Baby, you weakness, I love your weakness

So feel safe, and know you can speak your mind
Put all your pride aside, 'cause I know
When things get too hard to take, just give into my embrace
And I'll keep you safe, 'cause I know

Did the world disappoint you, babe
Leave you sold, took your innocence away
Let me compensate, I'll be there if it falls apart, let me in
If you open your heart, just let me in, 'cause, baby, I know
