They say the blacker the berry the swweter the juice 
(I'm be a twix that's in diguise) 
I'll oil my body just for you 
(baby my nature  let it rise) 
Love to see the expression on your face 
(you're tellin' me girl it's feelin' good) 
while I'm makin' you wet all over the place 
(place I knew  I knew you would) 
In this chocolate mood 

Chorus 

There ain't nothin'  nothin' like a chocolate man 
to putyou in the modd 
said it once and i'll say it twice 
ain't nothin' like (oh there ain't nothing like) 

A chocolate mood 
There ain't nothin', nothin' like a chocolate man 
To get you in the mood said it once and i'll say it twice 
ain't nothin' like (oh there ain't nothing like) 
a chocolate mood 

Baby lick on my navel 
here let me put you on my pool table 
shoot the black ball in the pocket 
(baby, hold on to me) 
Doesn't make sense to me, 
how could you be so damn sexy 
and while you're on top of me, makin' me do the nasty 
It's chocolate 

Chorus 

Bridge 

I got it baby 
if you want it girl 
so come and get with me 
finger lickin' good 
so better stay a while 
cause I'm gonna get with you 
there's a lot of thngs we can do tonight 
I'm down to try anything you like 
I'mve got a chocolate hand 
baby, I'm the candy man 
and I'll be your best friend 

Chorus
