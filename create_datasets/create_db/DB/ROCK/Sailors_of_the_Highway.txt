Sailors of the highway, come to me in my dreams

Sailors of the highway, come to me in my dreams
G...d...
I might look you in the face but
Cmaj7...d7...
Lifes not what it seems

G...
Sailors of the highway, come to me and be my friend
C...b...bb...g...
Sailors of the highway, come to me and be my friend
D...
Swing like a willow but
Cmaj7...d7...
My soul she wont bend

G...
Sailors of the highway, cloak me in midnight rags
C...b...bb...g...
Dress me in the vineyards of the changeable witch of new york
D...
And I see like the blind and
Cmaj7...d7...
They will play the highmoon(? ) talk , wow

G...
Baby of the highway take me to the unknown sea
...c...b...bb...g.
For I'll kiss you and caress you and make you look-a just like me
D...
Then the lions of the night will drop
Cmaj7...d7...
You and set you free
