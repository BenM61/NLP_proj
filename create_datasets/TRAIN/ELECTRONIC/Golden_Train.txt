Just like a star that can't be seen from your city at night
You can't build a wall as high, as deep, as mountains have climbed
'cuz these aren't owned, and never will be
So keep going on replacing each
Until the lonely shores retreat
And oceans will find

It happens all the time
An old design that can't be traced
Or shown on walls to contemplate
If ever there was only one escape route 
Past the golden train

(you're never lonely) moving through the plains
(never home) ever since it came
(it's just getting harder) we've been living strange
(never alone) and I've forgotten time

As soon as the ghosts return from sleep
There's nothing alive
'cuz you made the roads and mazes deep
For all you can hide
A treasure to keep 
And never be shared 
To breathe in a fortune as an heir 
Until the moon and sun can meet
They'll follow you blind

A never-ending sight
The new recruit to end the war
Has soldiers with, they're sending more
(it happens all the time)
The cavalry is making sure
No one can stop the golden train

(you're never lonely) moving through the plains
(never home) ever since it came
(it's just getting harder, harder, haaa) we've been living strange
(never alone) and I've forgotten time
(it happens all the time)

Lines are built and rails can carry you 
(it happens all the time)
Animals are scared and run from men
(it happens all the time)
(girl: there's no need to ever think again)
No one can stop the golden train 

Never lonely 
(lines are built and rails can carry you)
Never be home
(girl: lines are built and rails can carry you)
(past those who surely bury you)
It's just getting harder, harder, haa
(girl: past those who would surely bury you)
Never alone
(animals are scared and run from men)
Travel lonely
Never be home 
(girl: animals are scared and run from men)
(crossed the seas to never think again)
It's just getting harder, harder, haa
Never alone
(girl: crossed the seas to never think again)

It happens all the time
