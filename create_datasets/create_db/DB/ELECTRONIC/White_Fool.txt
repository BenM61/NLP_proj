Rothai an t'saoil ag casadh leo
Nil imeacht uaidh go deo
Daoine corr an t'saoil ag goid leo
Ni cuma leo go foill

The wheels of the world keep on turning
It's inevitable
The corrupt people of this world keep on stealing
Yet, they don't care

White fool come to a new land
There's a dark moon on the sand
Then nothing was ever the same again
This land is in their hands

A thousand years of tribe land
Strong winds carry the pulse
Greed and lust it stripped the earth bare
When the white fool came to a new land

Cries of an anthem
Craite
Of fury and unrest
Tuirseach
Fix your eyes to the sound
Eist leo
Of the horizon

Rothai an t'saoil ag casadh leo
Nil imeacht uaidh go deo
Daoine corr an t'saoil ag troid leo
Ni cuma leo go foill

The wheels of the world keep on turning
Its inevitable
The corrupt people of this world keep on fighting
Yet, they don't care

White fool come to a new land
There's a dark moon on the sand
Then nothing was ever the same again
This land is in their hands

A thousand years of tribe land
Strong winds carry the pulse
Greed and lust it stripped the earth bare
When the white fool came to a new land

The three tribesman
Bhi'os acu
Are a t sean doigh
Eist leo
