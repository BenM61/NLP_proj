Hard times, walking in the sunshine
Crawling through a landslide
Guilty of some old crimes
Clear eyes, can't avoid the searchlight
Hope that they don't find me
Find me where I'm lying

Scars, bone and blood
Iron, clay and mud
Can I find my way
Can I mine my way
Through the core of emotion

Dumpsite, out along the roadside
Look into the cold sky
Look into your mind's eye
Midnight, can't escape the searchlight
Hope that they don't catch me
Catch me where I'm riding

Scars, bone and blood
Iron, clay and mud
Gonna find my way
Gonna mine my way
Through the floor of the ocean
