Been there done that messed around,
I'm having fun don't put me down
I'll never let you 
Sweep me off my feet.

I won't let you in again, 
The messages I've tried to send,
My information's just not going in.

Burning bridges shore to shore,
I'll break away from something more
I'm not to not to love
Until it's cheap.

Been there done that messed around
I'm having fun don't put me down,
I'll never let you 
Sweep me off my feet.

This time baby I'll be bulletproof,
This time baby I'll be bulletproof.

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something 
When it's dead.

Do do do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are heard
There's certain things 
That should be left unsaid.

Tick tick tick tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh baby, your time is running out.

I won't let you turn around 
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do
Is fill me up with doubt.

This time baby I'll be bulletproof,
This time baby I'll be bulletproof.
This time baby I'll be bulletproof,
This time baby I'll be bulletproof.

This time I'll be bulletproof
This time I'll be bulletproof
This time I'll be bulletproof

(Instrumental)

This time baby I'll be bulletproof,
This time baby I'll be bulletproof.
This time baby I'll be bulletproof,
This time baby I'll be bulletproof.
