Stuck on the dark side 
Reaching for daylight 
Nothing wrong with alright 
But that ain't me 
I make suggestions 
Answers to questions 
All that they told me 
Was let it be 

'Cause all my life 
You know I was dreaming about 
About a way to find a way out 
You know you know 
They can't hold me down 
I said a man ain't a meant to fly 
But I'm reaching up for the sky 
You know you know 
You can't hold me down 

There's obstacles in my life 
But I just can't seem to do right 
But I keep trying 

It seems like they wanna knock me down 
But still I rise 
It wont happen this time 
Noo owahhh 
I've made up my mind

Mountain in my way 
I can't lie 
At times they seem to high 
But still I climb 

I told them I wont stop til 
I reach the other side 
They don't get to decide 
I've made up my mind

Nothing stays the same 
Everything's meant to change 
See I'm meant to be free 
So take your chains off me

I'm gonna turn it around 
Nothing can stop me now 
Some things aren't meant to be 
This time it's about me
