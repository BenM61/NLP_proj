We gonna run now

You wanna worship it's feelings
The ones who's squeezing the shame from every man
If mama says it's dinner time, if she ruins your love, run away
So you live in a prison, oh so you're wasting your life
Oh on a system you never will understand
Are you the one I dreamed of, man

Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Mama's alright she said she didn't want your love
Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Joni's alright she said she didn't want your love, yeah

Won't you walk down the main street
Take the bridge over never ending rails
And even if you're falling down
That's an open door to the outside world
So you live in a bubble, so you're wasting your life
Oh on a system you never will understand
Are you the one I dreamed of man

Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Mama's alright she said she didn't want your love
Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Joni's alright she said she didn't want your love, hey, hey

You can drive to the east cost, disappear for a while
I put the band-echo on, then we'll give him a ride
Are you the one I dreamed of man

Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Mama's alright she said she didn't want your love
Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Joni's alright she said she didn't want your

Love, she got away
Whoa, yeah, she got away
Whoa she got away
Whoa she got away
Whoa she got away
Whoa she got away
Whoa she got away
Whoa she got away
