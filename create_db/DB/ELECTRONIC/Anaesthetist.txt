Doctor, fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist, so when I go under the knife I believe in this

You fucking spanner
Just a cog in the industry, you're part blind
You shared your blood from the convicted
You parasite!
You play god and you don't care who it affects
You suck the blood of the afflicted
You suck the blood of the afflicted

Illness is not an indulgence which you should pay for
Nor is it a crime for which you should be punished
For this conviction I would endanger my health
Shut it! Oi!
Just 'cause you break bridges and lust for fame
No you won't see us participating in that game
Keep it twisted, take the success
'Cause all I really want is what's beating in your chest

Doctor, fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist, so when I go under the knife I believe in this
Fetch the Anaesthetist (Anaesthetist)

We drink to your health
But just one thought
This round's on you
And every day you roll the dice
We drink to your health
We capitalise on your condition
Bad luck, you pay the price
Bad luck
You pay the price

Fetch the Anaesthetist
(Anaesthetist)
Fetch the Anaesthetist
I wanna go under the knife I believe in this

You sold us short
You will not profit off our health
Step the f*ck back
