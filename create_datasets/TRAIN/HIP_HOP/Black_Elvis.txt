Yeah! 
For the 2000 (2000) 
Black Elvis (Black Elvis) 
We get raw with this (hand me my guitar) 
Tour bus packed (tour bus packed) 

Black Elvis  recordin in the 48 track studio 
Madison Square Garden soundcheck  to speak direct 
Fans in the upper level  backstage passes 
Wearin diamonds around my glasses  leather coat 
Thirty thousand from Wilson  countin the mill's 
I'm talkin to Andre Harrell with a chaffeur drivin me around 
in the green Rolls Royce, parked parallel, on Fifth Avenue 
Steppin in Bloomingdale's, waitin for Celine Dion to get her nails done 
Tour dates start tomorrow, MCI send the cash through Wells Fargo 
Black Elvis, 28 G's a night 
Tour bus with the Motley Crue, who gon' stop who? 
Rock star don't need no tattoo 
Guitar out of the sharp, Fender bass with the Stratocaster 
With Prodigy, Rage Against the Machine, flyin over the Atlantic ocean 
with the potion 


Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway 
What y'all thinkin about? 
Black Elvis, rock star, walkin down Broadway 
Chillin in the project hallway 

(repeat 1.5X)
(repeat 1.5X)
(repeat 1.5X)
(repeat 1.5X)
(repeat 1.5X)

Tour bus, painted neon green with black wheels 
We do big wheels, count big head Franklin bills 
Movin up that's when I'm Black Elvis at the Civic Center 
Promoter book venues that are too small, ignore the call 
Seventy thousand jam packed arenas 
with rock fans wearin backpacks 
Merchandise sell nice gold shirts with red lights 
Sponsored by Dial soap and a Heineken 
The biggest rock star gon' rhyme again 
Roadie cases for eight months, Samsonite suitcases 
Rappers comin home with no money on the red eye with dead eyes 
Stadium tickets, watch scalpers get wicked 
Pull up in my limo ejecting your demo (your demo) 
Stretch lamborghinis with four doors, with four floors 
Followin right behind yours, basic Continental 
Get out your rental before I get mental 
(Yeah baby) 


(Kool Keith) 
Huge signs on highways, you see the biggest advertisements 
I meant to man the bombs off and skip my next assignment 
Walk in the Sony building, grab checks 
Stop in a Hilton, Warner Brothers Chap' on the back 
of my royalty statements, my name is Matthew 
Three apartments on the West with 200 songs 
Five minutes each on Ampex reels 
At the Shark Bar chewin billionaire meals 
At the Apollo, can you digest? 
I'm a hard act to swallow 
With a Paris France with a real estate agent 
that's building me a kid's playground in Denver, Colorado 
Vacation unknown when I'm speakin 3-way with Roberto Duran 
and Sugar Ray Leonard on the cellular phone 
Upstate Connecticut, hold you rap style with a better grip 
(I'm a rock star now)
