I can see a point where all our futures meet.
Where we are going, and every place we feel.
Through all the static, I hear you calling.
Please switch yourself off, don't keep me holding on.

Sad as fire, 
It's your take to my mind.
Now you have to go.

I could be a soldier, 
I could be a humanoid.
I could be an ion far away from home.
I wanna feel you closer to me.
I wanna hold you in my arms.
I want to be a part of everything
I want to be a part! 

Fear that I see.
Fear that I see.
Fear that I see.
Fear that I see.
