There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'
You gotta keep it beatin' for all the hoppin' cretins

Cretin, cretin
I'm gonna go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop doin' the Cretin Hop
Cretin, cretin

One-two-three-four, cretins want to hop some more
Four-five-six-seven, all good cretins go to heaven

There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'
You gotta keep it beatin' for all the hoppin' cretins

Cretin, cretin
I'm gonna go for a whirl with my cretin girl
My feet won't stop doin' the Cretin Hop
Cretin, cretin

One-two-three-four, cretins want to hop some more
Four-five-six-seven, all good cretins go to heaven
