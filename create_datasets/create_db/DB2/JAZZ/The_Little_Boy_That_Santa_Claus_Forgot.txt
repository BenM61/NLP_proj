He's the little boy that Santa Claus forgot
And goodness knows, he didn't want a lot
He sent a note to Santa 
For some soldiers and a drum 
It broke his little heart 
When he found Santa hadn't come 
In the street he envies all those lucky boys
Then wanders home to last year's broken toys
I'm so sorry for that laddie
He hasn't got a daddy
The little boy that Santa Claus forgot

You know, Christmas comes but once a year for every girl and boy 
The laughter and the joy they find in each brand new toy
I'll tell you of a little boy that lives across the way
This little fella's Christmas is just another day
He's the little boy that Santa Claus forgot
And goodness knows, he didn't want a lot 

In the street he envies all those lucky boys 
Then wanders home to last year's broken toys
I'm so sorry for that laddie
He hasn't got a daddy
The little boy that Santa Claus forgot
