It's like candy
I can feel it when you walk
Even when you talk it takes over me
You're so dandy
I want to know
Can you feel it too just like I do
(Hoo!)

This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you
There's no mistaking, I'm clearly taken
By the simple mere thought of you
(Oh!)

This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
(Hoo!)

My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you
(Yes I do)

Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy
(Real shy)

I attempt to look my best for you
(Indeed I do, just for you)
'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do

It's like candy
You sure are sweet
You're so dandy
You're taking my appetite, but it's all right
It's like candy
(Ooh, vanilla! Chocolate!)
You look real nice, wrapped up tight
You're so dandy
You're giving me a heart attack
It's the kind I like
It's like candy, you're so dandy

You're like a brand new feeling
In a special way
A surprise package
On a bright clear sunny day
Strawberry! Raspberry!

All those good thangs!
Violets and gumdrops
That's what you're saying to me
(Ow!)
