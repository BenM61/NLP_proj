Ooh-ooh
Hey, hey, my-my-my-my
Black pearl, precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong
Black pearl, pretty little girl
You've been in the background much too long

You've been workin' so hard your whole life through
Tending other peoples houses, raising up their children too
Hey, how bout something for me and you?
Here in my arms you're gonna reign supreme
No more serving, baby, they're gonna serve my queen
It's our turn for happiness and our day has come
Living for each other and answering to no one

Black pearl, precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong because I love you
Black pearl, pretty little girl
You've been in the background much too long
Together we'll stand so straight and so tall
Created by love to love one and all, hey
Heart-to-heart, soul-to-soul
No other one could ever take your place
My world is built around the very smile that's on your face
You'll never win a beauty show, no, they won't pick you
But you're my Miss America and I love you

Black pearl, precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong, I will lead you
Black pearl, pretty little girl
You've been in the background much too long

Ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah, my-my-my-my-my baby
You know I need you, you know I want you, want you for myself
I don't want nobody else, oh babe I love you, you know I need you
You know I got to-got to-got to have you
Come on baby, come on, come on and be my baby
You know I love you, ooh-ooh
Be mine, nobody else have you, come on baby love
Ah, I love you, and I need you and I want you, want you for myself
Come on baby, I love you, hey-hey-hey
I really need you baby love and I want you
