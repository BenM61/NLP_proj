I'd like to dedicate this right here 
To my favorite girl 
I know I haven't been the most perfect man ever 
But I love you 
God knows I do 

Oh yeah 
Why, why
What's wrong with your shady ass 
Your waking me up early in the mornin' still yawning 
Don't you know a nigga half sleep 
So why the hell you keep on paging me 
I told you once before 
I'm goin' say it once again don't you call no mo' 
My girl is lying next to me 
Do you think this is a game 
Why you testing me 
You keep on stressing me 
 
Can't keep calling me 
All night long just constantly 
Interrupting can't you see 
I'm with my favorite girl 
What's that shit you on 
Talkin' 'bout my baby's Mom 
She's here laying in my arms 
She is my favorite girl 

I saw you around my way 
Riding by my crib just the other day 
The order of protection was restraining me 
I couldn't take the chance of someone naming me 
You tryna' frame me 
Leave me alone 
Callin' me and hanging up cause wifey is home 
How did you get my number in the first place 
Cause it ain't even listed under my name 

You call me 
And your telling me 
That you wantin' me 
And you needin' me 
Cause you lonely 
And you can't see 
How I could be with another 
B I T C H
And that she could never be my wifey 
Why can't you see it wasn't meant for you to be with me 
(Your so damn crazy girl) 
Your crazy girl to think that I would ever leave my baby 
My lady 
The only one 
Who was there for me 
Who cared for me 
My destiny 
Who knows the things that's best for me 
But you can't see 
It's ecstasy 
Will always mean the world to me
