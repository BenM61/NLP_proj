Rustling of the leaves used to be my lullaby
In the sunny South when I was a tot so high
And now that I have grown
And myself alone

Cradle me where Southern skies
Can watch me with a million eyes
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

Cover me with heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song thru the trees
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
That fine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me, I've heard it before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, that's Southland

Don't I feel it in my soul
And don't I know I've reached my goal
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the Leaves
