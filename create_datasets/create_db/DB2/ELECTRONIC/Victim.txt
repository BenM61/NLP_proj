Let me play
I've been dying to let you win
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take if from me
I wonder
But the less I get the more I give
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take if from me

I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes to see
I want someone to notice me

I wanna be the only victim
I wanna be the only victim

No regrets, even if it's all I get
It's all I wanna be
So won't you take it from me
It still hurts
It's never easy to forget
Do I wanna be
What you never asked me

I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes on me
I want your eyes
I want your eyes to see
I want you to notice me

I wanna be the only victim
I wanna be the only victim

I'm right here
I'm right here

I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here

So come and get me!

So come and get me!

I wanna be the only victim
I wanna be the only victim
I wanna be the only victim
I wanna be the only victim
