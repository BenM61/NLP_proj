(Ladies and gentlemen)
Let's make it funky

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
Hey yo
Dizzy Gillespie plays a sax
Me, myself, I love to max
Redbone booties I'm out to wax
Stick up kids is out to tax
Spring again, and I'm feelin fine
Pass me an ice-cold glass of wine
So I can get mellow
Lay back, and let my girl play the cello
Hello
I hate Jell-O
Let me be me, relax in my tipi
Watch a hardy boy mystery
Greg N-i-see-e
I'm nitro
And I'm hype, so
Don't ever believe
That you can deceive me
See many visions of love and splendor
I'm the real thing, not like a pretender
I rock rhymes over beats on the real tip
Stay real strong and hang on like a vise grip
Use my mind to control all my body parts
Got an early start, plus I'm very smart
Type of man that the girls want to read about
Indeed I proceed to rock the house without a doubt
Steppin up next, no further ado
Smooth be	 is gonna make it real funky for you

[ CHORUS: Pure Blend ]
	I'm gonna make it real funky for you

[ VERSE 2: Smooth be	 ]
Smooth be	, notorious, glorious
Knowledge is infinite, I live in a fortress
I'm so astronomical, yet on a physical plane
My body's just a shell, in control is my brain
I strain to gain spirituality
So I can finally be in unity
Harmony with the all eye-seeing
Supreme being
Knower of histories and mysteries
I'm mystic, also stylistic
Not materialistic, simplistic
Humble while others tumble, stumble
Smooth be	, not Bumble
Rumble, no, that's not likely
That's in my old 'school daze' like Spike Lee
Smooth be	, my rhymes get better with time
I should get an endorsement for creating fresh lines
And as I grow older, lyrics get hyper
Cause I'm a dominant black pied piper
Spreadin peace and love throughout my travels
And take time to read and unravel
Day to day problems, and then solve
Them, I can see clearly now as I revolve
Around suckers
Who perpetrate heroes
But I'm no sandwich
More like a manwich
Or maybe like a meal
Which is much more real
Than Clark Kent or the Man of Steel
Teddy Tedd, a hip-hop ambassador
Keepin you on the floor, givin you more and more
His cuts exquisite, what is it? A blizzard
The musical wizard you should come visit
The man in the back, without further ado
Teddy Tedd is gonna make it real funky for you

	I'm gonna make it real funky for you
Let's make it funky
Greg Nice makes it funky
Smooth be	 makes it funky
Teddy Tedd makes it funky
Special K makes it funky
DJ Doc makes it funky
And the Blend made it funky
