When I first thought to hobo'in, hobo'in
I took a freight train to be my friend, oh Lord
You know I hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd
Hobo'd a long, long way from home, oh Lord

You know my mother, she followed me that mornin', me that mornin', that mornin'
She followed me down to the yard, oh Lord

She said, "my son he's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Yes, he's gone in a poor some wear, oh Lord"

Yes, I left my dear old mother, dear old mother, dear old mother
I left my honor, need a crime, oh Lord

You know I hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd
Hobo'd a long, long way from home, oh Lord
