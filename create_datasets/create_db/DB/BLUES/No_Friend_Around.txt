Yes, I want my body buried.
Way down in Jackson, Tennessee.
Want my body buried now, people.
Way down in Jackson, Tennessee.

Don't you know-ooh, T.B. is killin' me.
Don't you know, don't you know
T.B. is killin' me.
Say, I was on my bed of affliction.

I didn't even have a friend aound.
On my bed of affliction
Didn't even have a friend around.
No, I didn't!

Yes, I lay down cryin', cryin' to the good Lord above.
I said, 'Lord, have mercy'
'Have mercy Lord, if you please.'
I said, 'Ain't gonna cry no more.'

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.
