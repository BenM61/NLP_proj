Get out from that kitchen
And rattle those pots and pans
Get out from that kitchen
And rattle those pots and pans
Well, roll my breakfast
'Cause I'm a hungry man

I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
Well, you'll never do nothing
To save your doggone soul

Wearing those dresses
Your hair done up so nice
Wearing those dresses
Your hair done up so nice
You look so warm
But your heart is cold as ice

I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
Well, you'll never do nothing
To save your doggone soul

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peeping in a sea food store
I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peeping in a sea food store
I can look at you
'Til you don't love me no more

I believe you're doing me wrong
And now I know
I believe you're doing me wrong
And now I know
The more I work
The faster my money goes

I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
I said, shake, rattle, and roll
Well, you'll never do nothing
To save your doggone soul

Shake, rattle, and roll
