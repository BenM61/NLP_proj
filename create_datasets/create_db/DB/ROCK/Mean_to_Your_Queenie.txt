Well I woke up this morning, and I was by myself
My closet was empty, there was nothing on my shelf
A note say daddy you might be good, but you ain't been too wise
Now you're on your own, and you should not be surprised

You been (You been to your queenie)
Ya didn't show her no respect
You been (You been to your queenie)
What the hell did you expect
Oh, noo

Been a fool

What happened to my car, where is all my money
My friend say I've been askin' for it, and they all think it's funny
I can't get no sympathy, no matter where I go
Even my momma and papa tellin' me, "They told me so"

You Been (You been to your queenie)
Ya didn't show her no respect
You Been (You been to your queenie)
What the hell did you expect
Oh, noo

Mm Mm

Well I seen you out messin', 
You been gone for a week
Your old lady gonna cut you man, 
And bust you in the cheek
Her veins are stickin' out, 
She's turning mighty red
Once she gets a hold on you, 
You'll wish that you was dead

You Been (You been to your queenie)
Ya didn't show her no respect
You Been (You been to your queenie)
What the hell did you expect
Oh, no
