When my home is, so far away;
And I miss you, so bad it hurts;
When I feel like, I've lost my way;
I know where to go to quench my thirst;

[Chorus]
Back to the well for a drink of cool, cool water;
Back to the arms where my heart first fell,
Back to the place my loving cup runs over,
Back to my love, back to the well

Cross the ocean, and around the world;
I've logged a million, country miles;
But I always come back to the girls,
Who makes it all worth while

[Chorus: x 2]

Back to my love, back to the well
