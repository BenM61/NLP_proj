I think I dream about you
Most of the time.
What can I say? Hey, Hey.
But I don't see you much.
It's only once in a while.
I want to know what you feel.
I used to hang around
Being the toast of the town.
But it's strange how your friends
Can sometimes let you fall down.
But you
And everyone in the world can see
That I'm for real, honey.
See, I don't know how to fool your heart.
I just know what I know and what I know is...

I will treat you right.
Cause little darlin'
You've got to be mine.
I see your love light.
We'll have a beautiful time.
All night.

I think about you; you're so fine.
It just might work out
If I treat you right.
I want to keep you close to the heart.
What can I say? Hey, hey.
So I know, you will never ever, never go far.
Cause I can feel if it's real.
Though your friends say they still doubt me
They don't know of the you I see.
And I don't know how to do you wrong.
I just know what I know and what I know is...

I will treat you right.
Cause little darlin'
You've got to be mine.
I see your love light.
We'll have a beautiful time.
All night.

You and everyone in the world can see
That I'm for real, honey.
I don't know how to fool your heart.
I just know what I know and what I know is...

I will treat you right.
Cause little darlin'
You've got to be mine.
I see your love light.
We'll have a beautiful time.
All night.
