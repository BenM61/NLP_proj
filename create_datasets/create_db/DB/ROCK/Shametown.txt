I see the world through the eyes of an idiot
Talkin' big white trash
Before the girls an boys inside of my soul
They make my path
In the mirror there I see my father's face in glass
I know I am not anyone yet too afraid to ask 

I will pawn you my watch
Pawn you my chain
Pawn you my new diamond ring
Pawn you my watch
Pawn you my chain
Pawn you yeah most anything

Get your clogs on the floor
Step up step up step up an do more 

Hey little girl is your door still open
The devil still inside
Seen your face he left the place
Took everything inside 

Hey by the way I forgot to mention
I let it just slip out
Today is the day of salvation
Ain't a gonna tell no lie 

Some through the water
Some through the flood
Some by the fire
But all through his blood
Some through the water
Some through the flood
Some by the bullet
But all through His blood
