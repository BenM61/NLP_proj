Now
All my life I've waited
And I've been afraid and
I wondered If I'd find
Someone to share my life

Every day I prayed and
Every night I searched in
Every stranger's eyes
For some kind of sign

Me and my heart wishin' in the dark
Tryin' to believe in a sky full of stars
I was waiting for you 
A million empty days, too much time and space
Every tear I cried, every lonely night 
I was waiting for you

Now here you are
And my world is, my world is so beautiful
Now here you are
And my life is, and my life is so wonderful
Now

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has, like no one ever has

Me and my heart wishin' in the dark
Tryin' to believe in a sky full of stars
I was waiting for you
All those empty days, all the time and space
Every tear I cried, every lonely night
I was waiting for you

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has, like no one ever has

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has, like no one ever has
