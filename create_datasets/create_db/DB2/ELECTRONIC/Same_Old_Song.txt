Same old song 
Welcome to my world 
Dark side of the universe 
I'll take you for a spin the mayhem begins 
The media mouth is feeding and chemical youth is screaming 
The circus starts to roll there's no turning back 
You think it's right you made your mind 

I've seen so many cross that line 
I've seen them come 
I've seen them go 
Times will never change 
It's the same old song 
The same old song 
That's playing again 
The same old song 

Your soul is burning bright 
High hopes of future sight 
Beyond the horizon lays a world that's so black 
They try to shape your mind 
And make you walk the line 
Don't let them steal your dreams 
It's all that you've got 
You start to doubt 
You change your mind 

I've seen so many cross that line 
I've seen them come 
I've seen them go 
Times will never change 
It's the same old song 
The same old song 
That's playing again 
The same old song 

Don't want to heart it no more 
Time to do this 
Time to do that 
I've got an offer 
You can't refuse it 
Just stick with 
And I'll push you 
All the way to the stars 

Can't take it no more 
The same old song 
It's playing again 
The same old song 
It's playing again 
And again and again 
The same old song
