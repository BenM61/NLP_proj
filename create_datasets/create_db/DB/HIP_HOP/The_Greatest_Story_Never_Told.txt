I rap about politicians, how money's their acquisition
To get it they gotta keep us without a pot to piss in
Strugglin' to survive, 9-to-5, ain't making it
Turn on the TV, all I see is celebs taking it
Feeling like they got all the bread but they ain't breaking it
I'm taking it as soon as I find the oven where they baking it

We was brought here to pick the cotton
Now we picking the music for massa to listen to
The clothes in which he rockin'
We don't drive a hard bargain
All we want back is crack, some more gats
And some more of that bullshit rap
The crime rhyme is still black on black
We need a leader like me to get us back on track
When y'all make them dis records do you know what you're doing to black community?
Market and promote the fact that we lack unity
Them white people look at you and laugh
You look like a porch monkey boy dancing for cash
Wanna get on a record and talk trash
See him at the awards and don't do shit but walk past

If I bust a gun in the hood I get Attica or the Cat
I bang a gat in Iraq I get a pat on the back
Best believe I know better than that
This a lesson for all my listeners ' shit ain't just regular rap
It's the greatest story that ever been spat
It's gonna teach the hood and at the same time make my pockets elephant fat
Go ahead with all the irrelevant rap
Me and my nigga Just Blaze bring the true element back
