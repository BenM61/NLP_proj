You're like a rollercoaster toast ya
In a big four-poster bed
You're such a puddin' I shouldn't I couldn't
I'm a gorilla in a wooden keg

Cruise around town with the windows down
Shake it all round to the stereo sound
Cruise around town with the windows down
Shake it all up to the summertime sound

You're like a rollercoaster toast ya 
In a big four-poster bed

Hey ba da da da da da da
Say what

Hey ba da da da da da da
Say what

Ba ba da da da da da da

Say you're like a rollercoaster toast ya 
In a big four-poster bed
You're like a rollercoaster toast ya
In a big four-poster bed

Baby, I can drive you crazy, baby
Maybe, later you can meet my old lady, baby
Baby, I can drive you crazy, baby

Maybe, later you can meet my old lady 
She dig ya

You're vine-ripened, I'm now frightened 
By the lightning in my legs
You're such a screamin' dream I'm leanin'
To the demons in my head

Cruise around town with the windows down
Shake it all round to the stereo sound
Cruise around town with the windows down
Shake it all up to the summertime sound

In a big four-poster bed
