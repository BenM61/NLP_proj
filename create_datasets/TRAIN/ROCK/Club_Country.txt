The fault is, I can find no fault in you
Assault is say it or I'll say it for you
If we stick around we're sure to be looked down upon
What better way or should I say?

Alive and kicking

Alive and kicking at the Country Club
We're old and sickening at the Country Club
A drive from nowhere leaves you in the cold
Refrigeration keeps you young I'm told
Alive and kicking at the Country Club
We're old and sickening at the Country Club
Your limitations are our every care
Every breath you breath belongs to... someone there

At all's two words could they be soldered as one
Therein lies the perfect pseudonym
To think you've learned to know someone and find
That you don't know don't know them at all

Alive and kicking

Alive and kicking at the Country Club
We're always sickening at the Country Club
A drive from nowhere leaves you in the cold
Refrigeration keeps you young I'm told
Alive and kicking at the Country Club
We're old and sickening at the Country Club
Your limitations are our every care
Every breath you breath belongs to... someone there

Sad to see that you're suffering
Work hard at being a something
Sad to see that you're suffering
Work hard at being a something
Sad to see that you're suffering
Work hard at being a something

Alive and kicking at the Country Club
We're old and sickening at the Country Club
A drive from nowhere leaves you in the cold
Refrigeration keeps you young I'm told
Alive and kicking at the Country Club
We're always sickening at the Country Club
Your limitations are our every care
Every breath you breath belongs to someone there
