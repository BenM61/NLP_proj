Now I was feeling like a total giant!
But now it feels like Silvius Brabo has sliced my hand off
and thrown it in the river!

Now I was just doing my job,
my feet sink into the bed of the Scheldt
but now my fingers are reeling about with the fishes

I know I'm not making any sense
(no you're not)
all will be revealed
(well I hope so)
all will be revealed if we travel
back in time

I've got to rest, it's for the best.
To build a nest, to take the quest.
To be given just one chance, to be
the best.

Go forth and re-colonize.

It appears the foundations
of all our great nations
are lies and indoctrinations.
So if Silvius Brabo collects the hands of giants
will you join him?
