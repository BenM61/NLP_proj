Before we ever seize the day
The calming of the season's end
Life becomes a hidden play
Imparted with a furtive glance
Was it everything you'd dreamed it'd be
Or illusions shattered into glass

World be gone
Or are you filled with loving
The way that you promised us
Long ago
And will it tie us to the mast of our souls
As in ancient lore
And as I saw you standing there
Holding your head in your hands

Though it hurts to say goodbye
Silver linings in the leaden sky
One day we'll return again
And surely we will make amends
Consequences never seen
Broken shadows on an empty screen

World be gone
Or are you filled with loving
The way that you promised us
Long ago
And will it tie us to the mast of our souls
As in ancient lore
And as I saw you standing there
Holding your head in your hands

World be gone
Or are you filled with loving
The way that you promised us
Long ago
And will it tie us to the mast of our souls
As in ancient lore
And as I saw you standing there
Holding your head in your hands
