We talked for hours of the travels
And all the beauty you had seen.
The south of France where the spring is beginning,
Sunset on the Thames from the village green.
We rolled on and on through the pages,
Of the books you'd taken from the shelf.
Unfamiliar faces and forgotten places,
Landscapes green and rich in wealth.
You've got a gypsy soul, and you love to wander.
Coast to coast to the Canadian border.
In the summer sun, yeah, yeah.
From my window you saw the ocean,
And all the changes that has been.
The south of France where the spring is beginning,
Sunset on the Thames from the village green.
