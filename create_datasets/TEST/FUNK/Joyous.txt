Throw away your troubles and leave your blues behind
Free your frustrations and have a jamming good time
Come on and clap your hands now and let yourself unwind
Everybody together in a universal mind
Get off of that ego into a higher place
Check out my music dig my magic space

The way I like it, love to see you doing your thing
The way I like it, makes me want to sing
(repeat)
