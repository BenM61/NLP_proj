Can't you see I don't need you around?
When I think of you, it brings me down
I turn my back and yawn at my door
What can I say, I don't need you no more

I wrote to you a 'Dear John' letter
I thought that it would be better
But it seems you didn't understand
Your're still thinking that you are my man

I was thinking 'bout the times we had
Some were good but most were bad
You said you loved me, oh so much
And you look shivered from my slightest touch

You go away and come back again
I thought that you were my only friend
Now I know that my love was blind
Deep down I thought you were all mine

You keep coming in and out of my life
I just can't understand why
You keep coming in and out of my life

You keep coming in and out of my life
I just can't understand why
You keep coming in and out of my life
