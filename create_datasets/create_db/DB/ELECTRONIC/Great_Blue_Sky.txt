Everything inside me
Attracts me to a great blue sky
All along they're calling
Me into a great blue sky
No more fears...
When I'm feeling lonely
I just think of a great blue sky
Everything is lovely
When you see from this great blue sky
When I'm feeling lonely
I just think of a great blue sky
Everything is lovely
When I see from this great blue sky.

No more fears
I don't know what's happening,
I don't know what's happening
Every night, all my dreams
They get me into a great blue sky
All my life is tiring
Except in this great blue sky.
No more fears
I don't know what's happening,
I don't know what's happening !
No matter what's happening
When I'm on this great blue sky.
