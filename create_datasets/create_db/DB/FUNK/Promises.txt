I knew a man
Who lied to the world
Hid from the truth
Lived a life with no rules
I knew a man
Who lied to himself
Scared of reality
Scared to ask for help

And He made promises
But they were all just lies
And he broke promises
Bringing tears to their eyes
And he made promises
That he could never ever keep
Breaking his promises
Leaving broken hearts to weep

I had a friend
Who had big dreams
Took on the world
But soon turned to scheme
I had a friend
Though he became a stranger
Hid from the world
Lived a life high on danger

And he made promises
But they were all just lies
And he broke promises
Bringing tears to their eyes
And he made promises
That he could never ever keep
Breaking his promises
Disappointment runs deep

And He made promises
But they were all just lies
And he broke promises
Bringing tears to their eyes
And he made promises
That he could never ever keep
Breaking his promises
And the bad blood runs deep
And He made promises
But they were all just lies
And he broke promises
Bringing tears to their eyes
And he made promises
That he could never ever keep
Breaking his promises
And the bad blood runs deep
