Ain't no way you bout to stop this sickness
From the deepest darkest part of Missouri
Psycho alpha skitzo get ya chest, ya diggin' me
A-be	-S-O-L-you-T-E P-O-W-E-are see me clownin'
Look at all you playa hatas frownin
Raw, God said kill 'em all, Tech's backs to the wall 
Fightin' for my life and I'ma bust back 'til they fall
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin one-eight-seven you trippin wit Strange
I'm really real wit it, like my homie AJ say deal wit it
Pushin' and pullin' fightin' for the meal ticket
In a minute I'ma do it like a villain 
I'ma get 'em in the middle of a bomb
Put 'em on the spot 
Till the funk go pop and they'll never have other calm
Tech Nizzle, when I'm fizzle this who be you
Rollin wit Dave Trap, Violet Brown, and 3DQ, hootie hoo
For those not knowin' Missouli true
I'ma tell you like the Swedish would say it, "Sig Min Kuk"

[Chorus]
Absolute Power! That's the only way to roll
Absolute Power! They love us everywhere we go
Absolute Power! Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute Power, Absolute Power
Absolute Power! That's the only way to roll
Absolute Power! They love us everywhere we go
Absolute Power! Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute Power, Absolute Power

I do hip hop and I mix it wit the hard rock
'Cause I'm in this rhyming for climbing
Tech N9ne he's unwinding the shining is blinding
Greedy so we constantly grinding
I been in the game sixteen years makin' rap tunes
Raisin hella havoc up in the classroom
Now in '02 you can watch me clownin' and diamonds shining
Watchin' DVD's on the Hoshitoshi (It's all Jesus)
Now I keep the crowds pumpin' they jumpin'
Get back to the telly we rollin' and stickin' somethin'
Racin' to the main line 
Absolute Power is havin' Halle Berry & Juliette Lewis at the same time
O!, that's how Strange niggas run
Listen to the villain wit a kinda sociated tongue
(We're close to the end) but not done
The Tech's just begin begun beginning to begin to have fun
The curse is tryin' to put me in the hearse
But I will not tumble first things first 
Talk a lot of shit and I can't take more
F*ck Jay Ferus and everybody down wit him and f*ck JCOR

[Chorus]

Thanks to Strange Muzik I'm comin'
And all my enemies they runnin'
Now all my hatas bummin' 'cause I was summoned
We Kansas City playas and we bout sold game
We make it so Tecca Nina is a household name
How many point you got, I got 50
Here's a question to the Cencorship Committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
My villains are gritty 
Big Scoob, Texas, Will, Bakari, rest in piece Short Nitty
Growl wit the evil ways, power what the people say 
Rebel yellin we're felons and my pockets are swellin'
This beats from Berlin Germany
Throwin' up MizzIzzy so ain't no other city concernin' me
I teach it and I speak very loosely 
Stamina gunnin' got playa hatas runnin' profusely 
Now I got the parents pissed and ready to noose me
'Cause they know that Absolute Power corrupts, absolutely!!

[Chorus]
