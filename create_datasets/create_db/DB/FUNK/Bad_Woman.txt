Bad woman, mad woman
Satisfy the man
Bad woman, mad woman

Every time that I see lovers
Look into each others eyes
I realize the best of my life was you
Now I left you with the blues
Or what we put each other through
Girl, we let good love blow away like sand

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I call your name
You're the only one
To ever satisfy the man

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I see your face
Girl, I reach for you
But only time's been spent

Hurry, now your plane is leaving
I'm not a fool in believing
You won't be there
Waitin' on the other side

Girl, I've had love and laughter
It's your love that I'm after
Two wrongs never make it right

Love will heal us
Love will make it right

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I call your name
You're the only one
To ever satisfy the man

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I see your face
Girl, I reach for you
But only time's been spent

Hurry, now your plane is leaving
I'm not a fool in believin'
That you won't be there
Waitin' on the other side

Girl, I've had love and laughter
It's your love that I'm after
Two wrongs never make it right

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I call your name
You're the only one
To ever satisfy the man

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I'll see your face
Girl, I reach for you
But only time's been spent

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless night I'll call your name
'Cause you're the only one to satisfy the man
Bad woman, mad woman
You know it's not about you, you're not there
And I wonder where you are

Bad woman, mad woman, yeah
Each night I'll call your name
And I wonder where you are
Bad woman, mad woman, bad woman
I will wait for you every night

Shed a tear in the middle of the night
Feel around, look around but you're not there
You're not there, anywhere to be found
You bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad woman

Bad, bad, bad woman, bad woman
Satisfy the man
