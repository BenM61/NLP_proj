In my heyday 
Young men wrote to me 
Everybody seemed to have time to devote to me 
Everyone I saw all swore they knew me 
Once upon a song 
Main attraction, couldn't buy a seat 
The celebrity, celebrities were dying to meet 
I've had every accolade bestowed on me 
And so you see 

If I never sing another song 
It wouldn't bother me 
I had my share of fame 
You know my name 

If I never sing another song 
Or take another bow 
I would get by, but I'm not sure how 

Always posing, but you love it all 
Though you have to learn to act like you're above it all 
Everything I did the world applauded 
Once upon a star 

Framed citations, hung on every wall 
Got a scrapbook full of quotes, I can recall them all 
There were times I felt the world belonged to me 
And so you see 

If I never sing another song 
It wouldn't bother me 
I had my share of fame 
You know my name 

If I never sing another song 
Or take another bow 
I would get by, but I'm not sure how 
But I'm not sure how 
But I'm not sure how
