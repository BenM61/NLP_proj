I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
(Get it?)

I keep calling, keep hauling, keep calling them back
I can't stand, can't stand, can't stand this attack
This neuron buzz is on another level
I'm on thin ice, I'm dancing with the devil
Can't sleep with the noise in this house
But you can't beat the allure of this now
I can't sleep with the noise in this house
Why won't they pipe it down?

I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
I want to live outside, live outside of all of this

I keep taming, keep training, keep taming the horse
But it's wild, it's feral and it's running it's course
Patiently madness waits in line
In the reception room of my mind
Waiting for the thought to be left
Unattended and open for an unwanted guest
And it's so busy I'd be surprised if I even noticed

I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
I want to live outside, live outside of all of this
I want to live outside, live outside of all of this

No, they don't even know about us
They don't even know about us
No, they don't even know about us

I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this now

I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this
I'm gonna live outside, live outside of all of this now
