I can go one day without calling
Two days without bawling
Three days without missing
But a lifetime of no kissing you
Is something that I just can't do
I wish I could be there 
To share the moon

I got more back for the breaking
More callous for making
A lifetime for the aching
I got no need to run this battery down
I'm just trying to get the stains out
I wish I could be there 
To share the moon

Hey la la
I'm gonna love to you till it hurts
I don't mind if I do
Hey la la
I'm gonna love you till it works
I've got no mind to lose

Theres one trash heap burning
Fireflies are returning
Nightfall is softly chirping
One trailer light is staying on till dawn
I wonder who it's waiting on

I wish I could be there
To share the moon

Hey la la
I'm gonna love to you till it hurts
So don't mind if I do
Hey la la
I'm gonna love you till it works
I've got no mind to lose
