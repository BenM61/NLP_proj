Time to lighten up?
I don't plan to
I don't plan to
Time I've given up
I don't plan to
I don't plan to

Every eye is on us
Every side is on us
"Sing it with pride and promise, never cry
Never cry, but you know we like it honest
You know that's why we bought you
I like your style and all
But do it right
Do it in time"

Time to lighten up?
I don't plan to
I don't plan to

Time I've given up
I don't plan to
I don't plan to

I need it, I love it
The music, the time it takes for the letter to write back
Let it go
Let it go, 'cause this is the final product
Drink it a while and call us
Sell it for dimes and dollars
There you go

Time to lighten up?
I don't plan to
I don't plan to

Time I've given up
I don't plan to
I don't plan to
