She want me, no

Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you say what you want
You howl and wail like a banshee
Still your mind won't ever let you say
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you say what you want
My little tired devotee
Your mind won't even let you feel

Quivering now, shivering now, withering
Your mind won't let you say that you're wondering now
Pondering now, hungering
Won't let you say that you're questioning
Wavering, weakening
You mind won't let you say that you're hearkening
Listening, heeding me now
Won't let you say that you want

Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you have what you want
I feel your hunger to taste me
Still your mind won't ever let you say
Your kind is just the type that should use me
But your mind won't seem to let you have
The opportunity to abuse me, abuse me
Your mind won't even let you feel

Quivering now, shivering now, withering
Your mind won't let you say that you're wondering now
Pondering now, hungering
Won't let you say that you're questioning
Wavering, weakening
You mind won't let you say that you're hearkening
Listening, heeding me now
But won't let you say that you want

Savor the addiction
Savor the affliction, savor me
Savor the addiction
Savor the affliction now

The addiction
Savor the affliction, savor me
Savor the addiction
Savor the affliction

Savor the addiction
Savor the affliction, savor me
Savor her mind, yeah

Yet your mind won't let you say that you want me yet
Your mind won't let you say that you want me yet
Your mind won't let you say that you want me

Because your mind won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me

Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me

What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
