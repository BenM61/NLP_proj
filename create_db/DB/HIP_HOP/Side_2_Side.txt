Yeah, this a dance song for all my niggas in the club
That don't dance, just be in the back, arms folded
Blunt in the mouth, cap pulled down, just scoping everything
Namsayin, just in the cut, watching you haters
With a tone on em

I'm in the club posted up (up) got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scoping I'm just
Twisting my body from side 2 side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side 2 side
I'm in the club posted up (up) got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scoping I'm just
Twisting my body from side 2 side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side 2 side
