Wild is love! 
Wild is love! 
Wild-wild-wild 
Is love! 

As a rule, man's a fool. 
When it's hot, he wants it cool. 
When it's cool, he wants it hot. 
Always wanting 
What is not. 

Wild is love 
Whenever two hearts meet, 
Wild is love, 
Bitter, but oh so sweet. 

And I know 
I must go 
Wherever love takes me, 
Whatever love makes me, 
I will be! 

Like a fire 
Burning beyond control, 
Wild is love 
Deep in my heart and soul 

And though wild as the wind 
And wild as the rolling sea, 
Nothing could ever be 
As wild as love. 

And I know 
I must go 
Wherever love takes me, 
Whatever love makes me, 
I will be! 

And though wild is the wind 
And wild is the rolling sea, 
Nothing could ever be 
As wild as love... 
As wild as love... 
As wild as love... 
As wild is love!
