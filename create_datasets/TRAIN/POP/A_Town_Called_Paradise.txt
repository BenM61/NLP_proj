When your sanity is a hurricane
And your heartache is tidal wave
Oh you can pull me under
Oh you can pull me under

When euphoria is hit and run
And you are drowning in a heatless sun
Oh you can pull me under
Oh you can pull me under

So let's wash away the night
Into a neon scene of light
Away we'll drive into a town called paradise

Into a town called paradise

When you are buried in the world eclipse
And there's nobody to help you left
Oh you can pull me under
Oh you can pull me under

When you are running out of dreams to catch
And every morning is an hourglass
Oh you can pull me under
Oh you can pull me under

So let's wash away the night
Into a neon scene of light
Away we'll drive into a town called paradise

Into a town called paradise

When your sanity is a hurricane
When your sanity is a hurricane
When your sanity is a hurricane
When your sanity is a hurricane
It's a hurricane

Oh you can pull me under
Pull me under
So let's wash away the night
Into a town called paradise
Into a town called paradise
Into a town called paradise
