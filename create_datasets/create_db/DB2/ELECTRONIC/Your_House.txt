Your love is a life for I
Realized that so much
When I first met you
That was some time ago
From then until this
Resist, no, no, no, close to you, see
Oh yes, right from the start
Oh, no, no, no, could never part
Oh, I hear from that thought, yes

(I wanna live in your house)
I wanna live in your house
(I wanna live in your house) your house
Wanna live in your house
You say dry your, don't
Wipe that tear drops from your eyes

Was in a little situation
Came with a solution (solution)
Was a revelation to hear
Triumphant calling
Triumphant trumpets

(I wanna live in your house)
I wanna live in your house
(I wanna live in your house) 

Oh, I no hear
Too much for what some say
'Cause at the close of the day
They'll be so far away
But then I know
One things for certain
'Cause at the closing of the oh
Yes, I know one thing for certain
You'll be there, you'll be there
It was you
That raise the flag above my head
Once when I was, once when I was
In a little situation
Came with a, came with a solution (solution)
Was a revelation to hear
Triumphant calling
Triumphant trumpets

I wanna live in your house
Wanna live in your house
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna live in your house
To make a home
To make a home yeah
