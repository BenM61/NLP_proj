[Chorus:]
I shoulda known you had a girl
Shoulda known you had someone to go home to
I shoulda known you was too good to be true
I shoulda known your time was taken
Shoulda known that someone was loving you
I shoulda known you was too good to be true

Oh

How could I been such a fool
To see something so visible
Guess I was blinded by the physical
And you kept me from being seen with you
Still I guess I couldn't see right through
That you had another side to you

[Chorus]

We always met at a private place
My place or a secret rendezvous
When I asked where you live
You gave the same excuse
I never met your kids
Never been to your crib
Never met your family or friends
After two years
I'm convinced but I'm confused

That my perfect gentlemen
Cheated me better than any man
There's something that's going on
That makes more sense

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You were the one that I wanted
You were the one that I needed
But someone already has you
And I feel so defeated

You were the one that I wanted
You were the one that I needed
But someone already has you
Baby how come I didn't see it

[Chorus: x5]
