Hired me on a greenhorn

Fmaj7
Didn't know a rope from a horse

G6
But I wanted to be a cowboy

Am
So I took the job of course

The foreman he said "Son you gonna ride

Fmaj7
At the end of my herd"

G6
All the wranglers sat around in a circle

Am
And nobody said a word

Fmaj7
'Cause there's a woman in my dreams

G6
That keeps me alive

Fmaj7
If I ever see her again

E Am
Lord I'll never ride drag on another cattle drive

Solo: Am Fmaj7 G6 Am Am Fmaj7 G6 Am

Am
There's a rumor goin' round

Fmaj7
That we're near a Kansas City town

G6
And when you're ridin drag on this cattle drive

Am
It takes 'bout a week for the word to get around

Fmaj7
'Cause there's a woman in my dreams

G6
That keeps me alive

Fmaj7
If I ever see her again

E Am
Lord I'll never ride drag on another cattle drive

Outro: Am Fmaj7 G6 Am
