Escaping contamination
Is a difficult
Operation
I need some hibernation
Hide me from the evil
Protect me from the vultures

The men and the women
Drink and make children
They need some hibernation
To hide them
From the evil
Protect them from the vultures
Guide me through the colours

Spring it dies
Summmer arrives
Summer dies
Autumn arrives
Autumn dies
Winter arrives
Forever and ever
Ever and ever

I need this hibernation
To stray with deviation
To gather some information
Hide me from the evil
Protect me from the vultures
Guide me through the colours

Spring it dies
Summer arrives
Summer dies
Autumn arrives
Autumn dies
Winter arrives
Forever and ever
Ever and ever
Ever and ever

(solo)
Spring it dies
Summer arrives
Summer dies
Autumn arrives
Autumn dies
Winter arrives
Spring it dies
Summer arrives
Summer dies
Autumn arrives
Autumn dies
Winter arrives
Forever
