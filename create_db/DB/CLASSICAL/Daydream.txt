What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time is really on my side
It's one of those days to takin' a walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
And follow my face, so somebody's new mode long

I've been havin' a sweet dream
I've been dreaming since I woke up today
It started me in my sweet dream
Cause she's the one that makes me feel this way

And even if time is pass me by alive
I couldn't care less about to do if they say I die
Tomorrow I pay the dues for droppin' my low
Upon the eye for being a sleepable toe

And you can be sure that if you feelin' right
A daydream will last a long into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast, yeah, you may pick up your ears
Oh, you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years

What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of Joy

And even if time is really on my side
It's one of those days to takin' a walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
And follow my face, so somebody's new mode long

And even if time is passin' me by alive
I couldn't care less about to do if they say I die
Tomorrow I pay the dues for droppin' my low
Upon the eye for being a sleepable toe
