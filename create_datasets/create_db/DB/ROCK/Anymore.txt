I packed my bags the first thing this morning.
I packed all my changes in there too.
Erased all the numbers and addresses,
And all the memories of you.

Because I don't care about you anymore.
Because I don't think about you anymore.
Because I don't call about you anymore.
Because I don't dream about you anymore.
I won't cry about you anymore.
I won't laugh about you anymore.
I don't ask about you anymore.
I don't care about you anymore.

When I catch myself from crying,
I stare so far into my soul,
But all along I get a feeling;
How something wrong can take its toll.

Because I don't care about you anymore.
Because I don't think about you anymore.
Because I don't call about you anymore.
Because I don't dream about you anymore.
I won't cry about you anymore.
I won't laugh about you anymore.
I don't ask about you anymore.
I don't care about you anymore.

If it doesn't kill us, well, I guess it makes us stronger.
But my strength is aching as my eyes just drift away.

Because I don't care about you anymore.
Because I don't think about you anymore.
Because I don't call about you anymore.
Because I don't dream about you anymore.
I won't cry about you anymore.
I won't laugh about you anymore.
I don't ask about you anymore.
I don't care about you anymore.
