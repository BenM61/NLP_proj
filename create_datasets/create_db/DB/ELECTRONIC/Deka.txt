We got the deka, it says track eleven
We got the promise, I'll take what's mine
We got the clearance to use the sound system
I got the promise, I'll take what's mine

You see oppressors, yeah they say forgive 'em
I see the promise, I'll take what's mine
You got the deka it says track eleven
I see the promise, I'll take what's mine

Keep us safe from the bats
Keep the truth in your eyes
Keep us away from the rats
Young terrorists attack

Keep us safe from the bats
Keep the truth in your eyes
Keep us away from the rats
Young terrorists attack

The real starter, sort out the fakers
You got the promise, I'll take what's mine
You talk of changes, underground arrangers
You got the promise, I'll take what's mine

I see the city, it's sleeping like 'The Jackal'
I got the promise, I'll take what's mine
You got the deka, it says track eleven
I got the promise, I'll take what's mine

Keep us safe from the bats
Keep the truth in your eyes
Keep us away from the rats
Young terrorists attack

Keep us safe from the bats
Keep the truth in your eyes
Keep us away from the rats
Young terrorists attack

Young terrorists attack
Young terrorists attack

Keep us safe from the bats
Keep the truth in your eyes
Keep us away from the rats
Young terrorists attack
