Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!

Well, I met her in a dancehall (c'mon let's go)
In Tennessee (c'mon, let's go)
I smiled at her, she smiled at me (c'mon, let's go)
I said baby it would move me (c'mon, let's go)
If could could dance with you, she said (c'mon, let's go)
Anything that moves you, daddy, 's gonna move me too

I said I must be dreaming
I said I must be dreaming
I said I must be dreaming
Life never been this good to me

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!

Well, let's jump this old dancehall (c'mon let's go)
Get out in the sun (c'mon let's go)
Let's go someplace we can have some fun (c'mon let's go)
I've got twenty dollars, mama, what you wanna do?, she said (c'mon let's go)
Anything that moves you, daddy, 's gonna move me too 

I said I must be dreaming
I said I must be dreaming
I said I must be dreaming
Life never been this good to me

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Well, let's go down to the river (c'mon let's go)
Moon is shinin' bright (c'mon let's go)
Me and you, baby, let's have a ball tonight (c'mon let's go)
I'm going to love you (c'mon let's go)
Teach you something new, she said (c'mon let's go)
Anything that moves you, daddy, 's gonna move me too

I said I must be dreaming
I said I must be dreaming
I said I must be dreaming
Life never been this good to me

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh!
