Bloom today - bloom today 
Are roses thorny any other way 
Sweet today - sweet today
I couldn't swallow any other way 

Don't you ask why
Don't qualify
This lullaby 

Blood today - blood today 
I couldn't be sure any other way 
Spilled today - spilled today
I couldn't soften any other way 

Don't you ask why
Don't qualify
This lullaby 

And I know it's nothing new 
But the red is roses true 
And it's gushing out of you 

Bloom today - bloom today 
Are roses thorny any other way
Squeeze today - squeeze today 
I couldn't show you any other way 

Don't you ask why
Don't qualify
This lullaby 

Bloom - bloom - bloom - bloom
