Wild,wild,wild,wild
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets

In the heat of the summer
Better call out a plumber
Turn on the steam pipe
Cool me off
With your big crime fighters
And your newspaper writers
Still need a drugstore
To cure my buzz

Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets

'64 valiant,hand full of valiums
Couple of beers really do me right
You better believe us,better trust us 
Teenage jive, walking wreck

Wild,wild,wild,running wild
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets

Got a gang called the wolves
You have to choose
Play with the boys
You're bound to lose
A bottle in one hand
A can in the other
Don't fool around 'cause they're real
Mean mothers

Wild,wild,wild,wild
Wild running, running
Wild
Mrs. America, how's your favorite son?
Do you care just what he's done?
No

Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running
Wild in the streets, running, running

Wild in the streets, we're running, running
Wild in the streets, we're running, running
Wild in the streets, we're running, running
Wild in the streets
