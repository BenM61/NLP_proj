If you think, the world owes you a ride,
You'll never find the reason why,
Boy you know it's down to you.
Looking down, you'll only see your own two feet,

Mama used to say to me,
Take a walk down Angel Street.
So sweet thing, Have I got news for you,
Come and taste my soul food,

So what have you got to lose?
Angel Street,
Stand on your own two feet,
'Cause baby can't you see?

If we're to stay alive
Only the strong survive.
Don't you know, if you can't respect yourself,
You'll be left on the shelf,

No one's gonna carry you.
Walkin' tall, dreamin' of love and pride
Reachin' up to the sky
Arms and eyes are open wide.

So come on, lets climb the stairs out of this,
Make a wish and steal a kiss,
Boy what have you got to lose?
Angel Street,

Stand on your own two feet,
'Cause baby can't you see?
If were to stay alive
Only the strong survive.

Angel Street,
Stand on your own two feet,
'Cause baby can't you see?
If were to stay alive

Only the strong survive.
(Take a walk, Take a walk, on Angel Street)
(Take a walk, Take a walk, on Angel Street)
(Take a walk, Take a walk, on Angel Street)

Only the strong survive,
Way way down
Angel Street,
Stand on your own two feet,

'Cause baby can't you see?
If were to stay alive
Only the strong survive.
Angel Street,

Stand on your own two feet,
'Cause baby can't you see?
If were to stay alive
Only the strong survive.
