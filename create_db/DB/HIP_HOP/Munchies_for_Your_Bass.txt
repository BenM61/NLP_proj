Tweedle- Dee
Tweedle- Dum
Last time we got busy your body got numb
And now you're beatin' like a big bass drum
You're in position I'm about to come...right.. thru...the...door
and don't stop and by now youur boilin' like a crock pot
You're in a frenzy
You're all over me
I got the honey your name's queen bee
I'm runnin' hot like a ninja thru a grill on fire
the longer we go the longer gets my desire
And I wanna see you lose your mind
Cause you know we'll be doin' the grind
But I'm not into torture
that's not my speed some big bass is...all...I...need
And I'm gonna let you have a taste if you keep the pace
Cause I've got the munchies for your bass

I want you,I want you,I want you yeah,yeah,yeah

Let's ride....the wave of the bass
I want it all but not in my face
Take your time and get relaxed
And feel the bass roll down your back
it's not hard just let it flow,smooth and easy
It's better when you let go Take a sample set the pace feel the boom

I got the munchies for your bass
I want you,I want you,I want you yeah,yeah,yeah

Let's get down I mean real deep
Go so low I can feel it when your bass beats
Gimme a kiss now below my navel
I'm the dinner the bed is the dining table
Feel the sensation a real bass blast
strong vibration for slower but it builds fast
You're goin' down
I'm comin' up
It's gettin' heated you're about to erupt
A lil nibble gimme your shoulder
you're getting cold feet I'm getting bolder
what should i do now i'm feeling alright
the trouble's loose the bass is getting real tight
it's amazing the way we do it
i know it's shallow i can see right thru it
now beneath us it's the milkyway
Got me cravin'...munchies for your bass

I want you,I want you, I want you yeah,yeah,yeah
I want you
I want you baby yeah
I want you
I want you baby
I need you 
I need you got to have you baby
I need you

I need you baby
