Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable
Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable ooh ooh
(Make yourself comfortable baby)
Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable
(I got some records here to put you in the mood)
Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable
(The phone is off the hook so no one can intrude)
Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable baby
(I feel romantic and the record changer's automatic) 

Sweetheart we've hurried through our dinner
Hurried through the dance
Left before the picture show was through
Why did we hurry through the dinner
Hurry through the dance
To leave some time for this
To hug a hug and kiss a kiss now 

Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable
(Take off your shoesies dear and loosen up your tie)
Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable
(I've got some kisses here, let's try one on for size)
Ooh ooh make yourself comfortable baby
(I'll turn the lights low while you make yourself comfortable baby)
