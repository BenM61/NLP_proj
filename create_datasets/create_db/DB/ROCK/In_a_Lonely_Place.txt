I heard it said somewhere that one day all good things come to an end.
I turn around to see you. And if I do or not, it all depends.
I was born the day I met you,
Lived a while when you loved me,
Died a little when we broke apart.
Yesterday, it would have mattered.
Now today, it doesn't mean a thing.
All my hopes and dreams are shattered now.

I'm in a lonely place without you.
I'm in a lonely place without you.

I walk the streets alone at night sometimes and think about you.
I look as strangers pass, and wonder how I'll live without your love.
I was born the day I met you,
Lived a little when you loved me,
Died a little when we broke apart.
Suddenly, this world's no longer bright.
I'm alone and lonely every night.
Won't you bring back your love that's out of sight?

I'm in a lonely place without you.
I'm in a lonely place without you.
