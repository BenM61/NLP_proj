Yeah, back in the days when I thought music wouldn't be a part of me 
It called to me, it dawned to me 
The heart of me was telling me to sing with harmonies 
Now let me tell you what it'd be like 
Easier said than behind the mic 
Many times I had to get right 
Countless days, sleepless nights 
Now I kinda wanna break away, get away to the money made 
And maybe come back another day with a whole new focus man 
'Cause been through it, proved it in time 
At the time, I was testin' glory 
Did with what I had to do with this 
There's no question that I'm livin' for it 

You go do whatever you gotta do (whatever you gotta do) 
I'ma do me and prove (I'ma do me and prove) 
That everything is new 
You go do whatever you wanna do (whatever you wanna do) 
I'ma stay true and prove (I'ma stay true and prove) 
That everything is new 

Big change, big things 
Now everywhere I go they know my name 
So strange, the other day 
I was thinkin' maybe givin' up on some things 
Not a quitter, but a single rider, dancer slash undercover spitter 
Now I got a few rides, dating new guys, and my house much bigger 
All I gotta do is stay on track, never lookin' back on all of that 
Not gonna hold me back to where I used to be at 
Now with white on wax, they wanna see me back 
Hum, that ain't the girl that used to dance at the night's games 
What it is is how it is
