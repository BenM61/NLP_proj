I got a bag of my own

Now, baby
Stop all that gabbing
We don't need
No backstabbing
Come take
Take care of all of mine
My good stuff

You know I'm grown
I've got a bag of my own

On my good book
I don't back up
Take my tea
From my favorite cup
My groove is still
Out of sight
Got the hook
Protect my love, right
Three times seven
You know I'm grown
I got a bag of my own
Wait a minute

I sweat all day
And half the night
Taking care of business
Handle it right
My body's built like a
32-20-45 frame
Don't shoot nothing
But ball and chain
Don't knock it if
You don't want to rock it

Hit me, hit me
I know I'm grown
I got a bag of my own

Can't get enough
Got to, got to do my stuff
Hit me, hit me
I got a bag of my own
Baby, stop all that gabbing
We don't need
No backstabbing
Got to change my ways
Taking care all
Of my good stuff

You know I'm grown
You know I'm grown
Now, hit me

I sweat all day
Half of the night
Taking care of business
Handle it right
My body's built like a
32-20-45 frame
Don't shoot nothing
But ball and chain

Shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, ah

Hit me, good God
Got to change my ways
Got to change my ways
Come on, come on, band
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me, hit me, hit me

Hit me, good God
I got a bag of my own
I got a bag of my own
Hit me, good God
I, I, I, I got a bag
