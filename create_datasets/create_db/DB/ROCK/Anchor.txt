My heart is ship lost out of thies
I'm drifting farther from your reach
Went down by the waves and winds
Comes down the seek as well
You are the one thing that I need
This is my only hope but you never let me go

I need an anchor to hold me throw the storm
I see the danger can't fight it on my own
I'm cryin' out, I'm going down
Hold me in, I need you now
My savior, I need an anchor

See you lie and tarrying at the sky
My darkest feels are on the way
So it's my undying faith cuz I know you'll walk away
Speak for this stealing ' to alive

I need an anchor to hold me throw the storm
I see the danger can't fight it on my own
I'm cryin' out, I'm going down
Hold me in, I need you now
My savior, I need an anchor

Save my soul, save my soul, save our soul
Save my soul, save my soul, save our soul
This is my hope, that you never let me go

I need an anchor to hold me throw the storm
I see the danger can't fight it on my own
I'm cryin' out, I'm going down
Hold me in, I need you now
My savior, I need an anchor
I need an anchor
