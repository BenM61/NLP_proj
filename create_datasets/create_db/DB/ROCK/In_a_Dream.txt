Life could never be 
Just what you want it to be 
But even in my dreams 

She's got a look in her eye I can't believe 
She brings me back down to earth 
And wakes me up again 
I try to get back to sleep 
She's nowhere to be seen 
In a dream 

The movement of my eyes 
Rapid and uninspired 
My brain is getting tired 

She's got a look in her eye I can't believe 
She brings me back down to earth 
And wakes me up again 
I try to get back to sleep 
She's nowhere to be seen 
In a dream 

Look what completes 
Nothing else so sweet 

I try to get back to sleep 
She's nowhere to be seen 
In a dream 
In a dream 
In a dream 

There's nothing to report 
From my unconscious thought 
Forever falling short
