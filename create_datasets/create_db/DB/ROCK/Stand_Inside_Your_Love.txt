You and me 
Meant to be 
Immutable 
Impossible 
It's destiny 
Pure lunacy 
Incalculable 
Inseparable 

And for the last time 
You're everything that I want and asked for 
You're all that I dream 
Who wouldn't be the one you love 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love 
Protected and the lover of 

A pure soul 
And beautiful 
You 
Don't understand 
Don't fear me now 
I will breath 
For the both of us 
Travel the world 
Traverse the skies 
Your home is here 
Within my heart 

And for the first time 
I feel as though I am reborn in my mind 
Recast as child and mystic sage 

Who wouldn't be the one you love 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love 

For the first time 
I'm telling how much I need and bleed for 
Your every move and waking sound in my time 
I'll wrap my wire around your heart 
And your mind 
You're mine forever now 
Who wouldn't be the one you love and live for 
Who wouldn't stand inside your love and die for 
Who wouldn't be the one you love
