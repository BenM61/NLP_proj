It's safe to say we made it
Along the path we tread so well
And the shades we use to paint it
Can't start to show our lives parallel

Eyes to the ground
We watch our feet
We're a little bruised and battle-worn
But the walls they built to keep us
Cannot shield our storm

We prayed for love
We prayed for love

We prayed for love
Someone in the distance
Who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts

We prayed for love
Someone in the distance
Who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts

The endless days of thunder
Seemed to leave us here without a chance
Feeling like a world around us
Is falling down like an avalanche
We look ahead you know our hearts
Are gunna lead us through another fight
The negative like string between us
Strong in our desire

We prayed for love
We prayed for love

We prayed for love
Someone in the distance who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts

We prayed for love
Someone in the distance who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts

Wherever the road takes us
The winds began to break up
Just stay by my side

Wherever the road takes us
The winds began to break up
Just stay by my side

We prayed for love
Someone in the distance
Who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts

We prayed for love
Someone in the distance who will listen
Listen to our breaking hearts
