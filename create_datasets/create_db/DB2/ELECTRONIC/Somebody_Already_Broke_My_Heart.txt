You came along when I 
Needed a savior 
Someone to pull me 
Through somehow 
I've been torn apart so 
Many times 
I've been hurt so many 
Times before 
So I'm counting on you now 

Somebody already 
Broke my heart 
Somebody already 
Broke my heart 

Here I am 
So don't leave me stranded 
On the end of a line 
Hanging on the edge of a lie 
I've been torn apart so 
Many times 
I've been hurt so many 
Times before 
So be careful and be kind 

Somebody already 
Broke my heart 
If someone has to lose 
I don't want to play 
Somebody already 
Broke my heart 
No no I can't go there again
