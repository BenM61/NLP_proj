Mmm, yeah
Alright, yeah
Listen

Baby, can you put them bags down?
Just wait, hold on for a minute
Gotta say a couple things before you go
Even though I know that were finished

I don't want you to leave without knowin'
Just where I'm comin' from, babe
I just wanna say I made a big mistake
And now I gotta face the fact that I

Shoulda been a better man
The kinda man that you needed
Woulda been better off
If I'd done right by you

I coulda done this
I coulda done that
But I know I can't go back
'Cause now it's just too late
I'm sayin' shoulda, woulda, coulda, yeah

I can tell by the look on your face
You ain't tryin' to hear what I'm sayin'
Maybe you done heard all of this before
Girl, this ain't no game that I'm playin'

This may be the last chance I ever have
To talk to you before you go
So I gotta say, I made a big mistake
Girl, you know it's killin' me that I

Shoulda been a better man
The kinda man that you needed
Woulda been better off
If I'd done right by you

I coulda done this
I coulda done that
But I know I can't go back
'Cause now it's just too late
I'm sayin' shoulda, woulda, coulda, yeah

I should have done my best to love you, baby
I should have placed no one above you
And now it's killing me more than you know
Letting you go that's why I

Shoulda been a better man
The kinda man that you needed
Woulda been better off
If I'd done right by you

I coulda done this
I coulda done that
But I know I can't go back
'Cause now it's just too late
I'm sayin' shoulda, woulda, coulda, yeah

I know I shoulda been
I know I woulda been
I know I coulda been a better man
I'm sayin' shoulda, woulda, coulda, yeah

I know I shoulda been
I know I woulda been
I know I coulda been a better man
I'm sayin' shoulda, woulda, coulda, yeah
