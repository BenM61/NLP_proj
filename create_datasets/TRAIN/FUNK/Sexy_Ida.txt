Don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
Don't try your love on sexy Ida
You might as well try it with the spider

She's got his long black hair
It's a hangin' on down her back
Long black pretty legs
And she walks just like a cat

Hypnotic eyes
And a stacked up love sacks
She not only wants your love
She wants your life after that don't do it

Don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
Don't try your love on sexy Ida
You might as well try it on the spider

And she's got a kingsized bed
With satin sheets of love
And you'll never wanna leave now
The web of love she weaves but I'll tell you, now

Don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
Don't try your love on sexy Ida
You might as well try it on the spider

You gotta beware of sexy Ida
'Cause she tries to look co sweef and kind
But her looks can be deceivin'
'Cause her love is like strychnine

Don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
Don't try your love on sexy Ida
You might as well try it on the spider

Don't give your love to sexy Ida
'Cause she's the sister of a black widow spider
