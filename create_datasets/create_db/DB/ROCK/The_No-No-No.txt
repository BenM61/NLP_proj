Oscar: I've got a new dance called The No-No-No! 
You can do it fast or do it slow 
Just shake your head and away you go 
You're doin' the dance called The No-No-No! 

Oh, no no no, no no no no 
No no no no no no no 
Just shake your head and go go go 
You're doin' the dance called The No-No-No! 

Shake your head to the left and right 
Shake no no with all your might 
Shake it high or shake it low 
Doin' the dance called The No-No-No! 

Oh, no no no, no no no no 
No no no no no no no 
Just shake your head and go go go 
You're doin' the dance called The No-No-No! 

Elmo: Now if someone says, "Please dance with me," 
The answer is easy as it can be 
Just shake your head and oh oh oh 
You'll be doin' a dance called The No-No-No! 

Both: Oh, no no no, no no no no 
No no no no no no no 
Just shake your head and go go go 
You're doin' the dance called The No-No-No! 

Oh, no no no, no no no no 
No no no no no no no 
Just shake your head and go go go 
You're doin' the dance called The No-No-No! 

I said, doin' the dance 
Called The No-No-No! 
No!
