Cover girl you've come a long way
New Mercedes in the driveway
Oh oh, she's just a small town girl at heart
I'm concerned with what they say
Reputation on display
Oh how people like to talk

I saw her picture in a magazine row
Blue eyes shinin' by the cellophane glow
Tonight she's giving it all away, she's all right
My Cover Girl

Five years in eighteen months
She got everything all at once
She moved out that's when he moved in
Cover Girl it's such a damn waste
You were more than just a pretty face
I never thought I'd never see you again

I saw her picture in a magazine row
Blue eyes shinin by the cellophane glow
Tonight she's giving it all away, she's all right

I saw her picture on the 6-o clock news
Just read about the cover girl blues
