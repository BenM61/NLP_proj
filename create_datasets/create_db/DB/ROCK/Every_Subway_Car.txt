My backpack was faded black
But now it's all blue
It looks whack, but it's compact
And works like brand new

I had found an old Greyhound
But it wasn't my scene
I'm underground at the turnaround
This one is pristine

Warehouses above
All I'm thinking of
You gave your heart to me
And soon the world will see
Our graffiti love
Spray-paint on my glove
They'll wonder who you are
On every subway car

I'm on my own I'm sliced alone
I did it for you
But I've outgrown
My wings and flown
Into something brand new

I show restraint I'm the patron saint
Of urban gardens in bloom
If I don't faint
Ingesting paint
Breathing all of these fumes

Warehouses above
All I'm thinking of
You gave your heart to me
And soon the world will see
Our graffiti love
Spray-paint on my glove
They'll wonder who you are
On every subway car

On every subway car you look amazing
While streaming out of bars
Their glasses raising
Systemically refused
And chemically removed

Warehouses above
All I'm thinking of
You gave your heart to me
And soon the world will see
Our graffiti love
Melted on my glove
They'll wonder who you are
On every subway car
Our graffiti love
On every subway car
Our graffiti love
On every subway car
