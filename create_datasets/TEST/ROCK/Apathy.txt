Looking around at twenty-two
And so tired of myself around you
Maybe I don't fit your ideals anymore
Or maybe I just grew up into a bore

I know that I shouldn't call you
But in this light we are all blue
I just want to feel like I'm
Neatly designed

Like a telephone pole
I want to feel whole
Do you wanna go on a date?
Or would that be hard to orchestrate?

When you close your dreamy eyes
Are they even close to dreaming of mine?
You could take me and my apathy
Turn us into clarity
