I've got to see you, somehow
Not tomorrow, right now
I know it's late, whoa I can't wait
So come on and steal away
Please, steal away

Now, don't start thinking, tryin' to make up your mind
Your folks are sleeping, let's not waste any time
I know it's late, whoa I can't wait
So come on and steal away
Please, steal away

I know it's wrong asking this of you
There's no other way I can be with you
If only your folks would approve
Seeing like this we wouldn't have to do
No, no

I won't tell anybody else
I'll keep it to myself
I know it's late, whoa I can't wait
So come on and steal away
Please, steal away

'Cause I need you, yes I do
Oh, by my side
Yes. Oh, honey I need you
I need you, I need you to be my guide
