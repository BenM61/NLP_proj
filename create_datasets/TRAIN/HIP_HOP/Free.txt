Okay

Why am I waking up out of my sleep
Thinking of ya babe
You had a hold on me
Now I'm feeling freer then I ever been
You been around love but you never been in

Um, ay, running out of shit that I can say
Wishing you the best and so I pray, hey hey hey

I've been waiting for the day
You knew it was coming either way
I know you hate it
But I'm freer than I've ever been
Something that you've never been

You had just what you needed to be
Everything you want to be
But you'd rather run 'round these streets
Now you're feeling freer than you've ever been
But really you feel trapped, no need to pretend, um

Ay, running out of shit that I can say
Wishing you the best and so I pray

I've been waiting for the day
You knew it was coming either way
I know that you hate it but I'm freer than I've ever been
Something that you've never been

I know you don't wanna f*ck nobody but me
You don't wanna touch nobody but me
Nobody
Nobody
You wanna be

Saved, I'm hoping that you found a way
I'm moving around state to state
I'm living I know you can't relate
Now I'm feeling freer than I've ever been
You know I was down
Now I'm on the fence, oh
Ay, a lot of bitches wanna ride the wave
Most of them was out to take your place
You done went and gave that shit away

I've been waiting for the day
You knew it was coming either way
I know that you hate it
But I'm freer than I've ever been
Something that you never been
