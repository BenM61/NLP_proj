Big easy

We got the Bourbon street
How about Decatur street
Way down on Saint-Phillip Street
Down in the Big Easy
We got Old Satchmo
We got Marie Laveau
Give me a bowl of Gumbo
Hike down to Papa Joe

Big easy
So easy
Big easy
So easy
Big easy
Big easy
Big easy
It's so easy

I like that broiled crawfish
Give me some Jambalaya
I love that crawfish vibe
And I ain't gon' tell you no lie 
Gimme some barbecue
Give me a plate of red beans
I'll take some mustard greens
Way down south in New Orleans

Down in the big easy
