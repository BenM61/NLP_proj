There's no telling what I'd do
If I could get my hands on you
I want you and don't know why
But now I know I'd like to try

Am I never know your mind
How I'd love to keep you in line
I should smile and tell you no-o
But how I'd hate to see you go

Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
You rattle my bones
Shake my heart like a ten-pound stone
Sometimes wish I'd left you alone

Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
You're makin' me weep
Wake me up nights and I can't sleep
Are you gonna be the death of me?

I could show you who you are
And I could kiss you in the dark
I could take it way too far
But I could never win your heart

Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
You rattle my bones
Take my heart like a ten-pound stone
Sometimes wish I'd left you alone

Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
You're makin' me weep
Wake me up nights and I can't sleep
Are you gonna be the death of me?

There's no telling what I'd do
If I could get my hands on you
I want you and don't know why
But now I know I'd like to try

Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
You rattle my bones
Shake my heart like a ten-pound stone
Sometimes wish I'd left you alone

Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
You're makin' me weep
Wake me up nights and I can't sleep
Are you gonna be the death of me?
