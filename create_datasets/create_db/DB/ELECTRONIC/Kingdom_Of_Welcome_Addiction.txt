Do you remember your coming down
Forced to take sides?
Your taunted charm and your broken smile
Touched me unexpectedly

So long
So long you've waited in line
Desire is a gift in life
So long
So long you've left and arrived
It's time for you to stay a while

If you chose life
You know what the fear is like if
You welcome addiction
This is your kingdom

Your fight for power
For memories, answers and signs
Will bring you through the dark to light
Clear and redefined

Too long
Too long I waste for these
Emotionally sucking life
Too long
Too long, you waste and right
It's time for you to recognize

If you chose life
You know what the fear is like if
You welcome addiction
This is your kingdom

If you chose life
You know what the fear is like if
You welcome addiction
This is your kingdom
