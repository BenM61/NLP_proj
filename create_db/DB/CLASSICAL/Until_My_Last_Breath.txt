Cannot cry it loud enough 
I'm giving up this ghost 
How can I still justify 
When you deny my voice 
In this nothing I'm not allowed 
I just follow alone 
Words as weapons without a sound 
Echoes dying unborn 

Until my last breath 
You'll never know 
Until you feel the silence 
When I am gone 
Now it's vanishing 
Everything 
What we might have been 
Only now your prays call my name 
But you won't see again 

Who can change this memory? 

Inside it needs to burn 
Worship by the enemy 
The guilty take their turns 
Watching as it's disappearing 
Shadows all that remain 
Wishes slowly crossing over 
In this parade of pain 

Until my last breath 
You'll never know 
Until you feel the silence 
When I am gone 
Now it's vanishing 
Everything 
What we might have been 
Only now your prays call my name 
But you won't see again
