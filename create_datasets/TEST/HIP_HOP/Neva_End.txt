We don't want it
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want it neva

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want it

I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you I don't give a f*ck about showing you
You know what it is, Shorty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I'm swimmin' in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You'll see reminisce every session, know you'll come back again
I know you can't breath without me, you gon' need the oxygen
I damn near gave you an overdose, on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain't been right ever since
As I think to myself what'd it have been heaven sent
Let's put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want it

You could leave today, I bet you'll come back tomorrow
I could see the haters comin' from a mile off
And it's only preparin' us, for what we got comin'
If they come your way, and you feel like runnin'
Run in my direction, and don't you run from me
'Cause anytime we get together, we gon' stunt them
And I'm applyin' major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It's lightnin', it's thunderin', it is striking got me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly
When you gon' ever leave?
Any time you leave my side
I know you comin' back
I know you comin' back to me

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want it

Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore
I bet you walking back
I bet you walking back to me
Actually that's a guarantee
Our friendship was guaranteed
You got my ego in another league
I ain't tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
'Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want it
