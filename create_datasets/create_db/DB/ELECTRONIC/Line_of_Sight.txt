I'm facing back to front
Over my shoulder at the sun
And it's an open door
End of my line of sight once more

And I don't learn, no I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
I don't learn, no I don't learn
'Cause you always seemed so kind
And I don't learn, no I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
And I don't learn, no I don't learn

And I already know, I already
And I already know
You know I could learn
You know I could learn
And I already know, I already
And I already know
You know I could learn
You know I could learn

And I already
You know I could learn

I'm feeling in and out
I turn full circle round and round
So will you help me down (help me down)
Come grab my hand for solid ground

And I don't learn, no I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
I don't learn, no I don't learn
'Cause you always seemed so kind
And I don't learn, no I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
And I don't learn, no I don't learn

And I already know, I already
And I already know
You know I could learn
You know I could learn
And I already know, I already
And I already know
You know I could learn
You know I could learn

And I already
You know I could learn

Help me out, don't let me down
I could learn from you, I could learn from you
Help me out, don't let me down
I could learn from you, I could learn from you
Help me out, don't let me down
I could learn from you, I could learn from you
