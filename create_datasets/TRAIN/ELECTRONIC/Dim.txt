Dim

You find out words are the same when you shout
I'm forced out
I'm someone childlike
My first time
Wonder when you'd come
So the mermaid's run 
For now the magic's gone

Falling under the water where i don't belong

Beaneth the mud and mead
There lurks like a dark seed
A memory long gone
A world so chained up
A world so chained up

Could look so down
Live like London
Walls are on your life
Hell's coves don't come, come
And over is over is over is over is o
Someone, yeah
Daylight's all, daylight's all

Just tell me if you've ever had
To find out
Words are the same when you shout
A small town
For the rest of your life
My first time
Wonder when you'd come
So the mermaid's run 
For now the magic's gone
So the mermaid's run 
And now the magic's gone

Oh heaven looks so sad
But give us all the time we need
I see no reason to believe
There ain't no sunflower that you won't see
There's only love sounds
Only love beats on
Alone and alone and alone
So we'll hold this
Alone and alone and alone
So we'll hold this
Alone and alone and alone
