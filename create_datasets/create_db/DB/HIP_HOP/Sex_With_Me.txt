Sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram with your temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I cannot mention

Ooh nana nana five fingers on it
Five fingers, hit it like you want it
I'ma hit it like I'm on it
Straight shots of the Buddha
Shots, shots, shots, shots
Baby, I'ma pick your poison
Ooh-we, oh-yeah (hmm na na na)
You gon' need it
I'm off that la-la
I'ma get it real like the Jacuzzi, (ah yeah)

And sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram with your temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me yeah
So amazing, so amazing
Hmmmm

You know I got the sauce (sauce)
You know I'm saucy
And it's always wet
A bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I'ma need you deeper than six, not a coffin
We're not making love, tryna get nasty
Grab up your drugs, that make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it'll feel alright
The sex doesn't get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I'ma roll
Even if I'm alone

Sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram with your temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga like a station
Sex with me so amazing, amazing, amazing hmmmm

Sex with me
So amazing
