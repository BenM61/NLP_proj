Do you know what's groovy
Have you seen the latest movie
Should I try and tip ya

May I hip ya, yes I know

Do you know what's playin'
Have you heard what folks are sayin'
Should I try and sell ya

May I tell ya, yes I know

I can see, baby
You're the kind of a chick who's sharp on top

Yes siree, baby
But why are we talkin' this shop

Mop! Mop!

You're a solid sender
And the band is some ear bender
We could both jump steady

Are you ready, yes I know

Look-a-here, boy
Look-a-where
Look at that tenor man
Yeah, ain't he a basher
Well, look at that trombone man
I believe he's a bout to flip his newt
Yeah, but ain't he cute
Zoot to boot
Well, what's your opinion of this band
This band, Gran-n-n-n-n-d!

I can see, baby
You're the kind of a gent who's sharp on top

Yes sirree, baby
But why're we talkin' this shop

Mop, Mop!

You're a solid sender
And the band is some ear bender
We could both jump steady

Are you ready

Yes I know
Baby, yes I know
Baby, yes I know
