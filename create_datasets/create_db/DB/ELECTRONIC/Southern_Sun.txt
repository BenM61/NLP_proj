Piece by piece
I release
Once was mine
Now undone
Turned blue
Like New Orleans
And went down like
A southern sun

I still feel you
Beneath my skin
I am tempted
To throw my senses in

Cause it's easier to fly
Than to face another day
In Southern Sun
And your love is all around

Piece by piece
I release
Once was mine
Now undone
Turned blue like New Orleans
And went down like
A southern sun

I still feel you
Beneath my skin
I am tempted
To throw my senses in

Cause it's easier to fly
Than to face another day
In Southern Sun
And your love is all around
And in the air to set me free

Set me free

You last like a sun
I'm deflated
I am pieces on the wind
Unrelated

I still feel you
Beneath my skin
I am tempted
To throw my senses in

Cause it's easier to fly
Than to face another day
In southern sun
And your love is all around
In the air to set me free

Cause it's easier to fly
And in the air to set me free
