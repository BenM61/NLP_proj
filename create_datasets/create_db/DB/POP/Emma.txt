We were together since we were five
She was so pretty
Emma was a star in everyone's eyes
And when she said she'd be a movie queen
Nobody laughed
A face like an angel
She could be anything

Emmaline
Emma, Emmaline
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen
Emmaline
Emma, Emmaline
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen

At seventeen we were wed
I'd work day and night 
To earn our daily bread
And every day Emma would go out
Searching for that play
That never, ever came her way
You know sometimes she'd come home
So depressed
I'd hear her crying in the back room
Feel so distressed
And I'd remember back when she was five
To the words that used to make
Emmaline come alive
It was :
"Emmaline,
Emma, Emmaline,
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen.
Emmaline,
Emma, Emmaline
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen."

It was a cold and dark December night
When I opened up the bedroom door
To find her lying still and cold
Upon the bed
A love letter lying on the bedroom floor
It read :
"Darling I love you,
But I just can't keep on living on dreams no more.
I tried so very hard not to leave you alone.
I just can't keep on trying no more."

Emmaline 
Aaargh, Emmaline 
Aaargh 
Emma, Emmaline 
Aaargh 
Emma, Emmaline
