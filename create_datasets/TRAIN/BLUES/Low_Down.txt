Low down, low down dirty shame
Low down, low down dirty shame
I've had nothing but the blues
Since I heard your name
No more, no more blues today
No more, no more blues today
I've been fond of you baby
But you got me crying everyday
I've been waiting, waiting so long for you
Waiting, waiting so long for you
It was good news sometimes
And then sometimes, it was bad news
Low down, low down dirty shame
Low down, low down dirty shame
I've had nothing but the blues
Since I heard your name
I've been crying, crying, crying all night long
Crying, crying all night long
I had nothing but the blues
Since you came along
Low down, low down dirty shame
Low down, low down dirty shame
