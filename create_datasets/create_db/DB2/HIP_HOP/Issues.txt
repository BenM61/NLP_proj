Can we try to work out
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues

You can tell me that you love me
And make it sound so sweet
Then right around and cuss me
Right in the middle of the street

Now I can do my usual thing
Jump in my car and speed away
But you know
I come runnin' back to you the very next day
Can we work it out?

Can we try to work out?
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues

Can we try to work out?
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues

Everybody got some problems
That don't make them have doubts
Before the neighbors call the cops on us
Let's try and straightin' this thing out

If they knew you were gonna do some many things
Then it's just not meant to be
I just want you to be happy, baby
I just want you to be with me

Can we try to work out?
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues

Can we try to work out?
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues

When you put out something
You get back somethin'
You put out nuthin'
You get the same

'Cause everyday we're struggling
Tryna keep this love from falling down
And no one was to blame

Just a lil' mo time, just a little
Just a lil' more trys, just a little
Just a lil' more love, just a little
'Cause we got issues

Can we try to work out?
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues

Can we try to work out?
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues

Can we try to work out?
It's no need to scream and shout
Let's make this love and turn it around
'Cause we got issues
