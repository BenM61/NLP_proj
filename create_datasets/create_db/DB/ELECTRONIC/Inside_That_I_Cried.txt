The talks we had on stormy nights
I often rushed away
When you were not in common sight
I was held by your embrace

I gaze and see the pain you feel
To think we had to part
I didn't feel you loved me
So I played games with your heart

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried

You treated me just like a queen
For me that wasn't enough
You showered me with expensive things
But I found a new love

Mistakes I made were fatal ones
Finally I see you cared
I can't undo what has been done
Now I need you, and you're not there

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried

No more prayers to make for tomorrow
Our time has slipped away
I feel so helpless
There's nothing I can do or say
To make things better

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

It was inside that I cried for you
Now you're never coming back for me no more
Oh baby, I know that I was wrong
So you left me all alone, don't go
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried
