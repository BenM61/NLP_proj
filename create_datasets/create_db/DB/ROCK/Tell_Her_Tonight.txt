I only watched her walk, but she saw it 
I only heard her talk, but she saw it 
I only touched her lips but she saw it 
I only kissed her lips, but she saw it 
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
She only flicked her eyes, but I saw it 
She only swung her hair, but I saw it 
She only shook her hips, but I saw it 
She only licked her lips, but I saw it 
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight

Hey, I'll have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah 
I'll have to tell her, tell her tonight, yeah 
I'll have to tell her, to tell her tonight, yeah 
I'll have to tell her, to tell her tonight 

I only held her hand, but she saw it 
I only watched her walk, but she saw it 
I only touched her neck but she saw it 
I only kissed her lips, but she saw it 
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight

Hey, I'll have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah 
Hey, I'll have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah 
You have to tell her, you tell her tonight, oh yeah
