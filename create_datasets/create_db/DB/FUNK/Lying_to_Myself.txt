I've been lying to myself
Been saying that I love somebody else
And all the time, girl, I'm in love with you
Say, what am I gonna do? Yeah

If I told you I'm sorry because I broke your heart
Girl, I didn't understand, no
I try to make her take the place over you
But you listen, she could never do, oh no, why

I've been lying to myself
Been saying that I love somebody else
All the time, girl, I'm in love with you
Say, what am I gonna do? Yeah

I know that love was made for two
And while we're apart
I'm supposed to wait for you, woh

I've been lying to myself
Saying that I love somebody else
All the time, girl, I'm in love with you
Say, what am I gonna do? Yeah

It's better to have loved and lost
Than not to have ever love anyone at all

I've been lying to myself
Been saying that I love somebody else
And all the time, girl, I'm in love with you
What am I gonna do?
