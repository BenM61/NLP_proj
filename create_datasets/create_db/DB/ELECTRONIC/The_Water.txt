The telegraph cables hung
The few can decipher who the message is from 
And delivering quietly
'Cause some don't get much company 

The harbor becomes the sea 
And light in the house keeps it collision free 
Understand the lay of the land 
Don't let it hurt you 
Or it will be the first to 

The water 
The water didn't realize 
It's dangerous size 
The mountain
The mountain came to recognize 
It's deep and rocky sides
More than realized 

I'm pale as a pile of bones
You hope for your babies and this is how they grow
With batters knocked over
The teeth bite the shoulder
Watching the gray sky that's acting like a good guy

The water 
The water came to realize 
It's dangerous size 
The mountain
The mountain came to recognize 
It's deep and rocky sides
Came to recognize
It's deep and rocky sides
More than realized
