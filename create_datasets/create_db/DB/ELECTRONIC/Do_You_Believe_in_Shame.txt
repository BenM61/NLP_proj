Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in shame?
And if love can conquer all then why
Do we only feel the pain?
I heard you speak my name.
Heard you singing The Stones
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static
On my telephone.
So why your eyelids are closed
Inside a case of rust?
And did you have to change all your poet's fire
To frozen dust.
I try to justify it
To learn from your mistake.
But where's the stupid lie that has to make its point
With such a pointless waste?
Come out

Do you believe in shame?
Do you believe in love?
And if they taste the same would you love again
Or abandon both?
I don't think I ever can believe my friend is gone
Keep saying it's all right, I'm gonna bring you back
But I know I'm wrong.
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing left to do
It's just that lately I've been so damn lonely when
I think of you.
And it may seem selfish now but I'll hold on to
The memory until all this fear is washed away.

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in life?
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die.
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die.
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die.

Oooooo-hey
Oooooo-hey
Oooooo-hey
