Hear the wind sings a sad old song
It knows I'm leaving you today
Please don't cry oh my heart will break
When I go on my way

Goodbye my love goodbye
Goodbye and aurevoir
As long as you remember me
I'll never be too far

Goodbye my love goodbye
I always will be true
So hold me in your dreams 'til I
Come back to you

See the stars in the skies above
They'll shine wherever I may roam
I will pray every lonely night
That soon they'll guide me home

Goodbye my love goodbye
Goodbye and aurevoir
As long as you remember me
I'll never be too far

Goodbye my love goodbye
I always will be true
So hold me in your dreams 'til I
Come back to you

Goodbye my love goodbye
Goodbye and aurevoir
As long as you remember me
I'll never be too far

Goodbye my love goodbye
I always will be true
So hold me in your dreams 'til I
Come back to you
