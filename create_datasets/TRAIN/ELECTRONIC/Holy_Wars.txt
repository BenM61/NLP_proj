Isn't there a holy war
You're going to
With cause enough
Enough to do

The Holy Grail has disappeared
There's nothing left to fight for here
There's only fear
Pick up where you last left off

Pick up the little pieces
You left upon the altar
Devoted to yourself
What to do

No stakes in hand
And nothingplanned
O what to do
To get to land

Drifting in a godless world
A hallowed life in a hollow world
A lifeless life
Pick up where you last left off

Pick up the little pieces
You left upon the altar
Devoted to yourself
Call your love a deity

Call family the enemy
call yourself free
Scale the Tropics
Mountain climb

Build pyramids to defy time
You've got the breaks
Pick up where yopu last left off
Pick up the little pieces

You left upon the altar
Devoted to yourself
And when all is said and done
Just face of death to fall back on

Just take a breath
So what's all the crying for
Heroes die and then come more
There's always more

Pick up where you last left off
Pick up the little pieces
You left upon the altar
Devoted to yourself
