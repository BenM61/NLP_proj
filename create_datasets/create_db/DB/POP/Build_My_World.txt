Clear my eyes it's the morning after
Did I fall in love, or did I find disaster?
Take a second just to breathe
I pick my heart up off my sleeve, yea

There she goes and I know she knows
By the way she eased out on her tippy toes
Skip the breakfast, tea for two
We made no plans to rendezvous, yea

Someone for everyone but no one for me
(No one for me)
Constantly searching for the love I need to

Build my world around, around
I'll be the lonely one until I find someone
The one I build my world around, around
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world

Lazy days, I'm in a hazy phase
Of watching countless ways in which my life goes crazy
Foolishness to blame
Still it pains me all the same, yea

Empty faces with empty gazes
In a race of change I'm losing faith in my pace
Trying to keep my feet before I fall

I'm on this endless road with nothing to see
(Nothing to see)
Constantly searching for the love I need to

Build my world around, around
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one I build my world around, around
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world

A cornerstone of honesty
(All around)
A foundation of gravity and freedom
(All around)
A clear and concrete understanding
(All around)
A love that's best kept safe and sound

It's amazing how we fear the maybe
It's from ourselves we so often run
Abandon fear and consequence of heartbreak
Expose the truth and give yourself to love

We've all been set up to be disappointed
We have to crawl before we learn to fly
It's a blur that moves right into focus
Removes the doubt, aligns your heart and mine

Build my world around, around
(It's amazing, ah yea)
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one I build my world around, around
(Around, around, yea)
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world around, around
(Around, yea, oh)
I'll be the lonely one until I find the one
The one I build my world around
(Just say it, just say it, just say it, just say it, yea-yea, oh baby)
So bring the arms of love until I find the one
The one I build my world
