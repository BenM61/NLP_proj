Don't you ever pretend
That we are more than friends?
Despite the metal and wires
I still have human desires

I'll wait here til the end
For my dividend
And when I turn off the lights
I'll wait here til the end

Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share

When I hear your voice
It fills me with noise
Was this meant to be?
Are you corrupting me?

Can't you just pretend
That we are more than friends?
Despite the metal and wires
I still have human desires

Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share

Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share

The satellites connecting us, protecting us
Our makers have neglected us
It's not their fault
It's just the way

Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share

La la la...
I can feel all the things that we can't share
