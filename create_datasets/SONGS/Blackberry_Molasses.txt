Blackberry Molasses 
One of the things that never change
You gotta keep pushin' on
The sun don't rain all the time
There's gonna be some heartache and pain

Woke up Sunday morning
Got a little bad news today
They say my life ain't worth living
And time is slowly ticking away
Don't think that I'm goin crazy
'Cause thoughts keep runnin' through my head
I know I gotta be strong
Gotta hold on
Sometimes I'd rather give up instead
Seems like I'm better off dead

Blackberry Molasses 
One of the things that never change
(It'll never change)
You gotta keep pushin' on
The sun don't rain all the time
There's gonna be some heartache and pain
(Heartache and pain)

Don't tell me how to live my life
After all that we've been through
Don't want to live out your hardships
'Cause I've been there myself a time or two
Still life goes on
If you just keep movin' on
So many things you'll survive
Once you realize
There's no such place as paradise
At least in my eyes
