When I talk to Loretta
Oh, boots, socks and sweater
Well she hugs me sweet and low
And it's never let me go
When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one
When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one

Well I heard her on the wire
Oh Sweet Loretta, child
She hugs me sweet and low
And it's never let me go
When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one
When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one

When I talk to Loretta
When I talk about the feeling
She hugs me sweet and low
And it's never let me go
When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one
When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

When I talk to Loretta
When I talk to Loretta
She make me, she make me, she make me
Make me, make me, make me feel like number one
