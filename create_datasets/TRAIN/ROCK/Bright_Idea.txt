Did somebody tell you what I couldn't tell you 
I hope they did 
I hope they didn't 

Well I oughta regret it 
Or should I forget it 
Whatever this is 
It feels electric 

You shot me a sweet look 
Gave me your yearbook 
Told me to sign it 
It was a signal 

But I couldn't find the words 
I just couldn't find the nerve 
As usual 

Here's my bright idea 
I'll just disappear 
I'll just fly away from here 
(Hey!) 

And now you're in Hollywood 
Right in my neighborhood 
Things are really looking up for you 
An army of managers 
And lots of pretty boys lining up 
To read for you 

Oh, I'm pretty sure that it was you 
That I bumped into just the other day 
At the record store 
But I still don't have a clue 
I just couldn't talk to you 

As usual 

Here's my bright idea 
Mmmm 
I'll just disappear 
Woah 
Here's my bright idea 
Bamb bamb bamb bamb 
I'll just disappear 
I'll just fly away from here 

So I come to your event 
In my well rehearsed mystique 
I show up an hour late 
But I've been ready for a week 
And you float into the hallway 
like some neon silohuette 
I'm slowly losing oxygen 
and my hands are soaking wet 
all the cameras and reporters 
piling up on one another 
just to get a look at you 
they all want an interview 

Then I make my move 
push them out of my way 
but I still just don't know what to say 

Here's my bright idea 
Mmmmm 
I'll just disappear 
Woah 
Here's my bright idea 
Bamb bamb bamb bamb 
I'll just disappear 
I'll just fly away from here 

Here's my bright idea 
Here's my bright idea 
Here's my bright 
Here's my bright 
Here's my bright idea 
Woah
