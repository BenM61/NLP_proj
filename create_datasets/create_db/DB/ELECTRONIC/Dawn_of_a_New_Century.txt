Imagine
Our planet floating silently in space
Around it, a white dove flies--
Forever circling
Every one hundred years, the dove's wing
Gently touches the surface of the earth
The time it would take for the feathered wing
To wear this planet down to nothing
Is eternity

Within eternity, time passes
Within time, there is change
Soon, the wing of the white dove
Will touch our world again
The dawn of a new Century
Time for a new beginning

Now is eternity
At the break of
Dawn of a century
A thousand years
Of joy and tears
We leave behind

Love is our destiny
Celebrate the
Dawn of a century
Let voices ring
Rejoice and sing
Now is the time

Now is eternity
Love is our destiny
Dawn of a century
