A million to one
That's what our folks think
about this love of ours
A million to one
They say that our love will fade like yesterdays clouds
They're betting everything that our love won't survive
They're hoping in time we'll forget each other lives
A million to one
They say were to young to know the meaning of love
A million to one
That they've forgotten the dreams that were dreaming of
But we'll forgive them because we love them
after all that's said and done.
There's one in a million
A million to one
A million to one
They say were to young to know the meaning of love
A million to one
That they've forgotten the dreams that were dreaming of
But we'll forgive them because we love them
after all that's said and done.
There's one in a million
A million to one
A million to one, a million to one
