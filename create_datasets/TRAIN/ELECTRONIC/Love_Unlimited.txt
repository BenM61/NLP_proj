Barry White, saved my life 
and if Barry White, saved your life 
Or got you back with your ex-wife (Chorus 1)
Sing Barry White, Barry White It's alright. 

Now I was watching Banachek, my mind's eye,
Right back when I was seed and learning my life.
At night they came together and gave me sight
He said it's better doing this, than sucking on a pipe.

Now when she came over, she brought the diskettes
On and on, she promised to kick this.
EWF, stole my breath,
When he finished, there was nothing left.

Over and over, 'til it's ready,
Sing about it low and fat, like J.P. Ghetti
We make it happen, ass slappin
Sitting on the point to where you never catch us napping
CO efino, he got the money grips,
No parking for Saturday night and the pips

The pips know the hymns, they singing along
Like knowing new verbs is gonna keep you from the twilight

(Do a little like that)

Barry White, Barry White
You know it's all right

Over and over, 'til it's ready,
Sing about it low and fat, like J.P. Ghetti
We make it happen, ass slappin
Sitting on the point to where you never catch us napping
CO efino, he got the money grips
No parking for Saturday night and the pips
