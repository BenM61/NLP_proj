I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless grains of sand
Careless hands don't care when dreams slip through

I brought you joy
And girl I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make the roses grow
If you don't change
Someday you'll know the sorrow of careless hands
That can't hold onto love

I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless grains of sand
Careless hands don't care when dreams slip through

I brought you joy
And dear I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make the roses grow
If you don't change
Someday you'll know the sorrow of careless hands
That can't hold onto love
Careless hands that can't hold onto love

Talking 'bout those hands
That can't hold onto love
Talking 'bout those hands
That can't hold onto love
