One-two one-two

To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep
I'm the motherfucker gripping the mic like it's a joke
Niggas fall in love with the music like its a ho
Put down your mic you lost your whole goal
You take it to seriously like it's a gamble
F*ck this rap shit I listen to classical
In the studio loop as usual
Lovin' my lyrical
F*ck bitches that you would know
I'm out of this cause you wanna be below
Ya'll niggas in love with the S
Ya'll niggas in love with the S

To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

Yeah, JD man I see sometimes
I sit and wonder when I think about these written rhymes
How'd I get to the point constantly taking all my time?
Time I could of been spending gettin' cash, gettin' mine
Hoping one day it comes around
One day when I'm
The nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the f*ck out the ghetto, cause I'm tired of crime
But it's a crime that I feel this fucking waste of time
But sometimes I feel like this shit here is a waste of time
Yours and mine
To these niggas out here trying to rhyme
Your reason for it better sure 'nough be genuine
I do it because it gives me a sort of peace-of-mind
And for the love

Yourself, yourself

To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do
