Street Corner Talking Lyrics
Kim Simmonds-Chrysalis Music Ltd. 
Came to the city, left my happy home 
Came to the city, left my happy home 

But I didn't do right, learned my lessons wrong 
Street Corner Talking, wonder what I'm gonna do 
Street Corner Talking, wonder what I'm gonna do 
If you can't get a job, council will take of you 

It's the same what a shame, no matter where you go 
It's the same what a shame, no matter where you go 
People wonder what to do, too much time for me and you 

Street Corner Talking, wonder what I'm gonna do 
Street Corner Talking, wonder what I'm gonna do 
If you can't get a job, council will take of you
