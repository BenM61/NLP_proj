No one's making any noise now, sshhh
We've been waiting for so long
They took away our films and tapes and notebooks
But it's okay, we've self-censored this song

But these lines are all individuals
And there's no such thing as a song
And even the silent are now guilty in the (empire of the senseless)
What's your line of questioning, sir?

(Empire of the senseless)
I can't interrupt intercept a one word sentence
Invent a war in secrecy
Sliding scenery like a vintage toy

Isn't plastic surgery wonderful?
Satellite secret national security
(Empire of the senseless)
Turning journalists into heroes takes some doing

(Empire of the senseless)
Boring Ollie north down in the subway dealing drugs and guns
(Empire of the senseless)
Turning little liars into heroes, it's what they've always done

(Empire of the senseless)
This song promotes homosexuality
It's in a pretended family relationship with the others on this record
And on the charts and on the jukebox

And in the radio
And in the radio

No one's making any noise now, sshhh
Stay quiet

All unacceptable gropings have been removed from the screen
Only eyes full of unspeakable thoughts remain
And even the silent are now guilty in the (empire of the senseless)
Baked beans, sugar, and margarine

(Empire of the senseless)
Bread, jam, groceries, and lard
For the unsentimental
The men who like the lady hard

The men who like the hard lady
And you know that people are really rather afraid
(Empire of the senseless)
Afraid of being swamped

(Empire of the senseless)
Afraid of being swamped by selfishness and greed
(Empire of the senseless)
(Empire of the senseless)
(Empire of the senseless)
(Empire of the senseless)
(Empire of the senseless)
