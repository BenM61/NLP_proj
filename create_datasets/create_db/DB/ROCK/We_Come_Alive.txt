Well it's early evening and I'm at your door 
Thinking of things to say
It's been a long hard week since I saw you now,
Baby, you're always worth the wait
I feel kinda restless, nervous I guess
But so lucky to be alive
We take the city by the hand 
It's our time tonight

We come alive

And the lights are way down low

Now I know why the night belongs 
To fools like you and me

Like thieves we steal each other's time 
We have to go back home
Got my arms around you so glad I found you
And it's something I've done on my own
Baby in just a little while we could go our separate ways
But we both know we'd fool ourselves 
This night ain't over yet

We come alive 
Yeah, we
