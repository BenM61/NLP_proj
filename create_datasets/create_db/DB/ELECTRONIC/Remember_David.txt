Remember David's eyes
The way he used to hypnotize his young
Remember David's words
The words he said to us when we were small

Remember David's hair
The way his long hair fell across his brow
Remember David's smile
I wonder where he's gone to now?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's asking questions
Tell me David, what's the secret?
Tell me David, what's the answer?

Remember David's eyes
The gray-green eyes he hides his world behind
And all the things he saw,
He saw for us when we were blind

Remember David's smile
The spirit moves tonight to make you shine
Remember David's words
The words he said would last all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, do you have the answer?
Do you have the answer?

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The day that David died
The world stood still
The stars refused to shine
And now he's far away from love
That was his only crime

The spirit moves tonight
To make your young heart
Make your young heart shine
The words he said to us
I'll carry with me for all time

He said the world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the question?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?
Tell me, David, what's the answer?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's laughing at me
Tell me, David, what's the secret?
The world keeps on turning
The world keeps on turning
The world keeps on turning?
