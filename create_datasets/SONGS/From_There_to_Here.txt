Brothers Wilber and Orville Wright
Built wings out of wood and steel
Folks said that thing'll never fly
They said, "watch, I bet it will"
We've been defyin' gravity now goin' on a hundred years
It was paper wings, faith, and dreams
That's how we got from there to here

A nickel brought a soda pop way back then
And a movie only cost a dime
He came home with a scar and a purple heart
She waited all that time
Today they'll cut a golden wedding cake
How'd they made it all those years?
It had to be tough; they just said it was love
That's how they got from there to here

You either do or you don't believe
That it can or can't be done
An ounce of faith and a touch of grace
And it can happen to anyone

Four boys, lots of noise, two-car garage
Hey, turn those guitars down 
They couldn't know that the world would grow
In time to love that sound
They headed out, in a beat-up van
And a U-Haul packed full of gear
The road was long, but the will was strong
That's how they got from there to here

Yeah, they got a bus, but you can bet they'd walk
Just to hear another crowd cheer
It was a song and a prayer and a lot of luck and you
That got us from there to here
