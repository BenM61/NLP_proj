[spoken - T.I.]
What's happenin' man this T.I.P. you know I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost
Somebody, to the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell, I done been in situations where I done had to
Cope with all three you kno what I'm saying, I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is died you kno..
But it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave. ya dig?

[Chorus]
Life's up and downs they come and go 
But when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around comes back you know
So when I die I hope I live in the sky 
All my folk who ain't survive may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky

[Verse 1]
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done that my muthaf***in folk 
And I love that n**** to death no muthaf***in joke
I can feel my eyes feelin the lord is my witness
If I catch em Imma kill em I made it my bizness
Back in the day you stayed in my bizness
Taught me I ain't have to corporate yay in my bizness
Coincedently that's why today you not wit me
My cousin died ova some yay and I miss him
Plus he had his family out let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave her life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments he still and brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life it taught me that

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 2]
Never seen a n**** go to jail and sleep til day two
Well that's how sick I was when Jayrue
Found out the hard way that wasn't powder that they were tootin
Overdosed on heron, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter she smile just like you
So cute even resorts to violence like you
You kno ya baby mama loose but haa what can you do
And I got 4 myself, yea it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, messiah, dazasha, demonte
Tell them lord they all I got so please don't take em from me
From me standin in the trap wit qerin and sir kap
Laughin at the n****s who serve with no strap
Tell them n****s man y'all trippin wit no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no hap
Me, you, and the crew just fell out ova dough and a little crack
Never could apologise cause you died that's why they say that..

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 3]
I bet you n****s think I'm living it up
Til you see polices laughing as they pickin me up
Went from seeing how many b****es I can fit in the truck
To 3 hots and a cot is you kidding or what 
F*** how many millions I got n**** so what if I'm hot 
When I got prices on my head Feds rushing my spot
A million haters want me dead forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven time felon wat you doing with dat
It's a catch 22 either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real n****s to suffer
And I ain't never been a busta always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me
A p**** n**** or polices wit a warrant for me
I'm a "G" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me wit these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If n****s only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but sometimes I couldnt take it
Got 4 kids the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my braclet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked
