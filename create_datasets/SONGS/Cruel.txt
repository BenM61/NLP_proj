She said, haven't loved in a year
I said, you have nothing to fear
We fled, but she didn't see me stay behind, no
She's got the most beautiful eyes
I've got the most beautiful life
We fled, but she didn't see me stay behind, no

And I can be cruel when it matters

He's got the most imperfect smile
Hell, I haven't kissed in a while
We fled, but she didn't see me stay behind, no
I've got all my numbers for sale
She knows how I hate when I fail
We fled, but she didn't see me stay behind, no

And I can be cruel when it matters

Cut my heart out while you can
Cut my eyes and cut my hand
Cut the boy who always blames
Cut my boys and cut my hate
All good come to those who wait
I was there stealing names

And I can be cruel when it matters
