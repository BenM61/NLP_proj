The kids need education,
And the streets are never clean,
I've seen, a certain disposition, prevailing in the wind,
Sweet change, if anybody's listening?
Emergency on planet earth.
Is that life that I am witnessing,
Or just another wasted birth.

Now, we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
Now, we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth

Think we're standing for injustice,
White gets two and black gets five years,
Took me quite a while to suss this,
But now I know my head is cleared
And a little boy in hungry land, is just a picture in the news,
Won't see him in that tv advertising, 'cause it might put you off your food

Now, we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
Now, we got emergency
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth
