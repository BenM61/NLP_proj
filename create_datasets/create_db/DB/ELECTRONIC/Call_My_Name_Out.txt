Storm dies, younger brother calls for his mother
Son, she said, follow me instead
Cloud rains tears, now the storm has cleared
Blown through time, let her mother shine

Still sees his father over the river
He pours a little his way
Shows him there's a way

Sea's calm now, but I don't know how
To bring in the tide and call the storm inside

Still sees his father over the river
He pours a little his way
Shows him there's a way

Won't be here very long
I know where I should be now

Rise and fall, and we will still be all
That we held so dear
When the storm was here

Still sees his father over the river
He pours a little his way
Shows him there's a way

Won't be here very long
I know where I should be now
Won't be here very long
I know where I should be now
