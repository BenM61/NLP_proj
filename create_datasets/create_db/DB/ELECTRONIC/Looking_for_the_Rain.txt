Children born to get high
Turn your heads to the sky
We're burnin' in the heat below

With a thorn in the side
And the ocean too high
And the avenue's so long

We'll be sufferin' here
In the blood, in the fear
If your Judas be man
I will kill you if I can

A solitary night bird is singing
Over thunder-crack you're hearing
I'm looking for the rain to fall

There's a wraith-like like shadow appearing
And though my eyes are veiled
I'm looking for the rain to fall

We'll be sufferin' here
In the blood, in the fear
If your Judas be man
I will kill you if I can

Children born to get high
Turn your heads to the sky
We're burnin' in the heat below

With a thorn in the side
And the ocean too high
And the avenue's so long

There's a wraith-like like shadow appearing
And though my eyes are veiled
I'm looking for the rain to fall

I'm looking for the rain to fall

I'm looking for the rain to fall

Army's down to defeat
All the dogs in the street are seeking shelter before a storm
I'm looking for the rain to fall

I'm looking for the rain to fall
