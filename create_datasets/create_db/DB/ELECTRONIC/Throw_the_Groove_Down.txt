(A:) Check, check. check, check it out yo'll
O'Yeah...
(R:) Come on yo'll
(A:) I want you to, I want you to
I want you to turn on the groove

You guys are un...un...unbelievable

(R:) The feeling is fine you throw down the line
The beat, the lyrics are to combined
Tonight tonight is mean't to be wild
Doing it to a level that feels alright
'Cause we're the ones yes the dancefloor fillers
Don't like crime, don't like killers
Come on over what you trying to fool
Nothing alright then throw down the groove

(A:) Throw the groove the down
Spining round and round 
We race them, we gotta pump, we can't can't get loose
Throw the groove down
Spining round and round
We turn it up, not gonna stop
Just throw down the groove 

(R:) You know that the best things in life are free
But if you don't make sure that you get a receipt
Like my man Bob Marley said 'Stand Up For Right'
Don't give the fight if you help me almight
I think there's no time for no childs' play
In the playground or perhaps another day
'Cause I in effect 'cause I coming in smooth
In other words throw down the groove

(A:) Throw the groove the down
Spining round and round 
We race them, we gotta pump, we can't can't get loose
Throw the groove down
Spining round and round
We turn it up, not gonna stop
Just throw down the groove 

(A:) Spinning round and round
Come on yo'll
Ho...! Throw the groove down
(R:) Come on yo'll

(A:) Hay... Come , come, come, come on yo'll

(A:) Throw the groove down
