I was waking in my house
I was watching for a moon
Lettuce rolling in my mouth
Washing kilos through the room

In the night, I could see
Rings of sound follow me
I was caught in between
I was born in the echoes

I won't wake up in my mouth
I won't wake up in the room

In the night, I could see
Rings of sound follow me
In the night, I could see
Rings of sound follow me
I was caught in between
I was born in the echoes

Rings move around me
