I used to be a king
And everything around me turned to gold
I thought I had everything
Now I'm left without a hand to hold

It's alright, I'm okay, how are you?
What it's worth, I must say, I love you
In my bed, late at night, I miss you

Someone is gonna take my heart
No one is gonna break my heart again

And I used to be a king
Everything around me turned to rust
It's 'cause I built my life on sand, yeah yeah
And I watched it crumble in the dust

But it's alright, I'm okay, how you are?
For what it's worth, I must say, I love you
In my bed, late at night, I miss you

Someone is gonna take my heart
No one is gonna break my heart again

I used to be a king
Everything around me, turned around me
Turned around me, turned around me
All I got to do is sing
I can lift myself way off the ground

Yeah, but it's alright, I'm okay, how are you?
For what it's worth, I must say, I love you
In my bed, late at night, God, how I miss you

Someone is gonna take my heart
No one is gonna break my heart again
