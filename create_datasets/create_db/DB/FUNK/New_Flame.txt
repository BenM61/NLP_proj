I was bowled out
I was sold down the river
And her warm heart
Would turn me forever
She's turned me round

A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong

I am stern now
Petty words don't believe me
But her warm smile
Is never gonna leave me
'Cause she's turned me round

But a new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
Oh no wrong oh no wrong oh no wrong oh no alright

she's made of real glass
She got real real emotion
But my heart laughs
I have that same sweet devotion
'Cause she's turned me round

A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong

A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
Oh no wrong oh no wrong oh no
(Nothing she can do can ever do me wrong)

Wrong oh no wrong oh no
(Nothing she can do can ever do me wrong)
Wrong oh no wrong oh no
(Nothing she can do can ever do me wrong)
Wrong oh no wrong oh no
(Nothing she can do can ever do me wrong)

Wrong oh no wrong oh no
(Nothing oh no no no no)
Wrong oh no wrong oh no
(Nothing no no no no)
Wrong oh no wrong oh no
(Nothing no no no no)
