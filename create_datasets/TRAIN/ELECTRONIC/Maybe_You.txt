We used to talk about it
Until the darks of the world made me blind
And I forgot about it
'Cause I nurture the clouds in my eye

And all those times I lost myself in lies
It was you I was trying to find
And though it really hurt sometimes
It was always true 
(Oh)

Maybe you
And your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
Out of all these lies
Maybe you
And your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
If you come tonight

And if you thought about it
If it's there in the back of your mind
And if you still remember
If you're reading my name between the lines

And If you got an emptiness inside
We should let our worlds recollide 
And though it really hurt sometimes
It was always true
(Oh)

Maybe you
And your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
Out of all these lies
Maybe you
And your sad blue eyes
Pull me through
If you come tonight
