What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
It's the only thing that there's just too little of 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
No, not just for some, but for everyone 

Look, we don't need another mountain 
There are oceans and rivers 
Enough to cross, enough to last 
Until the end of time 

What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
It's the only thing that there's just too little of 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
No, not just for some, but for everyone 

Lord we dont need another meadow
There are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sun beams and moon beams enough to shine
This I know, if you want to know

What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
It's the only thing that there's just too little of 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
No, not just for some, but for everyone 

What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
What the world needs right about now 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 

What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
It's the only thing that there's just too little of 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
No, not just for some, just for everyone

It's the only thing that there's just too little of 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
No, not just for some, but for everyone
