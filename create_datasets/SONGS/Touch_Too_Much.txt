When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again

I lift my head and it falls again
I take a step and I fall
I never ask for much

I watch my hand in shake in love
And it is always thus
I never ask for much

When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again

If I said enough's enough you'd know
I'd call on your brother he would show
It'd be on his face I would not stare
But beyond our best attempts we'd care

It was a really long time ago
When you were a friend of mine
And I would really like you to know
It would help to ease my mind
I would hold you up again if you asked me
I would hold you up again if you asked me
I would hold you up again if you asked me
I would hold you up again if you asked me

When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again

When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
When you said it's a touch too much I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again
