(Alright)
I am the new
For reasons I can never explain
I speak the truth
I put an end to all your pain
I want guilt, I want to drag you right through your past
I'm on a role
And I'm moving way to fast

(Alright)
Aren't we always looking over our shoulders
Aren't we always drawing guns from our holsters

I'm at the start to check every hour of the day
I stand well above
And mold you with my clay
Out of the depth, every soul can pay a fee
Those who are kept
I'm gonna set you free

(Alright)
Aren't we always looking over our shoulders
Aren't we always drawing guns from our holsters

I'll shed light
Tear apart all you believe
One of us
Grateful for all you receive
Make it up, do you find it hard to contain
Pray in God, can you hold it all inside your brain

(Alright)
Aren't you always getting scared of the future
Aren't you always thinking someone will shoot you
Aren't we always looking over our shoulders
Aren't we always drawing guns from our holsters
