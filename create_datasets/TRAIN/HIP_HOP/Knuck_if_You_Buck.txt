But we start to swing we makin' n****s hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thang

Crime mob n****s gettin started
And we n****s be the hardest
So if a n**** come and run his mouth just like ho
Punch 'em dead up in his nose
And stomp his a** down to the flo'

Yeah we knuckin' and buckin' and ready to fight
I betcha I'm'a throw dem thangs
So haters best to think twice
See me I ain't nothin nice
And crime mob it ain't no stoppin'

Jumpin off from on the stage
Throwin'dem bows like Johnny Cage
All my n****s startin' riots
Knockin down the barracade
Everywhere we be to deep
And M.O.B is to elite
The flawless n****s lawless 
You be jawless gettin' close to me
Bullets bussin' constantly
Ravagin' yo' city streets
Broken bones lay alones scattered 'cross the concrete
Knuckin' if you buckin' you'll be duckin'
If you get too close
In my eyes you wasn't wise
I think it's time I knuck you ho

I come in da club
Shakin my dreads, throwin these bows
And bussin these heads
B**** you irrelevant step to my residence
Besta back up boy I thank you for that 
I'ma a Diamond committing no crime
Not leavin a trace not leavin a line
We knuckin and buckin 'cause I got a nine
I blow you away 'cause you wastin my time
Stupid a** n****s y'all know what to do
I wax yo a** you f*** wit' my crew
I'm through wit you haters so watch what you do
You talkin bout me then I'm talkin' to you
You buckin on us 'cause we leadin' yo cla** 
Keep bussin' on me and that s*** gone get nasty
I'm colder than ice and I'm freezing out here
I target yo city but you cannot tell

Knuck if you buck boy
But you betta come equip
I got some s*** off in my trunk that's gonna make yo body flip hollow tips
Bussin off the rip soon as a hit the do'
Anybody make a false move dead bodys on the flo'
