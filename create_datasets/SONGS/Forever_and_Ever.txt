Forever and ever, my heart will be true
Sweetheart, for ever, I'll wait for you
We both made a promise that we'd never part
Let's seal it with a kiss forever, my sweetheart

Let bygones be bygones forever
We'll fall in love once again
So let's tell the world of our new love divine
For ever and ever you'll be mine

Forever and ever, my heart will be true
Sweetheart, for ever, I'll wait for you
We both made a promise that we'd never part
Let's seal it with a kiss forever, my sweetheart

Let bygones be bygones forever
We'll fall in love once again
So let's tell the world of our new love divine
For ever and ever you'll be mine

My heart will be true
I'll wait for you
Let's seal it with a kiss forever, my sweetheart
