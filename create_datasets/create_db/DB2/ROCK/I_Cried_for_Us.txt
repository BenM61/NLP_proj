Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Love you don't see the pain in me
It's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cry for us, I cry for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff, easy enough
And if you chose, I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
A time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
