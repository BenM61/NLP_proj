Need to ask a question
Calling out my name
Nothing seems to bother
Wish I had a clue
Come on abuse me more I like it

Well I don't think you like me
Well I hate you as well
No one seems to like you
Wish I couldn't tell

Come on abuse me more I like it
Come on keep talking 'cause it's true
Come on abuse me more I like it
Come on keep talking 'cause it's true

Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard, overboard

Come on abuse me more I like it
Come on keep talking 'cause it's true

Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard

Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard, overboard
