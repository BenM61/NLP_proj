Two young lovers on a Blytheville back road
Laying on the levee makin' love all night long
Wishing on a star in a southern sky
Dreaming out loud about the rest of their lives

They were lost, lost in love in a Delta dreamland
They were lost, lost in love in a Delta dreamland

She worked all day at the old shirt factory
Thinking 'bout the boy that made her happy
Across the street at the hardware store
He was busy reliving the night before

When they were lost, lost in love in a Delta dreamland
Yes, they were lost, lost in love in a Delta dreamland

She was seventeen and he was twenty
When they left their home for the land of plenty
Times were tough but they made it through
They lived to see their dreams come true, yeah, yeah

The years rolled by like river water
They said goodbye to three grown daughters
Together all alone again
Just like they started way back when

They were lost, lost in love in a Delta dreamland
Yes, they were lost, lost in love in a Delta dreamland

Two young lovers on a Blytheville back road
Laying on the levee makin' love all night long, yeah, yeah
