I can feel the whole world spinnin' around
I'm losin' ground, I feel it every day
And I can feel you comin' inside out
I'm losin' touch with all reality

I remember the look in your eyes
The way that they pulled me inside

All I've got now in my defense
Is my innocence, I've been hypnotised
Hypnotised

I can hear the church bells ringin' out loud
Reminds me of some bright and sunshine day
When all the pretty horses you would ride
Would come right back to feel your energy

I still remember the look in your eyes
The way that they filled me inside

All I've got now in my defense
Is my innocence, I've been hypnotised
You know it won't be easy, it's never easy
I've been hypnotised

So tell me what you think, do you think
I'll sink number one scapegoat?
I'm the missin' link, all I know
I've been hypnotised, it won't be easy

If you've got a heart that burns inside
Let me get inside, let me tangle with the flames
If you've got a light that burn inside
The heat will rise and melt down once again

I still remember the look in your eyes
The way that they pulled me inside

All I've got now in my defense
Is my innocence, I've been hypnotised
All I've got now in my defense
Is my innocence, I've been hypnotised

So tell me what you think, do you think
I'll sink number one scapegoat?
I'm the missin' link, all I know
I've been hypnotised, it won't be easy

Maybe there's a way, I can find a way
Final hour, judgment day
All I know, I've been hypnotised
And never realize
