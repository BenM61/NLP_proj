There was light before
The rain began
And there was hope
Behind the suffering joke

Lies come
Lies they go
Even the sun is tired
Under the surfaces
There is a benevolent drone
Do you feel it?

So brutal when the words are on
The tip of your tongue
So strange when your tired eyes won't
Shut your brain down

Hold back the melancholy
Hold back the fear, darling
It's a crime

Hold back the fear
Hold back the melancholy
It's a crime

Sometimes I can taste my death
Like a candy bar
So sweet and complete
As infinity takes me
This fool's end

I create to keep that dog in my bearable door
I made hologram
In my egocentric universe of

You're alive
But you know that the wire
Under you is bending
And the truth is always telling you to be
Immune to everything

Hold back the melancholy
Hold back the fear, darling
It's a crime

Hold back the fear
hold back the melancholy
It's a crime

Hold back the fear
Hold back the darkness
Hold back the melancholy
Hold back the melancholy
It's a crime
