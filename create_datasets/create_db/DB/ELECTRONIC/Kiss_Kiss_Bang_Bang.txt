A beautiful sight. We lay down inside. My head it never believed the tide.

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (chorus)

A beautiful sight. We lay down inside. Our head it never will leave the tide.
You understating, understand your undeceiving, and it's sad the breach comes with the peace it makes you like you want. Hear this.. Kiss! 
And Bang... 1....2.....3....4....5....6......7

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (chorus)

I know your watching, so why you could wear that Leather(?). Our friends talk talk about the weather. I know your waiting, why you waiting to exist(?) Scar, Scar, and now you take chances(?). Since your a suicide my bro.. trash trash my gash, oh it's the gas.
