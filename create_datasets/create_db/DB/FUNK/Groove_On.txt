Chorus
Gotta get my groove on
Baby can you move on
Gotta get gotta get
Gotta get my grove on

Gotta get my groove on
Baby can you move on
Gotta get gotta get
Gotta get my groove on

Things is hard 
I might need a little bit
Just for the hell of it
For the feel I get

Nice and slow grind to the
bone
Toe to toe don't you know
Oh baby come on
That's how I get my groove on

Chorus

To the left a little to the right
Keep me groovin' all through
the night
Going high going low with the
groove on
Flow in the nine fo' now here 
we go

Adjust the tempo
The groove is pretty simple
Steady and consistent
Can I get a witness

Back and forth movin'
Steady as we're groovin'
My song is 'bout to come on
That's how I get my groove on

Chorus

I wanna groove groove
Groove groove groove babe

Chorus
