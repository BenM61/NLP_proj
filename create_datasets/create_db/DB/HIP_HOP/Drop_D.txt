The days have passed when there weren't enough days before them to say remember when 
But you still say i can't wait until and you're still dreaming
I guess some things never die and the ones that do make you cry
And that one little sparkle in your eye is what keeps you going on and on
When you smile is it just for the lights
And when you pray does it come from deep inside
Did today look good when you went to bed last night

Every morning starts with a sunrise and no fair warning for what might pass your eyes
So don't let them make your head spin
Throw out a line and pull your soul in
Call your mother and tell her that you're fine

When you hurt there's always a reason why
But grief and pain are only passers by
So make sure tomorrow looks good before you sleep tonight

Don't ever let them bring you down
Try not to let them make you frown
'Cause in the morning when the light shines in
You know today you might win
