Out go the lights
In goes my Knife
Pull out his life
Consider that bastard dead
Get on your knees
Please beg me please
You're the king of sleaze
Don't you try to rape me

Bastard
Consider that bastard dead
Bastard
Won't get screwed again
Whoa! Whoa!
Bastard
Make it quick blow off his head

Got your neck in the noose
I got nothing to loose
We're really gonna screw you
Consider that bastard dead
Quick as a shark
Beast has its mark
You can't beat the dark
Don't you try to rape me
