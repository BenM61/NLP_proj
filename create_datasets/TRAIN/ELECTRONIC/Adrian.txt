I've been wasting my days on a nine to five
Spending dollars when I only make a dime
While you're surfing the waters in paradise
Oh, Adrian I wanna be like you

I wanna trade my worries
I wanna trade my troubles
All for a golden journey
Oh, Adrian I wanna be like you, be like you, be like you, be like you

I wanna trade my worries
I wanna trade my troubles
All for a golden journey
Oh, Adrian I wanna be like you, be like you, be like you, be like you

I've been wasting my days on a nine to five
Spending dollars when I only make a dime
While you're surfing the waters in paradise
Oh, Adrian I wanna be like you, be like you, be like you, be like you

I wanna trade my worries
I wanna trade my troubles
All for a golden journey
Oh, Adrian I wanna be like you, be like you, be like you, be like you
