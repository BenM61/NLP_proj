Been burned, 
And with both feet on the ground.
I've learned, 
That it's painful comin' down.
No use runnin' away, 
And there's no time left to stay.
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',
No time left and I know I'm losin'.

Flashed, 
And I think I'm fallin' down,
Crashed, 
And my ears can't hear a sound.
No use runnin' away, 
And there's no time left to stay.
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',
No time left and I know I'm losin'.

Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin',
No time left and I know I'm losin'.
