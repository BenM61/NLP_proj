Well girls will be boys
And boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world
Well some like it hot
And some like it cool
Well like it or not
This is what you got
A space age party
That's never gonna stop

Aah aah aah aah
Rio rocks
Rio rocks
It's a city in shock
Yeah Rio rocks
On Ipanema beach
We got two girls each
And everbody you meet
They're rockin' to the beat
Let's get crazy
Let's strip in the street
'cause some like it hot

And some like it cook
Well like it or not
This is what you got
A space age party
That's never gonna stop

So let's get high
So let's get high
So let's get high
On a free supply
What a crystal champagne
Rock 'n' roll way to die
