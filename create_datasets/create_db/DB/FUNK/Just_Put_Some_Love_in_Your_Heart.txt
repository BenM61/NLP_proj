just put some love in your heart.
And all of your troubles will.
Someday,soon all depart.

Let's put some joy in the world.
And give the word happiness.
To every boy and girl.

Why can't we understand.
That the whole world wants to live?
With so many reaching out.
Is love so hard to give?

Just put some love in your heart.
