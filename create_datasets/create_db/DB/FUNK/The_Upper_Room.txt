In the upper room with Jesus
Sitting at His blessed feet
Daily there my sin confessing
Begging for His mercy sweet

Trusting in His grace and power
Seeking there His love in prayer
It is then I feel the Spirit
As I sit with Him up there

In the upper with Jesus
In the upper room with my Lord
In the upper room
In the upper room
It's in the upper room
Yes, with my Lord

In the upper with Jesus
In the upper room I'm talking with my Lord, my blessed Lord
In the upper room
In the upper room
It's in the upper room
Yes, with the Lord
