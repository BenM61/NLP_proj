I can melt your deepest pain
Catch you out and give it back again
I can fill your each and every hour
Watching over you when no one's there

Standing still and motionless
Getting closer to the edge
You can hear the silent voices in your head
And you try turning back
But you're caught in a trap
'Till you find your conscience stops you in your tracks

Better get in touch with yourself
Do what you feel I'll make it real
Better get in touch with yourself
Because I'm the one you need so don't mess with me

Closer than a night of tenderness
Distant as you let each moment pass
But if you lose the gift that you recieve
Nothing fills the emptiness it leaves

Standing still and motionless
Getting closer to the edge
You can hear the silent voices in your head
And you try turning back
But you're caught in a trap
'Till you find your conscience stops you in your tracks

Better get in touch with yourself
Do what you feel I'll make it real
Better get in touch with yourself
Because I'm the one you need so don't mess with me
