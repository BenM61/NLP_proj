Are you far away, in a new life?
Are you wearing the same dress that you wore
When we met the first night?
Are you feeling it, in a different time?
Are you telling the same jokes that you told me
When we met the first time?

[Chorus]
The first time that we slept with the light on
And the sun's coming up and you woke up on the floor
Everything that you feel that you can't describe
Why can't it be like the first week?
Am I far away in your thoughts sometimes?
Are you telling your friends that you can't live
Without him like when we met the first time?
Do you lie awake and you wonder why
Is it always the same thing or is this just a new
Dream that's keeping you up at night?

[Chorus]

And I've been up and down your street, calling your house
I won't wait up 'til you get home
I just may be better off alone
The first time that we slept with the light on
and the sun's coming up and you woke up on the floor
Everything that you feel that you can't describe
Why can't it be

The first night that we slept with the light off
And the stars shine above and all our clothes are on the floor
Everything that I feel that I can't describe
Why can't it be like the first week
