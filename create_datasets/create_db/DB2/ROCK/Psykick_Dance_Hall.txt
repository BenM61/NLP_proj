Is there anybody there?
Yeah!

Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock
Rocky! Rocky!
Is quester psykick dance-hall
Step forward for
ESP medium discord

My garden is made of stone
There's a computer center over the road
I saw a monster on the roof
Its colors glowed on the roof

Round the corner
Is quester psykick dancehall
Step forward for
ESP medium discord

Here they have no records
They know your questions about no words
Just bumble stumble to the waves
Twitching out to the waves

Clock it! Clock it!
It's quester psykick dance-hall
Never bored with
ESP medium discord

When I'm dead and gone
My vibrations will live on
In vibes on vinyl through the years
People will dance to my waves

Rock it! Rock it!
It's quester psykick dance-hall
Step aboard for
ESP medium discord 

You gotta come
For a mental orgasm
