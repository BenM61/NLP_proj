Angela mia, you are my angel, dear,
The heavens sent you down to me from up above.

Angela mia, you are my guiding star,
A sweet Madonna that I honor and I love.

You're like the sunshine in all its splendor
And I surrender each time you smile.

Angela mia, my prayers are answered now
And I am thankful for Angela mia.
