(Cold 187um)
 
See it was seven o'clock
and the sun had just set
the crew rolled up and said it time to jet
I was kinda hesitatin' cause it was nothing to do
but we always find something to get into
Total-Kaos broke out he said lets go to the movies
he was paying so I wasn't being choosy
jumped in the ride and proceeded to go
"yo what are we goin' to see?"
"yo man I don't know"
but when we got there it was a quarter to nine
to see the main flick it was a long as line
paid to get in and not a second before 
a sucka looked me up and down at the front door 
now I shined on and walked on in 
but he kept on staring again and again
I walked up and said "what's up"
he said: "not you"
I turned around and then I looked at my crew
because I know he didn't say what I thought he said
and if he did 
I'm gonna have his head on a platter
the sucka scared out
when we got ill
the brother who tried to front he got his caps pilled
and his homies they got mad 
but they soon broke out
because of what we had

chorus:
because I take out my weapon 
and I quickly start blastin'
I go total loco like a crazy assassin
I look at my posse they say nothings confusin'
why? why? why?
it's just another execution

See it was early 
we was bored uptight
so we rushed up to In-and-Out
to get a bite to eat
I saw a freak I hadn't seen in a while
the one with the crazy eyes and the pretty smile
she was def you know what I mean
the hoe was stacked to the max 
in a skin-tight jean
she sat across the room 
and try to stare at me
then send a note about how she wants to get with me
now I'm wonderin' what has changed
is it that I'm rockin' the house
and that I'm makin' a name for myself
cause when I first met her
all she said I did with her was upset her
I think that sneak she's tryin' to play me down
cause I ain't the one that likes to be clowned
so I told the hoe to leave me alone
I said girl you need to take your stuck up ass home
at this second her boy walked in
I said man do I have to act crazy again
then I grabbed my weapon it's time to get ill
you can say it is cool or you can straight get pilled
with buck shots I mean all over the place
in your back, your side
in your stomach, in your face
cause I don't really care what your girlfriend says
if you keep talkin' shit you get a bullet in your head
so anyway what your beefin' about
if I wanted your hoe she'd  be already turned out
she's jockin me 
she might go with you
now checkin' your girl is what you need to do
