Here's what you can dream on and it's all I can give you
Come with me now and leave it all behind 
I don't know what you want me to say
It's been too long let's fly away 

Waiting for no one 
Only the waiting 
For our day in the sun
Live to the rhythm 
The rhythm of living 
For our day in the sun 

When you start to feel you've had all you can take
Time keeps on moving but this mood you can't shake
When I hear you talk in you're sleep
I know where blue water's run deep

Listen to me 
I want to tell you 
Got a love that's inside 
And you gave it back to me 
Every time we're apart 

I get a feeling I don't want to start
I want you back 
I don't ever have to be 
Without you
