M with the I with the S-T double E Q
All I want is to be with you
Mis-teeq with the one sun-ship

[Chorus]
All I want
Is to be with you
But I just got to live, live my own life too
All I need to know (need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine
That's all (that's all)
Firing it up and away we go

Sitting looking in the mirror like Alice
Through the looking glass
Life's a never ending journey be careful not to go too fast
Sometimes I can't help myself from falling in too deep
I know it may be hard to tell your love is calling me
Oh-ah, all I want to be, oh-ah
And away we go
Oh-ah, all I want is (oh-ah)
Gonna get on the mic, gonna make you whine

All I want
Is to be with you
But I just got to live, live my own life too
All I need to know (need to know that the world)
That the world is nuts snap my fingers (fingers) and
Everything is fine
That's all (that's all)

Floating on a river of dreams on a magic carpet ride
Take control of my destiny I know it's just a matter of time
That I will find that midas touch
And everything will turn to gold
It would mean nothing without you here to hold

Oh-ah, all I want to be, oh-ah
And away we go
Oh-ah, all I want is oh-ah
Gonna get on the mic, gonna make you whine

[Chorus]

I can read it in the stars that what I want is who you are
I will lay my hair down for you a thousand times to show you
That when you reach me at the top
I'm gonna give you all I got
And wherever we go our hearts will follow

It's a UK thing, stuff that we bring
No one to burn, let the journey begin
We're the Mis-teeq, we're in chorus we sing
Quick off the mark, ring a ding ding ding
In a mix with a bag of tricks
Feel the vibe with the one sun-ship
Move to the beat it's about music
Roll through these tracks with fresh tactics

[Chorus: x2]

Oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah oh-ah
Boy I want to be with you (woah)
I want to live my own life too (woah)
And I got to have it all (woah)
That's all (that's all)
That's all (woah)
I'm gonna snap my fingers (woah)
Everything is fine (woah)
Want to have it all (woah)
Woah-ah woah-ah woah-ah woah-ah
Woah-ah woah-ah woah-ah woah-ah
