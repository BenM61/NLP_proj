She wakes up early every morning
She get up long before the sunshine
Greets the milkman who's still yawning
And reads the paper for a short time
Calls the kids "get out of bed"
They never hear a word she says

Husband stands to leave the table
She says "i hope you have a good day"
He thinks "one day soon as i'm able
I'll get a job where i get good pay."

They find it hard to make ends meet
But they don't mention it because they have each other
An love is free while they're supposed to be ...

Too young to be married
Too young to be free
Too young to be married
But what could they do, they were going to have a baby

After the kids have had their breakfast
Now they're off to get some schooling
She cleans the house and makes the beds
She starts to dreams but knows she's fooling

She swears one day she'll stay in bed
But for now she knows she's got to keep on working
''cause round and round inside her head
She hears the words her mother said ...

Too young to be married
Too young to be free
Too young to be married
But what could they do, they were going to have a baby

Too young to be married
Too young to be free
Too young to be married
But what could they do?
