How can I forget your tender smile
Moments that I have shared with you
Our hearts may break
But they're on their way
And there's nothing I can do

Oh, so do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You know you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
I'd do it again

I can understand that it can't be
Guess it's hard as you were meant for me
But I can't hide my own despair
I guess I never will

Oh, so do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You know you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
I'd do it again

So tired of life
No fairy-tale 
So hold your fire
'Cause I need you

Oh, just do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You know you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
I'd do it again

Do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You keep going over every word that we've said
But you don't have to worry 'bout me
