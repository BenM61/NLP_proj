The love I lost
Was a sweet love
The love I lost
Was complete love
The love I lost
I will never, no, no, never
Love again, ooh

I can remember planning
Building my whole world around you
I can remember hoping
That you and I could make it on through

But something went wrong
We loved each other
We just couldn't get along
Take a good look at me
I'm in misery, can't you see?

The love I lost (the love, the love I lost)
Was a sweet love (yes it was)
The love I lost
Was complete love

The love I lost
I will never, no, no, never (never, no never)
Love again, ooh

I can't remember nothing, no no no
But the good times we used to share, my love
I'm so sad and lonely
Without you, my life is so dead

I'm sorry to say
You go your way and I'll go my way
It hurts deep inside
The day we said goodbye, but

The love I lost (the love, the love I lost)
Was a sweet love (yes it was)
The love I lost
Was complete love

The love I lost,
I will never, no, no, never (never, no never)
Love again (I will never love again)
I will never, no, no, never (never, no never)
Love again, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I will never, no, no, never (never, never)
Love again, oh

Never, no, no, never
Love again (never, never, never)
