Kisses that kill me are my friends 
I'm wasted on nothing now, but you again 
Shifting the colors from room to room 
I'm burning your images with my attitude 

[Chorus]
Naked desire blows me away haven't you noticed 
I won't ever go let you suffer no pain 
Like bottleflies 
I won't be the same in this vaseline cage 
Like bottleflies 

Sweet smell of roses around me 
Trapped in moments of fantasy 
Breaking my mind from myself, so hard to find 

[Chorus]
