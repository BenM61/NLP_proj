Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah!

D-D-D-Dead and buried
What was created, went on before
Burn your art out like some cheap old whore
You're all old and boring now
All the milk's been taken from the cow.

D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead and buried

Switched my sulph to Ajax
Ain't high but I'm clean
Never eat anything with a face on it
Know what I mean?

D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead and buried
Dead

Asthma attack in a purple haze
Your cards are numbered and so are my days
The living ain't easy, the living ain't clean
Makes me hot, makes me naked
Makes me feel just plain obscene
Know what I mean?

D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead and buried
Dead

Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Ah!

D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead and buried

Living ain't clean, living ain't easy
Makes me feel just plain obscene
Know what I mean?

Dead dead dead!
Switched my sulph to Ajax
Ain't high but I'm clean
Never eat anything with a face on it
Know what I mean?

D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead and buried

Ah ah!
Ah ah!

Asthma attack in a purple haze
The cards are numbered and so are your days
Living ain't easy, living ain't clean
Makes me feel plain obscene
Know what I mean?

D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead and buried

Now we're all on board the mystery train
Don't know where we're going
And if we did
It's all the same

D-D-D-Dead and buried
D-D-D-Dead ah!
Ah ah!
Mm
