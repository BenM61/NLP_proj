There you were freaking out
Trying to get your head
Around the fact that
Me and you and
Love is dead
See how I'm trippin' out
'Cause you can't decide
What you really want from me
Why does it have
To be like this
I can never tell
'Cause you make me
Love you, love you, baby
With a little "L"

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations
Getting upset
In your desperation
Screaming and hollerin'
How can this love
Become so paper thin
You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat
Just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothin' more
If you ain't givin' nothin' to me

Don't you know that

You make love you
Love you baby
With a little "L"
Why does it have
To be like this
I can never tell

Seems like you're
Stepping on the pieces
Of my broken shell
'Cause you make me love you
Love you, with a little "L"
You know
That's the way you
Make me love you, yeah

Why does it have
To be like this
I can never tell
'Cause you make me
Love you, love you, baby
With a little "L"

Why does it have
To be like this
I can never tell
'Cause you make me
Love you, love you, baby
With a little "L"

Why does it have
To be like this
I can never tell
'Cause you make me
Love you, love you, baby
With a little "L"
