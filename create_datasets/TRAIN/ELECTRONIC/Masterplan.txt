Early in the morning
My friends already calling
Ready for a party
They're just getting started
Wouldn't miss it for a moment
My heart's already stolen
Heard he's gonna be there
To miss it wouldn't be fair
No, no, no, no, no, no

When a woman wants her man
She'll catch him any way she can
I'm telling you I got a master plan
I'm gonna get you boy
Make you my man

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, de

Driving down the highway
Roberta, Donnie Hathaway, yeah yeah
Playing on the airwaves
As we're making our way
We pull up to a red light
Check the mirror for the last time (for the last time)
I know I'm looking just fine and I feel all right
'cause I know I'm gonna party tonight, yeah, baby

When a woman wants her man

Walking through the party
With all my girls behind me, yeah, yeah
Suddenly I saw him
My heart it started jumping (and jumping and jumping and jumping)
Then he led me to the dance floor
Then he held me closely (so closely, baby)
Then he whispered softly (ooh)
Will you be my one and only
My only girl

When a woman wants her man
She'll catch him any way she can
