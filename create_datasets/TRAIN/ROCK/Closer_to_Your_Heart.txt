It's the same old story
When someone astounds you
The harder they come 
Yes the harder they fall
Takin' it easy
No matter what people say
And time will heal all your troubles away

I've got a notion 
I might as well be closer to your heart
It's out in the open
I might as well be closer to your heart

Tossing and turning 
And burning dreams across the night
(forever searching)
Silently waiting for such a long time
But will I know tomorrow
If you will be mine?

I've got a notion 
I might as well be closer to your heart
It's out in the open
I might as well be closer to your heart

So it's the same old story
When someone astounds you
That the harder they come 
Yes the harder they fall
Like takin' it easy
No matter what people say
And time will heal all your troubles away

I've got a notion 
I might as well be closer to your heart
It's out in the open
I might as well be closer to your heart

I've got a notion 
I might as well be closer to your heart
It's out in the open
I might as well be closer to your heart
