Leave home today.
escape your region.
it's in your head, keep moving on.
become your dad.
live unquestioned.
it's in your head, nostalgia is death.
choose starlight.
no way to retrace.

it is gone.
choose star bright.
no way to retrace.
it is gone.
no way to retrace all your good days add them up.
it is gone.
none of you knew any more then. leave it here.
it is gone.

can't depend on honest answers from dependent hands.
won't accept an honest answer from an open hand.
say the words and i sign off.
starlight star bright.
