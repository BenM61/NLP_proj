Hey, when we showered
And I fainted on the floor
I was free swimming in light
You were so scared

You washed my hair
In bright red water
You really thought
I was dead

I know why you make me so scared
You're all I can see
You speak and my hearing's impaired
You're all over me

Late in your bed
You held my head for a while
Said goodnight and flew away

I know why you make me so scared
You're all I can see
You speak and my hearing's impaired
You're all over me
