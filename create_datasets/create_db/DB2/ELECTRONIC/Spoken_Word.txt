Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good

I believe in the meaning of spoken word
The feeling of freedom and healing the bleeding
In need of a reason, I wrote this verse
Yo, I hope this works
Being strong feels exactly the same as being weak
The difference is you don't quit
Not until you reach the peak
I believe in the mean of the spoken word
It's more than a speech to speak
It's what I feel when I'm sitting in your presence
The answers are written in your essence
It's all a test to see if you're made for it
But best believe it's your claim on it
'Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free
('Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it)

You're gonna go through things you don't deserve
And it's gonna hurt like an open nerve
So just know your soul's as old as earth
And whatever you do, don't be told its worth
Being strong feels exactly the same as being weak
The difference is you don't quit
Not until you reach the peak
I believe in the mean of the spoken word
It's more than a speech to speak
It's what I feel when I'm sitting in your presence
The answers are written in your essence
It's all a test to see if you're made for it
So go for it, you can't wait for it
'Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free
('Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it)

Everybody's free to feel good (it's your fight, your glory, your right, your story)
Everybody's free to feel good (it's your fight, your glory, your right, your story)
