Names that sound familiar 
Secret hope for failure
Try and look into their eyes 
A part of the weekend never dies 
There's no tension in your dance 
As you try and hold my hand 

It's not you it's the e-talking 
Closing in on the translation 
It's not you it's the e-talking 
I'm not sure which part I'm playing 

Looking like an in between 
Faces you have never seen 
Sirens scream, alarms go wild
Rock star paid me well to lie 
As you leave things look the same 
But I can't recall your name 

It's not you it's the e-talking 
Closing in on the translation 
It's not you it's the e-talking 
I'm not sure which part I'm playing 

Stranger at your own 
Party feels like home 
Late night phone calls 
Try to please all 

It's not you it's the e-talking 
Closing in on the translation 
It's not you it's the e-talking 
I'm not sure which part I'm playing
