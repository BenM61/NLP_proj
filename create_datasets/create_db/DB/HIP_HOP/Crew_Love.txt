Ooh, ooh
Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooh

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C-4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C-4
Twenty, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's and the trash we going
Straight to the top, rooftop close
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light skinned chick first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls first flight from Poland

Why? 'Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew ooh

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like fifty k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say "your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story, it made history
Tell em I'ma need reservations for twenty
I never really been one for the preservation of money nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and XO is everything you believe in I know

They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew ooh,
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew ooh,
'Cause we blowing like a C-4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C-4
If you broadcast swag, nigga we the news in the city
