Whatever you want I got it papi
Don't hesitate holla at me
What I'm looking for is simple you see
Love and support and sexuality
When I'm with you, I don't want to leave
I need you just like the air I breathe
But when I'm not with you I'm missing my peace
I got a lot inside I need to release

You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you you take me higher

[Chorus]
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needing
When I go ill come back
Cause there is no way I'm leaving
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needing
When I go ill come back
Cause there is no way I'm leaving

There is no way you are getting away
I need your love every day
Medicine can't cure the way that I feel
What I need is my inner fill
Being without you its making me ill
Stressing me out I need to chill
Something this strong gotta be real
Nothing or no one show my skills

You fulfill my every desire (oh yes you did)
When I'm (when I'm) with you (With you)You take me higher (oh you are)

[Chorus]

I admit that I'm a prisoner of your sex appeal (sex appeal)
I can't seem to find a way to escape how I feel (how I feel)
I can't wait no longer please come give a dose to me (dose to me)
Breathings getting stronger need you now close to me

[Chorus: x4]
