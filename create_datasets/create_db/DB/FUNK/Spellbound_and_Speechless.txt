Across a crowded room, set apart from it all
You took my breath away (yes, you did)

Like a sparkle in the dark
You smiled and I knew
That you would make my dreams come true

[Chorus:]
Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound and speechless
Spellbound
Spellbound

It's unbelievable, I hardly know you at all
Still you make me feel this way
You're unpredictable
In all the things that you do
Now my heart belongs to you (yes, it does)

[Chorus]

I'm bein' true to myself
With every word I say, in all the things I do
And though you may not feel the same
You know I'm there for you
I can't stop lovin' you
Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound

[Chorus x 3]
