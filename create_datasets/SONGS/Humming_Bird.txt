Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering near me
As I would need you to fly away, don't fly away

What can I say? You have to wait
I find it hard to say it articulate
I know that there's nowhere else you'd rather be

It seems so clear I know it true
That all I wanna do is make to love you
I know that there's no where else you'd rather be

Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering near me
And I need you to fly away

Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering near me
And I need you to fly away, don't fly away

Birds are in around my head, things you have done
The words you have said, your memory after you left
I try but I can't forget

Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering around me
Don't fly away
