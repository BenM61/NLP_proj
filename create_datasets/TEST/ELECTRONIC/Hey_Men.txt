Hey!
Somebody told me to live is a lie
But I know better got a woman inside
Tells me things that I should understand
'cause I know better even though I'm a man
So many things go in so many ways
Every single moment like a judgment day
Thank goodness things are gettin better for sure
I got the message
Love is the cure
Uh huh
Oooh yeah

Now I ain't stupid but I can't understand
Why so many things are gettin so out of hand
Think we should wonder what the problem could be?
All the world over sing "I want to be free"
Don't really matter what you think of me now
'cause I got the message
The message is wow
Got everything, got nothing to hide

I got... what?
I got a woman inside
Uh huh
Oooh yeah

I said, hey men.
Quit knocking your children 'round
I say, hey-hey men.
Quit mowin your women down
'cause it's all in the way
That you look at who you are
So hey hey men
Quit looking so far
Oooh yeah

Land of the free is a poor alibi
I learned my lesson when I learned how to fly
Sounds so silly but I think its the truth
I got the message
The message is you
Somebody told me that we live in a dream
Sounds like something that you hear on t.v.
Got everything even though I'm a guy
Feels so good
I got a woman inside
Uh huh
Oooh yeah

I said, hey men
Quit pushin your women 'round
I say, hey -hey men
Quit knockin' your children down
'cause it's all in the things
That you do with what you are
So, hey hey men
Whatcha been doing so far?

Playing guitar!
I said, hey men.
Quit knocking your children 'round
I say, hey-hey men.
Quit mowin your women down
'cause it's all in the way
That you look at who you are
So hey hey men
Quit looking so far

Epilogue:
We got more rock and roll than we ever deserved
Some of us were fishes, some of us were worms.
