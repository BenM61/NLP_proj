If you wanna go crazy and act like a clown
Be the laughing stock all over town
That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

If you stick your nose some place it don't belong
Don't you come to me if things go wrong
That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

When you're making your bed
Remember you'll do the lying there
When you buttered your bread
Don't expect me to eat your share!

If you're gonna play horses and blow your dough
Don't you run to me if they don't show
That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

So the chick you left me for is tired of you
Baby, why call me 'cause I'm tired too?
That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along

Now you've finally learned
That you get burned when you play with fire
Don't come running to me
You can't use me for your spare tire

If you don't have love songs to fit my key
Baby, don't sing your blues to me!
That's your red wagon, that's your red wagon
So just keep dragging your red wagon along
