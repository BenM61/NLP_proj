Sometimes life is fragile
Seems like it's coming undone
Sometimes you're over a barrel
Sometimes you're under the gun
Sometimes life is easy

Just a walk in the park
Sometimes life's a gamble
Just a shot in the dark
Another day in other words

In the story of life
I've found the only way
I can ever survive
Is reading by the light of my faith
Hope is alive
And love turns another page
And Heaven is mine
When the Author signs His name on my heart
In the story of life

Somewhere there's Someone watching
He is the watcher of me
He gives the story meaning
Gives me a reason to be
For it is written in words
