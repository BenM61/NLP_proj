Ah, mother
I reach for you in the dark
Ah, mother
I reach for the dark
Ah, ah

All alone and I can't decide
And I can't decide on him
All alone and I can't seem to
Can't seem to, oh, begin

Holding on (I won't)
And I got my mind (I can't)
And I got my heart (I know)
And I'm in a bind
Holding on (I won't)
And I can't decide (I can't)
On him (I know)
I won't, I can't
I know, I'll let you go!
I won't, I can't
I know, I'll let you go!
I'll let you go!
I'll let you go!

I go and I know, and I wait for you
Hold on, and go on, 'cause I'll wait for you
Faster, faster, the leaves will fall
The sky will grey and my skin will dull
Hold on, and go on, 'cause I'll wait for you

All alone and I can't decide
And I can't decide on him
All alone and I can't seem to
Can't seem to, oh, begin

Holding on (I won't)
And I can't decide (I can't)
I can't decide on him (I know, I'll let you go!)
Holding on (I won't)
And I can't (I can't)
Seem to, can't seem to, oh, begin
(I know, I let you go!)

Can't seem to oh begin
Can't seem to ohbegin
(I let you go!)
Can't seem to begin
Can't seem to begin (I let you go!)
