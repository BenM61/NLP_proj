I just wanna be everything
That you'd like so that we'd never part
'Cause you're the kind of girl that brings out
All the joy and happiness in my heat

You're a dream come true, my heart's delight
You make me wanna tell the world
'Cause you're the spark that lights up my life
So I just wanna let you know, I gotta let you know
Just wanna let you know

Anyway you want me baby
That's how you gonna get me
And I wanna let you know
It's gonna last forever

Girl when I'm with you
Seems like all my will power starts to fade
I'm like a robot in love
You have only to kiss me and you'll get your way

I feel like a king, you're my everything
I'll do anything to please you
But if there's something I miss tell me how I feel
I just wanna let you know, I gotta let you know
Just wanna let you know

Anyway you want me baby
That's how you gonna get me
And I wanna let you know
It's gonna last forever

If there's anyone deserving baby
I'm here to say it's really you
As long as you want me by your side
I just wanna let you know, I gotta let you know
Just wanna let you know

Anyway you want me baby
That's how you gonna get me
And I wanna let you know
It's gonna last forever, oh

Anyway you want me baby
That's how you gonna get me
And I wanna let you know
It's gonna last forever, oh

Anyway you want me baby
That's how you gonna get me
And I wanna let you know
It's gonna last forever
