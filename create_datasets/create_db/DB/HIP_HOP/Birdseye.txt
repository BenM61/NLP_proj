Stepped in the club alone at 'Atlanta Live'
Hat tilted to one side I watch her body, in phase
Platinum eyes like in department stores, she's curious, of course
You'll be mine one day, I said

If we could sometimes just go out with margaritas, drink greyhounds
Don't quite like dancing, too cool
But I could sense her class in a magazine
She looks just like Halle I know I found it, I know I found love

Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love
(Girl you define love)

When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruising through
I'll still find you, love
(Girl you define)

Now girl these girls the kind that play around
Don't wanna make her frown she'll bring her laundry to bed
And every day she finds a sunny cloud
It sort of makes me smile, she's so dramatically free

I'd like to show you my new house, I've seen us making on my couch
You'd dig the bathtub, for sure
So I baptized her in the bubble bath, she came out screaming mad
Oh, what a laugh 'cause she still had Halle's eyes

Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love
(Girl you define love)

When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruising through
I'll still find you, love
(Girl you define)

I'd take the A-Train to follow you
Oh well, she said she thinks it's all good
Don't matter what your body do oh cool, I'm cool
She thinks I'm cool that's cool

I know I've found love

Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love
(Girl you define love)

When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruising through
I'll still find you, love
(Girl you define)

Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love
(Girl you define love)

When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruising through
I'll still find you, love
(Girl you define)

Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love
(Girl you define love)

When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruising through
I'll still find you, love
(Girl you define)

Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love
(Girl you define love)

When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruising through
I'll still find you, love
(Girl you define)

Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love
(Girl you define love)

When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruising through
