What can you say?
There isn't much to tell.
I'm going downhill
And I blame myself.
I've been jumpin' at shadows,
Thinking 'bout my life.

Everybody points their hand at me.
I know I'm just a picture
Of what I should've been.
I've been jumpin' at shadows,
Thinking 'bout my life. 

God have mercy.
I think I'm going insane.
The Devil's been gettin' at me
He's got me down again.
Got me jumping at shadows,
Just thinking about my life
