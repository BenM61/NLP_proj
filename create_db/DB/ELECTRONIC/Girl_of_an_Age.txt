It's a plentiful day
Holding us together this way
The only things real to us are the words
We know we can have it all
Upon the heads of our youthful charms
But as far as I can see, all you see
Emotions flooding you to me

I touch, you're never there
I call, but we never seem to reach that far
Each time we fall, I call

You're a girl of an age
Who isn't touched by anyone
Out of reach, out of disbelief
You're a girl of an age

It's a plentiful day
Holding us together this way
The only things real to us are the words
Words are fine, each one we say
At the time we fall, to each others arms
But as far as I can see, all you see
Emotions flooding you to me
We belong to an age of love
