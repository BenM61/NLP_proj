Here I am the remains of me
My eyes tired but I can't sleep
My muscles withers
The weakness sows it's seed
God I ask you for your meaning of this
Can't you see what has become of my
Can't you see the tears I cry in horror
As last my eyes are closed and I am breathing slowly
Hoping again that this is the end
And I am on my way to embrace the holy

Look me in the eyes
What have you found in me 

A dark discovery

In my dreams I try to hide away
But there is no shelter to find
And I try to reach to the light of the day
I rage against the dying of the light 
God was I wish that I was all alone
Oh god all the ones that I learned to know
Think about those who I leave in sorrow
It is not fair why do I have to go

Please I beg you
To take away my pain

The dark discovery
What have you found in me
The dark discovery
The dark discovery

We all have to die eventually
But of course I didn't want to die
I wasn't old or infirm or in bad health
But most of all I didn't want to leave
My darling wife and my young son 
Who now has no father to look after him
And that is my greatest regret
