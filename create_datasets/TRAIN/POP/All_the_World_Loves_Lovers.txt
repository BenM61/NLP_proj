You and I won't lose our heads the way some lovers do
Saying "This will last forever" when it's just a year or two
You and I won't be the fools that other lovers are
Thinking every silver bottle top potentially a star still
All the world loves lovers.

All the world loves people in love

Love whatever the price
We won't make the promises that every lover makes
Only to find that all we've made are similar mistakes
No you and I won't wish for things
Like other lovers do
But let's cross our hearts and hope to die
If none of them come true 'cause
All the world loves lovers.
