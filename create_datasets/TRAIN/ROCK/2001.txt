Well I've been looking 
Looking for an answer 
Somebody promised me one 
And I've been waiting 
Waiting for the chance 
Well somebody said it would come 
Wake me up when we hit 2001

I've been talking 
Talking to the maker 
Of the compromise 
They said she's fine 
Call the undertaker 
You shouldn't look surprised 
Wake me up when we hit 2001

It's barely alive with a story at five 
So turn your video on 
We live in these years dark age of fear 
Meet me in 2001

I saw my sister 
Saw the ones who twist her 
A social suicide 
If looks could kill 
Each and every cheap thrill 
Could be a homicide 
Wake me up when we hit 2001

It's barely alive with a story at five 
So turn your video on 
We live in these years dark age of fear 
Meet me in 2001

I've searching 
Searching for a reason 
To either fight or fly 
Either way patriot or treason 
It's gonna be one long hard ride 
Wake me up when we hit 2001
