Searching the wide oceans with hooks and spears
We shake the tall trees till the leaves drop round our ears
Swimming the cold water where the sun will never shine
Making preparations for the whip-crack time
Hauling the kraken up with blocks and chains -
We're sailing into the eyes of hurricanes
You know that no-one here gets out alive
Only one thing makes it when the devil drives:

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

Flaming amazement - madder than the gale
Wreathed in shadows; crackling in the sails
This is our mission now as then -
We can do no other here we stand: amen
The winds are crying - remember me
Through the holy silence of the desert and the sea
The next armada waiting for the tide
Wind and rain are nothing to the storm inside

we're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

da dayadhvam damyatta da dayadhvam damyatta
Om a ra pa chana dhih om a ra pa chana dhih
Om ana hashi vier om ana hashi vier om ana hashi vier
(we're holding on, we're holding on...)

da dayadhvam damyatta da dayadhvam damyatta
Om a ra pa chana dhih om a ra pa chana dhih
Om ana hashi vier om ana hashi vier om ana hashi vier
(we're holding on, we're holding on...)

we're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...

Running on the rocks
Running on the rocks
Running on the rocks
Running on the rocks
