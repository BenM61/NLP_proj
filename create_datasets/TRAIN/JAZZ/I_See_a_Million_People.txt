I see a million people, but all I can see is you.
I hear a million voices, but only your voice comes through.
I wait for your footsteps, I've waited before,
I know if it's you if you knock at my door,
I know you're around by the sound of my pounding heart!

I see a million faces, but what do I really see?
A million little traces keep bringing you back to me;
And try as I may to forget to care,
What can I do if you're always there?
I see a million people, but all I can see is you!
