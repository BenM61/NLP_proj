Looking out my window, sun shinning bright
Birds singing, trying to make things right
How did your love songs play from those doors?

I don't want no one to come in to catch me sigh
But every since you left, said goodbye
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

? bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me
I keep on looking for a, brighter day
When all I see is time slipping away

I've got to stop and get myself together
All I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

I've got to stop, get myself together
Cause all I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here
I just wish you were here with me
