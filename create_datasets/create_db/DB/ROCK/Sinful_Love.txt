You're over my shoulder, I think I'm possessed
Your constant undertone, is making me toothless
Times come to trim you out of my life
Gonna cut you out, baby, out of my life

Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon

The power that I give you, I'm so sick of your voice
In my body, You don't give me no choice
But to boot you, honey, to give you the shove
So take back your despot, I'll keep you love

Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon

I'm searching by symbols, looking for a pistol
To laser you out, it looks like a keyhole
I'll just stick my key back, seamless and whole
No more idols, got my own self control

Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon
