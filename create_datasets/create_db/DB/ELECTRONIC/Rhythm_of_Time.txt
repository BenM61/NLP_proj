No, I can't see tomorrow when I close my eyes
There is no tomorrow, my gift is of no use

What's the horse on the shore waiting for?

See, today wears a mask, today is a shadow
Today is meant to drag down, shelter and devour
Today is a gift fading beforehand
Today is a feast ending too early

Break: Albeit unseen, albeit unveiled
There's a troublemaker
Hiding heavy secrets

If I don't see tomorrow then it must be black
It's a land of sorrow full of deadened groans
Tomorrow has no colors, it feels like the night
It's a pile of cinders instead of a fire
They did raze tomorrow to the ground
