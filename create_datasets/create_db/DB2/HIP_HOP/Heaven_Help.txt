There comes a time
To be free of the heart
I want to be ready, 
Ready to start
On a love journey, 
I got places to go
Made up my mind that 
I've got to let you know

Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the man
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
'cause I decided right now
That I'm ready for love

This funny feeling's 
Coming over me
Now I'm inspired and 
I'm open to be
In a love place, 
But it's out of my hands
I'm telling you baby, 
You just got to understand

Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the man
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
'cause I decided right now
That I'm ready for love

I can't see what's out there 
For me, baby
And I know love offers no guarantee
But I'll take a chance and 
I'm telling you something, baby
Gotta let you know

Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the man
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
'cause I decided right now
That I'm ready for love
