It's warm in and out
The pulse of flowing love
Spread the calm to meet the others
Pleasure fills with love 'til dawn

It's warm in and out
The call for sacred hours
The soft chant of new-born singing
The magic force of your feelings

The first picture of you
The first picture of summer
Seeing the flowers scream their joy

Can't lose this mood gentle
With summer at our ears
Flood the world deep in sunlight
Break into the peaceful wild

The first picture of you
The first picture of summer
Seeing the flowers scream their joy
The first picture of you

The first picture of summer
Seeing the flowers scream their joy
