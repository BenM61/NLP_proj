Oh for the pillow where my head used to lay
'Fore I left to be a grown man way back then
I miss the wooden kitchen floor
Painted brown to match the old back door
In my  old Kentucky home where I belong

Carry me back
Carry me back
Carry me back I been away so long
I'm goin' back where I come from

Something I read one day
Might have heard somebody say
Made me leave a happy home
Fortune waitin' in the city
Pretty women just like in the movies
Craziest mess you ever want to see

Carry me back
Carry me back
Carry me back ain't nothin' here for me
I want to get back home
Take me back where I belong

Lord Almighty I sure learned a lot
Enough to send me back where I come from
To that old Kentucky home where I belong
