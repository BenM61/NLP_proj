Chains of love have tied my heart to you
Chains of love have made me feel so blue
Well now I'm your prisoner
Tell me what you gonna do

Are ya gonna leave me, are ya gonna make me cry?
Are ya gonna leave me, are ya gonna make me cry?
These chains are gonna haunt me until the day I die

Well, if you're gonna leave me please wont you set me free?
Well, if you're gonna leave me please wont you set me free?
I can't bear these chains that bind me
Unless you're here with me

Well it's three o'clock in the morning, the moon is shining bright
Yes it's three o'clock in the morning, the moon is shining bright
I just sit and wonder
Where can you be tonight?
