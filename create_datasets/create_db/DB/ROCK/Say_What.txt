Say what?
Never do we stress 'cause we're known to rock shit
Decks are in effect and we're going to cock this
Twelve gauge, super-fly never had a plan - shit
It's what we do best it's how we scam shit
We're the two eight D crew and we get into
The zone and never leave until we're through
It's just a test if the rest of the mess
Can flip a song to bang along to nevertheless

We're gonna take what they don't deserve
They're gonna hate the fact that we're rocking
And we make another record, if we're not number one
We're gonna take what they don't deserve
They're gonna hate the fact that we're rocking
And we're motivated by something they could never hope to understand
Jedi Master is the man

Say what?

It's like a TV show, here we go
Kicking around the sound that's sounding def
'Cause I'm sick like salo
I tell ya that we're killing all the fake bullshit
While they're making hits
Like I'm taking shits and I'm sick of it
It's clear to me that they don't give a shit what the kids think
'Cause I can't tell the difference between heroin and *NSYNC
As long as they get sponsorship from the biggest cola drink
Open up your eyes to the crooked and you don't blink

And I'm motivated by something I don't understand
I'm the man guided by the hand of the force
And Jedi Master's on the same plan
Making no sense like the rain man
Underground battles like Vietnam
His cuts are so fresh, he's f*ck it - they get it
Hit it twice, pass it left then you kick back track list
Isn't this chronic number one of the finest batch
