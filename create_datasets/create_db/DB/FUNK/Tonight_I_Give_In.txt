Somebody walked into my life
And he's right on time
Somebody looked into my eyes
And he read my mind
And its true
I only need to tell you
That it's you
You're every thing
I ever dreamed would come to me

Somebody walked into my heart
And to my surprise
Somebody tearing me apart
And it feels just fine
And it's you
I've waited oh so long to say
It's you
You're every thing
I ever dreamed

And tonight I give in to the feelings
Tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you
And tonight I give in to believing
I'd hear you say
You'd always stay

Somebody turned my life around
And I'm not the same
Suddenly I don't hear a sound
Only your name
And I really need you

And tonight I give in to the feelings
Yes tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you
And tonight I give in to believing
You'll always stay in love this way

Oh, tonight I give in to the feelings
Yes tonight I give in to them all so hold me
And tonight I give in to believing, darling
You're every thing
I ever dreamed would come to me
