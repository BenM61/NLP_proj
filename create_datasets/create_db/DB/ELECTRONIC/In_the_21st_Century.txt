When the river runs dry, what will we say
Na na na na na na na na hey hey
In the twenty first century
Oh when the river runs dry, what will we do
Na na na na na na na na oh-hoo
In the twenty first century
When the river runs dry, what will we wear
Na na na na na na na na where?
To the twenty first century
Now some people sing, some people say
Na na na na na na na na hey hey
Get up off your knees and pray
Pray that the earth don't tire, of the way that we're puttin' her down
Hope that the universe don't say "I'm still expanding but your time is up"
Some people sing, some people sigh
Na na na na na na na na why?
Why can't we live in peace
Some people sing, some people say
Na na na na na na na na hey hey
In the twenty first century
Hope that the earth don't tire, of the way that we're puttin' her down
Hope the universe don't say - stop spinning around
Hope the world don't say that we've got no place to go
Hope the universe don't say "I'll be expanding for a while, you? no!
In the twenty first century
In the twenty first century
In the twenty first century
In the twenty first century
In the twenty first century
Twenty first century...
In the 21st century
Twenty first century...
When the river runs dry, what will we say
Na na na na na na na na hey hey
Twenty first century
The twenty first century
The twenty first century
The twenty first century
Oh when the river runs dry, what will we do
Na na na na na na na na oh-hoo
