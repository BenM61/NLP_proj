I am very very much in like with you
I hope that it?s okay ?cause it?s all I can do
?Cause you treat my skin like porcelain?
Rare and special porcelain
Even though you know I know you know
That this is not the real thing...

"Oh? isn't it enough what I'm giving to you? baby"
"Oh? isn't it enough that your kisses drive me crazy"
"Oh? isn't it enough? isn't it enough"

I read a book like you? it says for what it?s worth
People only really get what they deserve
And I hear a voice cry out within
Relax? enjoy the porcelain
Treatment feels like liquid gold
A treasured hand for me to hold

"Oh? isn't it enough what I'm giving to you? baby"
"Oh? isn't it enough that your kisses drive me crazy"
"Oh? isn't it enough? isn't it enough"

Porcelain? porcelain
You treat my skin like porcelain...

In the big? big scheme of things
Beyond the rare and special porcelain
Beyond the joy? joy and the dis?at?ease
Well there's a place for me...

Porcelain? porcelain...

Sometimes I think I should say I love you too
If words are free? why can't I spare the best for you"
?Cause you treat my skin like porcelain
Rare and special porcelain
Even though you know I know you know
I'm cracked from all of this living

"Oh? isn't it enough what I'm giving to you? baby"
"Oh? isn't it enough that your kisses drive me crazy"
"Oh? isn't it enough that I'm checking for you? baby"
"Oh? isn't it enough that your kisses drive me crazy"
"Oh? isn't it enough? isn't it enough"

"isn't it enough"
"isn't it enough"
