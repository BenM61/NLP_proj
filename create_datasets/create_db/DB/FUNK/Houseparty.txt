They're dancin' on the ceilin'
They're dancing' on the floor
People everywhere comin' through the door
They know there's a party goin' on

Do the dancin' romance all night long
I know it's cold outside
C'mon baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you gotta do is move

Every time you feel that groove
Ain't nothing' but a party
Ain't nothing' but a party
Ain't nothing' but a party

Ain't nothing' but a houseparty
C'mon baby, dig that crazy soul
I know you're gonna lost control
You can do boogaloo

Anything that you want to
I know it's cold outside
C'mon baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you gotta do is move

Every time you feel that groove
Ain't nothing' but a party
Ain't nothing' but a party
Ain't nothing' but a party

Ain't nothing' but a houseparty
I know it's cold outside
C'mon baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you gotta do is move

Every time you feel that groove
Ain't nothing' but a party
Ain't nothing' but a party
Ain't nothing' but a party

Ain't nothing' but a houseparty
I said move it, groove it
Baby, don't you lose it
I said roll it, stroll it

Baby, don't control it
It ain't nothin' but a party
Ain't nothin' but a party
Ain't nothin' but a party

Ain't nothin' but a houseparty
Yeah, tell me 'bout the party
I got to know about the party
