Have you looked into your heart
did you find a memory or two 
Even though the flame has died
Maybe there's a spark inside
Have you looked into your heart

Have you searched through all your dreams
did you ever find a trace of me 
Even though you say we're through 
That I'm not the one for you 
Have you looked into your heart

When the evening shadows 
Fall upon my window pane
I find I'm crying over, and over 
And over and over and over again 

Since we've been apart 
All I do is pray for your return 
Take a look and you will see
Maybe there's a place for me
Have you looked into your heart
