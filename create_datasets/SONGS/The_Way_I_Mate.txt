The way I mate, the way I mate, the way I mate
I call a girlie girlie in a wae-oh
I call a girlie girlie in a wae-oh

I call a hubby hubby, eep-eep-eep

Girls, come on let's have a good time
It is the day to get wild
Do you feel like going down

Mating seasons in heat
Come on and get to your feet
To get laid we eep-eep-eep

Time to go-go
wae-oh wae-oh

Bushes are moving around
All the beavers have fun
They are playing with their guns

Guys are chasing around
Getting ready to beep
When they all hear our eep-eep-eep
