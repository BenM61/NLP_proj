Girl now more than ever
I'm just sitting home and think about your love smile
And I don't know what to do right now
Cause I miss you baby
I want you back here you can't see that
Remember the time when I saw you special girl
You will never get out my mind
Deep in my heart I can feel the love so strong
You will always be the one I need

[Chorus]
I have never believed that I found someone
 a girl like you is the only one
 I can never ever let you go
 **Let me show you the way how to fall in love
 let me show you how it goes
 take my hand and go with me
 to the place you want to be
 Let me show you the way how to fall in love
 let me show you how it goes
 see the starlight in the night
 and the feel it's go so right..oh right

Now I believe ( I believe.. ) that my dream will come in true
I just gonna keep on holding you
Day after day...( oh why..)
I just think about you girl
From the first time you stepped into my life..

Repeat[Chorus]x2
