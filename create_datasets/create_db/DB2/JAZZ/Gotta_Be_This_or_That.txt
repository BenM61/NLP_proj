If you ain't wrong, you're right
If it ain't day, it's night
If you ain't sure, you might
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't dry, it's wet
If you ain't got, you get
If it ain't gross, it's net
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't sis, you can't miss
It's got to be your brother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other

If it ain't full, it's blank
If you don't spend, you bank
If it ain't Dee, it's Frank
Gotta be this or that
