Must you dance every dance 
With the same fortunate man? 
You have danced with him since the music began, 
Won't you change partners and dance with me? 

Must you dance quite so close, 
With your lips touching his face? 
Can't you see I'm longing to be in his place? 
Won't you change partners and dance with me? 

Ask him to sit this one out, 
And while you're alone, 
I'll tell the waiter to tell him 
He's wanted on the telephone, 

You've been locked in his arms 
Ever since heaven-knows-when, 
Won't you change partners and then, 
You may never want to change partners again.

You may never have to change partners again.
