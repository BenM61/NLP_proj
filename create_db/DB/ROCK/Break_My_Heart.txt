Wave if you want me to notice you
Stop if you have someone else
It could be a good thing
Might be a bad thing

But you can't put your arms around a memory
Break my, break my heart
I wish, ooh, I wish you would
You've had time to waste, time to wonder

Time to become someone else
Looks could kill me,
Lies they don't pretend
You want to remember

But you can't put your arms around a memory
Break my, break my heart
Oh, I wish you would
Wasted waiting, just as white ain't black
Like trying to get you baby, ooh yeah
