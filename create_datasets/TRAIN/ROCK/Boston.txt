In the light of the sun
Is there anyone?
Oh, it has begun

Oh, dear, you look so lost
Your eyes are red when tears are shed
The world you must have crossed, you said

You don't know me, you don't even care
Oh yeah, you said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains
Oh yeah

Essential yet appealed
Carry all your thoughts
Across an open field

When flowers gaze at you
They're not the only ones
Who cry when they see you
You said

You don't know me, and you don't even care
Oh yeah, you said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains
Oh yeah

She said, I think I'm going to Boston
I think I'll start a new life
I think I'll start it over
Where no one knows my name

I'll get out of California
I'm tired of the weather
I think I'll get a lover
I'll fly 'em out to Spain

I think I'll go to Boston
I think that I was tired
I think I need a new town
To leave this all behind

I think I need a sunrise
I'm tired of a sunset
Here it's nice in the summer
Some snow would be nice, oh yeah

You don't know me, and you don't even care
Oh yeah

Boston
Where no one knows my name
No one knows my name
No one knows my name

Boston
Where no one knows my name
