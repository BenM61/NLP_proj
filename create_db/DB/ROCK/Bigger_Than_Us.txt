You took the tunnel route home,
you've never taken that way with me before.
Did you feel the need for change?
Apologies on your fingernails,
love flickered in the city of lights,
Like good singers on radio waves

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I just gotta get home.

And I feel like I'm breaking up,
and I wanted to stay,
Headlights on the hillside,
don't take me this way,
I don't want you to hold me,
I don't want you to pray,
This is bigger than us

You went where the horses cry,
you've never taken that way with me before.
Did you feel the need for change?
Guilt smeared across your lips,
I was tired and cold from the window
You're cold, nothing has changed.

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I just gotta get home.

And I feel like I'm breaking up,
and I wanted to stay,
Headlights on the hillside,
don't take me this way,
I don't want you to hold me,
I don't want you to pray,
This is bigger than us
