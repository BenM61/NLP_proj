Can I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

Can I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness? There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness? The prophet looked and he laughed at me, ha, he said
Can I play with madness? He said, "you're blind, too blind to see"
Oh, said, "you're too blind to see", mmm

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said, "don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I said, "you'll pay for this mischief"
"Ah, in this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said, "do you wanna know the truth, son?"
"Lord, I'll tell you the truth"
"Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
