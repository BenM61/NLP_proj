I used to be in love with the finer things, (huh)
It was all about the cars and diamond rings, when I was with you
You never could've afford those kind of things
(Now I got a man) Now i got a man whose bawling and all I do
Is think about how much I miss u

'Cause u know he has a better car
He lets me use his credit cards
I wake up every morning with an attitude
'Cause all I think about you
And even though he buys me everything I need
That ain't everything I need (No)
I miss the little things we used to do
And all i think about is you

(Whoa, whoa)

(uh) T.D. screening the call, calling here on my arsenal 
(uh) V.I.P at the bar with my girls sipping crystal
Everything I want well I want to switch now
I had it all but I threw it all away
I'm sitting in a pink navigator now
I should be happy but I can't even fake a smile
'Cause I'm not with you

And with the trips to the beach now's over seas
Getting by ninety five now spending G's
But money doesn't matter that much to me
'Cause i still miss you 

'Cause you know he has a better car
He lets me use his credit cards (Ooh I miss you)
I wake up every morning with an attitude
'Cause all i think about you (Ooh I miss you)
End even thought he buys me everything I need
That ain't everything I need (no)
It's the little things we used to do
And all I think about is you (Ooh I miss you)

Now I feel alone
I was wrong
Should've kept you heart
Now that your gone
I realized
That you were mine, I need you by my side

Now I feel alone
I was wrong
Should've kept you heart
Now that your gone
I realized
That you were mine, I need you by my side
True love can't deny

'Cause you know he has a better car
He lets me use his credit cards (Credit cards)
I wake up every morning with an attitude (attitude)
'Cause all i think about you (I still miss you)
End even though he buys me everything I need
That ain't everything I need (no)
It's the little things we used to do (I miss you)
And all i think about is you (Ooh I miss you)

'Cause you know he has a better car
He let's me use his credit cards
I wake up every morning with an attitude (attitude)
'Cause all I think about you (Ooh oh no no no)
End even though he buys me everything I need (Buys me everything I need)
That ain't everything I need (That ain't everything I need)
It's the little things we used to do (Things we used to do)
And all I think about is you 

Ooh I miss you
Ooh I miss you
Ooh I miss you
Ooh I miss you
