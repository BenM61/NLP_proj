I was once a boy. 
'Til I cut my penis off
And I grew a hairy skull 
Of stubborn fire

Then I was a girl. 
'Til I sewed my hole up
And I grew a hairy heart 
Of dark desire
But 
There's no answer. just surrender
Send all your barriers into the fire

And
Let no foot. mark your ground
Let no hand hold you down.
You were once so sad
Till you cut your suffer off

Now you please yourself
And fight your own wars
And you were once so weak
'Til you sewed your wounds up

Now you've learnt to sing
About sun and shine!

Be you own hero
Be your own savior
Send all your suffering
Into the fire
