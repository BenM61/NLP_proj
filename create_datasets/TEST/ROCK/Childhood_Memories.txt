Jesus the weather was so good today
But I believe a change is on the way
And a little electricity won't hurt
And no a little electricity won't hurt

Especially when we're all out of gas
And coal and oil, and steel and cash
But a little electricity won't hurt
And no a little electricity won't hurt

And your politeness it could kill
And it's more than likely that it will
First it was getting better now it's getting worse
And then it's getting wetter now the ice age is complete
So everybody go

God help us if the radiation leaks
God help us if nobody knows for weeks
But a little electricity won't hurt
And no a little electricity won't hurt

And your politeness it could kill
And it's more than likely that it will
First it was getting better now it's getting worse
And it's getting wetter better call the hearse(?)

And can we move a little fast and go a little further
Move a little faster
Go and everybody go home
And everybody go that
And everybody go this
And everybody go that
And we go
And we go
And we go
And we go
And we go
And we go
And we go
And we go
Oh, oh, a little child has been
