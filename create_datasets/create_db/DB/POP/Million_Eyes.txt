Away, get away
You're such a freak
It's what people say to me
Different, too different
I'm scared of judgement
Your insults and your slanders stick on to me

Yes with your million eyes you're watching me
You talk behind my back
You spy on me
So I scream and shout to make you leave
But you're still here, you keep judging me
With your million eyes, eyes!

Drowning I'm drowning in that clown's mask
To make you laugh at my thousand flaws
Alone when I'm all alone I take my smile off
But your heartless words have left me scars

'Cause with your million eyes you're watching me
You talk behind my back
You spy on me
So I scream and shout to make you leave
But you're still here, you keep judging me

'Cause with your million eyes you're watching me
You talk behind my back
You spy on me
So I scream and shout to make you leave
But you're still here, you keep judging me
With your million eyes, eyes!

'Cause with your million eyes you're watching me
You talk behind my back
You spy on me
So I scream and shout to make you leave
But you're still here

'Cause with your million eyes you're watching me
You talk behind my back
You spy on me
So I scream and shout to make you leave
But you're still here, you keep judging me

'Cause with your million eyes you're watching me
You talk behind my back
You spy on me
So I scream and shout to make you leave
But you're still here, you keep judging me
