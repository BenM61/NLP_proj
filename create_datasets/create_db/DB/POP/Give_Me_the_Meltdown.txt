Feelin' worn down like a piece of glass
Doesn't take too much to get yourself to feed your monkey
Tell some white lies
Make and swallow them
You don't see just how you got into this situation

Late at night, late at night
You weep for something better than the secrets you keep me down
Just lay down, here, close to me
And tell me what you want from me

And I said
Hey now, give me the meltdown
Take it out on me this time around
Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
Hey now, give me the meltdown 
Take it out on me, don't let me down
Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around

Wide awake now and your monkey's dead
You so perfect that you never really need nobody
Put your hands down
You're among your friends
You just take and take and take and take and take and take and

Late at night, late at night
You weep but you're no better than the secrets you keep stay down
Just lay down, here, close to me
Pretend you'll never leave me

And I said
Hey now, give me the meltdown
Take it out on me this time around
Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
Hey now, give me the meltdown 
Take it out on me, don't let me down
Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around

Tell me what you want child
Give me the meltdown
Take it out on me this time around
Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
Hey now, give me the meltdown 
Take it out on me, don't let me down
Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
Hey now, give me the meltdown 
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
Hey now, give me the meltdown 
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
Hey now, give me the meltdown 
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
