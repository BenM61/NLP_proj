Snake in it, jack into the wall
TV amp on fire, blowin' in the hall
Gun your sled, close your peeping toms
Turbo organizer crankin' on the knob

You got it
Yeah, ride the silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket

Hit the power, psycho helmets on
You got to splice your halo, take it to a moon
Nymphoid clamor, fuelling up the hammer
You got to fake out the robot and pulse up the zoom

You got it
Yeah, ride the silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket

I can't forget the flashing, can't forget the smashing
The sending and the bending, the atmosphere re-entry
You gotta have the time, got a letter in your mind
Gotta heart injection that you got yourself a line

You got it
Yeah, ride the silver rocket
I can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket
