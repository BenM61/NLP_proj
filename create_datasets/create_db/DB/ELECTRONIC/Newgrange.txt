There is a place on the east
Mysterious ring, a magical ring of stones
The druids have lived there once they said,
Forgotten is the race that no-one knows.

Rum de rum 'rud a derimo
Rum de rum 'rud a derimo

The circled tomb of a different age
Secret lines carved on ancient stone.
Heroic kings laid down to rest
Forgotten is the race that no-one knows.

Wait for the sun on a winter's day
And a beam of light shines across the floor.
Mysterious ring, a magical ring.
But forgotten is the race that no-one knows.
