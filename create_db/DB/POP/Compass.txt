Yea it's been a bumpy road
Roller coasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast, pedal hard
You won't have to go that far

You want to give up cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone

Forgot directions on your way
Don't close your eyes don't be afraid
We might be crazy late at night
I can't wait til you arrive
Follow stars you'll be alright

You want to give up cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone

You want to give up cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone

When it's all said and done you can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
