See that black boy over there, runnin' scared 
His ol' man's in a bottle. 
He done quit his 9 to 5 to drink full time 
So now he's livin' in the bottle. 

See that Black boy over there, runnin' scared 
His ol' man got a problem 
Pawned off damn near everything, his ol' 
Woman's weddin' ring for a bottle. 

And don't you think it's a crime 
When time after time, people in the bottle. 

See that sista, sho wuz fine before she 
Started drinkin' wine 
From the bottle. 
Said her ol' man committed a crime 

And he's doin' time, 
So now she's in the bottle. 
She's out there on the avenue, all by herself 
Sho' needs help from the bottle. 

Preacherman tried to help her out, 
She cussed him out and hit him in the head with a bottle. 
And don't you think it's a crime 
When time after time, people in the bottle. 

See that gent in the wrinkled suit 
He done damn near blown his cool 
To the bottle 
He wuz a doctor helpin' young girls along 

If they wuzn't too far gone to have problems. 
But defenders of the dollar eagle 
Said "What you doin', Doc, it ain't legal," 
And now he's in the bottle. 

Now we watch him everyday tryin' to 
Chase the pigeons away 
From the bottle. 
And don't you think it's a crime 
When time after time, people in the bottle.
