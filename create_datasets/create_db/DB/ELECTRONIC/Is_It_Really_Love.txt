Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love, mhm
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me is it really love

Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above
Oh I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
Tell me is it really love

Oh I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
(Can't seem to get enough)
When I wake from dreaming
Takes me to the clouds above
(Takes me to the clouds above)

Takes me to the clouds above
Tell me is it really love
Takes me to the clouds above
Tell me is it really love
Takes me to the clouds above

Oh I lose control
Can't seem to get enough, aha
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love, mhm

Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above

Takes me to the clouds above
(Takes me to the clouds above)
Takes me to the clouds above
(Takes me to the clouds above)
Takes me to the clouds above
(Takes me to the clouds above)
Takes me to the clouds above
