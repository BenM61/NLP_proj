Can I get close to ya
If only for a while
I don't mean to busy ya
You're the jive guru, and
I want to sing along with you, with you
Your sweetness could cause a rock slide
If only before the summertime
This could be our last goodbye
Please, darling, please don't cry

Ooh, aah.
Ooh, aah.
Ooh, aah.
Ooh, aah.
