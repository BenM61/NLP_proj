Come on in, Look around
Try to see what's going down
We're gonna sing our songs to you
We hope it makes you feel good, too
Come on in, Stay awhile
We're gonna try to make you smile
Rock and roll gets in your soul
Makes you feel so natural, yeah!
We'd like to try to make you happy
Now you can be just what you want to be
So let's be friends no matter what you see
Come on in
Let yourself go
Come on in
Ow! It's Rock and Roll
[Instrumental]
Come on in, Stay awhile
We're gonna try to make you smile
Rock and roll gets in your soul
Makes you feel so natural, yeah!
