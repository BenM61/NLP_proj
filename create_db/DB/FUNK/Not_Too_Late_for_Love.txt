Do you wonder if your future rests on a mountain made of clay?
Climbing higher ain't an easy quest 'cause your ground's falling away
Once upon a time you knew just what you wanted, who you were
Now you find there ain't a soul you trust, and your vision's all a blur

Sweet baby, don't you cry
Everybody feels the same
Hope gives us reasons why
This is not a losing game

The world is going crazy
Everybody's spinning
Out of sync and out of time
Living in a movie
Waiting for the credits
Don't you know it's real life?
You can't let it phase ya
Trying to find the reasons
When it seems the bad outweighs the good
Until we lose our faith, fall from grace
It's not too late for love

There are times when we reach for the sky, and we tumble down to earth
Still no closer to the finish line, though we've run for all we're worth
We are living in the strangest years, there's so much uncertainty
Seems as though some of our darkest fears have become reality

Sweet baby, don't you cry
See this storm is gonna pass
No matter how it tries
Troubled weather never lasts

The world is going crazy
Everybody's spinning
Out of sync and out of time
Living in a movie
Waiting for the credits
Don't you know it's real life?
You can't let it phase ya
Trying to find the reasons
When it seems the bad outweighs the good
Until we lose our faith, fall from grace
It's not too late for love

I said it's not too late for or love

Its not too late, so put your faith in love
Its not too late, so put your faith in love
