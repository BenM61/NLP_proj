Can you tell me, how can one miss what she's never had?
How could I reminisce when there is not past?
How could I have memories of being happy with you, boy?
Can someone tell me how can this be?

How could my mind pull up incidents
Recall dates and times that never happened?
How could we celebrate love that's too late
And how could I really mean the words I'm about to say?

I miss the times that we almost shared
I miss the love that was almost there
I miss the times that we used to kiss
At least in my dreams just let me take my time and reminisce

I miss the times that we never had
What happen to us, we were almost there
Who ever said it's impossible to miss
What you never had, never almost had you

I cannot believe I let you go or what I should say is
I should have grabbed you up and never let you go
I should have went out with you, I should have made you my boo, boy
Yeah, that is one time I should have broke the rules

Should have went on the date, should have found a way to escape
Should have turned almost into if it happen, now it?s too late
How could I celebrate a love that wasn't real?
And if it didn't happen, why does my heart feel?

I miss the times that we almost shared
I miss the love that was almost there
I miss the times that we used to kiss
At least in my dreams just let me take my time and reminisce

I miss the times that we never had
What happen to us, we were almost there
Who ever said it's impossible to miss
What you never had, never almost had you

You seem to be the perfect one for me
You, you're all I ever wanted

You're my everything, yes it?s true
Boy, it?s hard to be close to you
My love, boy, it may sound crazy
But I'm in love with you

I miss the times that we almost shared
I miss the love that was almost there
I miss the times that we used to kiss
At least in my dreams just let me take my time and reminisce

I miss the times that we never had
What happen to us, we were almost there
Who ever said it's impossible to miss
What you never had, never almost had you

I miss the times that we almost shared
I miss the love that was almost there
I miss the times that we used to kiss
At least in my dreams just let me take my time and reminisce

I miss the times that we never had
What happen to us, we were almost there
Who ever said it's impossible to miss
What you never had, never almost had you, baby
