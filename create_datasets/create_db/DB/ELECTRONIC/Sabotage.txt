Its sabotage now
I keep praying that you'd leave me alone (leave me alone)
But she keeps waiting inside my home
I got an angel on the left,
Saying don't give in but the devil on the right,
Saying let her in
She won't stop kicking down my door
Whoa

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl,
Shes here to stay
It's sabotage now, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again

Sabotage now,
I can't hold on to guys I don't like no no no
But she keeps looking, with wondering eyes
I got an angel on the left screaming get away
But the devil on the right saying time to play
Whoa

And I can't take it anymore
It's sabotage now

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try to hard to fight the bad girl,
But shes here to stay
It's sabotage now, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again

Sabotage now,
Where to fall in love,
Caused myself so much pain
I sabotaged my heart and, and I don't know how to change,
It doesn't matter what I say or what I do
Cause in the end
She always wins, I always loose
I need to get her out of my life, oh

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl,
She's here to stay

It's sabotage now, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again

It's sabotage now, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again

Sabotage now
