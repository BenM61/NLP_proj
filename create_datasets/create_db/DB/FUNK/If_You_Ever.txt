It's about time
Maybe we'll make it, no
Save your light
And somehow we'll make it glow
And everything will be alright
Just trust 'em and let it go

There's a stairway to heaven
And maybe we can climb to them
We're both a little scared
We're both a little scared
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

(If you ever change your mind)
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

Take it all
Take it all, take it all, take it all
The only one
The only one, only one
When you say you like that
You got me like crackle
If I had a chance

There's a stairway to heaven
And maybe we can climb to them
We're both a little scared
We're both a little scared
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

(If you ever change your mind)
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

Baby I could show you something better
Show you something better
Maybe we could be forever
Even through the stormy weather, stormy weather clouds
I promise you I'll never give up
On us, for what
Would you like to go, like to go with me?
Yeah, yeah
Would you like to go with me? Yeah
If you ever change your
Like to go, like to go with me

(If you ever change your mind)
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Would you fly, would you fly with me?
(If you ever change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind for me
(If you ever change your mind)
If you find, if you find you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?

Oh yeah
If you ever change your mind
Would you like to go, like to go with me?
