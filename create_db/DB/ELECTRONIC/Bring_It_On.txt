Bring it on what you got 
Tonight you're my dart 
She says keep it tight 
You sure what I did 
You hold I commit 
You take what I owe 

You know some ain't right 
Tonight you're my dart 
She say keep it tight 
Come home some ain't nice 
Tonight lost in sight 
Can't take, take no more 

I believe a beat like thunder 
You're moving on 
The crowd go wild
