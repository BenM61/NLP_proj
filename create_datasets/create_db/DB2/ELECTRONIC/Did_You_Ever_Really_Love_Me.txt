But there is just one thing I need to know
Before you turn to go
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really love me?

I've known for sometime
It wasn't a big surprise
You can't deny
Leaving is on your mind

Too many nights
I'm crying myself to sleep
Afraid of the dark
Baby, the hurt's too deep

Although I was naive
If I wasn't half so blind
As to believe
In all the lies you told to me

But there is just one thing
I need to know
Before you turn to go
Did you ever really love me?

It's hard to believe
But I wasn't completely fooled
You had to deceive
Yeah, you had to break all the rules

Although you kept
So many secrets from me
Baby, just this one time
Can you tell the truth?

'Cos there is just one thing
I need to know
Before you turn to go
Did you ever really love me?

I wore my heart upon my sleeve
But you disregard me carelessly
How could you do this to me?

Although I was naive
I wasn't half so blind
As to believe
In all the lies you told to me

But there is just one thing I need to know
Before you turn to go
Did you ever really love me?
Oh, boy, did you ever really love me?

Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really love me?
