All the other ones never stayed too long
Just a hit and run, leading me along
Don't tell me you're different
It all sounds the same
Probably should've listened
Probably shouldn't stay

I hate the feeling of falling
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love
I hate the feeling of falling
I hate the feeling of falling
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love

Don't know what to say, at a loss for words
If we walk away, maybe it won't hurt
I can't keep on holding nothing but air
If we hit the bottom, I don't know what's there

I hate the feeling of falling
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love
I hate the feeling of falling
I hate the feeling of falling
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love

If you wanna stay, be my one mistake
I don't wanna wait anymore, anymore
If you wanna stay, be my one mistake
I don't wanna wait anymore, anymore
If you wanna stay, be my one mistake
I don't wanna wait
The feeling of falling in love

I hate the feeling of falling
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry (if you wanna stay)
If you wanna stay
The blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love
