Come back my darling one
I'm calling on ya.
The road ahead is long
And I must warn ya.
I wonder
Were did she go.
If I failed you
I tell you right now

All I want you to know
I love you!
All I need is the time to show you.

Come back my fallen son
Don't let em fool ya.
'cause when the day is done
They never move ya.
Lay down your sense of pride
Got more than you
Put out your mournefull tones
I tell you right now.

All I want you to know
I love you!
All I need is the time to show you how I feel, feel.

Lay down your sense of pride
Traveled once to often.
I tell you right now.

All I want you to know
I love you!
All I need is the time to show you, oh yeah.
You know I love you.
All I need is the time to show you how I feel.
