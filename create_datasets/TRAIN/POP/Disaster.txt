I'm trying not to pretend that it won't happen again and again like that
Never thought it would end 'cause you got up in my head and my head like that
And made me happy baby love is crazy so amazing
But it's changing, rearranging
I don't think I can take anymore

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now we're saying never
Feel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way
Look for another day, 'cause it ain't the same my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

Didn't want it this way I only wanted to say
I loved you right
Now you're walking away and leaving me here to stay
Wait for you to realize
All the things I gave you, made you change you
Your dreams came true
When I met you, now forget you
Don't want anymore

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now we're saying never
Feel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way
Look for another day, 'cause it ain't the same my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

You shot the bullet, you shot the bullet that killed me
Not feeling my heart beat, and now we're dying
I I'm through it, I I'm through all the agony
And now my eyes are, trying, trying no more crying,
Lying it's just a game,
And I'm all right cause my love's on his way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Burning up for forever and always, always
Yeah yeah yeah

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now we're saying never
Feel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way
Look for another day, 'cause it ain't the same my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now we're saying never
Feel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way
Look for another day, 'cause it ain't the same my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster
