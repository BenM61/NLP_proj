Blue Rain, falling down on my window pane 
But when you return there'll be a rainbow
After the blue, blue rain 
And there's a blue star 
Looking down asking where you are 
But when you return there'll be a sunbeam 
Hiding the blue, blue star
Skies will be much brighter than they were before 
When you and love come strolling through the door 
Then there'll be no more blue rain 
Just the sound of my heart's refrain 
Singing like a million little blue birds 
After the blue, blue rain
