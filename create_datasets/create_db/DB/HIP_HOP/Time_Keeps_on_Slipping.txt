Deltron tremendous force to end your course. 
Every whim is enforced 
I send men with torches to raid your fortress 
And in the process radiate your optics 
Subconsciously haunt emcees 
Super human technician atomic inner dimension 
Too mental with intuition 
Typographical aptitude let my lasers clap at you 
Mapped the route, psychologically crappin' out, 
What you laughing bout? 
Imitations getting penetrated in free simulations 
In my MC's training class remain in mass 
Never get liquidated convert energy 
Into matter instantly, with a pen and pad 
Calculate the Sinograph, heat the center of gravity 
Abolish apathy graphically packing three eighty's 
With body heat sensitive bullets you need safety 
Fest on your face and neck 
Mental armory levitate legs for my monarchy 
No malarkey my flows embarking 

Zionically sparking brain cells til they're sparkling 
Zionically sparking brain cells til they're sparkling 

No one knows the time passing by.

I remake my universe every time I use a verse 
To fulfill my destiny, emcees rest in peace 
Side barriers provide care within 
From impurities every word sees your attention like third degree 
I subjugate you other fake performers while the bass of your face

No sense you be in attempt fleeting 
Emcees siphon my likeness 
Biting my insides like five enchiladas 
This plain of existence is amazingly different 
From my orbital oratory always going for the glory 
You pop wide open from my slice slogans 
I stay in effect with alien tech 
Make you wanna say he's the best
With synchronization with commendation its armor plated hard to
Fake it 
Never carbonated, scar your matrix 
Virtually uncertainty, murk your mediocre sheets and sofa
