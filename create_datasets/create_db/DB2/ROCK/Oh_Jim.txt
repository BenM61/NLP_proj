nobody made you
do what you'd done
nobody told you
what you'd become
if you believe
that you get what you gave
don't turn around
just give it away

oh Jim
oh Jim
can you feel the pain I'm in

oh Jim 
oh Jim
can I leave it all behind

I'm OK
when you're OK
I feel fine 
when you feel fine
got no pain 
no sense no shame
roll on by
and put a smile on my face

oh Jim
oh Jim
can you feel the pain I'm in

oh Jim 
oh Jim
can I leave it all behind

so how does it feel
to be free
so far away
I wish it was me
yes I wish it was me

oh Jim
oh Jim
can you feel the pain I'm in

oh Jim 
oh Jim
can I leave it all behind
