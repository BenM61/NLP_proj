I, I went to hell, I might as well learn by my mistakes
I, at twenty-four, was insecure, do whatever it takes

Come on and wake up, (wake up, wake up, wake up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
It's time, smell the coffee, the coffee)

She's only got one reason to live, this is your life
She's only got one message to give, give it tonight

She's so gorgeous, I'll do anything
She's so gorgeous, I'll lose everything,

Any day!

Come on then wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
It's time, smell the coffee, the coffee

She's only got one reason to live, this is your life
She's only got one message to give, give it tonight

She's so gorgeous, I'll do anything
She's so gorgeous, I'll lose everything,

Any day!
