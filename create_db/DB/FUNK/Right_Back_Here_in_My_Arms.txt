(cause that's my only mission) [Repeats]
Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms) [Repeat: x2]
Right back here, yeah

Don't want you to write me no letters
Don't want you callin' my farm
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms
Alright

I ain't checkin' for the sweet talk, baby (Right)
Talkin' 'bout how you're missin' my charms (Right)
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms ("That's my only mission")
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

(Right back here in my arms)
Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms)
Oh baby

I know you got a lot on your mind (Right)
That's why I want to give you some time (Right)
Till I get to, till I get to
Till I get to hug that body so fine

I know you need a little space, just a little
That's why I ain't showin' my face (Right) 
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms)
(Right, right)
Right back in my arms (Right back here in my arms)
Right back, right back
Right back here in my arms
(Right) (Right back here in my arms)

No, no, no to the postman bringin' me letters
You know a brother gonna feel much better
If he keep his mind on, you know, whatever
Anything as long as it is makin' it wetter
Cause I can't stop thinkin' about what we do
There ought to be a law against the hoochie ooh! (Ooh!)
Can we groove? I don't want to do you no harm
I just want you right back here in my arms

Oh baby (Right back here in my arms)

Don't want you to write me no letters
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

Oh yeah, right back here in my arms 
(Right back here in my arms)
I just want you right back here in my arms (Right)
Right back here in my arms
(Right back here in my arms) (Right)
Right back, right back (Right)
I'll try to write you back
(Right back here in my arms)
