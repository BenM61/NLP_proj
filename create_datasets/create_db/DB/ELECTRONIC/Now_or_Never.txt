The walls are paper thin
You're moving in
I can see right through somehow
It all makes sense
Me caving in
But I barely know you

I'd rather have one night
Than nothing forever
Yeah that would be alright
With me
It's now or never
I'd rather have one night
Than nothing forever
Yeah that would be alright
With me
It's now or never

It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never

Like planets in the dark
We don't know how
We got here in the sky
Like magnets torn apart
You don't know why
You come back every time

I'd rather have one night
Than nothing forever
Yeah that would be alright
With me
It's now or never
I'd rather have one night
Than nothing forever
Yeah that would be alright
With me
It's now or never

It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
It's now or never
