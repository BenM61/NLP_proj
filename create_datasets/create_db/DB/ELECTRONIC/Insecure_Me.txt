It was the morning after the month before
And I'm looking like a nose with eyes
Take a trip or letter to make me feel better
'cause I know my mirror never lies

Have you ever had the feeling that your life's down the can
And the hand that holds the whip is not your own
Your breakfast's going cold and your routine's getting old
Is it me that's feeling insecure?

Hiding in the darkness where they can't see your eyes
In a naked city cinema
Watch the bodies rolling around on the screen
And nobody gives a damn who you are

You're surrounded by the bitter and the boring
And you wonder if you're on the turn
And again you get hurt when they're dishing the dirt
Is it me that's feeling insecure?

I haven't got time to worry about the future
When I'm busy covering up my past
Start to consider a tuck behind the ears
When I wonder if my looks will last

I could hit the bottle and the depths of despair
But come up fighting like the best
And I can tell myself that I'm winning the war
But then again I'm different than the rest

I'm not the hardest person in the world
But like the song says 'I will survive'
And I may be a wreck and a pain in the neck
But at least I feel that I'm alive

So I'll spit in your face and push you over the place
If I'm ever feeling so unsure
And you can really go to hell if you give me the soft sell
It's not me that's feeling insecure

It was the morning after the month before
And I'm looking like a nose with eyes
Take a trip or letter to make me feel better
'cause I know my mirror never lies

Have you ever had the feeling that your life's down the can
And the hand that holds the whip is not your own
Your breakfast's going cold and your routine's getting old
Is it me that's feeling insecure?

Forget the lows
Just love the highs
And wipe that look
Out from my eyes
Forget the face
That I despise
'cause I know my mirror
Never lies
I'll come up fighting
Like the best
But then I'm different
Than the rest
And I wonder how my looks will last
Because my life is really fast

And you wonder if you're on the turn
Oh, baby, won't you ever learn
That I'm a cut above the rest
Don't worry about the way I dress
And if my make-up looks a mess
I'm not about to get depressed
'cause I'm the one that loves to lose
Just loser in my f*ck me shoes

And I've got the touch
And I've got the feel
To make your good time
Really real
I'll just spit right in your face
And push you all around the place
Just love to love
Just love to live
Just love to live
Just love to love
And, baby, are you so, so sure
That you're the one that's insecure?
