Six foot six he stood on the ground
Weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him cryin' like a little whipped pup
Because of love

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hand
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world and a' turn it all around
Ever since time nothin's ever been found
Stronger than love

Most men are like me they struggle and doubt
Trouble their mind day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about
A word called love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young one close to her breast
I thank God that the World's been blessed
With a thing called love

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hand
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world and a' turn it all around
Ever since time nothin's ever been found
Stronger than love

Stronger than love
