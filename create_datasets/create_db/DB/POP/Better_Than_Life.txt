In a dry and weary land where is no water
My soul is thirsting for you
I have seen you in the sanctuary
Beheld your power and glory
My lips will glorify you
I will praise you as long as I live
In your name I will lift up my hands

Your love is better than life
Your love is better than life
Earnestly I seek you
My soul is thirsting for you
'Cause your love is better than life

Because you are my help I will be singing
In the shadow of your wing
I'm staying close beside you
Your right hand upholds me
I think of you through the night
With singing lips I will praise
And my soul will be satisfied

Oh, God, you are my God
Earnestly I seek you
I'm longing for you
Oh, God, you are my God
Earnestly I seek you
I'm longing for you
