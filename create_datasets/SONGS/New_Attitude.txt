Running hot
Running cold
I was running into overload
That was extreme.

I took it so high so low so long
There was no where to go like a bad dream.

Somehow that wires uncrossed
The table were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn.

I'm feeling good from my hat to my shoe
Know where I am going and I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I've got a new attitude.

I'm in control
My worries are few
'Cause I got love like I never knew
Ooh oh ooo oh
I've got a new attitude

I am wearing a new dress a new hat
Brand ideas
As a matter of fact
I've changed for good.

Must have been the cold nights new moon
Night changes
Or forget your love for just being like I should
