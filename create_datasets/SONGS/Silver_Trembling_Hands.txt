She keeps feeling for the blindfold 
She keeps wishing for the secret society 
To fall 
She keeps watching for the jaguar 
With the silver trembling hand 
Dagger 
Night 
Fight 
Tomorrow 
She forgets about the fear 

When she's high 
When she's high 
When she's high 
When she's high 

She puts diamonds on her forehead 
They remind her how the animals and 
Trees and insects call 
Is it wrong not to believe 
Nature makes us all compete 
Daggers 
Night fight 
Tomorrow 
She forgets about the fear 

When she's high 
When she's high 
When she's high 
When she's high
