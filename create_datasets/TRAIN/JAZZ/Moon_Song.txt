It came from nowhere the night that we met
Was like a melodious plea
Sweet moon song
That wasn't meant for me

Why is it always reminding me of
A love dream that never could be
Sweet moon song
That wasn't meant for me

It came gliding into my heart riding 
on a moon beam from above
Sorrow ended and the whole world blended
In a rhapsody of love; then

I heard her singing to somebody else
What I thought was my melody
Sweet moon song
That wasn't meant for me
