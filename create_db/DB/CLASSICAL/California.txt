Going back to California
So many good things around
Don't wanna leave California
The sun seems to never go down

Some people may treat you ugly
Some treat you beautiful too
That's the way life is all over
So look for the good things for you

California, there is a good place to be
California, that's where I'm feeling so free

California that's where I'm feeling so free
California there is a good place to be

California, that is a good place for home
California, I'll be back that be for long
