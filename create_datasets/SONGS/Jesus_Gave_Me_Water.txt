Oh, Jesus gave me water
Yes, He gave me water
Jesus gave me water
Oh, let His praises swell

Oh, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water
That was not in the well

Child and woman from Samaria
(Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water)
Who once came to get some water
(Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water)
Child in there, there she met a stranger
(Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water)
Oh, who did, did her story tell
(Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water)

Tell me he spoke, that she dropped her pitcher
(Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water)
And she drank and was made richer
(Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water)
Well, when Jesus gave her water
(Jesus gave her water, Jesus gave her water)
That was not in the well
