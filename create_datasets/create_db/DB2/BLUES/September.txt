Laura lays on the foot of the bed 
Mimics a noose with the telephone cord 
Doctor's on the phone 
And she hangs up and says 
"I ain't never gonna see the winter again" 
Then, I don't know how, but she smiles 

September, September 
September, September 

They carved your name into a stone and then they put it in the ground, 
I run my fingers through the grooves 
When no one's around 
Drink till I am sick and I talk to myself in the dog days of the summer 
And I feel you coming but I don't know how 

September, September 
September, September
