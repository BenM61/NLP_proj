Out in the park where they gather in the dark
It's a scaring atmosphere
Wide open eyes which are following the sign
It is soiled with blood and fear

One by one they're casting the unholy spell
A promise of murder - a present from hell

Danger for the free - like you hanging on a tree
Law and order is their goal
Shadows are behind you - run and take good care
They will snatch you if you fall

See them marching - hear them screaming
Never
See them marching - hear them screaming
Never we'll follow their way

March on - straight to hell
With the signs of death in hand
March on - scream and yell
You're bound for a yesterdays land

One after one they prepare for the run
Latest catchword is to choose
Face to face in an awful race
The pack of hounds is loose

Mortis comes with his loudest boots - beware
A message of yesterdays horror - take care

Wrath in their mind - there's no reason to find
They will never comprehend
Time is too late for a world to create
That is worth it to defend

See them marching - hear them screaming
Never
See them marching - hear them screaming
Never we'll follow their way

March on - straight to hell
With the signs of death in hand
March on - scream and yell
You're bound for a yesterdays land

One by one they're casting the unholy spell
A promise of murder - a present from hell

March on - straight to hell
With the signs of death in hand
March on - scream and yell
You're bound for a yesterdays land
