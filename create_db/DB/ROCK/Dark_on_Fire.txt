In the morning,
When you wake up
Daytime fades up
And your make up runs,
Just hold on

It sounds tacky,
But I'm hopeful
There's a reason
That the world turns round,
Through silent sound

Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Now oooooohhhhh
Wooooooo ohhhhh

I got lost
Inside a memory,
When I was young
And I almost drowned,
I was found

It sounds tacky
But I'm hopeful,
There's a reason
That I found the ground
And my sirens sound.

Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Now

So take all that you know and stuff it in a hole,
And in ten thousand years someone will take you home,
Rewind the words in which you roam

Ahh oooooh ooh
Oooooooh ooh

Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
Set the dark on fire
