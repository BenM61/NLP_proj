Give me strength
Don't give me grief
I don't wanna break or mend
Your beliefs
I wanna hear ya
And keep my mind free
I'm not gonna judge ya
I hope you don't judge me

Tell me do you feel an angel somehow
Has given you the right
To advise the world and his wife
How to live their lives
Whoever you may be
Whatever walk of life
It's you who hold your light
It's up to you whether to hide it
Or let it shine

We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone

Speak a solution
You can keep your problems
I hear your opinion
And yes we've got 'em
Somebody's trash is somebody's treasure
Somebody's laugh is
Somebody's pain
Somebody's loss is somebody's gain
It don't matter what car yo drive
Or whatever sound you like
It don't matter if you're praying to God
Or trusting mother nature's strife
What's true to you and I maybe
Won't be right for another kind of life
Can't we agree to disagree and we can be happy

We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are

We should be able to say what we think and make love at the end of the day
We should be able to step out out of sin and fall back in our own kind of way
It's ok if you don't wanna see, it's ok if you disagree
Just reach inside of yourself and realize that we're one of a kind
And all that you are is just fine know that you're you and I'm me
Free to fly
Free to fall
Free to learn, love and lie
It's up to you to live
If you don't know what to do with yourself, just breathe

We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone

We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone

Live, live, live
Let live
