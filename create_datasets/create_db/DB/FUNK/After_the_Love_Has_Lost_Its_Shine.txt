Ooh
I will endure, all the time
Hold together in the worst conditions
For at birth, we knew it to be, one of a kind
Mm, hmm
And as it grew into this love of a legend
We both made sure this piece of heaven
Would withstand any test
For the strength was made of love, faith and trust

And until all the glitter's gone
We'll be adding on to make it even stronger
True love will never die
Long after the love has lost it's shine

After it's all tired and worn
And the newness all wears off
We'll still be lovers

'Cause every time a weak spot
Would appear in this affair
We'd be mending it back together
With tender loving care
A promise to each other
That's lasted through the years
Is it solid as the first time
'Cause it's still alive and well

And until all the glitter's gone
We'll be adding on to make it even stronger
True love will never die
Long after the love has lost it's shine
Ooh ooh yeah
Na na na no

Aah
And until all the glitter's gone
We'll be adding on
To make it even stronger
True love will never die
Long after the love has lost its shine

After it's all tired and worn
And the newness all wears off
We'll still be lovers
Long after the love
Has lost it's shine
