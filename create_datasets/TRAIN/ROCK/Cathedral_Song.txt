I saw you from the cathedral
You were watching me
And I saw from the cathedral
What I should be

So take my lies
And take my time
'Cause all the others want to take my life

And I watch you with an intent, basic
It's the same for you
You hold your hand
And it's all fine - laced and
What would you make me do?

So take my lies
And take my time
'Cause all the others want to take my life

Serious for the winter time
To wrench my soul
whole cotton, whole cotton ears
But I know there must be
There must be, yes, I know there must be a place to go

You saw me from the cathedral
Well I'm an ancient heart
Yes, you saw me from the cathedral
Well here we are just falling apart

You catch me
I am tired
I want all that you are

I saw you from the cathedral
You were leaving me
And I saw from the cathedral
You could not see to see

So take my lies
And take my time
'Cause all the others want to take my life
