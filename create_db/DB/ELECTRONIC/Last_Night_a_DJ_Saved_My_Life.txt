Last night a D.J. saved my life
Last night a D.J. saved my life
Yeah
'Cause I was sittin' there bored to death
And in just one breath he said: You gotta get up
You gotta get off
You gotta get down
Girl

You know
You drive me crazy
Baby
You've got me turning to another man.
Called you on the phone
No one's home 
Baby
Why'd you leave me all alone?
And if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I do

Last night a D.J. saved my life
Last night a D.J. saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a D.J. saved my life
Last night a D.J. saved my life with a song
You know I hopped into my car, didn't get very far
I know
Before I had you on my mind why be so unkind?
You've got your women all around
All around this town

But I was trapped in love with you and I didn't know what to do
But then I turned on the radio
Found out all I need to know.
Check it out
Last night a D.T. saved my life
Last night a D.J. saved my life

Hey
Listen up to your local D.J, you better hear what he's got to say
There's not a problem
That I can't fix
'Cause I can do
On the double
And you don't let it
Trouble your brain
'Cause away goes trouble
Down the drain
Said away goes trouble down
The drain well
All right
