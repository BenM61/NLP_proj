I have learnt through all my past mistakes
Not to let the hurdles sap my energy
Time will tell and time is all it takes
You won't see the bastards knock the running out of me

And the band, they played one more song
One for the mocking bird, they played one more song
All the tears, they fell one by one
All for the mocking-bird, they fell one by one

Don't be fooled by those who feed you words
They just twist and tighten up the tourniquet
But the sweetest song of all the mocking-birds
Couldn't hope to match one note of any song we played

And the band, they played one more song
One for the mocking bird, they played one more song
All the dreams, they broke one by one
All for the mocking-bird, they broke one by one

What are you hiding from?
Why do you lock the door?
Open up the door!

And the band, they played

I have learnt, time will tell, years will pass, tears will fall,
Don't be fooled, fed by words, their sweet songs,
Mocking-birds!
