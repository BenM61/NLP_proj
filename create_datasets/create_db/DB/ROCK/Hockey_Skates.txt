Going down in the same old town down the same street to the same bar
And the same old people saying hi and I don't care
Going down in the same old bar and I don't even order anymore
I am so sick of consequence and the look on your face
I am tired of playing defense
I don't even have hockey skates 

You can meet me at ten thirty
I won't be there I'll be gone
We can talk like we are friends
Going over it all again
Talking about everything I am doing wrong 

Do you wish your nose was longer
So you'd have an excuse not to see past it
Do you wish the lights were brighter in the city that you live
I am so sick of consequence?... 

Do you think your boys club will crumble
Just because of a loud-mouthed girl?
