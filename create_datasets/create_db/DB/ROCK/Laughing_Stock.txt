Here we are
Our hands are all untied
We'd rather walk than ride
Then ride and ride and ride, ride, ride
Ride and ride and ride
There you stand
Your eyes are in your head
You should have stayed in bed
Oh, Fred in bed and ride, ride, ride
Fred in bed and ride

I keep on tellin' myself
Everything is gonna change
When I find someone to blame
And the people that I see won't bother me

I keep on hidin' myself
Away from everything
What a thing to fix your brain
I guess I want to be where it don't follow me

I keep on playin' my drums hey!
I keep on singin' my songs, I just got out my little red
I keep on doin' all the
Things I shouldn't have to do

I keep on buildin' my hopes
And you keep tearin' them down
What is this foolin' around
Are we supposed to be like history

I keep on playin' my drums hey!
I keep on singin' my songs, I just got out my little red
I keep on doin' all the
Things I shouldn't have to do

I keep on playin' my drums, drums
I keep on singin' my songs, oh, yeah
I keep on doin' all the things I shouldn't have to do
