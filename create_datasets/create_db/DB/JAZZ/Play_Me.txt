She was morning and I was night time.
I one day woke up to find her lyin' beside my bed.
I softly said, "Come take me."
For I've been lonely, in need of someone
As though I'd done someone wrong somewhere, but I don't know where.
I don't know where, come lately
You are the sun, I am the moon,
You are the words, I am the tune, play me.

Song, she sang to me, song she brang to me,
Words that rang in me, rhyme that sprang from me warmed the night.
And what was right became me.
You are the sun, I am the moon,
You are the words, I am the tune, play me.

She was morning and I was night time.
I one day woke up to find her lyin' beside my bed.
I softly said, "Come take me."
So it was that I came to travel,
Upon a road that was thorned and narrow, another place,
Another grace would save me.
You are the sun, I am the moon,
You are the words, I am the tune, play me.

You are the sun, I am the moon,
You are the words, I am the tune, play me.
