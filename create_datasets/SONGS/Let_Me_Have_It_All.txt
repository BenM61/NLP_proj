You have turned into a prayer
I can feel I'm almost there
Closer closer to the top
Looking down is quite a drop

Let me have it all
Let me have it all

You set up a barrier
Don't you know I'd marry ya
Can't explain how you make me feel
Looking down is mighty real
Make me feel like a king
Everything is everything

Let me have it all
Let me have it all

You set up a barrier
Don't you know I'd marry ya
Just to be near you is to be
Just so you can give it to me

Let me have it all
Let me have it all
