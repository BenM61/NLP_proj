You, you make me weak
Yeah you, you bring me to my knees
And all I ask of you
And all I ask of you

Is baby, please don't leave me
You are all I ever need

Oh baby, baby, baby
If you're leavin', leavin', leavin'
You would only, only, only
Take from me, me, me

Yellow, bracing teeth
These visions haunting me
Get me out of my head
You get me out of my mind
You get me out of my dreams
Marble browed in teeth
Come back to me in pieces
You get me out of my head
You get me out of my mind
You get me out of my dreams

Baby, please don't leave me
You are all I ever need

Oh baby, baby, baby
If you're leavin'
You would only, only, only
Take from me

Come clean, summer breeze
You leave it up to me
Just the thought of you leavin'
Had me on my knees, on my knees
Lately I've been feeling so weak
So set me free

Oh baby, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, leave me, leave me
You are all, all, all
I ever need, need, need

Baby, baby, baby
If you're leavin', leavin', leavin'
You would only, only, only
Take from me, me, me

Baby, baby, baby
If you're leavin', leavin', leavin'
You would only, only, only
Take from me, me, me
