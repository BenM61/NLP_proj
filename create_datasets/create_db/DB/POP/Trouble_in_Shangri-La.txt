I remember him, he was very young
No one spoke like him, he was someone
And I carried on, like I couldn't stop
All of it for us, baby

And you, you got in my way
Stood between me and my friends
It was my sin, it was my shame
You were unconscious to the pain I was in

I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Down to the sea
Show me the way back, honey
I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Show me the way back... to the sea

With honor be it spoken
To understand this light that we carry
And let it light your way
Of course, you know, I generally take it

Well, I make accommodations for you
And consider this...
Well, you used to be my love
I make excuses for you

I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Down to the sea
Show me the way back, honey
I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Show me the way back... to the sea

You can consume all the beauty in the room, baby
I know you can, I've seen you do it
And it brings up the wind
And it rises around you in pillars of color

But the promise has been broken
As you walk through the shadow of death
You try to see no evil
But you are so heartbroken
You say, dear god, make it stop!

Before the dawn of separation
Brings up the wind
Rises around you
I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
In pillars of color
Trouble in shangri-la
I make accommodations for you

I guess we don't believe
Things could go that far
We all believe in people...
That we think believe in god
Somewhere in the night...
Someone feels the pain
The ones who walk away
Try to love again...

I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Down to the sea
Show me the way back, honey
I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Show me the way back... to the sea
