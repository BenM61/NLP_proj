There's the same hotel, and we can go there now

We can go there now if you want to
Through the doors of that rented room
Yeah, we stumbled through
It was only hours

It seemed such a short while
We had no time to cry
Or sit and wonder why
We had so many things started to say

We had to get through
We tried the cinema
Within half an hour
We had to go find someplace else

Some more... you know
We tried a drinking bar
It gets so very hard
And when the cab ride gets too long

We go f*ck in the bathroom

We can't afford the time to sit and cry
Or to wonder why
We've got so many things started to say
We had to get through

Through the doors of that rented room
Yeah, we stumbled through
We had so many things started to say
We had to get through

We can't afford the time to sit and cry
Or to wonder why
We've got so many things started to say
We had to get through

We haven't got the time for telling lies
Or to even try
There's only days in between
There's just tomorrow

Through the doors of that rented room
Yeah, we stumbled through
It was only hours it seemed such a short while
In those pillows all the feathers that hold all our dreams

Whispered at the scene
Now they just seem to float on a breeze
I could have wrapped that pillow around my head
Face down on the bed
I could have drowned in those so-called dreams
