I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm with your love then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love

[Chorus:]
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn 
'Cus we're livin' in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the dawn to a better sun
You're the light in my deepest, darkest doubt
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love

[Chorus:]

Girl you came to me on a summer breeze
Kept me warm in love then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love

[Chorus:]

I believe in you
How deep is your love
