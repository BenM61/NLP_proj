Lord, let me have a dream
Without being a dreamer
Oh Lord, let me have a vision
Without being consumed of it

And let me work with diligence
Always knowing that
You're the start and the end of it
And oh Lord, let everything, everything I do
Remind me of my love for You

And Lord, teach me how to love
For so many are, they're in need of it
Oh Lord, teach me how to give
For it's in giving
Lord, that we, we learn how to live

And let me work, let me work
Let me work with diligence
Always knowing that You're the start
You're the start and the end of it

And oh Lord, Lord
Let everything, let everything I do
Remind me of my love for You
Oh Lord, Lord,
Let everything, everything, everything I do
Remind me of my love for You
