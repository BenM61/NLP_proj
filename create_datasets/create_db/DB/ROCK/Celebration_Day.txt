Her face is cracked from smiling  
All the fears that she's been hiding  
And it seems that pretty soon, everybody's gonna know

And her voice is sore from shouting  
Cheering winners who are losing  
And she worries if their days are few  and soon they'll have to go

My, my, my, I'm so happy  
I'm gonna join the band  
We  gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We are in the promised land 

She hears them talk of new ways 
To protect the home she lives in 
Then she wonders what it's all about when they break down the door. 

Her name is brown or white or black 
You know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell. 

My my my I'm so happy  
We gonna join the band  
We are gonna dance and sing in celebration  
We're in the promised land. 

Oh, there is a train that leaves the station 
Heading for your destination 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more
Yes, it has! 
And if you walk you're gonna get there 
And though it takes a little longer 
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan

Oh yeah, you'll moan
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, you'll moan, you'll moan

You're g-gone, you're g-gone, yeah-yea
You're g-gone
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my you are gone
You're gone
My, my, my
You're gonna, gonna get there, it's just a little longer
And when you see him in the distance you will wave your hand
