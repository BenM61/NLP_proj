Venus must have heard my plea
She has sent someone along for me

I have waited a long long time
For somebody to call mine
And at last he's come along
Baby oh nothing can go wrong
We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home till late
I say to myself each day
Baby oh long long live love
Mmm

True love must be the greatest thing
I know now why singers sing
Of the moon and stars above
How I love to be in love
We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home till late
I say to myself each day
Baby oh long long live love

Now of one thing I'm more than sure
Since love come I don't want more
Than to kiss him every night
Makes everything alright
We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home till late
I say to myself each day
Baby oh long long live love
Mmm

We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home till late
I say to myself each day
Baby oh long long live love
Mmm
Long long live love
