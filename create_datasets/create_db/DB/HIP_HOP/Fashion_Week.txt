We fall out but she always come back around
Hit Barney's and f*ck up a check there
In the dressing room, f*ck have sex there
"What's taking so long?" "Oh, she trying the next pair"
People see us everywhere and they just stare
And she mixing off white with SL

Until Paris Fashion Week, how soon is too soon?
