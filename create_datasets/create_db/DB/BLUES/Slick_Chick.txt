I'm a slick chick
On a solid kick always lookin' ready
Man, I'm on the mellow side

I'm a sharp queen
I make the hep cats scream
Know just how to send them
Man, I'm on the mellow side

Now when I start to jivin'
Beneath a groovy moon
Jack, you'll holler murder
And swoon, swoon, swoon

I'm a slick chick
I know that's the lick
Gee, I'm a killer
Man, I'm on the mellow side

Always lookin' ready
Man, I'm on the mellow side

Yeah, I know just how to send' em
Man, I'm on the mellow side

Oh, when I start to jivin'
Beneath a groovy moon
Jack, you'll holler murder
And swoon, swoon, swoon

I'm a slick chick
Don't you know that's the lick
Gee, but I'm a killer
Man, I'm on the mellow side
