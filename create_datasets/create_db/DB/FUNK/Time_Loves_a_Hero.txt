Well, they say time loves a hero 
But only time will tell 
If he's real, he's a legend from heaven 
If he ain't, he was sent here from hell 

Hear me well 
Seein' ain't always believin' 
Just make sure it's the truth that you're seein' 
Eyes sometimes lie, eyes sometimes lie 
They can be real deceivin' 

I got an Uncle in Puerto Rico 
Spends his days in the sun 
His nights in the casinos 
He left the States many years ago 
Took a fishin' boat to Puerto Rico 
Now my aunt - she is sad and lonely 
She'll never know that she drove him away 
As a coward I admire his courageous ways 

Well, they say time loves a hero 
But only time will tell 
If he's real, he's a legend from heaven 
If he ain't, he was sent here from hell 

Some say my uncle - that he's a zero 
His life is as a shell; he left it back at Stateside 
I'd say he's doin' pretty well without his shell 
Bumming 'round the beaches of Puerto Rico 

The beauty of the sunrise and sunset 
To his friends he wish he could tell 
They're at home still runnin' for bells 
Better San Juan than that blue collar hell 

Well, they say time loves a hero 
But only time will tell 
If he's real, he's a legend from heaven 
If he ain't, he was sent here from hell
