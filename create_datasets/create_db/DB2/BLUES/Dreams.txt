Just one more mornin'
I had to wake up with the blues
Pulled myself out of bed, yeah
Put on my walkin' shoes
And went up on the mountain
To see what I could see
The whole world was fallin', right down in front of me

'Cause I've a hunger for the dreams I'll never see, yeah, baby
Ah, help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah

Pull myself together
Put on a new face
Climb down off the hilltop, baby
Get back in the race

'Cause I've a hunger for dreams I'll never see, yeah, babe
Lord, help me baby, or, this will surely be the end of me, yeah

Pull myself together
Put on a new face
Climb down off the hilltop, baby
And get back in the race

'Cause I've a hunger for the dreams I'll never see, yeah, baby
Ah, ah, help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
