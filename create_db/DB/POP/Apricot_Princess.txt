You can never do wrong
It's me that makes the evening long
And I hope you believe me when I say
That I don't see any other
Yeah, you're the only one to meet my mother
And it shows she loves the way you love me, so
Yes I know she loves the way you love me, girl

But I wanna show them
How much I need her, I'm in this place again
Yeah, I wanna show them
That this ain't a fantasy, she's my best fucking friend
And I wanna show, I wanna show her the world
I need to know, she's down to go
And I wanna show, I wanna show her the world
But I need to know that I'm not a-
I'm not alone, oh
I'm not alone

I said, I wanna know, know, know, know, know
Said that I need to show, wanna show her the world
And I need to know that she's down to go
And I wanna know that she's not alone
And I'm not, no I'm not alone, I'm not alone
No, I'm not alone
I wanna know, said show her the world
And I need to know, na, na, know
