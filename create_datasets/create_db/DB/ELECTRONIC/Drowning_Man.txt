He's sinking faster than a drowning man
He'll grab a hold of anyone he can
Gun in his poket and a heart of ham
Uncle Sam...
He's dying faster than a rabid dog
Infect us all now he's losing blood
Nose for trouble and a soul of rock
Smokey's man...

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
Your going down
(Hay) NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

There's not much flesh
Just skin and bone
Cheeks sunk deep
Eyes popping wide
Don't put out a hand to help him
This drowning man will bite it right off
Right off , Right off , Right off...

He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen
He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen
He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen
He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
Your going down
(Hay) NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
Your going down
(Hay) NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
