Not that you remember
Maybe you locked away
Maybe we will meet again some better day
Some better life

Jonathan Fisk speaks with his first
Can't let me walk home on my own
Just like a knife down on my life
So many ways to set me right

It's such a long way home
Ooh that's how the story goes

And it's
Atom bombs some bloody razors
Atom bombs and bloody razors
Jonathan Fisk says it's a sin but he don't think twice 'cause to hell
Religion don't mean a thing
Oooh just another way to be right wing

Just like a knife down on my life
So many ways to set it right
Oh it's how it goes
That's how the story goes

It's such a long way home
Ohoooh you're too old to understand

'Cause I just wanna go home now
I just wanna go home now
Jonathan right down on my life
So many ways to set me right
Oohhh long walk home
That's how the story goes
Jonathan Fisk always a risk
Tells me he counts my teeth every night
I wanna get all back now
I wanna get em alright

I wanna turn him around yah
Oooh turn him around
Oooh ooh turn him around
