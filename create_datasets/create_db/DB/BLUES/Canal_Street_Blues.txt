Tell me down in New Orleans.
Whiskey's steamin' just like wine.
Tell me down in New Orleans.
Whiskey's streamin' just like wine.

Lord, my baby she's down there.
Wonder if my baby, she's gone wild?
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

They tell me Canal Street.
Is the longest street in town.
Tell me Canal Street.
Is the longest street in town.

Yes, you ride all day long.
You're still on Canal Street.
Yes, yes.
Then they tell me again, people.

Lord have mercy, it's the widest street in town.
Then they tell me again.
It's the widest street in town.
Lord, I'm gonna keep on ridin'.

Keep on, down in New Orleans.
