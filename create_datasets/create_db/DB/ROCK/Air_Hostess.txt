(Let's go!)
(Yeah! Alright!)

Walking through the terminal
I saw something beautiful
You left, for your duty call
Next time getting on the plane
That's when I see you again
I can't get you off my brain

(Let's go)
That uniform you're wearing
So hot I can't stop staring
You're putting on an awesome show
The cabin pressure's rising
My coke has got no ice in there

[Chorus]
Air hostess
I like the way you dress
You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better
I can fly in my mind
And you will look better
I messed my pants
When we flew over France
Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?
Air hostess

Throwing peanuts down the aisle
Stupid but it made you smile
You came over for a while
Then you whispered in my ear

The words that I longed to hear
I want you to thrill me here

You can't because you're working
The paparazzo's lurking
You didn't know I'm in a band
In England people know me
One photo's worth a hundred grand

[Chorus]

Air hostess
I like the way you dress
You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better

I can fly in my mind
And you will look better
I messed my pants
When we flew over France

Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?
Air hostess

Na, na na-na
Na, na na-na
Na, na na-na
Na, na na-na

Na, na na-na
Na, na na-na
Na, na na-na

That uniform you're wearing
So hot I can't stop staring
You're putting on an awesome show
The plane has almost landed
So tell me where I'm standing now

[Chorus]

Air hostess
I like the way you dress
You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better

I can fly in my mind
And you will look better
I messed my pants
When we flew over France

Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?
Air hostess

'Cause you're my air hostess
I love the way you dress
Air hostess
My air hostess

I love the way you dress
Air hostess
