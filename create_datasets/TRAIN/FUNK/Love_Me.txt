Love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss
Please love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss, please

I just can't take one more lover
Putting me under his other
I felt the pain, no more again
I give you all I can cover
Just promise you'll be my protector
Look over my fears and keep them clear
There'll be more problems here
I'm asking you to

Love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss
Please love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss, please

Well I guess I'm 'bout to find out
If there's truth in your soul
Your smile, your eyes are not enough alone
Is this a girl's intuition? (Yes)
This impossible love's our position
Bring me some light o face our life
I built a wall strong, I'll tell 'em why

Love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss
Please love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss, please

Now don't give me those eyes
It's meaning less, please hide it
Cause I am one to fall so far, so fast
That's why I'm asking you to love me

Love me from your heart
(That's why I'm asking you to love me right now)
Love me from your soul
(That's why I'm needing you to love me baby)
Take me as the one you chose
(Just the way that I am babe)
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss
Please love me from your heart
(Ooh love me right)
Love me from your soul
(Ooh love me freely)
Take me as the one you chose
(Just the way that you want to take me baby, take me)
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss, please

That's all I'm asking you to do
Please
Love me like you're supposed to
Please
Please
It's all I've been asking, all my life
Just a little love, just a little love
That's all that I want, that's all that I need
Just a little love
