It's the last dance
We've come to the last dance
They're dimming the lights down
They're hoping we'll go
It's obvious they're aware of us
The pair of us
Alone on the floor
Still I want to hold you like this forever and more

It's the last song
They're playing the last song
The orchestra's yawning
They're sleepy, I know
They're wondering just when will we leave
But till we leave, keep holding me tight
Through the last dance
Each beat of the last dance
Save me the first dance in your dreams tonight

They're wondering just when will we leave
But till we leave, keep holding me tight
Through the last dance
Each beat of the last dance
And save me the first dance in your dreams tonight
