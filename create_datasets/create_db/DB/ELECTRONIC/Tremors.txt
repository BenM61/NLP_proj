Vibrations of tremors that shook long ago
Tear holes in the fabric of all that we know

Can't survive with the secrets we have
All that we have is a lie
Hold the line
'Til the thread comes undone
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do

If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go,

Flood lines we etched when we merged into one
Rewind and scroll on before they were done

Can't survive with the secrets we share
If all that we share is a lie
Hold the line
Let the thread come undone
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do

If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go,

If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do

Vibrations of tremors that shook long ago
Vibrations of tremors that shook long ago
Vibrations of tremors that shook long ago
Vibrations of tremors that shook long ago

That shook long ago,
Vibrations of tremors that shook long ago
