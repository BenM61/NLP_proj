Standing looking in the mirror
Wondering who it is I see
The face seems so familiar
But it doesn't look like me
Something is changing ,something's different
A foreign look behind my stare
I feel frantic, almost desperate
He acts as if he doesn't care
A smile cracks his face, a tear comes to my eye
His laughter fills the room ,words echo in my mind
Look away- (Don't look at me)
Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away
Fell the lock of tension closing
As I slowly turn the key
I sense joints lock into place
Like cement setting in my veins
Like an attic stored with memories,the contents are so rarely seen
Look away- (Don't look at me)
Look away- (You won't like what you see)
Look away- (Fear what's inside me)
But I can't look away
A complex creature,I labor to see through the haze
I strive to know myself,but I'm lost within the maze
It's painful learning the truth about myself
So I always look away
Through the passage lies the answers,to the questions inside me
So,tomorrow like today, I'll stare again,doing nothing
