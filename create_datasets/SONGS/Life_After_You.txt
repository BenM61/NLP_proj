I've been on a roller coaster since you said we were over
'Cause you didn't want to be tied down
I felt like a loser, wasted and used
So scared to move without you around
I thought I was gonna die, turns out I survived

Hey, didn't need you anyway
I get better every day
Don't you think it's funny how it all works out
Yeah, I've finally got a life
I go on every night
Now I've got so much to say, so much to do
This is life, life after you

I've been on a roller coaster since you said we were over
I'm finally back to being me
I don't have to say I'm sorry
I'm the last one at the party
I don't ever think I've felt so free
I guess I should be thanking you for this brand new attitude

Hey, didn't need you anyway
I get better every day
Don't you think it's funny how it all works out
Yeah, I've finally got a life
I go on every night
Now I've got so much to say, so much to do
This is life, life after you
Hey, didn't need you anyway
I'm getting better every day
Don't you think it's funny how it all works out
Yeah, I've finally got a life
I go on every night
Now I've got so much to say, so much to do
This is life, life after you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey, didn't need you anyway
I get better every day
Don't you think it's funny how it all works out
Yeah, I've finally got a life
I go on every night
Now I've got so much to say, so much to do
This is life, life after you
Hey, didn't need you anyway
