La-la-la-la
Oh
Ah-ah-ah
(my darling
You mean so very much to me
And I feel so deeply
Ah-ah-ah

Duke, duke, duke, duke of prunes
I'll never forget you darling
I'll never forget your ballads
I'll never forget your rat race. in fact I might
Oh, I suppose I'll forget you eventually
What is your name? 
Nice to see you again)
