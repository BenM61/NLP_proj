First, you take my heart 
In the palm of your hands 
And you squeeze it 
Then you take my mind 
And play with it all night 

You take my pride and you 
Throw it up against the wall 
You take me in your arms, baby 
And bounce me like a rubber ball 

I'm not complaining 
What you're doing, you see 
Cause this hurting feeling 
Is, ooh, so good to me 

Don't you know that it 
Hurts so good 
Don't you know that it 
Hurts so good 

You take my name 
Scandalize it in the streets 
Anything you wanna do or say 
Is alright with me 

Turn right around and 
Make sweet love to me 
Ooo wee, baby, you're 
Sure nuff good to me 

Cause, baby, these 
Things you're doing to me 
It hurts so bad but 
It's worth all the misery 

Cause it hurts so good 
Don't you know that 
It hurts so good 
Ooh, hoo, baby, ooh... 

Ooh, boy, please don't 
Ever take the hurt off me 
Cause it would hurt even worse 
If you would ever, ever leave 
(Oh, yes, it would) 

Even though sometimes 
It's hard for me to beg 
(This heart is killing me) 
I make myself hold out 
Cause if it kills me, I don't care 

Cause, baby (baby) 
I don't want you to ever quit 
It ain't no good until it 
Hurts a little bit 

Cause it hurts so good 
Don't you know that 
It hurts so good 
Oh, baby 

It hurts so good 
Don't you ever, don't 
You ever stop now, baby 
Give me some, baby 
(Lord, have mercy) 

It hurts so good 
Don't you know that 
It hurts so good to me 
Good for me, yeah, yeah 

Hurts so good 
Ooh, baby
