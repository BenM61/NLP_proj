I'm alive
I can feel the blood
Rushin through my veins
An that's all I need to know
'Cause I'm not lookin for a change
'Cause I got friends and enemies
But it just don't bother me
'Cause as long as I believe
I can breath!

Metamorphsis, battle axe fortress
Four-hundred horsepower
Full moon the sorceress
Swollen members an my girl, NF
The predators an the terminator
The tribes cold breath
Why we hurt em' later
We can do so much damage now
They'll truck 'em
When I hit 'em
So much garbage around
Yells, bells, and whistles
Like carnival sounds
Phenominal adrenaline
From the words of my mouth

How did Shayne manage to rap?
With brain damage I'm phat
Remain famished and stacked
Your playin' with the
Praying mantis
In fact you gigantic
You sink like Titanic
Panic attack act up
An I'm a Mack truck
Crash into disaster
Smash like master-plaster
Punker
Rangle-monster wants
To stomp ya
Crushin 'cause I'm
Crushin' 
Will tomorrow be the same
Blood rushin' through my veins

A notice people I knew had to, that's we are of this point to do what I did of
So point to to whether it be easy enough to do

I'm sharin' a mouth
I'm like a crispy creme
Prevayer belt
With the sync notes
Swollen like your lymphnoids
We went from instro to intro to
Insto
Coincidentally
Messin up your mental state
We makin' ends glow
Pacific center 
Me an my kinfolk attention
Nobody can do it like your man mok'
My bands dope!
The tracks all flow
I'm beautiful
That's for sure!

The Harlem of Queens
The decibel kings
Inevitable, we were born to do incredible things
I let it ? like freedom
Swing letters from my jaw
Twenty six in the mix
An we do it better than ya'll

I'm a neanderthal
Your bound ta fall
I'm wonderful
We warned ya all
Its foreign to why'all
Its wonderful the underworld
Beautiful minds
Tryin' to keep it independent
In recruitable times

We crashin' through you
Now feel the magnitude
Were flashin' through
Inside of you
It has to do with how
You do your thing
Be true to only you
Well Moka only
Tellin' you
Is take your soul an
Talent to
The next plateau
An balance
Who you try to think of times two
