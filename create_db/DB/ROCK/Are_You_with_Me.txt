There will come a time
They will pull you out
It's too late to change your mind

Off the record, I've been saying
Cut the cord that's hanging you
On the record, information
Pretty soon they're selling you

Are you with me 
Nothing to trust in
You have the answers?
What are the questions
Are you with me
Are you with me now 

One's in your class
One's a relative
They're just getting started
One waits in line (put you on)
One in the next car (put you on) 

Off the record, I've been saying
Cut the cord that's hanging you
On the record, information
Pretty soon they're selling you

Are you with me 
Nothing to trust in
You have the answers?
What are the questions
Are you with me
Are you with me now
