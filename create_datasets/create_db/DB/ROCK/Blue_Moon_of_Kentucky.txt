Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on a moonlight night
The stars were shining bright
And they whispered from on high
Your love has said good-bye

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said good-bye

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It is on a moonlight night
The stars shining bright
They whispered from high
Your love has said good-bye

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said good-bye
