Now, just because you're pretty and you think you're mighty wise
You tell me that you love me, then you roll those big brown eyes
When I saw you last week your eyes were turnin' black
Go find the guy who beat you up, ask him to take you back

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can see you've been out on a spree
Well, it's plain that you're lyin'
When you tell me you been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

I used to spend my money just to make you look real sweet
I wanted to be proud of you when we walk down the street
Now don't ask me to dress you up in a satins and in silk
Your eyes look like two cherries in a glass of buttermilk

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can see you've been out on a spree

It's plain that you're lyin'
When you tell you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

Now, I guess our little romance has finally simmered down
You should join a circus, man, you'd make a real good clown
Your eyes look like a road map, I'm scared to smell your breath
You'd better shut those peepers 'fore you bleed yourself to death

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can see you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you tell me you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
