It was early one Monday mornin',
And I was on my way to school.
It was early one Monday mornin',
When I was on my way to school.
That was the mornin'
When I broke my mother's rule.

I've been in love with you, baby,
Before I learned to call your name.
I've been in love with you, baby,
Before I learned to call your name.
Now you're in love with someone else
I know that's gonna drive me insane!

Ooh wee baby,
You sure look good to me.
Ooh wee baby,
You sure look good to me.
Please tell me, pretty mama
Who can your great new lover be?
