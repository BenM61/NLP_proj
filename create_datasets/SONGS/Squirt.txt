Weighting over ten feet tall
Feet of clay, head of gold
Middle made of cannon balls
Rumour has is swallowed whole

Mineral, without a soul
That's the story being told
The estimated, undefeted
Champeen of the world

Big yet unfamiliar
Think bigger than the biggest bar
Think big, that's only half as large
Bigger, better, twice as hard
Outsized, extra large
Velocity very fast
Bigger than the closest star
Bigger than the motor car

Quick, quiet, confident
Comfortable, permanent
Undisputed every tense
Not a trace of what went left
More equal than the best
Unparalleled success
Everybody
