Spring is here and the birds are singing their love song
Tress are clapping to the rapid pace of my heart
Flowers open to the world at their appointed time
The laughter of a playing child
A kiss of love so tender and mild
These are essential to my well being

But it doesn't mean anything if you don't have a friend today
Trees could clap and birds could sing till heaven 
And earth pass away but you don't have to worry 
You got a friend
You got a friend

Spring's cool wind has escalated to a summer heat
Its high noon and everything is bright
Cloud above take the shapes of all of your favorite thing, 
Your favorite things
The sun is shining your way
No stormy clouds to darken your day
These are essential to my well being

But it doesn't mean anything if you don't have a friend today
Trees could clap and birds could sing till heaven 
And earth pass away but you don't have to worry 
You got a friend
You got a friend

But it doesn't mean anything 
But it doesn't mean anything 
But it doesn't mean anything if you don't have a friend today
But you don't have to worry 
You got a friend
You got a friend
You got a friend
You got a friend
You got a friend
You got a friend

You got a friend oh don't you, don't you know, don't you know
You got a friend oh don't you, don't you know, don't you know
