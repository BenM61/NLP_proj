Give me something hard to cure my loneliness
I'm so spent I'm out to steal a kiss
Curiosity has left my bed a mess
Touch me once I think I might still exist
I got something to waste the time
You're gonna love me you're gonna love me
Takes you up to the other side
Get on up or get left behind
Shady my satin drug
Far away I'm high and feelin done
Shady you got me on the run
High above on you can't get enough
My shady satin drug
Now someone tried to take my shade away
Kept ,e down for several times a day
I got bled she got stoned
That someone else he got left alone
Now I'm so done I think I might fade away
I got something to waste the time
You're gonna love me you're gonna love me
Takes you up to the other side
Get on up or get left behind
Shady my satin drug
Far away I'm high and feelin done
Shady you got me on the run
High above on you can't get enough
My shady satin drug
Give me something hard to cure my loneliness
I'm so spent I'm out to steal a kiss
Curiosity has left my bed a mess
Oh baby, touch me once I think I might still exist
But I can't remember
Shady my satin drug
Far away I'm high and feelin done
Shady you got me on the run
High above on you can't get enough
Shady my satin drug
Far away I'm high and feelin done
Shady you got me on the run
High above on you can't get enough
Shady my satin drug
Far away I'm high and feelin done
Shady you got me on the run
High above on you can't get enough
My shady satin drug
