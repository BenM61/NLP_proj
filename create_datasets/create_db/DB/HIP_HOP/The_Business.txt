[Verse 1: Yung Berg]
See I ain't never met a girl

And I ain't never met a girl

Ay,that business baby
Cause I really wanna drive you crazy
Wanna kiss wanna rub wanna lick wanna touch
Wanna put it inside you baby
Wanna climb on top of you
And give it to you for a hour or two
Until you cum I
Wanna hit it from the back
Oh stroke, stroke for a minute or two
Because ya so tight
Booty hung right
Got her tongue right
Ride with me
To the sunlight
We can have a little Sex in the City baby
You can be Carrie

Cause you so fine
And you just right
But you look much better with me
So let me manage ya girl
And did I ever tell ya
That it's nice to know ya
And you know I wanna

[Chorus]

Lets talk about that business baby
It's more than just a 8 letter word
It describes me and you
And what we do
Hold on this shit is so good, I gotta pay for it

Ya, see you been playing all night
Now its time to handle business baby
Keep goin' hard on ya job when ya do it
