A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'
In a little cafe just around the bend

I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you

I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you

A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'
In a little cafe just around the bend

A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
Bu we both know a change is coming
Come in closer, sweet release

I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you

Desert road from Vegas to nowhere
