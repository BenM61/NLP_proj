(R. Brewster-Spencer-Neeson-Eccles)
Why' can teach me, why' can reach me
Why' can beat me, why' can cheat me
Why' can bless me, why' can test me
Why' can take me through your hall of shame
You might think I've lost control
You think I've lost control
I've lost control
You might think I've sold my soul
You think I've sold my soul
I've sold my soul
Beyond salvation, there's not a lot I can do
Beyond salvation, I'll take a ride with you
You can kiss me, you can miss me
You can taste me, you can waste me
You can use me, you can lose me
You can make me feel alive again
You might think I've lost control
You think I've lost control
I've lost control
Beyond salvation, there's not a lot I can do
Beyond salvation, I'll take a ride with you
You can hate me, desecrate me
You can love me, you can shove me
You can turn me, you can burn me
You can drag me through
Your hall of shame
You might think I've sold my soul
You think I've sold my soul
I've sold my soul
Beyond salvation, there's not a lot I can do
Beyond salvation, I'll take a ride with you
