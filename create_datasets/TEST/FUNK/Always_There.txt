Such a good feeling
Thats where I wanna be (yeah)
Locked in your prison
Of total extacy (all right, all right)
Youre so strong and youre so together (baby)
Next you there is nothing better

Always there (to please you)
Always there (when I need you)
Always there (to love you)
Always there (thinkin of you)

And if you wanna
If you wanna do it too
Theres nothing better than being here with you
cause your love is a precious treasure (baby)
Only you can bring me joy and pleasure

Always there (to please you)
Always there (when I need you)
Always there (to love you)
Always there (thinkin of you)

Always there
Always there (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always there
Always there (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Always there
Gotta be there baby
