This is, this is China Town

She's more than most could ever be
More gore for her, more lust for me
More hot for her, much more for me
My adolescent fantasy

Oh, teenage thunder
Teenage thunder
Teenage thunder
Atom age wonder
Oh, teenage thunder

Money makes the world go round

Bombard the boredom, ban the bomb
No more heroes, no more fun
Shotgun hero kill for nothing
Kill for money, kill for fun

A teenage thunder
A teenage thunder
Teenage thunder, ah
Atom age wonder

A teenage thunder
Teenage thunder
Atom age wonder
A teenage thunder
My adolescent wonder

Ooh, I do it for her, do that for me
Get down, get on it
Just give it me
My adolescent fantasy

Oh, teenage thunder
A teenage thunder
Teenage thunder, ah
A teenage thunder
A teenage thunder
Atom age wonder

A teenage thunder
A teenage thunder
Teenage
