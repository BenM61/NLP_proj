Can you ride the rhythm of this human wave?
Caught up in the music and the space you save

Caught up in the magic of it
Caught up in the madness.

Sometimes you scare yourself
You're so strong
You're so tough.

Can you feel the fire pumping through your veins?
You try to get up and here it comes again

Right down to the basics of it
Right down to the wire.

So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack
Hold on, come back
Oh yeah, it's just that easy.
So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack
Hold on, come back
Oh yeah, it's just that easy.

Ring the bell, ring the bell, let the walls come down
Surrender your wings before they lift you off the ground
Surrender for every reason
Surrender yourself.

Sometimes you go so far
You're so hot
You can't stop.

Can you make it last
Make it rock to the bone?

If you do it faster will the hunger drive you home?

Right down to the basics of it
Right down to the wire.

So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack

Can you ride the rhythm of this human wave?
So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack
So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack
