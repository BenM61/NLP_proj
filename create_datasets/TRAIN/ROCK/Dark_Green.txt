Sunday morning, garden colours 
Tripping over every moment 
As they come fast like racing birds 
Swirling for the gathering 

Little children being golden 
Hanging on to window dreaming 
Don't tell them lies, 
Don't deceive them 
They rise now from the daisy fields 

Let the colour river flow 
Close your eyes, let it rise inside of you 
Sit beside me now darling 
Oh we're gonna see a change 

Won't be long now before it turns 
These heavy days of prophet tales 
All shameless rhyme and remedy 
We'll leave behind us when we sail 

Let the colour river flow 
Close your eyes, let it rise inside of you 
Sit beside me now darling 
Oh we're gonna see a change 

You're inner mind, 
There's more to feel 
Out to the stars, There's more to feel 
Don't let go of your lover's hand 
Everything may soon be over 

Let the colour river flow 
Close your eyes, let it rise inside of you 
Sit beside me now darling 
Oh we're gonna see a change
