Demons are following me
Following what we can't see
I just want to dance, baby
Move around, twirling
See you on the floor, you're back
Nobody has it like you have

Let me feel something
More than just the ordinary night
People in the club, they be hatin', baby
They see you lookin' over, relatin', lady
I just wanna, hold you down
Maybe if you wanna go around town
Walk the High Line, do a thing
Maybe if you wanna swing
You gettin' mad, awfully bitter
When no one pays attention, but you know you're a winner
For me
For me
Let's do it, on count of three
One, two, three
Aww
On time

Cupid keeps targeting me
Arrows are flying, I can't see
I just want a Michelle Obama lady
To hold me down when the world's crazy
See you own the city, so bad
Nobody loves you like your dad

Let me feel something
More than just the ordinary night
People in the club, they be hatin', baby
They see you lookin' over, relatin', lady
I just wanna, hold you down
Maybe we can walk around the downtown
Go to Paris, maybe France
Even Russia if you wanna dance
You gettin' mad, awfully bitter
When no one pays attention, 'cause you know you're a winner
For me
For me
Let's do it, on the count of three
One, two, three, aww

Oh darling
What you waiting for?
You know we've got it
Let me, let me
Let me
Hey
One, two, three
One, two, three
Move a little
One, two, three, aww
