Hands up 
I got my eyes facing down  
I'll show you where my tears come down 
Slowly down

Hands up 
I got my eyes facing down 
I shudder when my tears come down  
So slow down
So slow down

Suddenly my tears come down 
Slowly down

Hands up  I got my eyes facing down 
I'll show you where my tears come down  
Slowly down
So slowly down

Hands up  I got my eyes facing down 
I 'll show you where my tears come down 
Slowly down

Hands up  I got my eyes facing down  
I shudder when my tears come down  
So slowly down 
So slow down
