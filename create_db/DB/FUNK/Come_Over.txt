Won't you come over and make love to me,
'Cause I haven't seen you in a while.
Really miss your smile, oh.
Won't you come over and make love to me.
Baby I want ya.

Every time we're together, I feel a special part of me,
Drawing me closer...closer to you, baby.
I can't explain....it's just a magic that we share.
Something between us two.

Won't you come over and make love to me,
'Cause I haven't seen you in a while.
Really miss your smile, oh.
Won't you come over and make love to me.
Baby I want ya.

Sitting here in my window, thinking of nothing but your face.
Oh, baby, I try to remember how it used to be,
When you used to love me,
Love me everyday.

I don't want to fight ya. I just want you to see,
That you are the one, the only one
That's for me.
Baby, let me show ya, there's no greater love.
Baby I love you for the things you,
And I want you to come over.

Won't you come over and make love to me,
'Cause I haven't seen you in a while.
Really miss your smile, oh.
Won't you come over and make love to me.
Baby I want ya.

I don't want to fight ya. I just want you to see,
That you are the one, the only one
That's for me.
Baby, let me show ya, there's no greater love.
Baby I love you for the things you,
And I want you to come over.

Won't you come over.
Won't you come over.
Baby I just want to make sweet love,
Just want to show you, you are the one.
