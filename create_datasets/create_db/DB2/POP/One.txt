Starlight shimmers everywhere
There's a certain something in the air
Can you feel what I feel in me?
It's in the air, electricity oh, oh

Glimmering under neon lights
I can see the look, that's in your eyes
Like a shooting star in a galaxy
Making its way to the heart of me

I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me
I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me
I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me
I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me

My pulse is racing and I'm feeling high
Never-ending starts tonight
When you do what you do to me
Come on and let yourself feel the need in me, oh, oh

Circling and we're getting close
Can you imagine, just suppose
It's a feeling that I need to know
Close to touch like Michelangelo

I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me
I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me
I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me
I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me

Can you hear me?
I'm connecting with you
Can you feel me?
I'll do anything to have you near me
I was wondering, will you reach me?

Can you hear me?
I'm connecting with you
Can you feel me?
I'll do anything to have you near me
I was wondering, will you reach me?

I'm the one
Can you hear me?
I'm connecting with you
Can you feel me?
I'll do anything to have you near me
I was wondering, will you reach me?

I'm the one
Can you hear me?
I'm connecting with you
Can you feel me?
I'll do anything to have you near me
I was wondering, will you reach me?
