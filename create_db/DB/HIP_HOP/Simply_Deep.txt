Is anybody home in there?
I unexpectedly dropped by your heart
I simply wanted to hear
The cry of my love's never ending start
Impossible escaping you
And circumstances never stand a chance
So intrigued by the things you do

'Cause through my eyes I vision you
Oh
Your love protects my every move
O O O oh
And my life sways to your heartbeat
My everlasting love is simply deep

Each second spent is timeless
When I'm with you time seems to take a rest
No routine's ever lay with us,
'Cause everything is new when you're in love
So delighted that you feel the same
You say with me you're never liable to pain
Never love another again

'Cause through my eyes I vision you
Oh
Your love protects my every move
O O O oh
And my life sways to your heartbeat
My everlasting love is simply deep

As I
Lay here in the midst of ongoing creation,
Me as a whole
Can only think of you

And you
Breathe the air that surrounds the every move I run
And I never sleep
Without endless dreams
Of love so simply deep
Between you and me

'Cause through my eyes I vision you
Oh
Your love protects my every move
O O O oh
And my life sways to your heartbeat
My everlasting love is simply deep

'Cause through my eyes I vision you
Oh
Your love protects my every move
O O O oh
And my life sways to your heartbeat
My everlasting love is simply deep
