Come through here so sweet scented
In life girl you need me in it

And introduce you to my world
And introduce you to the better side of life

And I'm a show you how to get it
All you got do is be with it and
Let me hold you
Down like a real man's supposed to
I never would have approached you
If I ain't have intentions on doing good
See dude you with is so fooled
To me girl you're so cool
And all I'm asking you to do is
Let me hold you
Down like a best friend and two homies in a gang
When you cry I wanna feel your pain
No secrets, no games
All excitement, nothing plain
Keep you happy

When we hit the mall we can ball till there's no more left
I know you ain't used to it but you gonna get used to it
Cause that's the only way I'm a do you and just
All my hommies think I'm tripping cause I got you a pad
See they just mad cause they ain't get you

Scorpio is your sign and girl your so fine
And I would do whatever in no time
Let me hold you
No shine
It's what you're coming with but I'm a change all that
Rearrange that
Put you in the range all black
With the rims to match 
Phone attached 
TV's in the back

Niggas look at me like now here you go 
Really bout to blow some doe
But ain't nobody did it before so why is you so go hold it
Cause I believe this was meant to be

You can never go wrong if you
