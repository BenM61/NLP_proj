You're the first thing I see when I wake up in the morning
And the last thing I see when I turn off my phone, yeah
I skim through your insta, looking for a warning
I see you with a girl and I'm pretty sure you're on it
I'm in too deep, do you know that I'm sinking
I wait like a fool as I'm begging you to dive in
Lying on my bed don't know what I'm thinking
Hold up, there's a light on my phone and I'm hoping

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
Tell me you want me
Say that you feel the same
Stay with me, baby
And I will play your game
Say that you want me
Say that you need me

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
You say you want me
But do you feel the same?
Take it deeper
I never want nothing
Say that you want me
Say that you need me

I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling

You are the one got me sitting on my own head
Playing with my love and don't really want me
When you're up getting down till six in the morning
Wonder how many girls are at home when the phone rings

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
Tell me you want me
Say that you feel the same
Stay with me, baby
And I will play your game
Say that you want me
Say that you need me

I hear you calling
I hear you call my name
You say you want me
But do you feel the same?
Take it deeper
I never want nothing
Say that you want me
Say that you need me

I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling
I hear you call, I hear you calling

(Say it, baby)
(Say it, baby)
(Say it, baby)
