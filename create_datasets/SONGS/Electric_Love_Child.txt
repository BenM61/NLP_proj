People say she's from another time, got a neon heart, got an X-ray mind 
Oh, a spiritual attraction 
Two black eyes painted on her face, just one look'll lay your soul to waste 
Oh, a ritual reaction 
Let my dreams run away, tell me baby, tell me baby that you're gonna stay 
Touch my body, crush my soul, love 

Sweet Electric Love Child, Sweet Electric Love Child 

Little girl wanna stay so high, reach down and touch the sky 
Oh sunshine again 

Aw my sugar gonna shoot the moon 
Dancin' in an old cartoon on the windowpane 

Trip the lights, drift away 
Tell me baby, tell me tell me what you wanna say - what d'you wanna say? 
Touch my body, crush my soul, oh baby, I'm in love love love love... 

Sweet Electric Love Child, Sweet Electric Love Child 

Sweet Electric Love Child, Sweet Electric Love Child 

Oh honey, child, oh sing it, huh 
Sing it baby, oh child, yeah baby, oh, oh my my my my...
