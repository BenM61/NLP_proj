Swim in the river ascending
Free of fear filled with purpose
Nishikigoi fights through oceans adversity
Against the current to obtain the highest goal

Swim through our sins of suffering
Climb to the falls of dragons gate become
Transform from koi into a beast, dragon

A living symbol of courage
No wave will shatter these scales (shatter the scales)
Dreams of free from pours
Pours of the dying
Water falls up ahead
What they left to do

Swim through our sins of suffering
Climb to the falls of dragons gate become
Transform from koi into a beast, dragon

To have a shot
To becoming a
This dragon will rise and be king

I'm a witness to a burning form
Evolution is complete
A breath that turns into clouds producing rain of fire
Watch the world move according to each desire

Swim through our sins of suffering
Swim through our sins of suffering
Climb to the falls of dragons' gate become
Transform from koi into a beast, dragon
