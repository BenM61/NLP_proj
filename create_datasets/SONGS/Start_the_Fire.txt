When your heart dictates the moment
The room feels  you own it
All you see is for the asking
But just one look is all you're after
It opens a whole new world

Its not what you're saying
But its everything you do
It drives me crazy
It's all because of you

Slide over here
Skin against skin
Melt into me
Forget  you begin yeah
Cause everyone needs a touch
Everyone needs a touch

You're a desert I'm rain
I poor down you soak me in

Its amazing
Its just a new horizon
Somehow you make me
Feel just I'm flying

Slide over here
Skin against skin
Melt into me
Forget you begin yeah
Cause everyone needs a touch
Cause everyone needs a touch
No matter who you are or you're from
Some down the road gonna nee someone yeah
Cause everyone needs a touch
Everyone needs a touch

Wearing nothing but the summer breeze
Baby doing what comes naturally
Doing what comes naturally
