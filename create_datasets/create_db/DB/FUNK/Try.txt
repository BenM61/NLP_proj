Working so hard, I was so alone
So much on my cards, so much going on
And lately I've found I'm heading astray
And none of your feelings came in to play
I'll make you stronger, stronger
'Cause now I can see the fakes that use me
I'll make you stronger, stronger
'Cause I know it's you saving me

I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
I will fight, fight, fight for what we had before
You don't even want this
You don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
Try na, na, na

10 days apart when 3 seems insane
You can't hear my voice you still hear my name
A call from a afar a message to send
I pray you don't leave me nothing's changed
I'll make you stronger, stronger
'Cause now I can see those fakes that use me
I'll make you stronger, stronger
'Cause I know it's you saving me

I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
I will fight, fight, fight for what we had before
You don't even want this
You don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home

I'm so sorry darling
I've been breaking this home for far too long
So I, I

I will try
I will fight
You don't even want this
You don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
Try na na na, oh...
