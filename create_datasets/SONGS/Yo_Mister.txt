Oh, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

My crazy friend named Cara
After all of us told her, ?No?
S-s-she'd get another spoon ball
Now, she's going no where slow

Her papa caught her for the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only seventeen

Yo, mister how's your daughter? how's your girl?
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone

Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then s-s-she started skipping school
Then Cara got high to make disappear
A world full of fools

In her eyes her father was the biggest fool of them all
And she was speeding, that's what she?d say
Maybe, maybe, maybe she wouldn't talk so stupid
If she knew how much she needed this fool today

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

She needs you right now mister
?Cause she ain't got long to live
It?s so easy to say, ?I love you?
But it?s harder to forgive

Her father cried when I told him that Cara twice got knocked up
He said, ?Just like her mama, aha, she shows her body
When she wants to show love, she tried that stuff with me
And I beat her down, there's no way I could let her stay
Couldn't let her stick around ?

?Cause I tried so hard to raise her right
He said, ?What made her turn out this way?, I don't know
What made her turn out this way, I don't know, I don't know
And I said and I said and I said

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know, every thing
Every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

But she needs you right now mister
She ain't got long to live
It?s easy to say, ?I love you?
But it?s harder to forgive
(How?s your daughter tonight?)

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
(How?s your daughter tonight?)
Yo, mister how's your daughter?
(How?s your daughter tonight?)

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
(How?s your daughter tonight?)
Yo, mister how's your daughter?
(How?s your daughter tonight?)
