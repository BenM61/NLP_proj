I just can't get without you 
I just can't get without you 

Can't you see 
You've taken the soul from me 
I can see 
I've been lost on the way 

I just can't get without you 
There's nothing left 
Just a view we cannot share 

Always thought there'd be 
A way for you and me 

Can't you see 
You're something less to me 
Never free 
I'll watch you move away 

Can't you see 
You've taken the soul from me 
Should have seen 
You'd take it out of me 
You've taken it all from me
