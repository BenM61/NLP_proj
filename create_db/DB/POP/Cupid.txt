Hey, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, oh, oh

You're the perfect part of me
You're the oxygen I breathe
You're a superstar
A work of art, it's electricity

You're a yes in a world of no's
You're the Beatles to my Stones
It's a sweet romance
A spotlight dance
Girl you shake me to my bones

But every now and then I'll start to slip away
I gotta' hear you say

Take me out, spin me around
We can laugh when we both fall down
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
And when I sing out of key
Still play air guitar for me
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right

Hey, oh, oh, oh
Hey

And when we fight we fight
And it ain't a pretty site
Well it's not complex
It's the make up sex
Don't we always get that right
Well they don't make a pill , that can give me the thrill

When you look at me
Then I hear you say

Take me out, spin me around
We can laugh when we both fall down
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
And when I sing out of key
Still play air guitar for me
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right

It's quite clear to me
That we were always meant to be
You're my bird
Baby I'm your bee
You got me A to Z

Take me out, spin me around
We can laugh when we both fall down
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
And, when I sing out of key
Still play air guitar for me
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right
Let's get stupid dancing with cupid tonight
Don't feel all kind of right

Hey, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, oh, oh
