Raise your hands and lift your voice
Make some noise
This is your time, come on everybody
Rejoice, come on, rejoice

Life throws us around in circles
That never seem to come to an end
Before you know it you don't know how or when
You lost the joy but you're lost too

The burning fire that burns deep within
But it's never too late to start again
Just because you can't, forget the hurry
It's time to lay it on top

Raise your hands and lift your voice
Sing a new song to the Lord
Give Him thanks and make some noise
This is your time, come on everybody

Rejoice
Come on, rejoice
Rejoice, come on

You don't have to look very far now
To find a reason, to find a rhyme, no
You just got to stop, you got to take the time
To see His glory, feel His mercy
To see the life that He's given to us

All the joy and all the forgiveness
(Before the Lord's mountain)
Before the mountain
Before we start to climb

Raise your hands and lift your voice
Sing a new song to the Lord
Give Him thanks and make some noise
This is your time, come on everybody

Rejoice
Come on, rejoice
Rejoice, come on
Ooh, move over

Make some noise, yeah
Come on, ooh yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
God speaks unto you, everybody rejoice

This is the day the Lord has made
And I will rejoice
This is the day the Lord has made
And I will rejoice

This is the day the Lord has made
And I will rejoice
This is the day the Lord has made

Before the rocks, before the mountains
Before we start to climb, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Raise your hands and lift your voice
Sing a new song to the Lord
Give Him thanks and make some noise
This is your time, come on

Raise your hands and lift your voice
Sing a new song to the Lord
Give Him thanks and make some noise
This is your time, come on everybody

Rejoice
This is the day the Lord has made
And I will rejoice
This is the day the Lord has made
And I will rejoice
