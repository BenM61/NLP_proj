I want to know itsu kara
Kokoro ikitsuiteiru no
Sore wa guuzen
Anata to deatta toki

Atarashii sekai ga mawaridashi umare kawaru
Kono mune no takanari ga kienai you ni
Fukiareru nami ni nomikomarenai you ni
Dream of sky high kisetsu wo yume might

Stay by my side
Ima hajimaru kono omoi
Dakishime nagara aruiteku
Stay by my side
I can mitsumete kureru kara
Mou hitori jyanai
Anata no tame ni
Take me to your dream
I will walk with you

Can you stay kono mama
Kimochi tsuranuite yuku no
Sukoshi tomadou
Hayai supiido ni makezu

Kirameku hitomi ga utsushidasu anata to watashi
Kono ryoute no nukumori kienai you ni
Sugiyuku jikan ni tada nagasarenai you ni
Dream of sky high omoi wo kanaete

Stay by my side
Ima anata ni dou utsuru
Nakimushi datta koro no watashi
Stay by my side
You can mamotte kureru kara
Mou nakanai yo anata no tame ni
Take me to your dream
Gambattemiru kara

Stay by my side
Ima hajimaru kono omoi
Dakishime nagara aruiteku
Stay by my side
I can mitsumete kureru kara
Stay, stay

Stay by my side
Itsuka zutto soba ni irareru hi made
Sutenai kagiri yume wa nigete ikanai
Stay by my side
Shakunetsu no kotoshi no aoi natsu wa
Issho ni karada wo kogashitai

Stay by my side
Stay, stay with me
Stay by my side
Don't run away
Don't be afraid
Stay, can you stay?

Stay by my side
Never cry again
Stay, stay
Stay by my side
Hold on to dreams
Stay, stay
