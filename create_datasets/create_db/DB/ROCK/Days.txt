And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

And I worked so hard
And I killed myself
And you broke my bones
And I sold my soul

And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

And I could have been your other
And I could have been your sister
Be your twin brother
I just wanted to be

And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time 
We were just wasting time 

And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you
