Trouble is her only friend and he's back again
Makes her body older than it really is
And she says it's high time she went away
No ones got much to say in this time
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down

As strong as you were
Tender you got
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

If she had wings she would fly away
And another day god will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down,down,down

As strong as you were
Tender you got
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means

I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

And they all want pretty
New York City lights
And summers little girl has been taken from the world tonight
But the stars and stripes

As strong as you were
Tender you got
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And i'll carry you home

As strong as you were
Tender you got
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home

I'll carry you home
