I love you
And all it takes is just one night alone with me
To show you that there can never be anyone else

All I need is just one night alone
Just one night alone, one night

And as we lay down here together on this soft warm bed
I think back to the time when we first met
And all those memories that just keeps dancin' in my head

I love it when you touch me here
When you touch me there
And when you touch me right here
Show you right

We had so many good times
But the best time was
When I fell in love in just one night

All I need is just one night alone with you
And I'll show you love like you've never seen before
Just one night alone with you, I'm all you need
And I'm sure you'll come for more

The way you make me feel so happy
The way you make me feel so good
That is something I just can't hide

And the way your body touches my body
It penetrates to a feeling deep, deep inside
The way you make love excites me, everywhere

My neck, my lips, my feet, can you see?
But then again, you've got to be real good
In order to make love to me

All I need is just one night alone with you
And I'll show you love like you've never seen before
Just one night alone with you, you're all I want
You're all I need, and I've gotta have you to myself

Oh, I need you so much

Oh yeah, I know you need me because I am the man
And when it comes to makin' love
I am in control, I know this, I mean, I know you're there

But I'm the one who has to get up all the strength
And creativity to do the job that I do
Huh, well speedy lately you've been fast
The next time you do your job try to last

Try to last? Yeah, try to last
Wait, wait a minute, what, what, what do you mean try to last?
You know, at least we can wake up in the morning together
And you can bring me a cup of tea or something

Oh, I just thought when you said try to last I thought
I wasn't doing the job, well
Well, you don't last that long, do you? I mean what's wrong with you?
Oh, you mean when I had my fever? I was sick, sweetheart

I mean, you know, what are you talking about?
It's getting a bit, I mean, look, normally it's the woman
Who get the headaches but that doesn't happen any more
I see that, it's you, the guys are getting all the headaches
These days and it's not happening

Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
I do my thing, I mean, I just had a bad back, that's all
I thought you said it was a headache
Yeah well that too, but you know, give me a break

You've had so many things wrong with you lately
You forgot on which one's wrong now, I'm sleepy
Yeah well, I'm gonna go out and get me some fun
Hey, where are you going? Naughty girls need love too, bye bye

Don't try that, hey, wait a minute, hey, wait a minute
I'm out the door, hey, give me my money, see ya
Hey, nice knowing you
Hey, give me my money
