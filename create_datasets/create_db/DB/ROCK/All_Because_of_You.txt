Pull the plug and cut the cable
I've got the time but I know I'm not able
I stand up and I leave the table
My state of mind is becoming unstable

I've played this game that is not mine
I'm through, my time has come to shine
I'll break the rules and cross the line
It's time to go
C C C C CRAZY

And all because of you
It's all I want to do

We talk sweet but we're tainted with lies
We make a promise where there's no alibies
I put my life in the hands of a joker
She went to bed with a real-estate-broker

I'm breaking out I'm breaking free
This shit is all because of me
This is the man I'm going to be
And he's bound to go
C C C C CRAZY

(I'm breaking out I'm breaking free this is the man I'm gonna be)
And all because of you
(I break the rules and cross the line I'm fighting back to take what's mine)
It's all I want to do
