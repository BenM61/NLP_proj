They say I'm nothing but a party girl
Just like a million more all over the world
I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high
But I have seen the hungry look in their eyes
They'd settle for anything in disguise of love
Seen the party girls look you over
Seen them leaving when the party's over

They can't touch me now
You say you don't mind
We're so hard to find
I could give you anything but time

Give it just one more try
Give it a chance
Starts like fascination
Ends up like a trance

You'll never be the guilty party will you
Maybe someday we can go hiding from this world
Maybe I'll never get over this change in style
But I don't want to lock you up and say you're mine
Don't want to lose you or say good-bye
I'm the guilty party and I want my slice
But I know you've got me in a grip-like vise
They can't touch me now 
You say you don't mind
We're so hard to find
I could give you anything
I would give you anything
I can give you anything but time
Time
Time
Time
