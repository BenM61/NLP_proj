I'm so far out of sight
Sounds about right

I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right
Sounds about right
Kill this cup, not my vibe
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light
Look alive
I can get you so right
I just need an invite

I'm a smooth criminal
Michael Jackson moonwalkin'
Like I'm on a pill or somethin'
Five bitches 'round me, mane
It's 'bout to be a royal rumble
Hands up if you want the lumber
Hands up if your head the dumbest
Promise I'mma keep you cummin'
I get throwed out my mind
Grab a cup, catch a vibe
You look at me and you see big diamonds
I pressed the button on the coupe
The ceilin' go behind me

I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right
Sounds about right
Kill this cup, not my vibe
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light
Look alive
I can get you so right
I just need an invite

You my target, no doubt
Somethin' 'bout you really stood out (Poke it out)
Come here, baby, 'cause you got three strikes
Come here, baby 'cause you got what I like
Lit from head to toe (Like Bic)
We can pour us a cuatro
Kick back, we can roll
I'mma stay rollin' indo
Shoppin' spree before breakfast
Yeah we stay in the latest
I'mma see to it, that you go crazy
Don't think I'm here to judge you
I'mma rock you like a baby
Turn you out, yeah I'm that one
I'mma get you where I want you

I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right
Sounds about right
Kill this cup, not my vibe
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light
Look alive
I can get you so right
I just need an invite
