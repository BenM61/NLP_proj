[Bow Wow]
When I was 8 I was rhyming not back yard game playing
Watching Snoop anxiously and waiting for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I know that I am man 
I'm going down in history like American Band stand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep coming wit dough man
You steady watching stealing but there ain't no hope man
You dealing with something bigger than the US oh man
And ain't no joking
Fresh like fat-laces and dukey ropes and I keep on smoking
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm stroking
Look at me now days girl a dog is poking
Addicted to it Jd say I got it bad
18 nigga making more than yo dad see
They think they doing it but I'ma out do em
If you know somebody like that pull up and say to em

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri]
Ye ain't riding (ye ain't riding) 
Ye ain't bumping like I'm bumping
Ye ain't saying nuthin homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it (ye ain't got it)
You don't keep it thugging like I keep it thugging
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

[J-Kwon]
Ye ain't big (big) whipping
Ye ain't steady tip tipping
No girl getting homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
Think ye is (think ye is)
But cha ain't (but ya ain't)
Think you can get it crunk like me but you can't 

[Bow Wow]
Now every record that I make I'm trying to get up out the store man
Every car I drive I'm trying have you saying whoa man
Fourth album comeback power like Rogaine
Records say Columbia but I'm So So man 
I stay on my grind bringing in that dough man
From records to movies now a tv show man
Anything given to me I'm goin' rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breaking they neck man 
Blinded by the light glistening off the brake lane
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't trying to go prep
Like these lil R'n'B groups that need my help
Wish they had my style wish they had my rep 
But oh no, you'll never have it like me man
And if you can't understand this is what I'm sayin

[Chorus]

[J-KWON]
Ye ain't big (big) whippin
Ye ain't steady tip tippin 
No girl gettin homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
Think ye iz (think ye iz)
But cha ain't (but cha ain't)
Think you can get it crunk like me but you can't

[Bow Wow]
I got a spot in MIA to get away from the cold weather 
Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shutting suckers down in the parking lot
Especially when they trying to stunt thinking they hot 
All out the window talking loud like they running my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man 
Tired of making girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quick sand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we crew thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin 
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

[Chorus: x2]

[J-Kwon]
Ye ain't big (big) whipping
Ye ain't steady tip tipping
No girl getting homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
Think ye iz (think ye iz) 
But ya ain't (but ya ain't)
Think you can get it crunk like me but you can't
