As we speak about love today
Many men will let it drift away
Until inner feelings recognize
That inner joy will harmonize
There is one possibility
That we share universally
It don't take much ability
To let it shine naturally

Spread your love around and around the land
Spread your love to every grain of sand
Spread your love, let's spread our love together
Spread your love, I can feel it getting better
Spread your love, let's bring our hearts
together
Spread your love, spread your love around

As you live one day at a time
Independence plays on your mind
To bring you experience
Human love is damn serious

Spread your love, let's spread our love together
Spread your love, I can feel it getting better
Spread your love, let's bring our hearts
together
Spread your love, spread your love around

Someday the world will smile again
Someday all brothers will be friends
We will then truly understand
Inner light and universal plan
Until that time comes around
I'll be your friend through ups and downs

Spread your love around
Spread your love around
Spread your love around
Spread your love around
