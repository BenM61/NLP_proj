Somewhere deep in the night
There's a child on his own
And his pulse isn't there
And the house is aglow
With the light from outside
Well the house is aglow

There's a mattress downstairs
Full of brown peppered holes
And the hoarse hair is coarse
Not as coarse and as rough
As the rash thoughts that never heal sores

Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild

Dogs in the wild in the wild
Dogs in the wild in the wild
Dogs in the wild

Even dogs in the wild
Could do better than this
Even dogs in the wild
Will protect and care for
Whatever means most to them

Even dogs in the wild
Could do better than this
Even dogs in the wild
Will care for
Whatever means most to them

Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild

Dogs in the wild, in the wild
Dogs in the wild, in the wild
Dogs in the, the wild

Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
Even dogs in the wild
