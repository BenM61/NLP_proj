Sometimes I look at my own face
And I don't know who I am
I see a piece of everyone I know
Buried underneath my skin

I don't want to be like them
I want to crawl back in

Its hard to think of anything that I haven't heard before
I hear these voices in my head
They could be mine but I'm not sure
I hear them telling me who they think I should be
Why won't they leave me alone
I can't deny it I try to fight it
But I'm losing control

I don't want to be like them
I want to crawl back in

Don't want to lose my innocence
Don't want the world second guessing my heart
Won't let your lies take a piece of my soul
Don't want to take your medicine
I want to crawl back in

Sometimes I lie
Sometimes I crawl
Sometimes I feel like I want to die

I don't want to be like them
I want to crawl back in

Don't want to lose my innocence
Don't want the world second guessing my heart
Won't let your lies take a piece of my soul
Don't want to take your medicine
I want to crawl back in

I want to crawl back in
I want to crawl back in
