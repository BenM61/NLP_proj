I like noise, that's why I'm livin' where I am.
I like the noise and confusion of a traffic jam.
I like the sound of a jet as it's shakin' my dwellin'
I like ragin', rampagin' and screamin' and yellin'

Sound of a fire engine headed for a fire.
Emotions so high they can't get any higher
Goin' out of control in an outta hand crowd
I like noise and it's gotta be loud.

Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet
It was awfully quiet on the streets yesterday
People on the streets had little to say
Well I walked the streets and barely heard a sound

It was awfully quiet on the streets downtown.
Sometimes quiet's okay, sometimes quiet's alright.
Given the choice, I like noise, morning, noon, and night.
It was awfully quiet and on the trains last night.

People on the trains kept the conversation light.
I rode the trains and barely heard a word
Quietest train I ever heard.
Sometimes quiet's okay, sometimes quiet's alright.

Given the choice, I like noise, morning, noon, and night.
Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet, Awfully quiet
It was awfully quiet and I needed some noise
I got on the blower called up the boys

I was doing so bad I could barely hack it
They came to my house and they kicked up a racket
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah

They turned my place on its ear ooh
The boy's began to riot ah
It felt so good to hear ooh
On a day that was so quiet ah

I screamed and cheered them on ooh
And I helped out where I could ah
And when they all were gone ooh
I was feeling good!

I like noise that's why I'm livin' where I am.
I like the noise and confusion of a traffic jam.
I like the sound of a jet as it's shakin' my dwellin'
I like ragin' rampagin' and screamin' and yellin'

Sound of a fire engine headed for a fire.
Emotions so high they can't get any higher
Goin' out of control in an outta hand crowd
I like noise and it's gotta be loud.

Yeah it's gotta be loud
Oh yeah its gotta be loud
Come on its gotta be loud
From now on its gonna be loud oh yeah
