Feel the vibration 
(Woh ho woah ho woah ho woah oh) 
Underneath your feet 
A non ground flight 
(Woh ho woah ho woah ho woah oh) 
Begins to light 

Before you learn how to walk 
Before you learn how to rock 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 

Your forward momentum slows 
(Woh ho woah ho woah ho woah oh) 
And your travel straight line 
You gotta know how to stop 
(Woh ho woah ho woah ho woah oh) 
When you do the bunny hop 

Before you learn how to walk 
Before you learn how to rock 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 

Loop the loop 
Around the rink let's go, I go 
Loop the loop 
Around the rink let's go, I go 
Loop the loop 
Around the rink let's go, I go 
Loop the loop 
Around the rink let's go, I go 
I go I go I go I go 

Before you learn how to walk 
Before you learn how to rock 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 
You learn to rollerskate 

Ooooooooooooooooooooo
