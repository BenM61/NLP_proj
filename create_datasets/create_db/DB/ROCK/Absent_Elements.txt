Everyone plays along
Get them giving or steal the life they're breathing
They'll grow sickened
Take their secret codes and signals
Discover all they know
Keep up the pace now until it all dries up

You'll never find out now
That all these absent elements
Build your comfortable defense stronger still
Like an emptiness

Way too early to consider losing
Vacant staring may discover some reflection
Or may discover none
Just think what you've done
And watch it all add up

Like an emptiness you'll never fill
