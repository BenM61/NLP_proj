You're lookin' fine, it's been a long time
I still remember everything that used to be
Like the love, it's always so easy loving you for me

It's been a while, though time has got a smile
I see it now, love feels new to me

Tell me have you still got a place in your heart
Is there a chance you'll be showing me

One time for old times, (darlin') one kiss for the love we missed
One time for old times, and for all the love that we've lost along the way

You're still the same, nothing's really changed
Still got the look that always got through to me
I see you now, love feels new to me again, once again

Tell me now, has anyone taken my place
Is there any chance you'll come back to me

One time for old times, honey, one kiss for the love we missed
One time for old times, and for all the love that we've lost along the way

One time for old times, darlin', one kiss for the love we missed
One time for old times, and for all the love that we've lost along the way

You're lookin' fine, it's been a long time
I still remember everything that used to be

Tell me have you still got a place in your heart
Is there any chance you'll be showin' me

One time for old times, darlin', one kiss for the love we missed
One time for old times, and for all the love that we've lost along the way

One time for old times, honey, one kiss for the love we missed
One time for old times, and for all the love that we've lost along the way

One for old times
