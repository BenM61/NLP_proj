Sometimes I feel like I've been living much too long
And I've wasted too much time
I think I've lost the inner harmony that flows through me
And my body and mind

Like the shoreline that divides the sea and sand
I'm a surface ever changing
I get burdened by the things I just don't understand
And all the mountains left to climb

But then the morning sun comes shining through my window
And it's good to be alive
It's gonna be a golden day
Wings unfoldin' day
Green trees, blue sky

If I can only learn the lesson of the seasons
Of a balance re-arranging
Though they may not always come just when I want them to
Still they come and keep me high

And the morning sun comes shining through my window
And it's good to be alive
It's gonna be a golden day
Wings unfoldin' day
Green trees, blue sky
