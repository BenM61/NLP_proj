There was a girl who used to live
At the grey house by the bridge
At the edge of the empty world

Carmen's the name
That evokes the fear and shame
From the people that she left behind

She had the spirit
To live her life so free
Although many people wanted to clip her wings

She ran away
She broke away the chains
That they wrapped around her heart

The people said, out of all the things she's done
The worst one was just leaving without saying goodbye

The people said, out of all the things she's done
The worst one was just leaving without saying goodbye
Goodbye (say goodbye)
Goodbye (say goodbye)

Carmen
The voices cry out
Carmen
The voices die out
Carmen
The voices cry out
Carmen
The voices die out

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh)

Carmen
The voices cried out
Carmen
The voices died out
