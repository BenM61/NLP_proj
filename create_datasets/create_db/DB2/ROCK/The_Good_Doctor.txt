Calling Dr. Rex to Cell block two
The nurses cry
Twenty inmates scream in their beds, but one
One is silent
An unusual case this one deluded
Psychotic then catatonic
The good doctor looks him up and down and smiles
It's time for a game

Electricity is the prescription he needs
Bring him back to society
Electricity the cure that he really needs
Bring an empire to its knees

Inside his mind, sparks fly
Vague memories of a caved in broken life
Inside his mind, sparks fly
Vague memories of a caved in broken life

Electricity is the prescription he needs
Bring him back to society
Electricity is the cure that he really needs
Bring an empire to it's knees

Make sure his arms are bound
And all his pills go down
Make all his secrets drown
Render his mind unsound

Inside his mind, sparks fly
Vague memories of a caved in broken life
Inside his mind (inside his mind), sparks fly (sparks fly)
Vague memories of a caved in broken life

Electricity is the prescription he needs
Bring him back to society
Electricity is the cure that he really needs
Brings an empire to its knees
