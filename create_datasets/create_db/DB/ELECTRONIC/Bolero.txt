Let's not be the ones outside 
Looking at the world go by saw you standing all alone 
Wasted time has gone for good 
Play no more, its understood 
Come to the twilight zone, let me feel your secret hand 
Like a feather on the sand. Only made of gold 
You can make me feel a king 
And surrender everything. A fire can't control 

Hold me in your arms again 
Strangers down a lonely lane 
We can still survive, driftwood on the stream of life 
Hold me in your arms again 
Let me touch your velvet skin 
No more lonely nights on the way of no return 
Play me the bolero 

See your mystery in your eyes 
And the emotion in your lies 
I feel the magic in your touch 
Cause the voiting is too much
