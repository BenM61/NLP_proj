Who's that in the big Japanese car?
Dealing sushi from a German bar
Well no one knows but he won't get far

I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk
I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk

Who put the fishes in the deep blue sea?
Who put the monkeys back in the tree?
Well it wasn't you and it wasn't me

I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk
I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk

Who's been sleeping in my VCR?
Who's been chewing on my PDR?
I must complain to the manager

I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk
I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk

Who's that sailing in the black lagoon?
Who's erasing the face of the man in the moon?
Well I hope he don't come around here too soon

I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk
I took my tomahawk for a satellite walk

Wake up, wake up
Get up, get up
Let's dance
