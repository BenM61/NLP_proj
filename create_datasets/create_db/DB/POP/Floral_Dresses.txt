I grew up in one hell of a family
You'd envy us alright
All three girls are looking for trouble 
But we came home every night

I don't wanna wear your floral dresses 
And my lips won't be colored
I don't want your diamond necklace
Your disapproval cuts through 

I see the way you look at me
You don't have to tell me

I'm growing older each passing day
But my heart still remains
I bet you thought I'd grow out of these habits
Forgive me for missing

I don't wanna wear your floral dresses 
And my lips won't be colored
I don't want your diamond necklace
Your disapproval cuts through 

'Cause I see the way you look at me 
I see the way you look at me 
You don't have to tell me
