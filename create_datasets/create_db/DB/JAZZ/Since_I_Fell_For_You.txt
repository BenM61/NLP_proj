When you give love and never get love,
You'd better let love depart,
I know it's so and still I know,
I can't get you outta my heart.

You made me leave my happy home,
You took my love and now you're gone,
Since I fell for you.

My life has been such misery and pain,
I guess I'll never be the same,
Since I fell for you.


Well, it's too bad and it's too sad,
That I'm in love with you.
Well, you love me and then you snub me,
But what can I do... I'm still in love with you.

I guess I'll never see the light,
I get these blues most every night,
Since I fell for you.


Well, it's too bad and it's too sad,
That I'm in love with you.
Well, you love me and then you snub me,
But what can I do... I'm still in love with you.

I guess I'll never see the light,
I get these blues most every night,
Since I fell for you.

Since you love me... then you snub me,
I prayed you'd put the world above me,
And now I ... black and blue... scoo, doo, doo, doo...
Since I fell for you
