You made your mind up
To make my heart stop,
I think you've done this before.

It's always kind of
It's always almost
You always look to the door.

I,
I
Cut my hair, cut my hair,
Wanna see if I care,
When it falls to the floor,
Will you love me more?

Cut my hair, cut my hair,
Baby ball, won't you dare,
If you just, got your way,
Will that make you stay?

Cut my hair,
Cut off my hair
I cut my hair,
Cut off my hair

You wanna change me,
I wanna please you,
Wanna get to the core.

I always feel stuck,
Caught in a deadlock,
Still I'm hopin' for more.

I
I
Cut my hair, cut my hair,
Wanna see if I care,
When it falls to the floor,
Will you love me more?

Cut my hair, cut my hair,
Baby ball, won't you dare,
If you just got your way,
Will that make you stay?

Cut my hair,
Cut off my hair
I cut my hair,
Cut off my hair

I'm not like anybody,
I said,
I'm not like anybody else
I said,
I'm not like anybody
I said,
I'm not like anybody, else.

Cut my hair, cut my hair,
Wanna see if I care,
When it falls to the floor,
Will you love me more?

Cut my hair, cut my hair,
Baby ball won't you dare,
If you just got your way,
Will that make you stay?

Cut my hair,
Cut off my hair
I cut my hair,
Cut off my hair
