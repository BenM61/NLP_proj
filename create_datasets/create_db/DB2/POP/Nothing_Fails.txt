I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me

It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

I'm not religious

But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray
Pray you'll always be here

I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me want to pray

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause you're the one

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel so moved (But I feel so moved)
Makes me wanna pray (But I feel so moved)
Pray you'll always be here

I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray

I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna play)
But I feel so moved
I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna play)
Makes me wanna pray (Makes wanna play)

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved (Makes me wanna)
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray (Makes me wanna)

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
