I been tusslin' in my bed, 
Not with her, but the pillow instead. 
Do I got to beg and plead 
For no woman to make love to me. 
Just a wee bit of her time 
Said, I need somebody 
I can call all mine. 
We ain't got to push a shove 
Give me just a tee nine chee bit of your love. 



She got me walkin, in my stocking feet
To watch her dress up, is my only treat 
Spend all my money, and it goes to her 
What more woman, you're gonna get me rough. 
My head is itchin', needs a rub 
Even scratched my back on the side of the tub
Give me just a tee nine chee bit of your love.
