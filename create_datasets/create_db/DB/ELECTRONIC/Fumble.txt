Found a flaw in the ending of a book that I've read twice. 
I set her straight it's not based on your life. 
There's tension in this room we'll have butterflies soon, 
Fumbling round in the dark with a flashlight. 

No need to be uncalm we'll, leave it by the phone. 
A message you can swallow, a letter to sign. 
No need to be alarmed we'll leave this all alone And all the guilt will follow You in a line... There's tension in this room We'll have butterflies soon fumbling round in the dark with a flashlight.
