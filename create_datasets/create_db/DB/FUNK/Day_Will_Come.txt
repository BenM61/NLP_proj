The day will come when out of empty space
A flash of fire will light the children's face
Hopelessly, their last tears they will cry
Be too late to ask our leaders why
The day will come, a day of sorrow
A day we'll see them strollin' out to tomorrow.
The song of life that once we knew so well
Will not be heard as we're led into hell
Death is close, yes I can see the sign
And down your street the blood will flow like wine
The day will come, a day of sorrow
A day we'll see them strollin' out tomorrow
The day will come and swallow up the sun
We can't escape, we've got nowhere to run
The generals must be found some work to do
The medals must be bought by me and you, yeah
The day will come of pain and sorrow
And we'll see them strollin' out tomorrow
The day will come
The day will come
The day will come
