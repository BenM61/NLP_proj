Wouldn't that be fair
Wouldn't that be fair
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, okay

Baby, baby, I've got this feeling in my soul
If you don't love me would it be fair
Use my love and give yours to another
Wouldn't that be fair

I can hide all of the misery and pain
I am sure I will never love this way again
Wouldn't that be fair
Do you think she would care

Wouldn't that be fair
Wouldn't that be fair

Like the sun when it hits the urban sky at day
Lights and music takes me higher
I would love to dance my life away
Now wouldn't that be fair

Baby, baby, baby
I want, I want to, want to, want to be fair
Oh, fairplay
Oh, fairplay

Soul II Soul is the place where you should be
On Sunday night we'll expect you and Jazzie be
'Cause it's all about expression
'Cause it's all about expression

Funky people, express yourself tonight
But thinking 'loud but that's the same thing alive
'Cause it's all about expression
'Cause it's all about expression

Baby, I think you should come down
And try to express yourself, yourself
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I want you, want you, want you to be fair, baby

Oh, fairplay
Oh, fairplay

'Cause, baby, baby, I've got this feeling in my soul
If you don't love me would it be fair
Use my love and give yours to another
Wouldn't that, wouldn't that, wouldn't that be fair

Oh fairplay, oh fairplay
Oh fairplay, oh fairplay
