Smile a while,
Laugh in such a happy style
That the world will stop and smile with you.
Why not grin
Even when the others win?
Smile and take it on the chin when blue.

Don't mind the raindrops.
Wait till the rain stops.
Say, you'll find the sun
Laughing at life.
No road is lonely 
If you will only
Smile through the tears
Laughing at life.

Live for tomorrow
Be happy today.
Laugh all your sorrows away!

Start now and cheer up.
The skies will clear up.
You'll lose all your blues 
Laughing at life.

Don't mind the raindrops.
Wait till the rain stops.
Say, you'll find the sun 
Laughing at life.
No road is lonely 
If you will only
Smile, smile through your tears
Laughing at life.

I just live, live for tomorrow.
Be happy today.
Laugh, laugh all your sorrows away!
Cheer up, cheer up, cheer up,
The skies will clear up, clear up, clear up.
Say you'll lose all your blues 
Laughing at life.
