You caught me in the middle dazed on the carpet
I was following the lines,
That move like more snakes thinking

Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side,
Standing to your right come on

You caught me in the middle dazed and confused
I was following the good steps,
Fancy free and footloose.

And something ain't quite right
But if you get them on your side,
Then we'll have a good time,
Come on now come on!

I get along, I get along, I get along, I get along
Get along

It's coming out my ears,
So baby here's what we'll do
There's four for you and nine for him,
And six for them and let me see

Now something ain't quite right
You can get them on your side,
Then we'll have a good time, come on!

I get along, I get along, I get along, I get along
Get along

I get along singing my song,
People tell me I'm wrong
F*ck 'em!

It's coming out my ears,
So baby here's what we'll do
There's four for you and nine for him,
And nine for them.

Now something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side,
Standing to your right, come on!

I get along, I get along, I get along, I get along
And when I do, I'm singing, get along!
