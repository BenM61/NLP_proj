Turn the fuckin beat on!
Ha!! Yeah, we back! ?
I had to switch back to Dom Perignon in rap baby!
Cock-and-run to stay in the business
Son of a bitch! Double R, look at me now motherf
Two-thousand-and-one, "Kiss the Game Goodbye" let's get it on!

[Jadakiss]
It's the J-A-D-A I got beef with the feds and the D-A
I got footage in the game press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me ma take it e-asy
And y'all scared I can tell
and I'ma get Buckss like Milwaukee cause like Sam I Can-sell
I'm that nigga y'all know that
Bang you in the yard then slide off on the early go back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes so say cheese
Already told you I'm looking for enemies
Double R so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank membership Visa sweaters
And we ride or d-i-e together

[Chorus]
Uh uh come on put ya hands up
Nah, f*ck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah, f*ck that put ya hands down

[Jadakiss]
Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
Y'all wanna know who the best is aks ya hoe
The honies don't lie they love it
And they cop for real trust me dogg the thugs will dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody never gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through off the books
So when you mention my name shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know I'm there the hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club ice over the thermal waitin for you to try me
When the lights get low I'ma burn you
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Gotta slay two or more, ma that's our motto
And y'all might get down with the team if y'all swallow

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king and scoop the queen
and take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy pants sagging I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash
Never did a day and got the jails on smash, K-I double
I move the perico quick, and just let manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start working
Now put ya hands up 'til ya arms start hurting
Don't put 'em down 'til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed then find out what the shells do
Now you can put 'em down if you want 
But soon as the hook come back put 'em up

[Chorus]
