get up 
get out of your lazy bed. 
Before I count to three - step to it 
baby. 
She goes out every night 'till the morning light 

And she sleeps aU. day. So 
come on and get up 

I won't say it again - I'll drag you out! 
Get up 
get up 
get out of your lazy bed. . . . 
I don't care anymore. 
You can sleep on the floor 
'cause I'm knocking you out. 
So 
come on and get up 

I won't say it again - I'll drag you out! 
Get up 
get up 
get out of your lazy bed. 
Get up 
get up 
get out of your lazy bed. 
Get up 
get up 
get out of your lazy bed. . . .
