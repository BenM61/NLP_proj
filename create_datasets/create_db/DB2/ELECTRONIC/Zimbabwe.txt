What you gonna do Zimbabwe
What you gonna do Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe is a man who tried
To teach his children what was right
But then there came a time when war
Split the family from inside
He said no fighting no more

What you gonna do Zimbabwe
What you gonna do Zimbabwe

The old man sits and shakes his head
While the multitudes insist
Where is the cause of unity
With just one thought there could be peace
Men gathered in silence the same

Can there be some peace on earth
Can there be a love
Greater than the world we see
Greater than us all
It's the last station home
It's the last station home

You ran your heart in those days
When no-one could see days
You want to run in the wind
You want to go back inside
See no more crime in your lifetime
Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe
No more crime in your lifetime
Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe
