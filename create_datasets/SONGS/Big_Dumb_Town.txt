Now, when the city was in flame, you were on the phone
Sellin' fire hoses at a premium loan
Yeah, the bankers all smile; but when you pass, they frown
You're just a little too smart for a big dumb town

Now, we seen you drivin' down the boulevard
You throw that trash, but not in your backyard
But like Newton and the apple, what goes up comes down
You're still a little too smart for a big dumb town

We'll all applaud when you break on through
"He's a genius, boys, but then we always knew..."

Yeah, lofty possibilities, you never had a doubt
We'd all scream from the bleachers when you'd always strike out
But now you're way out in front and you look glory bound
You're just a little too smart for a big dumb town

Now, when the world is over, clocks run outta wind
Somebody will scrape through the ruins and find
A little picture of you and in a file they found
Sayin' just a little too smart for a big dumb town

Now, you speak so soft but in your heart you're cold
In a tower of glass you've got a mountain of gold
Yeah, you talk real sharp, but we'll soon cut you down
You're still a little too smart for a big dumb town
