Stop it, stop it girl
Stop it, stop it girl

I said stop it girl
Look what you're doin' to me
I said it's just not right now can't you see
This ain't the way it's supposed to be 
I should be loving you and you loving me

Stop girl before he breaks your heart
Stop girl before he breaks your heart
I'm the one that loved you right from the start
Stop girl don't let him bring you down
I'm the one that needs you
And I'll be around

He could never love you like I love you girl
He could never say the things like
I need you in my world
Girl I really love you
But you won't give me your time
You tell me that he loves you so 
And you can't make up your mind

Girl he's not true
None of his love is for you
It's all not true
It's not true baby

Stop girl before he breaks your heart
I'm the one that loved you right from the start
Stop girl don't let him bring you down
I'm the one that needs you
And I'll be around

I guess I'm gonna love you for my whole life long
Girl he's not the one for you
I couldn't tell ya nothing wrong
Just tell me that you love me
Let me take you by the hand
Girl my love is oh so true
Try and understand

Girl it's so true
All of my love is for you
It's all so true
It's true baby

Stop girl before he breaks your heart
I'm the one that loved you right from the start
Stop girl don't let him bring you down
I'm the one that needs you
And I'll be around

Stop it girl
Stop it girl

Stop girl before he breaks your heart
Don't let him break your heart
I'm the one that loved you right from the start
Right from the start
Stop girl don't let him bring you down
Don't let him bring ya down
I'm the one that needs you
And I'll be around
I'll be around

Stop girl before he breaks your heart
Oh baby
I'm the one that loved you right from the start
Stop girl don't let him bring you down
Don't let him bring ya down
Don't let him don't let him
Bring you down
