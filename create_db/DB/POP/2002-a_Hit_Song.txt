We’re goin’ to sing a whopper
and you’re goin to make it pay for us

No weakness to hinder the fun
Now sing it with reckless abandon
and go to the bank with your mon, mon, money

Gonna make a hit

You take a little drums
Add a little bass
And let the guitar play
at a teenie bopper’s pace
It’s gotta be a hit
