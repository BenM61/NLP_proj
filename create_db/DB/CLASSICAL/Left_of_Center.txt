Are we a fantasy?
Swimming in theocracy
We are far from holy
The wholeness of one
Repeat after me

We lost the key of sight
Now blind we fear in flight
We are far from love
But silence is golden
Please observe

Fighting your empire
Defending your vampires
Far away, 
We're going too far

Bombing your ignorance
We're feeding your insolence
Far away, we're going too far
We're going too far

If today I die
I cannot deny
The life that I live
For what I say not
Befit myself in time

No time to die or dare
No structures of a pyramid
No train, horses to rise
Surmise my position
My words define

Fighting your empire
Defending your vampires
Far away, 
We're going too far

Bombing your ignorance
We're feeding your insolence
Far away, we're going too far
We're going too far

We go forward
We go backward
Living
Dying
We're dying
We're living
We're living
We're dying
We're crying
We're seeing
We're living
We're breathing
Dying
Seeing

Fighting your empire
Defending your vampires
Far away, 
We're going too far

Bombing your ignorance
We're feeding your insolence
Far away, we're going too far

We're going too far
