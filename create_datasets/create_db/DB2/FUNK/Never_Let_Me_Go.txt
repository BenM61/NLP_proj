Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch

What would I be without you?
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start, all my bridges burned
By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Never let me go
Never let me go

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start all my bridges burned
By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Never let me go
Never let me go
