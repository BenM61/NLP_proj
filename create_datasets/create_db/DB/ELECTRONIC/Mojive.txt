This is the house of MoJive
You take the R&B from the rhythm and blues
The 50's style
And the dancing shoes
A little bit of soul
A little bit of roll
Four on the floor and we're ready to go

We call it MoJive
MoJive, MoJive
MoJive, MoJive

Hey, Hey, Hey
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme MoJive

Hey, Hey, Hey
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme MoJive
Hey, Hey, Hey

Gimme the, Gimme the, Gimme the MoJive
Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, MoJive

You take the hip hop sound and you shuffle it around
A techno beat
But you make it sound sweet
A little bit of house
A little bit of swing
Four on the floor and you're doing your thing

We call it MoJive
MoJive, MoJive
MoJive, MoJive

Hey, Hey, Hey
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme MoJive
