Change my life
Everyone is telling me
To change my life, oh
Maybe I’m depressed
Or maybe I know too much
About the world
About myself

I know some good luck
And a good f*ck
A nice glass of wine
And some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(But it’s not what I’m trying to find)

I know some good luck
And a good f*ck
A nice glass of wine
And some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(And it’s fine, and it’s fine, and it’s fine)

Is my chemistry
Not forgiving me
Body chemistry
Unrelenting
Unforgiving
Unforgiving

Oh, everyone is in one room
And I’m in the next room
I lean into the corner
I smell the wall, I exhale, I smell it again

I know some good luck
And a good f*ck
A nice glass of wine
And some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(But it’s not what I’m trying to find)

I know some good luck
And a good f*ck
A nice glass of wine
And some quality time
Is gonna make you mine
(And it’s fine, and it’s fine, and it’s fine)

Is my chemistry
Not forgiving me
Body chemistry
Unrelenting
Unforgiving
