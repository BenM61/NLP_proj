All ancient towers will one day crumble to the sea
When faced by armies
Intent on rendering obsolete

Just war, just war
You said it wouldn't hurt
Just war, just war

Is this just war?
Is this just war?
The last survivor crawling through the dust
And furthermore
Will evolution diminish right in front of us

Late September
I heard the siren call a truce
But by December
My head returned into the noose.

Just war, just war
You said it wouldn't hurt
Goodbye, sleep tight
Cause surely, it ain't just war

The last survivor crawling through the dust
And furthermore
Will evolution diminish right in front of us
There is just war

The last survivor crawling through the dust
There is just war
A contribution till humankind
Turns to rust
