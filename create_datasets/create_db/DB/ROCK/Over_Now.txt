You said you'd give me love,
Instead you caused me pain.
You made me curse an' slam the door,
An' hang my head in shame
But, it's over now, it's over now.

You talked to me of virtue,
An' sang a song so sweet
But, all I know is I could smell the perfume of deceit.
An' it's over now, it's over now.

You told me of your innocence,
An' I believed it all
But, your best friend is your vanity,
An' the mirror on the wall.
It's over now.

I turned away from what I heard,
An' everything I saw
But, now I see the light of day,
I release the dog of war.

So what ya gonna do when the truth pays you a call,
How you gonna feel, when you finally lose it all,
How you gonna look, standing up against the wall,
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna say, when you feel the hammer fall,
I'm gonna see you crawl.

You took your pills an' washed them down,
An' then you talked for hours.
I tried to build a garden,
But, you trampled all the flowers.
An' it's over now.

Wanting this, needing that,
Always after more.
Now that it's all over,
I release the dog of war,
I release the dog of war.

So what ya gonna do when the truth pays you a call,
How you gonna look, standing up against the wall,
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna say,
When you feel the hammer fall.

What ya gonna do, what ya gonna say, standing up against the wall,
So what ya gonna do, what ya gonna say, mamma, when you feel the hammer fall,
So what ya gonna do?
