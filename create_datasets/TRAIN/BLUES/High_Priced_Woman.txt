Goin' back home, get my old gal soon
Goin' back home, get my old gal soon
You a high-priced chick, and I got to let you go

I love you, baby, you think I good price
Yeah, baby, I got to let you go
That's why I am goin' back home, get my old gal soon

My mama told me leave that chick alone
Mama didn't know what that gal was puttin' down
I said, Mama, I just can't let her go
She's a high-priced baby, but I love her just the same
Yes, I love her

I got a map to the highway, baby
Movin' on down the line
I got a map to the highway, baby
Movin' on down the line
You such a high-priced baby, got to let you go
