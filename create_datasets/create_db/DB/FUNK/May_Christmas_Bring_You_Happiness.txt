Here may the happiness you find
Bring you love

May the happiness that you've been lookin for
Finally find its way to your front door
And may everything on this Christmas day
Alright

I've been hoping, wishing, every day this year
That when Christmas was here
It would bring us loving
Lots of holiday cheer, and it will
