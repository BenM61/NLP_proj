Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?
And swear by the stars above you?

Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?

Could I repeat that sweetest story told?
Could I repeat that sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
And swear by stars above you?
Should I confess I love you?
