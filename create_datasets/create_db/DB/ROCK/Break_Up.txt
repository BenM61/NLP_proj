Well, that little guy you been seein' him most every day
He shouldn't be allowed to come and take my baby away
Baby why don't you wake up, all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby, don't break up with me

Well, I saw you walkin' with him just the other night
I almost flipped when I saw him squeeze you tight
Baby why don't you wake up, all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby, don't break up with me

Don't you remember all the things that we used to do
Before he came along and looked at you
Don't you remember when you said you loved me so
Baby, now please don't go

And I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do
Because If you like him, and I know he likes you
Baby why don't you wake up, all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby, don't break up with me

Don't you remember all the things that we used so do
Before he came along and looked at you
Don't you remember when you said you loved me so
Baby, now please don't go

And I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do
Because if you like him, and I know he likes you
Baby why don't you wake up, all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby, don't break up with me
Come on baby, don't break up with me
Come on baby, don't break up with me
