She got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die, oh, one of these days
All the medicine I can buy, and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days

When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep
When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep
I'm gonna bury her very deep, rubies and diamonds round her feet
She got to take sick and die one of these days

I got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die, oh, one of these days
All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days

She got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die, oh, one of these days
All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days

If it was me and all the power was in my hands
If it was me and all the power was in my hands
If it was me and all the power was laying there child in my hands
She wouldn't have to go down to the promised land
