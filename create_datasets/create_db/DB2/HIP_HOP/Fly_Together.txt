So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever

I'm a boss so I need a boss chick
And we can boss up like the bosses
All about green like Paul Pierce
Mayweather look zero losses
Dime in the day, dime in the night
Five star chick 'bout that five star life
I must admit I'm a fan
Your shoe game ruthless girl god damn
Been a few years you're my number one
Blood in my veins, breath in my lungs
We the ones winning so they want toast
Love the way you're doing it, keep doing it now
Fly like a jet blue stewardess
You can fly alone but I don't advise it
I'm inviting you to fly with the pilot

So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever baby
So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever oh yeah

She wanna hit me on the
On the ipad, flying in the sky caps
Shawty got a nice job but works too hard
Put that shit now welcome to the mall
I need my women mogul
Double m g is global
I ain't rocking no polo but I'm
Her heart beating so fast 'cause I'm taking my time
Yeah I get it and lick it, I just handle my business
And my Bentley just different, I keep her by my side
My life a runway, and it's time to fly

So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever baby
So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever oh yeah
