I'm not a hero story
I'm not the (??)
I'm not everything they said
I'm not here to save you
I'm not your confessor
My sins are long to wake the dead

Now do you understand
Nothing can make it better
Nothing can make it go away
And do you understand
That we are lost to ruin
And this won't be your end of days?

And when the sun fell down
And when the moon failed to rise
And when the world came apart
Where were you?
Were you with me?

And when the light burns out
And when the fire is cold
And when my breath is the wind
Where will you be?
Dear God

I have no forgiveness
I have a heart of stone
I am a lesson for the freed
I am cold and twisted
I am a broken bone
I am what you made of me

But do you understand
That none of this will matter?
Nothing can take our pain away
And do you understand
That everything is shattered
And so the whole world is to blame?

And when the sun fell down
And when the moon failed to rise
And when the world came apart
Where were you?
Were you with me?

And when the light burns out
And when the fire is cold
And when my breath is the wind
Where will you be?
Dear God

And when the sun fell down
And when the moon failed to rise
And when the world came apart
Where were you?
Were you with me?

And when the light burns out
And when the fire is cold
And when my breath is the wind
I will find you
Dear God
