Our circus closed, and the midnight ghost,
Comin' out as light's gone down.
Old and tired clown, no one is around,
Staring at the mirror, now listen

Oh, show must go one,
Lived in the crowd, dyin' all alone

Clown in the mirror, glitter and scars.
Here's the pleasure and pain looks as one
Clown in the mirror, touchin' the stars,
Flyin' in dreams to the sun

What a mask can say?
Cry the night away!
Askin' mirror, "tell me how long?"
Wrigglin' all those years, through the laugher 'n' tears,
Don't believe in hearts of stone

Oh, show must go on,
Lived in the crowd, dyin' all alone

Clown in the mirror, glitter and scars.
Here's pleasure and pain looks as one
Clown in the mirror touchin' the stars,
Flyin' in dreams to the sun

But the sun will rise, evil took the prize,
Something will remind you
Sign of disgrace, this paint on your face
