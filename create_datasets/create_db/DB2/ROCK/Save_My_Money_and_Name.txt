Hey diddle do, the cat played the fiddle
And the cow jumped over the moon
No kid, I swear that they did
Couldn't get to you too soon 

You know, I've got to beg you
Save my money and name
Oh, never leave me 

Hot'n'dog, then you treat me like a hog
Just about to make you swoon
No kid, you know that you did
Still couldn't get to you too soon 

You know, I've got to beg you
Save my money and name
Oh, never leave me 

Ooh, rock-a-bye baby
Ooh, on the tree top
'Cause when the wind blows
The cradle will rock
The cradle will rock
Ooh, rock-a-bye baby
Ooh, don't ever stop
'Cause when your love goes
When your love goes
The cradle will drop
The cradle will drop
