Every day's a holiday in Paris
Every day's a Paris holiday
Spring has painted all the boulevards
So they'll look like pretty postal cards

Every day's a day for celebration (Every day's a day for celebration)
What's a celebration, who can say (Every day's a holiday)
And fun in Paris is the fashion, they seek it passionately
That's why every day in Paris is a holiday

Every day's a holiday in Paris

Every day's a holiday in Paris 
Every day's a Paris holiday
