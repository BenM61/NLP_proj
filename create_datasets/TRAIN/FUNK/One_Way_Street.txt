Taking my clothes, walking out the door, 
Tired of your games, tired of your show,
You want it your way, 
Always got something to say,
As much as its hurting me, 
I'm on a one way street (see me walking)

Walking on, on a one way street,
All alone on this one way street,
Nowhere to go on this one way street, 
Tired of being lonely

Who oh who, stop, don't move, 
Man let me talk to you,
There's rules to the game, ( the game ) 
What you do comes back to you,
You better better wait turn around, 
And put your bags back down,
Your love runs too deep, 
And there ain't nothin' good on a one way street

Walking on, on a one way street,
All alone on this one way street,
Nowhere to go on this one way street, 
Tired of being lonely

Bridge:
You see she hurt me
But what did you do 
I tried to be fair
But you were never there 
So I'm walking away 
Man you better stay, 
You got a good good girl don't you let her get away, no 
I tried my best to make it work, I fed her candy she 
Fed me dirt
I been down this road too many times,
If you don't want no trouble you better change your mind

Walking on, on a one way street,
All alone on this one way street,
Nowhere to go on this one way street, 
Tired of being lonely
