You're looking at a man that's almost gone 
Had a good woman and I went and did her wrong 
Honey found out I was lovin' double time 
She moved me from her heart to the back of her mind 
She made a memory out of me 
Just a vision of the past is all you see 
Like a statue of stone a part of history 
Yeah, that woman made a memory out of me 

Lord, I'm so low down for what I've done 
I don't even make a shadow when I'm walking in the sun 
I hide my face, hang my chin 
Just another sad story 'bout an old has been 

She made a memory out of me 
Just a vision of the past is all you see 
Like a statue of stone a part of history 
Yeah, that woman made a memory out of me 

Say Lord, that baby made a memory out of me 
Just a vision of the past is all you see 
Like a statue of stone a part of history 
Yeah, that woman made a memory out of me 

Lord, that baby made a memory out of me
