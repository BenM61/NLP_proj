I can't wait 'til the time is right
Like a gun waits for war
Like the sun waiting for a light
Pound away
Get it done in just half a day
'Neath the sweltering sky
Get it done, don't ask why
Don't you want to live my way?
Living day for night
Don't you want to live my way?
Why you want to keep trying?
You never get it right
When you could be
Living day for night
Live my dream
There's no dancing in between
Why not let it go?
There's no sense being so extreme
Act instead
There's no life living in your head
The director's long gone
Still the play goes on
And on and on . . . come on!

Your dreams were disappearing
So you disappeared
Into your head
There's no freshness
In your feelings
So you feel like
Going back to bed
As the mercury rises
There are still some surprises
Day for night
There's no time
There's no end in sight
Not a moment to lose
There's no voice
You can't choose

Your dreams were disappearing
So you disappeared
Into your head
There's no freshness
In your feelings
So you feel like
Going back to bed
As the mercury rises
There are still some surprises
Day for night
There's no time
There's no end in sight
Not a moment to lose
There's no voice
You can't choose
