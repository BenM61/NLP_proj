I don't mind it if you're mean to everybody, but me
In fact, I'd rather be hated together than loved apart
'Cause if they had a heart, they'd see that you're just hurt all sad and twisted inside

I don't compromise anything
Waste time on shiny things
If you know what you seek
Put your legs into it

'Cause, baby, you crawl
Then you walk, then you run the show
Build it up just to watch it fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)
Let you talk like you run the show
Build you up just to watch you fall
What you wanna feel when you hit the floor? (The floor)

'Cause if they had a heart, they'd see that you're just hurt all sad and twisted inside

Don't think about who I'm gonna be
When I hit the floor and you're left with me
Worry about what you're gonna do
When you hit the floor and you're left with you
