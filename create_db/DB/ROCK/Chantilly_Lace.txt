Chantilly lace and a pretty face and a pony tail hangin' down
A wiggle and a walk and a giggle and a talk made the world go round
Ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl to make me act so funny make me spend my money
I feel real loose like a long necked goose
Like a whoa baby, that's what I like

A wiggle and a walk and a giggle and a talk made the world go round
Ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl to make me act so funny make me spend my money
Make me fool real loose like a long necked goose
Like a whoa baby that's what I like

Chantilly lace pretty face pony tail hangin' down
A wiggle in her walk giggle in her talk it gonna make that world go around
Ain't nothing in the world like a big- eyed girl
Make me act so funny spend my doggone money
I feel real loose like a long neck goose like a whoa baby that's what I like
