Aaaa

I don't hold you responsible
On the time, i'm alone
I don't think it's unreasonable
So I won't claim all night long

Aaaa

The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up

Aaaa

Huruhuhu
Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before again
The rollin' comes again and we go and on and on...
Huruhuhu
Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before again
The rollin' comes again and we go and on and on...
Huruhuhu
Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before again
The rollin' comes again and we go and on and on...
Huruhuhu
Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before again
The rollin' comes again and we go and on and on...
