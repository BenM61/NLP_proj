Answer my fervent prayer
Please make him love me
Don't leave me in despair
Please make him want me and need me

Every night before I sleep I
Ask the Lord to bless and keep you
Bless, bless, bless you I pray

And as I in my prayer, I say
Please make him love me
Teach him to care
Please make him love me

Answer my fervent prayer
And make him love me
Don't leave me in despair
Please make him want me and need me

In the chapel of my heart
I pray that we will not be parted
Bless, bless, bless you I pray

And as I in my prayer, I say
Please make him love me
Teach him to care
Please make him love me

Answer my fervent prayer
And make him love me
Don't leave me in despair
Please make him want me and need me and love me

Please make him love me
Please, please make him love me
