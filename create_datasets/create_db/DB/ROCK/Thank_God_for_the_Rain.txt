Saw the news in the afternoon
'Nother war will be coming soon
Man ripped up like a piece of paper
With his wife looking on and no one to help her 

Hammill says we're still in the dark ages
With people's greed and hating rages
The world don't learn so the world will burn
The world will burn cause the world won't learn

Looks like I'm gonna build my shelter again
Such a messed up world we're living in today
Thank God for the rain, maybe it'll wash that scum away

Streets ain't safe in this town no more
A girl get hassled at her front door
Violence rising out of hand
Can't bring the kids up in this land

Getting mugged on your way home
By kids with masks and knives they own
How long will it be 'til they got a gun
And hoot you down just like a dog for fun

Looks like I'm gonna build my shelter again
Such a messed up world we're living in today
Thank God for the rain, maybe it'll wash that scum away

Thought my sensitivity would be smashed, by some inner city wisdom trash
Instead my own phobia eccentricity is growing out of every bit of me
I like my home I don't want to move but maybe I'll be forced soon
To lock the doors and board up the windows

Looks like I'm gonna build my shelter again
Such a messed up world we're living in today
Thank God for the rain, maybe it'll wash that scum away

People die and nature replaces
You see the lives in all the faces
Of so-called lunatics and basket cases
Who'd hang themselves with their shoe laces

They have no place in the rat race
As a society which just misplaces
Puts more importance on money not faces
And have it's sleeves filled with all the aces

Looks like I'm gonna build my shelter again
Such a messed up world we're living in today
Thank God for the rain, maybe it'll wash that scum away
