You can hold her hand
And show her how you cry
Explain to her your weakness so she understands
And then roll over and die

You can brave decisions
Before you crumble up inside
Spend your time asking everyone else's permission
Then run away and hide

You can sit on chimneys
With some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're doing or waiting for
But if ever anyone should ask

Tell them, I've been licking coconut skins,
And we've been hanging out.
Tell them, God just dropped by to forgive our sins,
And relieve us our doubt.

You can hold her eggs
But your basket has a hole
You can lie between her legs and go looking for'
Tell her you're searching for her soul

You can wait for ages
Watch your compost turn to coal
But time is contagious
And everybody's getting old

So you can sit on chimneys
With some fire up your ass
No need to know what you're doing or looking for
But if ever anyone should ask

Tell them, I've been cooking coconut skins,
And we've been hanging out.'
Tell them, 'God just dropped by to forgive our sins,
And relieve us our doubt.
