You know you've got to throw your body around
You say there ain't no way to scare you
Knock you down

High wire routine is working for you
Ain't nothing there for you to hold on to
High wire, so far to the end

So many chances to miss your step
If you stand up (all on your own)
If you fall down (always alone)

Hold onto yourself baby
Cause no one else will
People gonna watch your every move
You know there's always something there for you to prove

High wire so far to look down
No one to catch you when you hit the ground
If you stand up (all on your own)
If you fall down (always alone)
Hold onto yourself baby
Cause no one else will

If you stand up (all on your own)
If you fall down (always alone)
If you need help (nobody else)
Gotta hold on (all by yourself)

Watch your body, take 'a hold of yourself
You've gotta make it, 'cause there's no one else
Keep your balance 'til the end of the line
Gotta find a way to get it right
Hold onto yourself baby
Cause so one else will
(all on your own)
