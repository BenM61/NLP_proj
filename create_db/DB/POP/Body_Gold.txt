Before you came round my heart would never beat much faster
Before you came round I was ready to slow down
Before you came round I was heading for a small disaster
Before you came round I was ready to blow me down

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

Before I was found I felt like I could drain the ocean
Before I was found I didn’t wanna breathe out
Now my soul beats a sound loud enough to quiet the thunder
A love with no doubt and now I’m never gonna slow down
Never gonna slow down

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds

And we will walk with our feet on the ground

On the ground

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

(And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds)

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go until the morning glow

We can go higher and higher and higher
