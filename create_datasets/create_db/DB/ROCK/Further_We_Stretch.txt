Sometimes...
It feels like my time is coming
Sometimes...
It feels like my days are through
The phone it rings always
When by bath is running
Out the door with all my things
And it's all over now Baby Blue

Well you know I've got me an imaginary friend
And it's his daydreams they buy in the end
He won't let me break, he won't let me bend
He puts it all together and I just press send
And he's a shadow behind me in the light
And he takes me walking in the park at night

He makes me do something wrong,
Do something right
And disappears before the morning

The further we stretch
The higher the sky
It get's harder
The harder we try
The faster we run
The longer the road
The stronger we get
The bigger the load

When I fell in love with you
It wasn't the way I dreamt it would happen
Bells didn't ring, no violins
Or me on a horse with Nelson Eddy's hat on
You're not Jeanette McDonald
And our signs don't match
We dance with an opposite sway
You said you needed to run
And have fun, fun, fun
'Til your Daddy took the T-Bird away

The further we stretch
The higher the sky
It gets harder
The harder we try
The faster we run
The longer the road
The stronger we get
The bigger the load
