Dixie moonlight, Swanee shore,
Headed home bound just once more
To my Mississippi Delta home.

Southland has that grand garden spot,
Although, you believe it or not,
I hear those breezes a-whispering, "Come on back to me!".

Muddy water round my feet,
Muddy water in the street,
Just Gods don't shelter
Down on the Delta!

Muddy water in my shoes,
Reelin' and rockin' to them low-down blues,
They live in comfort and ease down there,
I do declare!

Been away
A year today,
to wander and roam;
I don't care
It's muddy there,
But see, it's my home!

Got my toes turned Dixie way,
Round the Delta let me lay,
My heart cries out for muddy water!
