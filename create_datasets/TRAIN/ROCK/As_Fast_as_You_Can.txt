I know a girl, got a long snake moan
A fever in her head and a restless soul
I got a feeling that the church don't know
What the church don't know, the church don't mind
We all work on borrowed time

Girl, you run as fast as you can
Don't give up, we'll always be friends
Run as fast as you, run as fast as you can

I know a girl, got a long snake moan
Got the voodoo in her hips and a god-shaped hole
I got a feeling that the kids don't know
What the kids don't know, the kids don't mind
We all work on borrowed time

Girl, you run as fast as you can
Don't give up, we'll always be friends
Run as fast as you, run as fast as you can

Every dog will have its day
Every dog will have its day

Girl, you run as fast as you can
Don't give up, we'll always be friends
Run as fast as you, run as fast as you can
