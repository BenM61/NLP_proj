All I see - is washed away
I am the voice - left from drinking
I celebrate - my love for you
Into the calm - saying I believe
That all the bitterness will last for hours

Maybe - I would blind the girl
Who is drowning - in the silence
She turns the grey - into a cold stare
Into a storm I have to be
Wake up to anger and mixed emotions

In the sun - I will come - to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos

In the sun - I will come - to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos

All I see - is washed away
Ooh, I am the voice - left from drinking
I celebrate - mmm, my love for you
Into the calm - saying I believe
That all the bitterness will last for hours

In the sun - I will come - to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos
Woh-oh, to see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos
To see Barbados
In the sun - I will come - to see Barba-a-a-dos
To see Barbados
In the sun - I will come
