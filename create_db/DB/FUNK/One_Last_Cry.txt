My shattered dreams and broken heart 
Are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone, wishing all my feeling was gone
I'd give my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind, this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to one last cry

Cry

I was here, you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you,
I need some love to rain on me
Still, I sit all alone,
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind, this time
Stop living a lie
I know I gotta be strong,
'Cause 'round me life goes on and on and on 
And on

I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I have my one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I'm gonna put you out of my mind, for the very last time
Been living a lie
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down to one last cry
