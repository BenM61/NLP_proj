Been a long time since you touched me
And made me feel that wonderful glow the way you do
Been a long time since you held me and squeezed me
So I wonder what's come over you

I don't know if I oughta bring it up
Seems like such a funny thing to talk about
Don't know if it's right to do
Nowhere to turn to, ooh, I'm up against the wall

And I wanna know

Is it still good to ya?
Does it feel alright?
Is it still good to ya?
Will you prove it tonight?

Been a long time since you asked me how was my day
And kissed me before I could say
Been a long time since you told me if things could change
You wouldn't have it no other way

And I don't know if I oughta bring it up
It seems like such a funny thing to talk about
I don't know if it's right to do
But I don't wanna bug you and ooh, I'm up against the wall

And I wanna know
(Give it to me straight now)
I wanna know
(No need to hesitate)
I wanna know, know

Is it still good to ya?
Does it feel
(Does it feel)
Alright?
(Does it feel, does it feel alright?)

Is it still good to ya
(To you)
Will you prove it tonight
(Prove it to me, yeah)

Is it still good to ya? Is it good?
Is it still good to ya? Is it good?
Is it still good to ya? Is it good?
Is it still good to ya? Is it good?
