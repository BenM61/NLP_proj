Got love, if that's what you need
I got three or four babies sittin' on my knee
I got love waitin' for you
I come sneakin' round the corner of the avenue

You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you

There's one thing that's on my mind
And that's getting hold of you before I serve my time
I'll keep on, with my heavy load
Till I see you come a strollin' down that open road

You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you

I love you Ma-Ma-Ma Belle
That's why I want to get it all well I'm sure you can tell
I got, good soul, runnin' so deep
Gonna get you in the corner so that I can keep
Can't you hear me once Ma-Ma-Ma Belle

You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I get you
