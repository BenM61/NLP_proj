Chicky chick ah, we puff the stuff daily 
Hey hooray bless the tray lord save me 
Take one for you two for me son pay me 
89 seven set and let out crazy 
Cafe open 1:30 in the am 
The street vigilante real do or die agent 
The sworn statement, Son look how we came in 
The mental patient will make you move on the pavement 
Heinous gold mic assault, ill, famous, nameless 
Remind me how Son Doobie reign it 
Hippie hold on, more funk, Swollen kick it 
Stick it til they ? party people come get with it 

In the wild witching hour when the sun sets 
I've learned to outrun ships of outlaws and cutthroats 
Some spoke of who knows where I'll turn up 
The streak from our recorded scores could torch Europe
The overhand thrust is a motion not to trust or confide in
Cause I wield the trident like Poseidon 
My last slip knot hangs for shanghai surprise 
The last of my crew is skeleton by design 
Cannon balls crush courtyards and those courted
Those falsely supported its been duly noted 
Unruly, roguish and sordid constrewn crews 
I've strewn body parts, make art in the arcs of the moon 

Iron magic Black Sabbath and Tabitha
Control freaks on power trips heathens and masochists 
Powder electrocutes executive executes 
Primal expressionist is to purify wizardry age 
Withering strength and swiftness of the beast 
Indulge triumphant feast the hunter moves in circles
Enter the spirit world sliced by samurai 
Unphotogenic schizophrenic and camera shy 
Carnivorous cretin evil cartoon character 
Triple aces faces of death breath replaces 
Empty spaces explicit embraces 
The dream chaser lifelong commitance 
Brass knuckles white fists cue ball in a sock 
Mad Child rocks mohawks and tomahawks
