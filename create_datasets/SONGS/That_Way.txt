You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say 
That I want it that way

I want it that way

Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say 
That I want it that way

And I
I want it that way

You are my fire
The one desire
You are, you are, you are, you are
Don't want to hear you say 

And I don't want to hear you say 
That I want it that way
