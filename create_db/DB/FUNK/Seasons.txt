I won't say goodbye
I don't want to use that exit line
Please don't make me lie
I have no excuse for you this time
Cause sometimes
(It's alright for a season)
But then it's time to go

The verses of my life are moving past
And so now the chorus I must hear
I've got to define my life and times
Before I can give you more than tears
Cause sometimes
(It's alright for a season)
But then it's time to go

Your heart was stretched to the point of breaking
Your tears are etched and your sorrow is waking

This complicated curse
Causes you to freeze our love in time
If I awaken that first
It's only 'cause you lost yourself in mine
Please don't let me see you cry
Cause sometimes
It's alright for a season
But then it's time to go
