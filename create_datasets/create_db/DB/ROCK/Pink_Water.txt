Sky
I'm gonna leave tonight
You know
I've got a life to live
And it's getting late
So, I'm gonna leave tonight

I can't decide if I'm the one you need
Or what you want out of life
I always thought you'd be the one to leave
The one to change your mind

I'm on a rocket to a dying star
You have to stay behind
Can't take you with me 'cause it's very far
And you don't have the time

(Get me out of this place)
(Get me out of this place)
(Get me out of this)
(Place)

Sky
I'm gonna leave tonight
You know
I've got a life to live
And it's getting late

I can't decide if I'm the one you need
Or what you want out of life
I always thought you'd be the one to leave
The one to change your mind

I'm on a rocket to a dying star
You have to stay behind
Before I met you, I was crushing cars
And I was doing fine

Get me out of this place
Get me out of this town
Before I drown in your deep pink water
I won't remember your face
I can't remember your frown
Because I'll drown in your deep pink water

(Ten, nine, eight, seven)
Sky (six)
I'm gonna leave tonight (five, four)
(Three)
You know (two)
(One)
I've got a life to live
And it's getting late

I'm on a rocket to a dying star
You have to stay behind
Can't take you with me 'cause it's very far
And you don't have the time

I'm on a rocket to a dying star
You have to stay behind
Before I met you, I was crushing cars
And I was doing fine

Get me out of this place
Get me out of this town
Before I drown in your deep pink water
I won't remember your face
I can't remember your frown
Because I'll drown in your deep pink water

Get me out of this place
Get me out of this town
Before I drown in your deep pink water
I won't remember your face
I can't remember your frown
Because I'll drown in your deep pink water
