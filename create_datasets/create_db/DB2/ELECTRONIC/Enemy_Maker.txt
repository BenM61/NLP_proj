They swear they tell the truth
Yet hide the truth, deny the truth
Kill the truth and destroy the truth
So why call on god

Guilty or not guilty
Exploiting the crime
You can be the rise
And you can be the fall
But you ain't schooling us
And you ain't got no proof

Guilty or not guilty
They're discarding the truth

This is the judgment night
And the verdicts in
Broken scales they use
So how can you win

Enemy maker
Enemy maker
Enemy maker
Enemy maker

The same old things they come
With each and every day
Dead world affairs and useless slander
Another day another dollar
Another scream another hollar
Another penny in your pocket
For the words you wrote
Noose around his throat
You said dis and he said dat
Now he's bound to choke

This is the judgment night
And the verdicts in
Broken scales they use
So how can you win

Enemy maker
Enemy maker
Enemy maker
Enemy maker

News of the earth
It's daily madness headlines going down
Could be the death of Mr Simpson or krusty the clown
They push the knife into the wounds and watch the people yell
It's black and white and blood all over
There's a stinking smell
Reports of earthquakes
Prostitute she could not take no more
It said the Arabs they're the ones who's making all the wars
It read the boxer knocked him out and now he's lost his brain
They're selling arms they're selling smack
They're even smelling fame

Enemy maker
Enemy maker
Enemy maker
Enemy maker
