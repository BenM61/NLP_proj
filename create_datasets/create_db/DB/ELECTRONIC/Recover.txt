Caught out cold, cold
Hiding from you in this skin
So, old
I'll come, clean
Everyone-everyone knows
It's, me

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any color
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance
To say we can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me

I'll give you one more chance
To say we can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me

Blow by blow
Honest in every way I know
You appear
To face a decision I know you fear

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any color
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance
To say we can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me

I'll give you one more chance
To say we can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me

And you know you don't need me

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any color
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance
To say we can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me

I'll give you one more chance
To say we can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
