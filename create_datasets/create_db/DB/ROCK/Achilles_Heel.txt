Goodbye to the sky 
You know I can't fly but I feel love 
Do you know how I feel 
You are my Achilles heel 

Hello to below 
I feel love flow like a river flow 
I'm standing still 
You are my Achilles heel 

Feeling free yeah what about me 
Well you gotta give it up 'cause I feel love 
Do you know how I feel 
You are my Achilles heel 

Goodbye to the sky 
You know I can't fly but I feel love 
Do you know how I feel 
You are my Achilles heel 

But there's a child in our eye's 
And the child never dies 
So keep the dream alive 
When the air I suck inside 
I can push with all my might 
And the statue in the sky 
With my Achilles heel 

Small cry don't know why 
I gotta get high just to love a lot of you 
I am low from my head to my toes 
I said hey la 
Will I go far, will I go far 
'Cause I feel love 
Do you know how I feel 
You are my Achilles heel 

I said oh no no 
Will I go slow now will I go slow 
Will the feeling flow 
But there's a child in our eyes 
And the child never dies 
So keep the dream alive 
When the air I suck inside 
I can push with all my might 
And the statue in the sky 
With my Achilles heel.
