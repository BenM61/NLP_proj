Yo, yo (Gravediggaz)
Gatekeep and Grim Reap'

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Check it, yo, yo
I was unearthed, the womb gave birth
Partitioned to submission, forced to dwell in hell's kitchen
I lived contaminated for months
Stalkin' fresh was a casual hunt, peep the game
Waitin' for a stray pass-byer
Grab the motherfucker burn him set him on fire
I've been insane since exchange of rings
That the docs in autopsy, tried to prevent to stop
Biologically I breathe, a rebel
Psychologically havin' fights with the devil
Wakin' up with gashes, deep river slashes
Hearin' the talkin' of the motherfucker burned to ashes
Scared to sleep, fearin' committin' a sin
Stuck my eyelid and brow with a safety pin
Feelin' myself lifted yet seein' myself, still sittin'
Evil has become my faith, I'm slippin'

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Yo, from the first day, that I burst through the skin of a virgin
I was cursed by sin
A mammal of the sea
Pops named John Samuel Berkeley, out of his nuts came me
True indeed I had soul, even as a tadpole
Grab hold of an egg, just to have a mole
Grew up surrounded by darkness and blood
Swimmin' in the cut like Noah in the flood
Eh ah ah ah ah! Drama! Devils attack me inside my momma!
This caused trauma
While I was growin' up she was throwin' up
It got worse, it's how I met the doc and the nurse
They took an X-ray, kept it to the next day
To figure out the best way to possess me
Trapped in a pool of impurity
Without security, nearly ruined me
No immunity, to the curse yet
I saw the Earth sweatin', as poppa prayed on the church step
In the place where they worship
As the nurse crept I got mad nervous

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Tossin' turnin', fightin' to awake
I woke up with a scream, strapped to the stake
Blood drippin' like rain, excruciatin' pain
Loosin' my grip, episode of "Tales From the Crypt"
Seein' faces of death had me shortness of breath
Fallin' through the rabbit hole that collapsed my chest
Blood spillin', inside survive like a villain
Killin' life, torturous as Vincent Prince
Tried to run got caught then I lost my tongue
Barrels of dead corpse beatin' my head like a drum
Summoned to scotch your head, let's figure
They guided my light, I came back a grave digga
The prophet, enhanced by these deadly concoctions
Killin' evil that lurk in the dirt, is our only option
Four hundred years in the pits we dwell
And for every drop of blood you will burn in hell, devil

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Yo, pain builds my character
Deranged cancer cell begin to damage my shell
Tissues begin to swell
A human pin-cushion needles begin pushin'
Through my, melanin color, blood begins gushin'
Hunger, pain is, fed through my veins
Tryin' to maintain body and brain under strain
Belly bein' drained from my nose through a catheter
To maintain my stamina, game is high caliber
Flashback my dossier file before the hospital
Lots'll pay a pile of cheddar to see me rock my style
Got lots of smiles from man woman and child
A grave digga here runnin' wild like the Nile
Ghetto, X-File, the horoscope bringers
City morgue singers, new rap era beginners
Four years out of seven I remember tourin'
And this year I'm measurin' my urine

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn

Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
