Every day I'm a star in the city
Walk the streets like a wanted man
All the time got my shine looking pretty
Motherfuckers all know who I am
Every day feel the heat in the city
Like the barrel of a smoking gun
Read the signs see the lights there so pretty
Your the one now turn me on

[Chorus]
(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me
(hey) give it all up for me

Every day I'm alive in the city
Shes a fire that lives by the sun
On the street looking fine looking pretty
She sucks the heat off my, gun
I will eat you alive in the city
While they pull up in fancy cars
Drinking whine wasting time you are pretty
Politiations movie stars

[Chorus]

City boy life

[Chorus]

City boy life

Every day I'm a star in the city
Walk the streets like a loaded gun
All the time got my shine looking pretty
Everybody now turn me on

[Chorus: x2]
