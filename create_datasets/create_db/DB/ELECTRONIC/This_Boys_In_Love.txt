I stole the keys to the skies
We'll leave this place for the final time
No crying words, no goodbyes
Yes tonight we're burning all the tough times

Drown all the fears that we had
These are the things that we'll never understand
This time fight fire with fire
'Cause baby tonight the world belongs to you and I

This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
(Under city, under city lights)

Don't tell the world what we've known
We've come so far but there's still a way to go
It's dark, there's no need for lights
When the fire in his eyes is so bright

This boy's in love, love
This boy's in love
(Under city, under city lights)

Tonight, turn out the lights
Don't wait, too late to die
Look out, hold on, hold tight
Tonight, all night I'm getting ready so

Love, love, love, love
This boy's in love

This town, these streets, your friends
You'll never see this place again
You'll think about it now and then
(Love)
You'll never see our face again
(This boy's in love)

Goodbye, this town, these streets, your friends
You'll never see this place again
You'll think about it now and then
(Love)
You'll never see our faces again
