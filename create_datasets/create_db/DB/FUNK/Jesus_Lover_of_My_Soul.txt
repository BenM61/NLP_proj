Jesus lover of my soul
Let me to Thy bosom fly
While the nearer waters roll
While the tempest still is high

Jesus lover of my soul
Let me to Thy bosom fly
While the nearer waters roll
While the tempest still is high

My Savior hide, Savior hide
Till the storm of life pass
Safe into the heaven's guide
And receive my soul at last
And receive my soul at last

My Savior hide, Savior hide
Till the storm of life pass
Safe into the heaven's guide
And receive my soul at last
And receive my soul at last

Plenteous grace with Thee is found
Grace to cover all my sins
Let the healing streams abound
Make and keep me pure within

Till the storm of life pass
Safe into the heaven's guide
And receive my soul at last
