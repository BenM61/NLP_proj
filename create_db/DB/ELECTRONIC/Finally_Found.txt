Ooh ooh ooh 

I can't believe you're here with me 
And now it seems my world's complete 
And I never want this moment to end 
I close my eyes and still I see 
My dreams become reality 
And now I know how it feels to be in love 
I prayed so many nights that you would come my way 
An angel from above to light my darkest day 
I think it's time for you to hear these lines 
'Cause there's something I want to say 

I finally found what I've been looking for 
And now you know I'm going to love you more 
Hold me tight 'cause it's always been you 
(It's always been you) 
To think that you were always there (always there) 
To be my friend and wipe away my tears 
Now it's clear that it's always been you 

Sometimes you don't expect that friends 
Can become lovers in the end 
Only God knows what the future will bring 
So hold me close and don't let go 
'Cause this is love boy, don't you know? 
And we're gonna be together for eternity 
I prayed so many nights that you would come my way 
An angel from above to light my darkest day 
A love so strong it can't be wrong 
It's with you that I belong 

I finally found what I've been looking for (finally found) 
And now you know I'm going to love you more 
Hold me tight 'cause it's always been you 
(It's always been you) 
To think that you were always there ( you were always there) 
To be my friend and wipe away my tears 
Now it's clear that it's always been you (you) 

(This time) this time 
I'm gonna make sure it turns out right 
I want to be your everything and by your side 
For the rest of my life 
(This love) 
This love feels the way that love should be 
Look in my eyes and realise there's no disguise 
'Cause I'm in love with you 

I finally found what I've been looking for 
And now you know I'm going to love you more 
Hold me tight 'cause it's always been you 
To think that you were always there (you were always there) 
To be my friend and wipe away my tears 
(Wipe away my tears) 
Now it's clear that it's always been you

I finally found what I've been looking for (I finally found) 
And now you know I'm going to love you more 
Hold (oh) me tight 'cause it's always been you
