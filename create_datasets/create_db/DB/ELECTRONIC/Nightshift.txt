Now who will kiss your lips darlin'
Who will call you sweetheart
Oh who will tell you they love you
Oh you once was my little sweetheart

Now who's been talkin' to you
Somebody's been tellin' you wrong
Things a-bout me that you shouldn't believe
I miss you sweetheart when you're gone

This talk that's goin' 'round town
Some of it I know is not true
'Bout the things that I've done and the places I've been
For darlin' I've always loved you
