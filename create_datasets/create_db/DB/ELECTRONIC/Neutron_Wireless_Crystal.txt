Take a chance and get together in the storm in town
Where your enemies and friends go round
A broken merry-go-round

I'm lying on the floor
To feel like I'm connected
I'm flying all around
It feels like I'm projected
I'm lying on the floor
To feel like I'm connected
I'm flying all around
It feels like I'm projected

And it's magic magic
And you feel like you'll never die
When there's time to love
And be loved

All the lights will blink and brighten up
The darkest skies
And the compass in your heart will spin
Hello to everything
I'm lying on the floor
To feel like I'm connected
I'm flying all around
It feels like I'm projected

And it's magic magic
And you feel like you'll never die
When there's time to love
And be loved
And it's magic magic
And you feel like you'll never die
When there's time to love
And be loved

Falling, falling, falling
Keep falling down
Falling, falling, falling

I'm lying on the floor
To feel like I'm connected
I'm flying all around
It feels like I'm projected
I'm lying on the floor
To feel like I'm connected
I'm flying all around
It feels like I'm projected
