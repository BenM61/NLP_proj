Oh, bop-a-lena, bop-a-lena, yeah she's my gal

Well the school bells are ringin', everybody went out
Goin' to the shag, gonna shake it all about
Bop-a-lena lookin' like a rose in the will
Man I dig that freak juvenile
When she gets a-goin' she's a real cool chick
She do the bop like a pogostick

Me and bop-a-lena gonna walk the beat
To the whole jukebox in the be-bop shag
When we get a-goin', gonna ball a jack
Bop-a-lena got two feet that talk
Look at her go on a camelwalk
