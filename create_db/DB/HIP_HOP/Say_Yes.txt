There is only one for me
You have made that possibility
We can take that step to see
If this is really gonna be

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you, baby;
Open up your mind and express
I'm about to let you know you make me
So, so, so,so,so,so,so
You make me
So, so, so,so,so,so,so, ah

Loving you has taken time, taken time
But I always knew you could be mine
I recognize the butterflies, inside me, Uh
Since it's gonna be made tonight, tonight
All you gotta do is say yes

[Chorus]

Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby;
Open up your mind and express
I'm about to let you know
You make me
So, so,so,so, so,so,so
You make me
So,so,so,so,so,so,so
You make me
So,so,so,so,so,so,so
You make me
So,so,so,so,so,so,so

 I'm about to let you know
 ( So,so,so,so)
