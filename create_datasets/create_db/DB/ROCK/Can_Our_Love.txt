Finding love
Now seems like the easy part
Just turn round the corner
You standing there

I felt the wind
Was pushing behind us there
It's taking us someplace
That, darling, we've never been

Don't you feel the wind?
It's pushing us further now
Are we just gonna let it blow?
And hold on, don't you fall
'Cause there's such a way to go
We've touched it now, don't let it go

Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?
Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?

Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?
Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?

Don't you feel the wind
It's pushing us further now
Are we just gonna let it blow?
And you stand, don't you fall
'Cause there's such a way to go
We've touched it now we've touched it, don't let it go

But you see my love
When everything's pushing now
Everything's moving now
And I don't know where to go
We've touched it now, let it show, let it show

Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?
Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?

Can our love, can our love?
I feel in my heart I can't wait any longer
Can our love, can our love
Can our love, can our love grow any further?

Sometimes we see that our love can change
And I don't know why
But it's not enough to change our hearts
