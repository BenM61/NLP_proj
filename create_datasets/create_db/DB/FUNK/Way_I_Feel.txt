So you want
To call it a day
I think your crazy
What else would I say
That's just the way that I feel
Just the way I feel

And you say
The well has run dry
There is just bitter words to me
No reason no right
That's just the way that I feel
Can't help the way that I feel

See I don't want to lose you
I just want you in my life
I don't want to argue
Over who is wrong and who is right
I don't want to lose you
I still want you in my life
So I'm trying to let you know the that I feel

Now you want
Just to throw it all away
See I never understand you
What else can I say
That's just the way I fell
This is the way I feel
Can't help the way I feel baby
This is the way I feel
