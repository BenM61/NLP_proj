Chours:
They're playing Basketball,
We love that Basketball,
They're playing Basketball,
We love that Basketball

(Now rapping Basketball, Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport,
I like the way they dribble up and down the court,
Just like I'm the King on the microphone, so is Dr. J and Moses Malone,
I like Slam-dunks, take me to the hoop,
My favorite play is the alley-oop,
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go,
Cause it's Basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow,

Chours

I used to go to dinner, and then take the girl,
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl,
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West,
To play Basketball at it's very best,
Basketball has always been my thing,
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King,
And number 33, my man Kareem,
Is the center on my starting team,

(To the hoop, ya'll, Watch out, Watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete,
Now these players, could never be beat,
Isiah, and Iceman too,
Just give 'em the ball, and then you talk up too,
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene,
And Ralph Sampson is really mean,
Bill Russell didn't take no junk,
and Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk,
Tell me, were you in the joint?,
The night Wilt scored 100 points,
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back,
And didn't give nobody, no kind of slack,
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team,
With moves that came right out of a dream,
Or when, Willis Reed stood so tall,
Playing D with desire, it's Basketball,
