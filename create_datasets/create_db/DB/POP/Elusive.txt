He's a gambler, spinning wheels
A poison victim, look of steel
The coldest heart you've ever felt
The coldest hands you've ever held
Take him down, all his way
A million miles, still no headway
Has his love truly blown?
In his mind I'm proud to roam

He's elusive and I'm awake
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me free

A reckless night, he hears me breathe
Cursing the skies of this company
You've lost the wisdom deep inside
His bitterness shows it's side
If it's true I'll doom
What more is there to hold onto?
Strength of head is all I own
If to me this sorry's whole

He's elusive and I'm awake
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me free
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(That set me free)

He's elusive and I'm awake
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me, that set me free

Ooh
Mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me
Lies in the hands that set me free
