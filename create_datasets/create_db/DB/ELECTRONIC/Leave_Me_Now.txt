I 
Still don't know you 
(night is closing in) 
Tired shoulders 
It feels over 
(it follows us again) 
One year older

Leave me now 
Never call again 
Each new ending 
So different 
So different

Show me then 
The things you do 
Be the friend 
I never knew 
Show me things 
That i cannot do 
Do without 

Or without you

Still don't know me 
(tell me what you need) 
Each roll over 
It's so over 
Can't console me

Leave me now 
Never call again 
Each new ending 
So different 
So different

Show me then 
The things you do 
Be the friend 
I never knew 
Show me things 
That i can do 
Do without 
Or without you
