Forty days now
I'm drifting away
And the planet
Gets smaller and
Smaller now
I am fading
It's cold out here
The stars are
Glowing
Brighter out here
I'm free
No sky is the
Limit
And I just keep 
Moving on
Yes we're back
We're out of
Control
Yes, it's true
We're losing it
All
Hold me down
Outer space is
Nothing I'd
Expect
There are no
Limits
No places to put
My weight
And I'm just
Flying
I just keep moving
On
Yes we're back
We're out of
Control
Yes, it's true
We're losing it
All
Hold me down
Just get me out
Of here
Out of the
Stratosphere
'Cause when I
Glance at you
I know
Yes we're back
We're out of
Control
Yes, it's true
We're losing it
All
Hold me down
