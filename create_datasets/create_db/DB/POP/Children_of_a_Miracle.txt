Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle, miracle

Sea of flames, taking hold
They're throwing oil on burning water
They raise the tides
We raise the boats
No, we won't be going under

We are the children of a miracle
Running with the wolves through the valley tonight
We are the children of a miracle, miracle
We're shadows in the moonlight
Empires will fall, will fall, will fall before midnight
We are the children of a miracle, miracle

3, 2, 1

Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle
We are the children of a miracle
Miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle

Bang the drums, I'll bring it out
And there's no one left to hear them
Take me home, yeah take me home
The only place that I believe in

We are the children of a miracle
Running with the wolves through the valley tonight
We are the children of a miracle, miracle
We're shadows in the moonlight
Empires will fall, will fall, will fall before midnight
We are the children of a miracle, miracle

And we can fly with the cannonballs
We can fly between the lines
We are the children of a miracle, miracle

3, 2, 1

Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle
We are the children of a miracle
Miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle

We are the children of a miracle
Running with the wolves through the valley tonight
We are the children of a miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle, miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle, miracle
