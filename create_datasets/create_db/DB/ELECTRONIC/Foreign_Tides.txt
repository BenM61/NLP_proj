Under mane of night
I remember
When I held you tight
We surrendered

Desire turn into my matter
Open up my heavy eyes
We're goin' to the bed, I'm ready
Fallen to the feeling

Give it up, my love
Let your world unravel
Get your heart unfurled
Let my heart un-cable

As these moments come
Part of feeling
Is my soul undone?
You're still beating

Desire turn into my matter
Open up my heavy eyes
We're goin' to the bed, I'm ready
Fallen to the feeling

Give it up, my love
Let your world unravel
Get your heart unfurled
Let my heart un-cable

(Heyo, heyo)
(Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
(Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
(Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
(Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
(Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
Under mane of night
(Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
I remember
(Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
When I held you tight
(Heyo, heyo)
We surrendered

Desire turn into my matter
Open up my heavy eyes
We're goin' to the bed, I'm ready
Fallen to the feeling

Give it up, my love
Let your world unravel
Get your heart unfurled
Let my heart un-cable
Give it up, my love (Desire turn into my matter)
Let your world unravel (Open up my heavy eyes)
Get your heart unfurled (We go into the bed, I'm ready)
Let my heart un-cable (Fallen to the feeling)

Feeling (Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
Feeling (Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
Feeling (Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
Feeling (Heyo, heyo, heyo, heyo)
