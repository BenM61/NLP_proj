I've been down so low people look at me and they know, 
They can tell something is wrong 
Like I don't belong, 
Well, staring through a window standing outside there just to happy to care 
And I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again, 
I tripped them out when God kicked outside everybody's soul. 

And I know that it's a wonderful world 
But I cant feel it right now, 
I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now, 
Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea, 
But I can only see when you're here, here with me. 

Sometimes I feel so full that it just comes spilling out, 
It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily, 
But if I had someone I would do anything and never never never never let you feel alone 
I wont, I wont leave u on your own, 
Who am I to dream, dreams are for fools, they always let you down. 

And I know that it's a wonderful world 
But I cant feel it right now, 
I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now, 
Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea, 
But I can only see when you're here, here with me. 

And I wish that I could make it better, 
I'd give anything for you to call me, 
Maybe just a little letter 
Oh it could start again. 

And I know that it's a wonderful world 
But I cant feel it right now, 
I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now, 
Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea, 
But I can only see when you're here, here with me. 

I know that its a wonderful world 
But I cant feel it right now, 
Iv got all the right clothes to wear I just wana cry now, 
I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down 2 the sea, 
But I can only see well when ur here, here with me. 

And I know that it's a wonderful world 
When your with me.
