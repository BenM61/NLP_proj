We see the soul and the pain
We tried our best to save the world
But everyday is still the same
All the violence all the blood and every tear
Fill your minds more and more with hate and fear
We fight against everything and everyone
With every war we tried to make our kingdom come
Everyday we lose ourselves more and more
But still we pray for someone to save our souls

We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide

We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide

We see the soul and the pain
We tried our best to save the world
But everyday is still the same
All the violence all the blood and every tear
Fill your minds more and more with hate and fear

We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide

We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide

We fight against everything and everyone
With every war we tried to make our kingdom come
Everyday we lose ourselves more and more
But still we pray for someone to save our souls

We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide

We know that nothing is alright
And there is nothing left inside
But keep those memories in your mind
We run away to suicide
