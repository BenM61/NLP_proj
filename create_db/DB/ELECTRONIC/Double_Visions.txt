Peculiar fucking in the player's ball
Well I've been known to fall
Well I've been down
Taste your sweat and I prepare to fly
Frpm my nine to five
Well I been down

Making babies in a parody
Of Adam's family
Well I've been down
Double visions that I can't recall
Let's kick it down the hall
Well I've been down

Lovie Dovie give me fnatasies
Have I been on my knees
Well I've been down
Higher natives we can entertain
We're necking on the plane
'Cause I've been down

Undertakers at the rendezvous
What does that mean to you?
Well I've been down
Hitch a ride up to the hit parade
We're stiffing meter maids
Well I've been down

All that you tell me
Will you follow me home?
Are you all that you tell me?
Leave the body alone
Are you all that you tell me?
Will you follow me home?
Are you all that you tell me?
Love's a mind of its own...

See ya laters from my majesties
I never wanted to be down
