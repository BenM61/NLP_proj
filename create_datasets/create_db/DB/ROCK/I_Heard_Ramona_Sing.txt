I had so many problems
And then I got me a walkman
I really liked it a lot, and
They walked right in and they solved them
They walked right in and they solved them

I heard Ramona sing
And I heard everything
The speed they're traveling
They are the only thing

Ramona
There were moments in the night
It was all right
There were moments in the night
I heard Ramona sing
And I heard everything
The speed they're traveling
They are the only thing
Ramona

I don't care if they're real or they're pseudo
I don't care if they get any higher
I hope if someone retires
They pull another Menudo
They pull another Menudo
They pull another Menudo
They pull another Menudo

There are moments in the night
It is all right
There are moments in the night
I hear Ramona sing
And I hear everything
The speed they're traveling
They are the only thing
Ramona
