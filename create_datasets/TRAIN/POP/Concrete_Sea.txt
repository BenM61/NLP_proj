I heard some music being played today
I heard a song but the words were wrong
It doesn't matter to me anyway
Some people really don't care what they say

I started looking at the sky today
'Cause it's so deep and so far away
I've got too many things inside my head
I wish that I could be up there instead

No one was meant to be
Living here in this concrete sea
Everyone including me
Wishes that we could be set free

Then I looked into the ocean blue
It's so deep and it's so quiet too
There's just too many people everywhere
I wish that I was down there

No one was meant to be
Living here in this concrete sea
Everyone including me
Wishes that we could be set free

I heard a story being told today
About a man and how he got away
You got to leave the things you grow up for
So duck your head and swim for shore

No one was meant to be
Living here in this concrete sea
Everyone including me
Wishes that we could be set free
