The galaxy, no boundaries
My tiny eyes can never see
Human paradigm, that's asinine
With a broad mind I'm sure we'll find different realities
Infinitely small, we think we can understand it
Go out and stand tall, call their bull
There's more beyond this planet Earth
Mystics knew the subtle view
And modern man, well he's got no clue
And on my back I stare through the cold night air
As the moon and stars witness our egocentricity
God and goddesses revealed
The old world knew it to be real
We've lost connection with the sky
And if they know, they conceal
Autonomy fantasy's their deal
In a generation too busy to ask why
