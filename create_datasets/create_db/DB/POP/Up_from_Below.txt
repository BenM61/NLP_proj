I was only five when my dad told me I'd die
I cried as he said son, was nothing could be done
Now all the fists I've thrown, just tryin' to prove him wrong
After all the blood I spilled, just tryin' to get killed

'Cause I've already suffered I want you to know God
I'm ridin' on hell's hot flames comin' up from below

Heroin and rain blowing out my window pane
Drugs drugs drug me down, killin' light killin' sound

But now I've already suffered I want you to know God
I'm ridin' on hell's hot flames comin' up from below
Yes I've already suffered I want you to know God
I'm riding on Heaven's flames coming up from below

Far from below, how high can we go

To all the love I lost, hey just tryin' to play boss
To all those friends I hurt, I treated 'em like dirt
And all those words I spewed, nothin' sacred nothing true!
To all these ghosts I turn, I'm ready now to burn!

'Cause I've already suffered I want you to know God
I'm ridin' on hell's hot flames coming up from below
Yes I've already suffered I want you to know God
I'm ridin' on heaven's flames coming up from below

Far
From below
How high can we go.
