Poor Shirley
She must hide her tears
For nobody wants to see them
Surely it will break her heart
Time passes as she waits for a friend

We'll take all the doubtful ones
in the fight
And make them hold off 'til
the spring
Take hold of their hallowed souls
And save them from pain
All of the pain
Save ourselves from all of the pain

Dearly held are the friends
Left in the years and lost in the war
Dearly held are the loves
Save for the ones you lose on
your own
Stars will light up the lonely nights
Harbor lights
Making us believe in the love
So struck by the hope of
the harmony
Leaving the sorrow
Gently

Poor Shirley
She must hide her tears
For nobody wants to see them
Surely she will win a heart
Time passes as she waits for
the wind
