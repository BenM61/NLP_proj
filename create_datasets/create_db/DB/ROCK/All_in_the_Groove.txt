Sometimes when you worry
The tendency to hurry
Can make your vision blurry
And blind you
You might shake and you might stammer
Or dance like MC Hammer
But could that pomp and glamour
Remind you
Of who you are and where you're going
And whose mind that you're blowing
And if your car needs towing
Don't move
Then calmly call the AAA you've got nothing to prove
As in all things, it's all in the groove

All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove

Well if it's your destiny don't fight it
War between the states unite it
It might be difficult but might it
Be worthwhile?
I ain't no Solomon from Babel
But my cards are on the table
And I swear that if I'm able
I'll run that mile
So if I'm rambling ignore me
If on the money then adore me
You know the pearls are cast before me
Oh what to do?
Wish I could put it in a picture and hang it in the Louvre
But like I said before it's all in the groove
	
You could say it isn't worth it
Or maybe you could birth it
But if there's too much girth it
Won't move

All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove

The jam it swings and sways
As the groove funkily plays
And they say crime never pays
But this ain't no crime
It's just a life blood flowing water
That any son or daughter
Would send away for order
A celebration of time
So jam on, jam out, jam it in
Till it feels like it's a sin
And that's only when you begin
To improve
Don't mind if it's the rhythm that's just only when you've
Got to let it all be all in the groove

All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove

They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway...in the groove, in the groove

"Hey, you know..."
"You can't do that!"
"I remember one time I was, ah.."
"...we was jammin' on stage"
"Yeah, I know that..."
"You know what I'm talkin' about..."
"You know the stories?"
"Aw, yeah..."
"Yeah, that's right..."
