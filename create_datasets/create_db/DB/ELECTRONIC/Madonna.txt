While the symphony played,
I was starting to fade,
'Til I woke to a cymbal crash.
I turned to my right,
You were gone, that's all right.
These platonic things are such a burn.
I walked out on the street,
While the big city lights
Tried to sell me on a way of life
I was already living.
Well, a limousine longer than
The Golden Gate Bridge
Pulled up along side me at the curb.
All the glass was blacked out,
so I knew there was somebody
Very important in there.
Then the door opened up
And a blonde in the shadows said:
"Get inside."
And of course, I got inside.

[Chorus]
Madonna, is that really you?
Madonna, what 'cha gonna do?
Feelings only you can have,
Never in the photograph.
Feelings only you can have.

Well, she took me back to her penthouse
And showed me all of her platinum records,
And of course there were a lot.
Then we sat on the sofa
And she turned on a classical station,
But the reception was poor.
And we sat there and talked,
And talked a little more,
And one thing lead to another;
As they often do in these situations.
All the stars are shining tonight for me.
All the stars are shining tonight, glory be.

[Chorus]

In the morning
She fixed me a continental breakfast,
And then she said: "Well, goodbye."
And I said: "Can I see you again?"
And she said: "No."
And I said: "Well, goodbye."
And I never told anyone about this,
'Cause after all,
It's none of their business what she or I did.

[Chorus]
