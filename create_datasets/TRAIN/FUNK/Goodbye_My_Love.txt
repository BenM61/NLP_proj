There never was a fool, like a fool in love
I oughta know
But I can tell you one thing, this fool's had enough
And it shows

When we were making love
I wonder who you were thinking of
Was it you and me, or you and he?
I gave my all to you and you walked all over me
Girl, can't you see?

I don't want to cry for love again
No more do or die for love again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love

There never was a moment I didn't need your love
I loved you so baby
Far too many lonely nights, it hurt so much
Girl just go

When we were making love
I wonder who you were thinking of
Was it you and me, or you and he?
I gave my all to you and you walked all over me
Girl, can't you see?

I don't want to cry for love again
No more do or die for love again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say that I don't want you

I don't want to cry for love again
No more 'do or die for love' again
I don't want to lie for love again
The only way to mend this broken heart
Is for me to say goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love

I'm goin' on, goin' on with my life
Wipe my tears away, I don't wanna cry
No more 'do or die', sorry, I have to say

I'm goin' on, gotta go on with my life
Wipe my tears away, I don't wanna cry
No more 'do or die', sorry, I have to say
Goodbye, my love, goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love, goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love
