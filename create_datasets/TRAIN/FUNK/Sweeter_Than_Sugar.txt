Oh J.O.E.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen (and royalty)
I got my man royal on the track
And my dog bishop young don oh well

Sweeter then sugar

Don't argue much now that I
Acquired some things of the good life
360 Medina how things have changed
A crib with a east and a west wing
I gotta thank god for my life and all
He keeps blessing with more and more

I' gonna ball to I fall now I see that I
Can reach for a dream and pull it from the sky
Sweeter then sugar is what I dream
My life would be if left up to me
And oh I like that

Sweeter then sugar

Shopping sprees trips over seas
Finest luxuries
The good life
I just say the word and it will be
The cars I want I buy the lot
The cribs I want I buy the block
I just say the word and it will be

Moderate players that's we are
About getting paper feel me god
No longer out there chasing dreams
Living the words for the song I sing
Gotta thank mynas for your support
Cause you"ll keep loving more and more

I' gonna ball to I fall now I see that I
Can reach for a dream and pull it from the sky
Sweeter then sugar is what I dream
My life would be if left-up to me
And oh I like that
Sweeter then sugar

Shopping sprees trips over seas
Finest luxuries
The good life
I just say the word and it will be
The cars I want I buy the lot
The cribs I want I buy the block
I just say the word and it will be

Cars jewels and chips (word)
Rims cribs and chicks (word)
Love for these streets (I got it)
Sweeter then sugar
