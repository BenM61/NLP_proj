Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo, spank
Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo, spank

When you're lovin' me lady, spank
That's how I want it to be baby, spank

Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo
Spank, do it, do it, do it, do it
Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo
Spank, let's get to it to it, spank

Let's make love from our hearts
When we do it's really hard to part
Combine our minds this time
Quite sure our love won't go blind

Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo
Spank, do it, do it, do it, do it
Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo
Spank, let's get to it to it, spank

Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo
Spank, do it, do it, do it, do it
Spank, woo, woo, woo, woo
Spank, let's get to it to it, spank
