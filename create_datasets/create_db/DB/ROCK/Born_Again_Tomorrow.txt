If you were born again tomorrow

You've seen it, that's not what you wanted
Ain't gonna say the sky is falling
You gotta read between the lines
Stop waiting for a sign
Who's gonna live your life?

Yeah, you don't have to look back to see where we are
The future's looking brighter than a handful of stars
You gotta hold on, hold on, be strong

If you were born again tomorrow
Would you live your life like yesterday?
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way

Don't have to end up where you started
Heaven loves the broken hearted
You learn from your mistakes
Bones grow stronger when they break
Who said the scars don't fade?

Yeah, you don't have to look back to see where we are
The future's looking brighter than a handful of stars
You gotta hold on, hold on, you gotta be strong

If you were born again tomorrow
Would you live your life like yesterday?
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way

Would you relive every moment?
Would you tear out any page?
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way
Any other way, hey, hey, hey
Any other way, hey, hey

If you were born again tomorrow
Would you live your life like yesterday?
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way

Would you relive every moment?
Would you tear out any page?
If you were born again tomorrow
I wouldn't live my life any other way

Any other way
Born again tomorrow
If you were born again tomorrow
Born again tomorrow
