It's that time again when I lose my friends
Go walkabout, I've got the bends from pressure
This is a testing time when the choice is mine
Am I a fool for love or foolish with desire
You can throw him out you can spit on him
Call what he does a sin if it makes you feel better

And I can't believe you're all I'll ever need
And I need to feel that you're not holding me
And the way I feel just makes me want to scream
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home

After thirty years I've become my fears
I've become the kind of man I always hated
I am pulled apart, and my swollen heart
Has flipped out of the pan into the fire
I am in love insane with a sense of shame
That I threw stones at the condemned and
Now I'm slated

And I don't believe you're all I'll ever need
And I need to feel that you're not holding me
And the way I feel just makes me want to scream
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
