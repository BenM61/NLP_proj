And this is nothing new,
It's just the same old blues
Like a devil on my shoulder
Nothing left to lose
You can never break my heart
Everything will fall apart
You can never save my soul
I think it's time to let me go

I keep on having this dream
Where I'm stuck in a hole and I can't get out
There's always something that's pulling me down, down, down
And this is nothing new
It's just the same old blue
And this is nothing new
It's just the same old blues

Today I lost my future to the past
I got nobody left, I'm going nowhere fast
Never getting far away enough
Like a shadow on the sidewalk
I can't shake it off
You can never change my mind
I think I'm running out of time
You can never save my soul
I think it's time to let me go

I keep on having this dream
Where I'm stuck in a hole and I can't get out
There's always something that's pulling me down, down, down
My heart is down on it's knees so I try, oh I try
But it's too late now
There's always something that's pulling me down, down, down

I keep on having this dream
Where I'm stuck in a hole and I can't get out
There's always something that's pulling me down, down, down
My heart is down on its knees
And no one is hearing me screaming
There's always something that's pulling me down, down, down

And this is nothing new
It's just the same old blues
And this is nothing new
It's just the same old blues
