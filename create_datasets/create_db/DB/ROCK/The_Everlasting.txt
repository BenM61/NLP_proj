The gap that grows between our lives 
The gap our parents never had 
Stop those thoughts control your mind 
Replace the things that you despise 
Oh you're old I hear you say 
It Doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore 
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause.

In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine 
In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine 
But now unforgiven the everlasting everlasting.

The world is full of refugees 
They're just like you and just like me 
But as people we have a choice 
To end the void with all it's force 
So don't forget or don't pretend 
It's all the same now in the end 
It was said in a different life 
Destroys my days and haunts my nights?

In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine 
In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine 
But now unforgiven the everlasting everlasting 

In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine 
In the beginning when we were wining when our smiles were genuine 
But now unforgiving the everlasting everlasting 
But now unforgiving the everlasting everlasting.
