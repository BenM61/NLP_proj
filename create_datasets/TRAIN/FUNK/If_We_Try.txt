We go through changes
Time after time
I guess that's just life
Feelings we can't express
We only hide
Deep down inside

Who needs another sad affair
Girl, if we care
We'll end it right here
We could be lovers
If we'd only share
All that we feel
But we must be sincere

I know we've been
Been here so many times before
But don't you think
Think that our love's worth fighting for

If we try
Just one time, oh baby
If we try
Then I'll know we'll get by

Our love is gentle
It's give and take
It's all about the vows we make
Whether we honor them
With love and trust
It's all up to us

Who needs another sad affair
Girl, if we care
We'll end it right here
We could be lovers
If we'd only share
All that we feel
But we must be sincere

I know we've been
Been here so many times before
But don't you think
Think that our love's worth fighting for

If we try
Just one time, oh baby
If we try
Then I'll know we'll get by
