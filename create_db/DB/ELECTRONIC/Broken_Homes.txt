Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.

Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
We lose our voice more each year
Maybe we won't bring some
Is there Cancer in the throat No Stress
Maybe its supposed to kill the success
Because success needs killing
Murder is media
Forced laugh, Forged autograph,
First my body, now my corpse
Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
Life is pain, Murder is fame,
And if you're famous you might get acquitted
There's nowhere to run away
Damn you I hope you pay
And finish the day-to-day
The games we play.
Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
I will stay at home
And talk on the telephone,
'cause nothing in this world I want from you,
Don't free yourself, run and cry
Too scared to live
Too quick to die

Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.

Don't know how to build stable homes.
Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
Those men will break your bones,
Don't know how to build stable homes.
Stable Homes
Those men will break your bones
Stable homes
Those men will break your bones
Stable homes
Those men will break your bones
