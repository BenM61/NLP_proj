You're holding him so tight that he can't move

If you never give him room
You're gonna lose.
He's feeling like he's tied up in a knot

Every time he comes home late he's on the spot.
Trust him to be the kind of man he wants to be

You aren't gonna keep him long if you give him
The third degree.

Let him go
Let him go
Do the things he's got to do

Give him the freedom that he needs even though it worries you.
Let him go
Let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true

It's the only way you can be sure he'll come back to you.

You want your life with him to work so well

You forget the love you need to give yourself.
I understand your desire to keep him near

But you poison love when you mix it up with fear.
Trust yourself to be the woman that you want to be

If you both have room to grow
Then you'll live in harmony.
Let him go
Let him go
Do the things he's got to do

Let him go
Let him go.
Let him go
Let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true

It's the only way you can be sure he'll come back to you.
Let him go
Let him go
Let him go.
