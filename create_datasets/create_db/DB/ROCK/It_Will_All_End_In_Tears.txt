Baby, I know you hate me so
I gave you everything, why do you hate me so?

I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye

Baby, you took my soul
I gave you everything, what did you give my soul?

I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye

It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears

I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye

It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
