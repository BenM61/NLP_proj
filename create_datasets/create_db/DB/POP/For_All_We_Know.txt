For all we know 
We may never meet again
Before you go 
Make this moment sweet again
We won't say Good night
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand 
And my heart will be in it

For all we know 
This may only be a dream
We come and go 
Like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come 
For all we know

So love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come 
For all we know
