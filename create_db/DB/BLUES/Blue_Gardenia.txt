Blue gardenia 
Now I'm alone with you 
And I am oh, so blue 
He has tossed us aside 
And, like you, gardenia 
Once I was near her heart 
After the teardrops start 
Where are teardrops to hide?

I lived for an hour 
What more can I tell 
Love bloomed like a flower 
Then the petals fell 
Blue gardenia 
Thrown to a passing breeze 
But pressed, yes they're pressed in my book
Of memories 

I lived for an hour 
What more can I tell?
Love bloomed like a flower 
And then the petals fell 
Blue gardenia 
Thrown to a passing breeze 
But pressed in my book
Of memories
But pressed in my book
Of memories
