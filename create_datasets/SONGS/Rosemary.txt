Do you remember when you walked with me
Down the street into the square
How the women selling rosemary
Pressed the branches to your chest
Promised luck and all the rest
Ran their fingers through your hair

I had met you just the day before
Like an accident of fate
In the window there behind your door
How I wanted to break in
To that room beneath your skin
But all that would have to wait

In the Carmen of the Martyrs
With the statues in the courtyard
Whose heads and hands were taken in the burden of the sun
I had come to meet you with a question in my footsteps
I was going up the hillside and the journey just begun

My sister says she never dreams at night 
There are days when I know why
Those possibilities within her sight
With no way of coming true
Cause some things just don't get through
Into this world although they try

In the Carmen of the Martyrs
With the statues in the courtyard
Whose heads and hands were taken in the burden of the sun
I had come to meet you with a question in my footsteps
I was coming up the hillside and the journey just begun

And all I know of you is in my memory
And all I ask is you remember me
