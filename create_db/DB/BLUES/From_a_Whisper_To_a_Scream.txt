From a whisper in the wind
To a loud scream
The message came
That I'd lost you
To the warmth of another man

I've seen more tears fall from your eyes
Than all the showers of April
I took kindness for granted
As if it came with the wallpaper

So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason, I just thought you had to be there
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love

I simply must have been crazy
Or I must have been out of my mind
For me to overlook the need in you
Tell me, how could I have been so blind

Never giving thoughts to your wants and needs
Now I'm begging you please
Oh my love
Oh my love

So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason, I just thought you had to be there
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
