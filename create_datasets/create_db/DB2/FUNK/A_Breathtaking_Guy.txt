One night you held me tight
And whispered in my ear all night
Sweet words, I never heard
And I believed every word

Next day you came my way
And not a word to say
You passed me by
You didn't bat an eye

My darlin', won't you tell me why
You're actin' strange toward me
Why have you changed toward me?

Are you just a breathtaking
First sight soul-shaking
One night love-making
Next day heartbreaking guy?

That night your love was true
The next day we were through
Your love won't come
And you were moving on

And I was left to cry alone
What have I done to you?
Was it just fun to you?

Are you just a breathtaking
First sight soul-shaking
One night love-making
Next day heartbreaking guy?

Breathtaking, soul-shaking,
Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Breathtaking, soul-shaking
