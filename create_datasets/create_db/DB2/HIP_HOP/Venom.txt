VENOM - Freestyle's first verse...
WITHIN MY INTRICATE
WEAVE OF BRAIN CELLS
I WITHHOLD THE MAIN SPELL
TO CAST UPON YOU DEMONS PLOTTIN' AND SCHEMIN', DREAMIN' ABOUT
THINGS THAT WILL NEVER OCCUR
IN THIS DIMENSION, FAR BEYOND YOUR WILDEST IMAGINATION, THE ILLUSTRATION'S SUSPENDED ANIMATION
I PUT YOU ON PAUSE 'CAUSE YOU'RE
TOO BUSY BENDIN' RULES WHILE I'M BREAKIN' LAWS OF GRAVITY
DON'T GIVE A DAMN IF YOU'RE MAD AT ME
FILLIN' JAWS WITH CAVITIES
IF YOU'RE STILL BREATHIN' YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO BE ALIVE, SOME DON'T SURVIVE OR LIVE TO SEE THE NEXT DAY
YOU CAN'T RESET AND AIN'T NO FREEBIE IN THE GAME THAT YOU PLAY
YOU SLITHER SKILLFULLY AND WILLFULLY ALL OVER MY TRUST
THEN IT'S A MUST THAT YOU BITE THE DUST, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET BUST
OR PERSECUTED, EXECUTED, LYRICALLY DEGRADED
MENTALLY DECAPITATED, MAKIN' SURE YOU NEVER MADE IT
'CAUSE I'M FED UP WITH YOU'RE MISSION, STUPID NIGGAS NEVER LISTEN, TALKIN' 'BOUT THEY'RE NEVER DISSIN', ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE THEY'RE PISSIN'
THE HISSIN'S AT A TONE
UNDETECTABLE BY EARS
THE ADVANTAGE IS HIS OWN IF YOU HAVE NEGLECTABLE FEARS
SLIDIN' THROUGH CRACKS AND CREVICES, NO MATTER HOW TIGHT
SHOW FRIGHT,
AND PREY GETS SWALLOWED UP IN ONE BITE...

VENOM - Freestyle's third and last verse of the song

WORD... ALL JOKES ASIDE
THIS MATTER CAN BE COMPLICATED
YOU COULD
FAIL IN UNVEILIN' THE ONES WHO PERPETRATE, KID
THEIR CLOAK AND DAGGER HIDES THEIR DESIRE TO USE THE NEXT KIN
IT'S HEREDITARY AND NECESSARY TO SHED SKIN
IT TENDS TO BURN WHEN YOU'RE TOUCHED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT
PRESENTED WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR IT
YOU CAN'T BE NEAR IT, YOU FEAR IT, IT ALWAYS FOILS YOUR PLANS
YOU DEAL WITH GREED AND ALWAYS FEEDIN' OF THE BLOOD OF MAN
IT'S ALL A HOAX, YOU TRY TO COAX WHEN YOU'RE UP IN MY CENTER
YOU ENTER BUT THE TEMPTOR'S NOT MY MENTOR
IT'S MY BELIEF WITHIN THE CHEMISTRY, I PREACH MY MINISTRY
GOT MY SEAL OF AUTHENTICITY, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS DISSIN' ME
INTERFERENCE WITH SIGNAL'S THE THING I ALWAYS TRY TO PREVENT
SLIPPERY SERPENTS
YOU NEED TO REPENT
AND AIN'T NO REPTILE WITH FANGS LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE MY SHIT
FROM TIME TO TIME I PRAY AND STAY AWAY FROM DEEP SNAKE PITS
