I do believe,
You were strong in forming violence!
We were strong performing silence
I do believe,
You were strong in forming violence!
We were strong performing silence

We are deceived, all the toys of our convenience,
Opening our hearts to the brilliance
We are deceived, all the toys of our convenience,
Opening our hearts to the brilliance

Love is strong, hearing as loud as gunfire away,
Never wrong, constantly dreaming of another way.

If love is wrong,
Go ahead and end the world with your charades.
Never wrong, constantly dreaming of another way.

Can I get some more piano please?

I do believe,
You were strong in forming violence!
We were strong performing silence
I do believe,
You were strong in forming violence!
We were strong performing silence

We are deceived,
All the toys of our convenience,
Opening our hearts to the brilliance
We are deceived, all the toys of our convenience,
Opening our hearts to the brilliance

Love is strong,
Hearing as loud as gunfire away,
Never wrong,
Constantly dreaming of another way

If love is wrong,
Go ahead and end the world with your charades.
Never wrong, constantly dreaming of another,
Another day day day day day day day day day!

Find me a red bag, one without a tag.
Hope that you are near,
Valiantly appear,
Find me a red bag

Na na na na na

Love is strong, hearing as loud as gunfire away,
Never wrong, constantly dreaming of another way.

If love is wrong,
Go ahead and end the world with it's charades
Never wrong, constantly dreaming of another,
Another day day day day day day day day day!

Find me a red bag, one without a tag.
Hope that you are near,
Valiantly appear,
Find me a red, bag
