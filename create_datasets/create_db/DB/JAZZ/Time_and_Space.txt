Every soul comes to the sun
Carried on angel's wings to human birth
Born of love or born of hate
Each one is heaven sent to human fate

Dream
Little girl, dream
Dream
Little boy, dream
Dream

In joy and pain each one will grow

For wisdom is so much more than what we know
And every child will find their way
Of living the whole life story day by day

Dream
Little girl, dream
Dream
Little boy, dream
