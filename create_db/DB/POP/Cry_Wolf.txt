"Night I left the city,
I dreamt of a wolf"

He came from where the winds are cold
And truth is seen through keyholes
Strange longings never sleep
Now he's come where no hearts beat
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf
Time to worry

You can start, but you cannot stop
You give in, but you can't give up
You can tell all your desperate jokes
To a world that puts
Love on hold
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf
Time to worry now

The sunken-in eyes
And the pain in his cries
A shape in the dark
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf
Time to worry now
