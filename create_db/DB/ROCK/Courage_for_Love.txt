I guess I handled wrong
Giving up so carelessly
But I ain't got courage for love
No, I ain't got courage for you
Got Gold on my hands
Your touch remains
I still think you're mine
No, I aint got got courage for love
No, I ain't got courage for you
Whoa
I know I'm selfish but I gotta keep loving you
Oh
Whoa
I know I'm selfish but I gotta keep loving you
But I ain't got courage for love
I ain't got courage for love
No, I ain't got courage for you
