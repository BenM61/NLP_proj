Slipped through the window by the back door
Caught short in transit with my love
Jumped up, fell back, cut off from romance
How could I fall without a shove?
Tiptoe like thunder on my feelings
You rock me gently with your sighs
My knees are week, my head is reeling
Consumed by fire in your eyes

(Dont'cha know why, goodness no! Why?)
Stepped in and shattered my defenses
Just playin' hookey with my heart
Slipped through the window by the back door
And took the keys to my poor heart

Yes my poor heart
Try as I might, try as I may
Well I'd try anything to make you stay
'cause I need your love, yes I need your love
Ooh I need your love, yes I need your love
I'm lookin' high, I'm lookin' low
Tryin' to find where did my baby go
Gotta find out why she ran away
I don't know where did my baby stay
Try as I might, try as I may
Well I'd try anything to make you stay

Just find that Boulevard d'amour
Shoot through a neon in the night
Hot-foot through alleys, check the doorways
Try that old parking lot on 9th
There's 3-course-kissing in the same way
Oh but that don't help me none no more
I've been away too long and dreaming
Little girl ain't I seen you before?

Oh little girl
