Little girl, little girl
Won't you please ma'm tell me your name
Little girl, little girl
Won't you please ma'm tell me your name
The reason I ask you all these questions
I just want to be your man

Little girl, little girl
Where did you get your sugar from
Little girl, little girl
Where did you get your sugar from
If you wasn't born in Texas
You was raised down on a Louisiana farm

Little girl, little girl
You're just as sweet as you can be
You know your kisses taste like
The sugar you use in tea
Well you got me tryin' to taste your sugar
And your sugar's all right with me

Little girl, little girl
Won't you take me down on your daddy's farm
Little girl, little girl
Won't you take me down on your daddy's farm
I was doing the things for you baby
So you just wont leave me alone

Little girl, little girl
You're just as sweet as you can be
Little girl, little girl
You're just as sweet as you can be
You know every time I kiss you baby
Cold chills run all over me
