There was a big cold wind
It came a rolling down this hill
It passed an old pine tree
That tree is a shivering still
Now that wind was cold as it could be
But no colder than the kisses you've been giving me
They're like a big, a big, mighty big
Like a big cold wind

Ah, since your heart has turned on me
There's nothing more to say
There's someone new that you want to see
So I'll be going on my way

I'm gonna miss your kiss
And the arms that held me tight
I'm gonna miss those nights
When things were going right
But I want to tell you just before I go
That I pray your heart will never ever know
A love that turns about can freeze you out
Like a big cold wind

Ah, since your heart has turned on me
There's nothing more to say
There's someone new that you want to see
So I'll be going on my way

I'm gonna miss your kiss
And the arms that held me tight
I'm gonna miss those nights
When things were going right
But I want to tell you just before I go
That I pray your heart will never ever know
A love that turns about can freeze you out
Like a big cold wind

A love that turns about can freeze you out
Like a big cold wind
