You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face
And you try so hard to see
The way things were when we were at your place
Everyday was just you and me
And you cry because things ain't like before
Well, don't you know it can't be that way anymore
But don't worry baby

I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
This is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone

If there was something, baby, that I could do
Something that would last, honey, I would
But you should know better than to think that you
Can return to the past
So close your eyes and I'll be there
Hold you once more,not go anywhere
I wish I could, babe

But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
This is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone

And you cry because things get so strange so fast
And you cry because nothing good ever lasts
Well, I know babe
Yes, I know, babe

But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
'Cause this is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone

This is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone
