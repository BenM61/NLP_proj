Things I said were wrong 
I've takin' much too long 
To say that I, I want you back 
Always be near, oh that's a fact 
I always keep on trying 
I never try to deny it 
That I was wrong once before 
Give me a chance 
I can't take this anymore 

I'm counting the days 
I'm counting the nights 
Till we'll be together 
I'm, I'm counting the hours 
I'm watching the clock 
It seems like forever 

Waiting for you now 
I keep on wondering how 
To win you back 
Why can't I dream 
It's not as impossible as it seems 
I always keep on trying 
I never try to deny it 
That I was wrong once before 
Give me a chance 
I can't take this anymore 

I'm counting the days 
I'm counting the nights 
Till we'll be together 
I'm, I'm counting the hours 
I'm watching the clock 
It seems like forever 

I haven't seen you for a long, long time 
But this moment is what's on my mind 
I've waited for you to say 
I want you, I need you, got to have you today 

I'm counting the days 
I'm counting the nights 
Till we'll be together 
I'm, I'm counting the hours 
I'm watching the clock 
It seems like forever 

I'm counting the days 
I'm counting the nights 
Till we'll be together 
I'm, I'm counting the hours 
I'm watching the clock 
It seems like forever
