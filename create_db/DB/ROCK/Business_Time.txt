Aww Yeah
Girl tonight we're gonna make love
You know how I know?
Because it's Wednesday
And Wednesday night is the night that we usually make love
Monday night is my night to cook
Tuesday night we go and visit your mother
But Wednesday we make sweet little love

When everything is just right
There's nothing good on t.v.
You haven't had your after work social sport team practice
So you are not too tired
Oh, boy, it's all love
You lean in and whisper something sexy like,
"I might go to bed. I've got work in the morning."
I know what you're trying to say baby.
You're trying to say "Aww, yeah. It's business time.?

[Chorus]
It's business
It's business time
I know what you're trying to say
You're trying to say it's time for business,
It's business time, oh
It's business
It's business time
Aww ohowoah yeah, yeah

Then in the bathroom brushing our teeth
That's all part of the foreplay, I love foreplay
Then you go sort out the recycling
That isn't part of the foreplay,
But it's still very important

Next thing you know we're in the bedroom
You're wearin' that baggy old ugly T-shirt you got from work several years ago
Mmmm, you know the one, baby
With the color stain

I remove my clothes
Very very clumsly
Trippin' sensually over my jeans 'cause I'm still wearing my shoes
But it's OK because I turn it all into a sexy dance.

Next thing you know I'm wearing absolutely nothing
Except for my socks
And you know when I'm down to just my socks
What time it is
It's business time

[Chorus]
It's business
It's business time
When I'm down to my socks it's time for business
That's why they're called business socks, oh
It's business
It's business time
Oh, ho ho ho oh yeah, yeah

Making love
Making love for
Makin' love for two
Making love for two minutes
When it's with me you only need two minutes,
Because I'm so intense
Two minutes in heaven is better than one minute in heaven

You turn to me and say something sexy like, "Is that it?"
I know what you?re trying to say, girl
You're trying to say, "Aww yeah, that's it"
And then you tell me you want some more
Well, uh... I'm not surprised
But I'm quite sleepy

Mmm
It's business
It's business time
Business hours are over, baby
It's business
It's business time
