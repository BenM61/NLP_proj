Have you ever felt like, you the only one in love in your relationship? 
And as hard as it was to let go, you knew it was the best thing for you 
Well that time has come for me, I gotta move on 

You say you wanna get married, but boy are you sure 
Cause there are a couple of issues I refuse to ignore 
You say one thing, and you do another 
And I'm realizing you don't want me on your shoulder 
You think material things is what I need 
But all I ever wanted was you 
Just a little kiss, just a little hug 
Now I'm realizing that that ain't your kinda love 

Sometimes we want things 
That might not be right for us 
But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
You're not changing and I know that you love me but 
This thing ain't going the way I planned 
Sometimes we want things 
That might not be right for us 
But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
As bad as I want you to stay 
We can't keep going on this way 
Going this way 

Don't think you're doing me no favors 
Feeling the need to get on one knee 
When you know you ain't right baby 
You wanna make sure I'm always around 
And with the ring on my finger 
That means I'm on right now 
I see it in your eyes you weren't 
There's a good chance you doing some dirt 
Cause I don't wanna be the one 
To make you do something you don't want to 
I'm gonna let you do you 

Sometimes we want things 
That might not be right for us 
But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
You're not changing and I know that you love me but 
This thing isn't going the way I planned 
Sometimes we want things 
That might not be right for us 
But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
As bad as I want you to stay 
We can't keep going on this way 
Going this way 

See there's a part of me 
That doesn't want you here with me 
That's a part of me 
That wants to stick right with you 
But it seems like you don't wanna put up a fight 
And why should I even try? 

Sometimes we want things 
That might not be right for us 
But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
You're not changing and I know that you love me but 
This thing isn't going the way I planned 
Sometimes we want things 
That might not be right for us 
But when you're in love 
You tend to look over the obvious 
As bad as I want you to stay 
We can't keep going on this way 
Going this way
