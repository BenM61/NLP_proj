Yeah back
When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad
When this whole world had way less worries, nobody in a hurry and back
To mama's home cookin' and dad
Was baitin' my hook and I'm sitting on a tailgate,
Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was
Back

When I think about how it used to be, Lord it was so simple then
Dirt-bike and a fishin' pole at a fishin' hole with all my friends
Nothin' better than a BB gun in my backyard just huntin' squirrels
Took a ring from my mama's drawer and gave it to this little girl
Her mama called mine and then my daddy had to have a talk
I remember like yesterday what he said when we took that walk
"Son don't you ever tell no lie, even if the truth burns"
Everyday my mind goes back to all those lessons learned
And I wanna go

Back
When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad
When this whole world had way less worries, nobody in a hurry and back
To mama's home cookin' and dad
Was baitin' my hook and I'm sitting on a tailgate,
Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was
Back

I remember that Texaco that Mr. Logan used to own
They turned it into something else and Mr. Logan's long gone
My best friend David, he grew up ridin' in that wheelchair
Thought I'd give a million bucks if that old boy was still here
Ain't it funny how time goes by and memories seem to fade away
They built a parking lot on the baseball field we used to play
That skating rink is closed down, but now I see us back again
I remember those all night skates, very first dates and my old friend

Back
When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad

Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was
Back

My dad's gettin' older now but son he's still as tough as ever
Him and my little boy are best friends now, wish it could last forever
My mama is still the one I talk to when I need advice
She never ever let me down
God what will I do when she's not around
