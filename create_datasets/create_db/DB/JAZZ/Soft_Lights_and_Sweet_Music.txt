I can't resist the moan of a cello
I can't resist the light of the moon
So place me in a light that is mellow
And let me hear a beautiful tune
The music must flow
The lights must be low
 
Soft lights and sweet music
And you in my arms
 
Soft lights and sweet melody
Will bring you closer to me
 
Chopin' and pale moonlight
Reveal all your charms
 
So give me velvet lights and sweet music
And you in my arms
 
Bring out the gypsy in me
