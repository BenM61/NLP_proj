The neck, and then the chain 
The head is hung in shame 
The neck, and then the chain 
The head is hung in shame 

I thought that you had grown 
That you'd carry on 
But now that I am gone 
What else's been withdrawn 

you used to be like my twin 
And all its been 
Was it all for nothing 
Are you strong when you're with him 
The one who's placed you above us all 

I think our love 
I'll let it pass 
It feels like fire 
But it won't last 

what is this coming to 
I am unwilling to go on 
You have lost 
No one has won
