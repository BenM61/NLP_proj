Sister, sister, solitude
Likes her swimming in the nude
Sometimes she is black and blue
Melody get over you and your kisses

Sister, sister, solitude
Gettin' off on being nude
Wish I could get used to you
I would know just what to do, hits no misses

Yeah

Sweet like candy
Yeah, I can be
Fake your beauty
Smiling sweetly
Yours completely
Fake your beauty

Baby, baby bubblegum
Tell me are we havin' fun?
Never knew what I could do
To get really close to you, for no reason

Baby, baby bubblegum
Are we playing hit and run?
You'll be singing last years song
Honey acting way too young, out of season

Yeah

Sweet like candy
Yeah, I can be
Fake your beauty
Fool him slightly
Doors locked tightly
Fake your beauty

Sweet like candy
Yeah, I can be
Fake you beauty
Fool him slightly
Doors locked tightly
Fake your beauty

Fake your beauty
Fake your beauty
