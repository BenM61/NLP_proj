Sexy Sadie what have you done
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone

Sexy Sadie ooh what have you done.

Sexy Sadie you broke the rules
You laid it down
For all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie ooh you broke the rules.

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along to turn on everyone 

Sexy Sadie the greatest of them all.

Sexy Sadie how did you know
The world was
Waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie ooh how did you
Know.

Sexy Sadie you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big
You think you are
Sexy Sadie ooh you'll get yours yet.

We gave her everything we
Owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie she's the
Latest and the greatest of them all.

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie.

However big you think you are 
Sexy Sadie.
