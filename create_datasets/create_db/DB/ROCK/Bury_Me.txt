Well I can't settle down,
I seem to spin around
Gonna fall off the world any day
Still when you make a sound

Like a spill when you hit the ground
Bury me up to my waist
Carry me back to my...
So far as I can tell, feels like cathedral bells

And I found it in the mess that you made
I walked into the room, ...
And the smile that still broke at your face
You said let's get out of this place

... when you land on your feet
It's cold, I feel old
And you're giving me more than I need
More than I need

I want to be with you
Want to be with you
