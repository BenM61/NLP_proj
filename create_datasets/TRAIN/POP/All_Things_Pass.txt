Each day I wake
It's gonna be my last
I hope it's gonna pass
I hope it won't last

Each drug I take
Is gonna be my last
I hope I don't fry
I hope I don't die

I have taken a vow
I have taken a vow
To prove myself
To find me

I'm regrettin' it now
I'm regrettin' it now
'Cause I found me

Hey, get out of the way
All things must pass
But not too fast

Each day I wake
It's gonna be my last
I hope it's gonna pass
I hope it won't last

Each girl I touch
She's gonna be my last
I hope she didn't lie
I hope I don't die

I have taken a vow
I have taken a vow
To prove myself
To find me

I'm regrettin' it now
I'm regrettin' it now
'Cause I found me

Hey, look out, here it comes
All things must pass
But not too fast
Hey, look out, here it comes
All things must pass
But not too fast

I have take a vow
I have taken a vow
To prove myself
To find me

I'm regrettin' it now
I'm regrettin' it now
'Cause I found me

Hey, look out, here it comes
All things must pass
But not too fast

Hey, look out, here it comes
All things must pass
The first and last
