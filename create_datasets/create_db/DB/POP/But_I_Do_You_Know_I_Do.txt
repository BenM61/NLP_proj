I keep trying to, I'm just dying to 
Get you out of my mind, 
But that's hard to do with somebody you love! 
I've denied it, I've tried to hide it, 
But every evening I find, 
You're the one that I keep thinking of 

I shouldn't mind if you find someone new, 
But I do, you know I do! 
I shouldn't care if you're here or you're there, 
But I do, you know I do! 

I know you love to flit around 
While I just sit around and wonder, 
What's become of you; 
I know that I shouldn't mope, shouldn't hope you're lonesome, too, 
But I do, you know I do! 

I keep saying and I keep praying 
That I'll forget you somehow; 
But the more I try seems the more that I pine; 
While you're dancing and out romancing 
With those you care about now, 
Do you think of days when you were mine? 

I shouldn't mind if you find someone new, 
But I do, you know I do! 
I shouldn't care if you're here or you're there, 
But I do, you know I do! 

I know you love to flit around 
While I just sit around and wonder, 
What's become of you; 
I know that I shouldn't mope, shouldn't hope you're lonesome, too, 
But I do, you know I do, do, do, do, do!
