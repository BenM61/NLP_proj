You invite me to a war party
Me no want to go
Everybody seem to be inviting me to - a war party
Me no want to go
Heard about the last one
So thanks but-no
Thank you
You
You killed off all the Indians
And you killed off all the slaves
But no quite
So you killed off the remains
You a look for me
And I'm looking for you
I can't believe what they say about you is true
That you're a bad star just like Pharoah
You killed the children just like Pharoah
Now you send a ticket for me
It don't have R.S.V.P.
Oh Lord
It's a war party
Me no want to go...
You've invited all our wise men many time before
To dance around your fires and even out your scores
And when the tolls taken of the valiant and the brave

The only decoration is the one upon the graves
Oh no
You're a bad star just like Pharaoh

You killed the children just like Pharoah
Now you send a ticket for me
And it don't have R.S.V.P.
Oh Lord
It's a war party
Me no want to go...
Please don't send no ticket for me
No
Don't send no ticket
No
Don't send no ticket for me
If don't have R.S.V.P.
Oh Lord
It's a war party
Me no want to go...
Do you want to go
Say no
Do you want to go
Say no
Me no want to go right now
Me no want to go right now
They invite me to a war party me no want to go...
