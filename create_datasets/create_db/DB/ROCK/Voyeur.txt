When voices through the thin walls
Speak of aberrant behavior
And the video's her only savior
She turns it on when they're all gone
And then she turns and slips her high heels on.
Shadows fill the room and she starts moving.

Voyeur, voyeur, are ya hot tonight?
Dance, dance, dance till it makes you feel good.
Voyeur, voyeur, who ya got tonight?
Well, love is still alive, it's just locked up inside.

Lingerie and loveliness
Still looking for a strange and sweet caress.
Her love life's hot but her life's a mess.
She got no minor vices
And she makes no excuses
And she concedes that she's the one she pleases.

Voyeur, voyeur, are ya hot tonight.
Dance, dance, dance till it makes you feel good.
Voyeur, voyeur, who ya got tonight?
Well, love is still alive, it's just locked up inside.

Voyeur, voyeur, are ya hot tonight?
Dance, dance, dance till it makes you feel good.
Voyeur, voyeur, who ya got tonight?
Well, love is still alive, it's just locked up inside.

Voyeur, voyeur, are ya hot tonight?
Dance, dance, dance till it makes you feel good.
Voyeur, voyeur, who ya got tonight?
Well, love is still alive, it's just locked up inside.
