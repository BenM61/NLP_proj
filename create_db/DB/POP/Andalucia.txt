Andalucia when can I see you
When it is snowing out again
Farmer john wants you
Louder and softer closer and dearer
Then again
Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you
In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter -- I love you

I'll be here waiting later and later
Hoping the night will go away
Andalucia castles and christians
Andalucia come to stay
You were lost, once before, on a day much like this
When you'd made up your mind not to come
And I couldn't persuade you
Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time
