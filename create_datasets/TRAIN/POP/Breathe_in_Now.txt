I see love and beauty all around, I also see the sadness that's embedded in your frown
I wonder why you choose not to talk to those around, I sense a fear of lifting heavy feet
Higher than you want to, I just want to believe your truth... 

You stand there but you do not cast a shadow, you walk away with every word you choose not to say
I suppose that moving on paints a new colour for each day, I don't like to see
Dreams put on the shelf, to deal with on that one day, I just want to be happy for you 

'Cause I only have one second, this minute today
I can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now
And so this moment, I just have to sing out loud
And say I love I like and breathe in now
And say I love I live and breathe in now 

I move on holding on to what I learn, it's time to move on from the notion
That the whole world's against me
Break free of shackles that formed young, time free in now
And now I know, it's not all up to me, I can count on another
So move on lighter and be free

'Cause I only have one second, this minute today
I can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now
And so this moment, I just have to sing out loud
And say I love I like and breathe in now
And say I love I live and breathe in now 

I believe in for today I just want to know that you're okay
'Cause I believe in breathing just for today
I just want to know that you're okay

'Cause I only have one second, this minute today
I can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now
And so this moment, I just have to sing out loud
And say I love I like and breathe in now
And say I love I live and breathe in now
And say I love I live and breathe in now
