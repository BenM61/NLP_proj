Hey baby,come on over here and sit down 
I want to tell you how you make me feel 
Listen 

Let me tell you about few things that turns me on 
Just the little bitty things that make this love so strong 
Like how you push your hair back from over your face 
Bit your lip when you want me to come and taste 

[Chorus]
Make that face that you do when we're loving 
Make that sound that you make when we're hugging 
You know what I mean 
Baby do those things that you only do for me 
Close your eyes like you do when you kiss me 
Send that face that you send when you miss me 
You know what I mean 
Baby do those things that you only do for me 

Subtle way that you nudge me in the middle of the night 
It's just way of letting me know that the time is right 
You give me singles that nobody else can understand 
How you trimble at the slightest little touch of my hand 

You know when I want it,you put nothing extra on it 
It's just the simple things that you 
You know how I like it and I ain't afraid to try it 
As long as I am trying with you 
Cause only you can understand 
Just how to treat your man 
That's the reason that I made you my wife 
You always keep it real 
You know just how I feel 
See you made a difference in my life 

[Chorus]

Can I get a witness in here? 
Somebody knows what I'm talking about 
Only heaven knows 
(Only heaven knows how you make me feel) 
I can't explain it 
(I can't explain it but I know that it's real) 
I know that it's real 
(I won't trade for the world even if it cost me my life) 
Yeah 

[Chorus]
