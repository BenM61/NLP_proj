You like
Don't be scared
You never saw me like this before huh'

I been a goody daddy,but I don't have to be
If you don't want me to,I'll be your nasty baby

No time for games,no rules just play
Hope you been thinking about the same thing

I'm just sayin'what's on my mind
It's been good,but now it's time
To show love what we made of

No time for games,no rules just play
[I hope you want me in the same way

[Chorus:]
Every time I close my eyes,all I dream about is
Making love
I can't even sleep at night,all I dream about is
Making love
It's just all the things I see,when you're inside of
Me,that keeps my mind going crazy
I can't even think at night,all I dream about is
Making love

to you

I love the shower,out by the kitchen sink
Lay me where you wanna,make my
Knees weak

No time for games,no rules just play
Hope you been thinking about the
Same thing

I'm just sayin'what's on my mind
It's been nice,but now it's time
To show love what we made of

No time for games,no rules just play
Hope you want me in the same way

(chorus)

[Breakdown:]
Do you want it on the back',it's like that
Do you want it on the floor',lover please
Tease me please me spank me feed me you
Know what I need baby

(repeat x 2)

I'm just sayin'what's on my mind
It's been nice,but now it's time
To show love what we made of
No time for games,no rules just play
Hope you want me in the same way

(chorus)

Like that
Like that

Tease me please me spank me feed me you
Know what I need baby

(repeat x 2)
