I want to ride the river of your kiss
I want to sink into your sacred abyss
I want to swim inside your radiance
I know you'll thank me if you give it a chance

Your love, intoxicating
Your touch, illuminating
Your kiss, inebriating
Your love, penetrating me

You are the solar storm inside my soul
You are the yes amid an ocean of no
You are the blue sky in eternal rain
You are the serotonin pulsing through my brain

Your love, intoxicating
Your touch, illuminating
Your kiss, inebriating
Your love, penetrating me

Intoxicating

Guide me through your dimension
Fill me with your creation
Lead me to your temptation
Fly me to your destination

Drawn me with your inspiration
Release me with your salvation
Take me to your elevation
Give me a new revelation

Your love, intoxicating
Your touch, illuminating
Your kiss, inebriating
Your love, penetrating me

Your love, intoxicating
Your touch, illuminating
Your kiss, inebriating
Your love, penetrating me

Intoxicating
Illuminating
Inebriating
Penetrating me

Intoxicating
Illuminating
Inebriating
Penetrating me

Intoxicating
