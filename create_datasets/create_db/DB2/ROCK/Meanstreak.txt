(Ooh yeah) 
I've been to the left, I've been to the right 
I've found myself in Abudhabi, just a mirage in the night 
Been to the high, I've been to the low 
And I've been to lots of places that I didn't want to go 
But I ain't see nothing to get me off my ass 
And I laughed at all the jokers want to make me walk on glass 
I could walk 'fore I could crawl 
And I was meaner than a bad dog with his back against the wall 

Animal, animal 
Cannibal, cannibal 
See 'em fall, see 'em fall 
I'm the guy that they call 

Meanstreak, I gotta meanstreak 
Meanstreak, they call me meanstreak 

I just don't know who I want to be 
The count of Monte Cristo or the sheik of Arabia 
Eaten rich, and I've eaten free 
And I'm the perfect culture vulture in the face of poverty 
And I ain't met no one who told me I got class 
They say never feed the animal, the boy's got too much flash 
I'm a guy they just can't teach 
And I always kick the castle that's been built up on the beach (heh ha) 

Animal, animal 
Cannibal, cannibal 
See 'em fall, see 'em fall 
Cause I'm the guy that they call

What's your name? 

Meanstreak 

I got a meanstreak 
Ooh I got a meanstreak 
Ooh I got a meanstreak 
want to feel a meanstreak? 
They call me meanstreak 
All the children say meanstreak 

What's my name? 

Meanstreak
