There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply.
Oh just remember a don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find us
Out to lunch

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
We're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A-vacant

Don't ask us to attend
Cause we're not all there.
Oh don't pretend 'cause I don't care
I don't believe illusions 'cause too much is real
So stop your cheap comment
Cause we know what we feel

A-vacant

Oh we're so pretty

Ah but now
And we don't care

There's no point...(etc.)
