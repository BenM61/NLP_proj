Movement 
No movement 
Just a falling bird 
Cold as it hits the bleeding ground 
He lived and died 
Catch sight 
Cover me with earth 
Draped in black 
Static 
White sound 
A day without substance 
A change of thought 
An atmosphere that rots with time 
Colors that flicker in water 
A short term effect 

Scream 
As she tries to push him over 
Helpless and sick 
With teeth of madness 
Jump jump dance and sing 
Sideways across the desert 
A charcoal face 
Bites my hand 
Time is sweet 

Derange and disengage everything 
A day without substance 
A change of thought 
The atmosphere rots with time 
Colors that flicker in water 
A short term effect 

A short term effect 
A short term effect 
An echo 
And a stranger's hand 
A short term effect 
An echo 
And a stranger's hand 
A short term effect
