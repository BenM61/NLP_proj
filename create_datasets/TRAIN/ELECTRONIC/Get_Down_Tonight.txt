Baby, babe, let's get together
Honey, hon, me and you
And do the things, do the things
That we like to do
Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Baby, babe, I'll meet you,
Same place, same time
Where we can get together
And ease up our mind
Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight
Get down tonight.
Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
Get down, get down, get down, get down,
Get down tonight baby
