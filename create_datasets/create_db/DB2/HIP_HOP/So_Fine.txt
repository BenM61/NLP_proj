This is for all these 
Special people whom God has created 
Who he put on this Earth 
So beautiful indeed... 
The woman 

Such a beautiful lady 
The kind you find in a dream 
And dreams are so real for me 
With eyes so warm and soothing 
They put me in a trance 
And I imagine us by the warm cozy fireplace 
The light shines on your face 
Your smile gets me higher and higher 
My heart starts to race 
I gotta say what I feel 
'Cause girl you look so good to me 

So fine lady 
So fine you sway me 
So fine lady 
So fine you sway me 

Can't believe my eyes 
Take me for a ride 
Such a woman of quality 
Your body's so supreme 
When you dance you sway so elegantly 
Girl you simply dazzle me 
You put me in a trance 

And I imagine you and me 
Just kissin' away 
My fingers in your hair 
Your embrace holds tighter and tighter 
Your touch makes me say 
I gotta stop to look 
'Cause girl you look so damn good to me 

So fine lady 
So fine you sway me 
So fine lady 
So fine you sway me
