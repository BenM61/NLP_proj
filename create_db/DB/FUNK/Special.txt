Hey there pretty lady
Love has come my way
So nice to be involved
It's tough out there these days

I got my weather 'cause I'm so wrapped up in you
My heart is on the line
Tell me what more can I do, pretty baby
'Cause you're special, hey
Girl, you make me feel real good
Special to me, you see, you are special
Baby, you're so special to me

Hey baby, I can't believe the things you've done for me
You put me back on the right track
Think about you constantly
And I know in your heart that you feel the same way for me, baby
Late nights with me all alone, it's total ecstasy

All I can do is think about the the times
When I'm making sweet love to you
And there seems to be, I'm tellin' you girl
Some kind of magic when we touch
Don't you leave
Special, yeah, you are

Girl you make me feel real good
So special to me, you see
Baby girl, you're special
So special to me, baby
Hey baby

Girl, you make me feel so good
You make me feel so good, hey
And all I can do is think about the the times
When I'm making sweet love to you, baby
And there seems to be
Some kinda magic when we touch
Don't you go nowhere, don't you leave

Special, so special, special to me, you see
You're a special part of me, love
So special to me, baby
Oh, you put me back on the right track, baby
And I like that, oh you're so good
So special to me, you see

I put my heart on the line any time
'Cause I know that you'll let us guarantee, baby
You're so special
