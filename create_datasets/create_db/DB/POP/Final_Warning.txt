Someone's gonna get hurt
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Someone's gonna get hurt
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
And it's not gonna be me

Good morning gorgeous
I drove your truck in the lake last night
Hope she was worth it
Don't worry, I slept just fine

You keep throwing punches but you won't win this fight
You're just fucking yourself when you don't read the signs
I'm going to the kitchen, coming back with a knife
'Cause I've had enough this time

This is your final warning
There's a dark cloud overhead
This is your final warning
Just remember what I said
Someone's gonna get hurt
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Someone's gonna get hurt, na-na-na-na
And it's not gonna be me

Good afternoon dear
How does the rope feel around your neck?
Just one more error
Could be a fatal step

You keep throwing punches but you won't win this fight
You're just fucking yourself when you don't read the signs
I'm going to the kitchen, coming back with a knife
'Cause I've had enough this time

This is your final warning
There's a dark cloud overhead
This is your final warning
Just remember what I said
Someone's gonna get hurt
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Someone's gonna get hurt, na-na-na-na
And it's not gonna be me

'Cause you're the one thing
You are, you are the one thing
'Cause you're the one thing
You are, you are

This is your final warning
There's a dark cloud overhead
This is your final warning
Just remember what I said
Someone's gonna get hurt
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Someone's gonna get hurt, na-na-na-na
And it's not gonna be me

'Cause you're the one thing
You are, you are the one thing
'Cause you're the one thing
You are, you are the one thing
