Everyday after day, another question for you
If I could go back in time I'd find a reason for you
The more I seem to try, another secret lies

Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and i wont make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and i wont make the same mistakes

Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, like into the night
Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night

Every ends has a start just like a dream come true
It won't be long till you'll find the feeling inside you
Before we walk, we crawl, but we can only try

Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and i wont make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and i wont make the same mistakes

Set fire to the night, see ashes fall
Set fire to the night, like into the night
Set fire to the night, leave none behind
Set fire to the night, set fire to the night

Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and i wont make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want
Walk away, from the flame, and i wont make the same mistakes
Cast away, from the train, I can give you what you want

Set fire to the night, set fire to the night
