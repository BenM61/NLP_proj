She weighs her words on a silver tongue
While she cradles the phone, moves through the room
I can hear her lightin' a cigarette
But so far she said nothin' yet

Oh, they say that your love is poison
I think that it's just uncommon
Jane Jane
There's a dark side to you that turns me on

I wish I knew where it's comin' from
You're like a Spanish dancer on a TV set
You hide a rattlesnake under your dress
They say that your love is poison

I say that it's just uncommon
Jane Jane Jane
Don't make the same mistake again
Jane Jane

Don't break the chain
That ties you to my heart
Jane Jane Jane, listen babe
It's not a game anymore

I'm gonna throw myself in a wishing well
I'm gonna go spin-dizzy on a carrousel
Gonna gonna gonna drown myself in the pouring rain
And wash up on some far away shore again

They say that your love is poison
I can't do without it darlin'
Jane Jane Jane
Don't make the same mistake again

Jane Jane
Don't break the chain, that ties you to my heart
Jane Jane Jane, you've gotta listen to me babe Jane Jane
Oh Jane, you've gotta start makin' sense baby Jane

It's not a game, it's not a game anymore
Jane, Jane
Don't you know that we've gotta change
Jane Jane
