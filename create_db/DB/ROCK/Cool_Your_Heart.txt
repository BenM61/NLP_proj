How do you feel?
Is it loneliness?
Is there shining in your heart
But no gloss on your lips?
Do you sail alone 'round the island with
A silhouette of a shark beneath the skiff
And then you say

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one

You've been waiting for the love in me
And there's been waters indeed
We've been hanging tight for all the things we want out of love
So wade, go deep on these mellow waters too

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one

Though I been trying hard not to fall
The feeling is tumbling in
Last night, I realized it's been feeling wrong
To start relying, making decisions based on another person

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart	

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
