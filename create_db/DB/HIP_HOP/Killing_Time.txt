Sitting on the stairway
Hoping that you're okay
Waiting patiently
For you to come back to me (what should I do?)
I don't mind the waiting
As long as there's still maybe
A possibility
For you to be true to me

I'll be sitting on the stairway
'Til a quarter 'til 2
With nothin' to do baby ay yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and think

Killing time
Waiting on you (baby)
What should I do
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time
Waiting on you (baby)
What should I do (baby)
I'll be sitting here waiting

Look inside your mirror
I hope that you see clearer
Look behind yourself
And you will find me (what should I do?)
I've got your back baby
The love I have, I'm saving
I'll be there for you
Just like I said I'll be

I'll be sitting on the stairway
'Til a quarter 'til 3
With nothing to do baby
But twiddle my thumbs and wait

Killing time
Waiting on you (waiting on you)
What should I do (what should I do)
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time
Waiting on you (waiting on you)
What should I do (what should I do)
I'll be sitting here waiting

Oh baby, when you come back down
Don't forget the love you found in me
I know that you're gonna take time
Oh, remember I'm by your side
Don't worry, I'm down for you
No matter what you're goin' through
I'll be there, I'll be there
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Killing time
Waiting on you (waiting on you)
What should I do (what should I do)
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time (killing time )
Waiting on you (waiting on you)
What should I do (what should I do)
I'll be sitting here waiting

Killing time
Waiting on you (killing time)
What should I do (oh baby baby baby)
I'll be sitting here waiting (I'll be staring at the wall)
Killing time ('cause I'll be)
Waiting on you (I'll be)
What should I do (what I want should I do)
I'll be sitting here waiting (I'll be waiting)

Killing time
Waiting on you (I'm lookin' at my watch)
Killing time (killing time)
Waiting on you (waiting ooh, ooh)
Killing time, killing time
