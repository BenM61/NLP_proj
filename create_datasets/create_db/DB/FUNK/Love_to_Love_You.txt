Ooh ya ya 

When I first met you
I wanted to give you the best of me 
Something special
I gave you my trust and honesty
And to stay fateful until the day I die
Then you gave me your love
I told you your the only one,that I really trust
I gave you all my love
Instead of a thug, so nothing can separate us

I love you more every day
You make me smile when I see your face
There's only one thing I can say
Is I love you
I love you more every day
You make me smile when I see your face
There's only one thing I ca say
Is I love you

So promise me you'll marry me
one boy and two girls
We can raise a family
You be my baby, my provider
Take a ride wit' me
So we can live a happy life
Ooh ya

But for right now 
I'll take care of you
You can settle down
There's nothin' you have to do

So until that day comes true
My promise to you
Is that I will stay wit' you
I love you love you more

I love you more every day
You make me smile when I see your face
There's only one thing I can say
