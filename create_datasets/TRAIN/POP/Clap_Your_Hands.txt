Just clap your hands now

Never did I ever
Mean to make a mess
How I'm gonna get home
Is anybody's guess
Money where your mouth was
Gonna wake up in debt
And my car ain't fixed yet
Oh, no, no, no

Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got it all

Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap your hands now

Just clap your hands now
Just clap your hands now

Never did I ever
Mean to send that text
Maybe in the morning
We can make amends
Keep on running my mouth
You keep getting obsessed
Baby, don't be upset
About

Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got it all

Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap, clap
