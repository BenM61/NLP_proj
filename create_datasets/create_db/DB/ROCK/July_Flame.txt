July flame
Sweet summer peach
High up in the branch
Just out of my reach

Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

July flame
I'm seeing fireworks
They're so beautiful
Tell me why it hurts

July flame
Ashes of a secret heart
Falling in my lemonade
Unslakable thirsting in the backyard

Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
