I woke up this morning
And I thought what am I doing here?
Yeah what am I doing here?
I woke up this morning
And I thought what am I doing here?
Yeah what am I doing here?

Oh, my brother he starts raging
I watch him rising 
I see him howling
And he sucked her and he sucked her and he sucked her dry
And he bit at me and he bit at me and said goodbye
Up on the twenty-ninth floor
Up on the twenty-ninth floor

Well, ah-oh
Ah-oh,

Well I was lying there with just my brother
We could hear someone ratting the locks
Yeah I was lying there with just my brother
And he said yeah man I think it might be the cops?
And we sucked her and we sucked her and we sucked her dry
Yeah we sucked her and we sucked her and we sucked her dry
I was Mickey Mouse. 
He was the Big Bad Wolf

Next thing you know
I'm looking down below
See a lupine child
With her hair on fire
Little burning girl
Looking up at me
Running to the elevator
Getting in the elevator
Sixth floor
Seventh floor
Eighth floor 
Nine
Come on baby
Blow my mind
Ah-oh, ah-oh
Oh yeah,

I woke up this morning and he was gone
And there were posters in the airports and the stations
We took shelter under her body
We sucked her and we sucked her and we sucked her dry
And we sucked her and we sucked her and we sucked her dry
He kissed me and kissed me and said goodbye
He kissed me and kissed me and said goodbye

Well no time at all
She's walking down the hall
A bat-faced girl
With dynamite curls
Ringing the bell
Banging on the door
Walking like a travelator
Jumping in the elevator
Twenty-two
Twenty-four
Twenty-six
Twenty-nine
Come on baby
Blow my mind
Ah-oh, ah-oh
Yeah
