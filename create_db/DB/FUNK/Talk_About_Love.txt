You and me
We're not alike
You like to walk I ride my bike
You like shoes
I like bare feet
But that should never come between you and me
Seems there are so many things
On which we disagree
So why don't we just concentrate
On what we know we need
Let's talk about love

[CHORUS:]
I need love, love, love, love
That doesn't let me down
The kind of love that's gentle
And always sticks around
You need love, love, love, love
The kind of love that's true
The kind of love that's faithful
That's what I've got for you
Let's talk about love

You and me
We've got it wrong
We're fighting over stuff that's here and gone
There's so much
We both could share
Love for one another, that's my prayer
'Cause you don't need another finger
Pointing out the cracks
And I don't need another tongue
Shooting flames behind my back
Let's talk about love

[CHORUS:]
I need love, love love, love
That doesn't let me down
The kind of love that's gentle
It always sticks around
You need love, love, love, love
The kind of love that's true
The kind that makes you happy
That's what I've got for you
Let's talk about love

You and I have got to try
To live this command
Love your neighbor as yourself
No matter where he stands
If only we could do that
Then everyone would see
The kind of love that Jesus has
Can conquer anything

Let's talk about love
(Repeat 3X)
