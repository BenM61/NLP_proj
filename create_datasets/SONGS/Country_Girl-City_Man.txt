 was born in New York City
I was born in Georgia
Girl you're lookin kinda pretty 
Don't you think we oughta
Get to know each other better
Take the time to find out while we can 
Gotta be some soul between a country girl and a city man
We could find, we could find it's groovy just to cross the line

City boy had your eggs and bacon
You were raised on cornbread
The rooster crowed while I was wakin
Bout the time I was going to bed 
Bet we got a lot in common
Take the time to find out while we can 
Gotta be some soul between a country girl and a city man
We could find, we could find it's groovy just to cross the line

We could find, we could find it's groovy just to cross the line
He was born in New York City
She was born in Georgia
Girl you're lookin fine
Don't you think we oughta
Get to know each other better
Take the time to find out while we can 
Gotta be some soul between a country girl and a city man
We could find, we could find it's groovy just to cross the line

That man's from New York City 
She's a girl from Georgia town
We could find, we could find it's groovy just to cross the line
