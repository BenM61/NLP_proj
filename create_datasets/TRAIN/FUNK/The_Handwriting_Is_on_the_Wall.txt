Lately I'm beginning to see signs
That you've got leaving me, on your mind

I get a cold cold feelin, when I touch you
It's hard to face, but I know the truth

You see the handwriting is on the wall
I just looked up and read it all
You're getting ready to call it off
The handwriting is on the wall
The handwriting is sure on the wall

Lately when I want to make love to you
You say you're too tired or some other excuse
I might as well quit foolin' myself
There just ain't much love between us left 

You see the handwriting is on the wall
I just looked up and read it all
You're getting ready to call it off
The handwriting is on the wall
The handwriting is sure on the wall

You see the handwriting is on the wall
I just looked up and read it all
You're getting ready to call it off
The handwriting is on the wall
The handwriting is sure on the wall

You see the handwriting is on the wall
I just looked up and read it all
You're getting ready to call it off
The handwriting is on the wall
The handwriting is sure on the wall
