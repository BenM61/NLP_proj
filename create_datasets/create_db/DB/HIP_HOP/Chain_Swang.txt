[Gipp]
 Yup, yup, yeah.. uhh..
 Yeah..
 All night like a corner store, twenty-four seven
 Hood hanger; we gets hot like a wok
 in the Chinese kitchen, switchin up on my shoe wear
 How we get down, we blew down, nigga big bank style
 Sit and chill a while, wait a minute yo we blows big nigga
 Sip on bottles with funny names, holla holla
 Deep in this thang, keep it simple and plain
 and watch my chain hang, watch my chain hang
 [Cee-Lo]
 Listen here -- I got a book that you should read
 It's about me, and I suggest that to any nigga who doubt me
 it will correct you, affect you, it will make shit clear
 Now switch to the next nigga with that bullshit here
 Keep readin -- it will also say
 that if you, disrespect, anything up in this way
 that will guaran-tay an awesome array of gunplay, okay?
 This is Carlito's Way, all day
 [T-Mo]
 Shake it shake it shake it shake it hang out all night
 and don't stop until the DJ quit spinnin what's right
 Everybody sweatin gettin closer and closer, be shoulder to shoulder
 Bouncin, bouncin, we tipsy, danceflo' is slippery
 But we groovin, keepin this bitch movin
 Provin, we bang in this game watch my chain hang
 [Khujo]
 Back and forth, back, and forth
 ?? style, whatchu know bout ridin out
 from the Kroger parking lot to the Paramount
 and Birmingham then back, punk is spittin his jack
 When the leaves turn you're-ange, and you see your breath
 uhh, fifteen eleven colossal
 I'm weighing in at a Knighton
 If you don't know nuthin else
 believe that it is some ol' real niggaz
 Chorus: Cee-Lo (repeat 2X)
 Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
 or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
 Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
 and let your chain swang, and let your chain hang
 [T-Mo]
 Lyric assassin while mashin they blastin come fast and
 scatter from every rational imaginal
 International region, under my seeds and, over these airwaves
 Manipulate the rhyme with my mind so it's good to grind
 through your speaker, this one's a keeper
 Like Ebenezer, it was his decision, to live his life
 through a tunnel vision, followed by the reaper
 who knows your past deeper, don't let him creep ya, from behind
 [Khujo]
 Before I was rudely interrupted, house fallin down
 but we straight, you should save yourself ??
 It's rainin suckers cause they greed sickens me
 Poverty stricken, hand pickin, in the corner cleansin
 Lights out poor, slip and you nails hell
 Everythang for sale, be eat with they plastic
 Let's enhance it, I'll be good til Saturday
 Thick volume gravity
 [Gipp]
 We bout to mix and mingle, meet a match for the next single
 Money stashed away in jars like Pringles
 Keep it hard for the Tunnel, we make it bump
 for the 5 5 nina skull-cap boot-wearin renegade motherfuckers
 Throw yo' hands up, you give it up we give it back
 Yo, this is how we act when it's packed from the back
 Lady don't snatch, let my chain hang
 Everythang is everythang boo
 [Cee-Lo]
 Behold, the stolen soul, the ancient scroll
 The game of control, roll the Swisher swoll
 Open the gate away, lay to lay, I getcha gotcha greaterly
 Even when you hate me, you educate me
 So try to trill, I will take ya to the battlefield
 Crack your motherfuckin, windshield you better yield
 cause I got the right of way, night or day, alright okay
 This is Carlito's Way
 Chorus 2X
