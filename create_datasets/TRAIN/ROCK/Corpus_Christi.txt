Born into a hazy crossfire
The end result of innocence and ignorance
Flesh and blood cure for emotional strife
Vision obscured by a soft skin curtain
Torn and ripped youth in a glass case
Convinced of divinity afflictions for attributes
Living out of body life crippled cub for crippled life
Vision obscured by a soft skin curtain
Window to reality shrouded soft skin curtain
Torn and ripped battle lost
Casualties ignored, ignorance victorious
Minority whored behind cold stone front
There lived one who cried
He feels like a man, he feels like a child
He feels like a doll, he feels like a living
Dead thing, empty and dry lying soaked in the rain
Drowning in lonely tears, dreaming of living
Searching, exploring
Lost in a bottomless whole
Expecting, directing
Disappointed in the world as a whole
Healing, feeling
Learning to accept those wholes
Living, loving
Living life as a whole
To live and fly
Breathe the clouds
Sleep with the stars
Know answers why
Soft skin curtain
Window to reality
No longer clouded
Soft skin curtain
Torn and ripped
Away
