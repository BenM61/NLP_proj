If we stand here shaking much more
We're gonna come apart, split in half,
You're telling me don't want no more
'Cos my head's up my ass,
I watch my world through a glass,
I'm just a crazy tired shape from your past

You say it's love that you need,
But it's war that you've got
That you want to live your life and "to have"
Not "to have not,"
Better wise up and face my lot;
She loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
Wise up sucker to what you've got

I'm freakin' and you couldn't care less,
I got the deep down crazies;
Trying to get my head round this mess.
At the sound of the bell
An act you know so well,
You give me sixteen different flavours of hell

You say it's love that you need,
But it's war that you've got
That you want to live your life and "to have"
Not "to have not,"
Better wise up and face my lot;
She loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
Wise up sucker to what you've got

Wise up! sucker, see the sights
Taking your ass for a ride, Wise up! Wise up!

You say it's love that you need,
But it's war that you've got
That you want to live your life and "to have"
Not "to have not,"
Better wise up and face my lot;
She loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
Wise up sucker to what you've got
