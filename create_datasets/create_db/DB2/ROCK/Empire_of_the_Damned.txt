There is an empire in the boundaries of Hell
Where only the death can reach and only demons reign
Place of lust, blasphemy and eternal darkness

Illusions of the darkness
Power of death
strength of Hell
Empire of the damned
On the black hills of Meggido you'll find
A place so cold as the mist, so dark as the night
Black armies march to the hills
To make power of the reign of darkness crow

The exterminating angels
Here there's to be emperor
To command Nospheratus
Creature of crypts
From the eternal darkness
A blade will shine
Saints and Gods will judged
Killed and buried

One day this empire will be discovered
For the judgment of mankind
Gnash of teeth and endless cries will be heard
The Hell there's to bury, the Heaven there's to dethrone

In the quietness of Heaven
And in the orgy of Hades
An empire will raise
Against the churches
And against the priests
It'll be like a concentration camp
A desolate place
Where the sun will be black as the darkness
