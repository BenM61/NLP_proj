Oh little sicky, seems to be the pain
Got all these herbs don't mean a f***ing thing
I am the little witch, with the magic tricks
Mistrust the white house, come and get your fix

It's not about the numbers, what you feel is real
Crystals, rays of light, the taste of orange peel
Open the mind, change the mind, that's how we achieve
Can't hurry to try right, it's what I believe

Witch doctor

I taste the green when you come here and complain
I'll give you cleanliness, while I'll make it rain
I'm a corpse eating vulture, who tells you how to feel
Don't trust the white coats, I'll make you a better deal

Put a needle in the cheek so turn the other one
Come back tomorrow, because we'll never get it done
Open the mind, change the mind, that's how we achieve
Can't hurry to try right, it's what I believe
