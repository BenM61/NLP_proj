Bo Diddley done had a farm (hey Bo Diddley)
On that farm he had some women (hey Bo Diddley)
Women here, women there (hey Bo Diddley)
Women, women, women everywhere (hey Bo Diddley)
But one little girl lived on a hill (hey Bo Diddley)
She rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill (hey Bo Diddley)

One day she decided she'd go for a ride (hey Bo Diddley)
With a pistol and a sword by her side (hey Bo Diddley)
She rolled right up to my front door (hey Bo Diddley)
Knocked an' knocked 'til her fist got sore (hey Bo Diddley)

When she turned and walked away (hey Bo Diddley)
All I could hear my baby say (hey Bo Diddley)
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley

Saw my baby run across the field (hey Bo Diddley)
Slippin' and slidin' like an automobile (hey Bo Diddley)
Hollerin', my baby got towed away (hey Bo Diddley)
Slipped on from me like a Cadillac-8 (hey Bo Diddley)
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
