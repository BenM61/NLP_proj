Oh

Yeah yeah

Really wish I could.

If only someone could un-break my heart
Come relieve my pain
Somehow I could wish upon a star
And make all of the memories go away,

But my mind just keeps on going back
And I can't help but think about
That guy that's gon' make me miss out on you
And I can't help but remember
'bout that sad day in September
That day he took my heart with him when he left.
Oh

See eventually I will get through this,
But right now it seems my heart's in the way.
I apologize for the way that I treat you
But I gotta leave you,
Unless somehow I come across a case of amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(to forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(to forget, to forget, to forget the pain)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(and I think, and I think it'll make things better)

I gotta leave ya I gotta leave you.

I tried to leave the past behind me
But it just hurts so bad. Oh
And I tell myself please don't cry,
Let it go and let the past be the past.

But my mind just keeps on going back
And I cant help but think about
That guy that's gon' make me miss out on you.
And I can't help to remember 'bout that sad day in September
When ya took my heart and just ran away! oh

See eventually I will get through this,
But right now it seems my heart's in the way.
I apologize for the way that I treat you
But I gotta leave you,
Unless somehow I come across a case of amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(to forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(to forget, to forget, to forget the pain)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(and I think, and I think it'll make things better)

I gotta leave ya, I gotta leave you.

Every time you try to get closer to me
I'm fallin' back cause I can't go down this road again
Memories won't go away
Constantly in control of my life
I don't wanna erase it all
And forget about it all! Oh Yeah.

See eventually I will get through this,
But right now it seems my heart's in the way.
I apologize of the way that I treat you
But I gotta leave you,
Unless somehow I come across a case of amnesia

See eventually I will get through this,
But right now it seems my heart's in the way.
I apologize for the way that I treat you
But I gotta leave you,
Unless somehow I come across a case of amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(to forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(to forget, to forget, to forget the pain)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(and I think, and I think it'll make things better)

I gotta leave ya, I gotta leave you.
