Aiyyo Jamar I got a girl that's bad! (uh-huh) 
But she don't understand my ways (why's that?) 
Arguin' days after days after days

Well I can dig it 
See I done had some fly ones 
But they try to get just that, thought I'd like to chase the cat 
But I'm not a dog, God is who you're lookin' at 
Couldn'ta tooken that, bullcrap, you woulda caught a jack 

I told her, "Yo the first thing is when the telephone rings 
It ain't really nuthin' but noise" 
You want to flip and lose your poise? 

Now they quick to flip, but yo honey get a grip 
You gotta understand I'm a man with needs that needs fulfilling 
And if you ain't with it somebody else is willing 
You gotta love me, or leave me alone 
You gotta love me, or leave me alone 
You gotta love me or leave me alone 

I got this good thing girl, it's the righteous love 
Not that quick on the top, one shop hop 
I'll make your knees get wet in the places I'll pet 
I'll make you breathe, faster than you can believe 
Within your hole I'll use my control 
And the final burst, I'll hold 
Until it comes 
Back scratches added up in sums 
Didn't your momma teach you bout bonin' a man? 
Bent my dick so bad that I ran 
Now I'll, freak of the week, or ride the quest of a yard girl's hips 
Your pussy can't see these lips 
I keep my tongue in my mouth 'cause I can't see down South 
Vulgar? Maybe, obscene with the purpose 
Sayin, "I'ma do my own thing, bein I'm my own King
And it's up to you to follow" 
So on your Wisdom I'll shine my light 
Bring forth the seed, created in the night 
You gotta love me, or leave me alone 
You gotta love me or leave me alone

The degree, love hella right, get it right 
Either all the above, or it ain't true love 
I ain't down for a honey who don't want to submit 
Always throwin' a fit, want to talk a lot of shit 
But love to get hit from behind 
Gettin' crazy joy from my Lazy-Boy that reclines 
Seems the only time we're not in a fight
Is when I'm layin' the pipe
You don't want me to bone another chick 
Quick to claim my name and my dick 
But when I tell you get off the swine and get refined 
You act like you're blind and you lost your damn mind 
See I'm not the kind to let a woman run it 
How my man Rick say it? 'I Shouldn't Have Done It'
Is what I'd be saying if you was runnin' the show 
No hoe, there's no gold, the G-O-D know 
The time on the Sun and the Moon and the Stars 
Dance to the tune of Lord Jamar 
And if you're actin tone def it's your own mental death 
Huh, you gotta love me, or leave me alone 
You gotta love me, or leave me alone 
You gotta love me or leave me alone
