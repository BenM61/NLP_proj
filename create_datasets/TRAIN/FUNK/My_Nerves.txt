You hold my hand, and I can't understand
My nerves, oh, my nerves
One look from you, and you don't know what you do
To my nerves, oh, my nerves 
Oh, my nerves

You hold me tight and kiss me right
My nerves, oh, my nerves
I get such a thrill, it sends a chill
To my nerves, all my nerves

A-can't you see what you do to me
To have me feel this way?
I pat my feet, and I clap my hands
And I snap my fingers all day

Whisper low that you love me so
My nerves, all my nerves
I should be bold when I lose control
Of my nerves, all my nerves

Like the sun shines in the summer
Like the sun shines in the fall
I'll be there anytime you want me
All you gotta do is call 

Call my name and you start that flame
In my nerves, all my nerves
When you're around, I can't hold 'em down
My nerves, all my nerves

One little squeeze, and I just kinda ease
My nerves, whoa, my nerves!
I'm a total wreck 'cause I just can't check
My nerves

Whoa! 
My nerves!
