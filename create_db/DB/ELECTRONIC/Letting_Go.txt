Now I often talk of my heart
How can I turn to the dark
And the swaying silence
I see, is nothing I can hold onto
You can't breathe if I hold you tight
You can not breathe if I hold you tight

Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go

Not of anything out of anyone
All alone here with my demons
Am I ready to move on
To a person or place
Alone away from here
And I miss you
And I lose you
And I find you
I choose to follow my heart

Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go

Not of anything out of anyone
Out of anything, out of anyone

Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
