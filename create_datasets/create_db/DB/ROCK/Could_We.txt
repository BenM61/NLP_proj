Could we
Take a walk
Could we
Have a talk alone
In the afternoon

Could we
Have a seat
Why yes be my guest
You can hold my hand

What a dream
In the grass
We kissed
Fell in love too fast too soon
Love full bloom

Should we get up
Let's wake up
Let's get dressed
I'll let you walk me up the street
Back home

Thank you
It was great
Let's make another date
Real soon
In the afternoon
