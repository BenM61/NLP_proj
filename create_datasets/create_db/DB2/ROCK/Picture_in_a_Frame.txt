The sun come up, it was blue and gold
The sun come up, it was blue and gold
The sun come up, it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture in a frame

I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
Ever since I put your picture in a frame

I'm gonna love you
Till the wheels come off
Oh, yeah

I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture in a frame

I love you baby and I always will
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
