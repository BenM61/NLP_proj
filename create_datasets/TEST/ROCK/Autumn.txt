When essence cast's shadow to see the ground,
Colours mix in hallucinations
I see a tree on a hill

It asks "Are you ready to become physically hardened?"
The answer includes a question

I experience things in it's entirety
Not as one after another
This vision is possessed by autumn
Return my gray matter, black sparks
