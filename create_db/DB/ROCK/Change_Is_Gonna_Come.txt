CHANGE IS GONNA COME
(Tommy Caldwell)

There was a time I dreamed about money
Was a day I feared growing old
Many times have come
When I'm thinking 'bout you, honey
And if you leave me girl
I got nowhere to go

Cause I know, yes, I know
A change is gonna come someday

Do you remember a long, long time ago
You would follow me
All the time
And everywhere I go?

Now I find myself a pot of gold
Living on another name
And what I got to know
Is it still the same?

Cause I know, yes, I know
A change is gonna come someday
