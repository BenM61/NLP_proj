Look at me
I've got your heart
Black and blue
I've got your nose
Bleeding through
I've got your mouth
How does it feel
To hear me say

Coming down
Cashing hard
I wake to find
A day you sleep
I'm still alive
I give my life
To spend the day
Just telling stories
Of nothing much
With just something more
And just enough

I introduce
Two shades of grey
I reach out
You walk away
I reach out
A suicide
I'm hard to please
Quick to believe
Coming down
Crashing hard
I wake to find
A day you sleep
I'm still alive
I give my life
To spend the day
Just telling stories
Of nothing much
With just something more
And just enough
Just telling stories
Of nothing much
With just something more
And just enough
Oh

Quite a lot
Missing you
Throwing up
Needing you
Coming down
Crashing hard
Coming down
Just telling stories
Of nothing much
With just something more
And just enough
Just telling stories
Of nothing much
With just something more
And just enough
