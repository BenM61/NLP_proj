Girl don't you know 
I can't let you go 
I want you all the time, all the time 
Now can't you see 
What you're doing to me 
I've got to make you mine, make you mine 
Boy you should know 
Before I let it go 
You got to treat me right, treat me right 
Boy can't you see 
That I want you and me 
Because you look tight, I want you tonight 

Chorus: 
Love me or leave me 
Don't you dare deceive me 
Can't you see I'm at the point of no return 
Repeat (1x) 

Love me or leave me 
Don't you deceive me 
Repeat (1x) 

Can't you see I'm at the point of no return 

Girl now I know 
Your hearts touch and go 
I know you cry, I know you cry 
Girl just believe 
That I won't deceive 
I'm gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine 
Boy can't you see 
If you want to be with me 
You've gotta feel alright, you feel alright 
Boy desperately 
If you want what you see 
You better do it right, I can do it all night 

Chorus (1x) 

Girl don't you know 
I love to be the man who turns you on 
Could you be the man who turns me on 
Give you the love you're dreamin' of 
c'mon girl, I can keep it strong 
c'mon baby, keep it strong 
Can't you feel my heart beats beating 
Don't you leave girl, time is fleating 
You must know that you're the only one 
So get ready 'cause here I come 

Chorus (1x)
