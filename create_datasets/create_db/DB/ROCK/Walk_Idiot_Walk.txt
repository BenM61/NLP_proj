Well is it true what they say about it
They say it's new but I have to doubt it
And then they tell you everything about it
Had enough

I got some people saying this way
I got some people saying that way
I got some people saying there's no way
Ain't it tough

See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
See the robot write up his name on the ballot
They say this is all I need to get by
The truth is baby it's a lie

Well is it true what they say about it
You oughtta do what I do and doubt it
He won and now he's gonna do something about it
Ain't it sad

And if you don't want to feel like a putz
Collect the clues and connect the dots
You'll see the pattern that is bursting your bubble
And it's Bad

See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard
They say this is all I need to get by
The truth is baby it's a lie

If we review the winning combination
Body at work and a mind on vacation
Who had the brain where it started to sink in
It was you

You've seen the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
But you never learned nothing and nothing isn't over
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
Still you never learned nothing and nothing isn't over
They say this is all I need to get by
The truth is baby it's a lie
