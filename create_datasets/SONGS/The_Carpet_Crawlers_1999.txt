There is lambs wool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries into fame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures are trapped in birth on celluloid
The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping they'll find peace
Each thought and gesture are caught in celluloid
There's no hiding in my memory
There's no room to avoid

The crawlers cover the floor in the red ochre corridor
For my second sight of people, they've more lifeblood than before
They're moving in time to a heavy wooden door
Where the needle's eye is winking, closing on the poor

The carpet crawlers heed their callers
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out

There's only one direction in the faces that I see
Its upward to the ceiling, where the chamber's said to be
Like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree
They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they are free

The carpet crawlers heed their callers
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out

Mild-mannered supermen are held in kryptonite
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright
Through the door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight
Its the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight

The carpet crawlers heed their callers
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out

The carpet crawlers heed their callers
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
...To get out

We got to get in to get out
We got to get in (get out to get in)
Got to, got to...
Got to get in to get out
(Got to get in to get out)
We got to get in to get out
(Got to get in to get out)
We got to get in to get out
We got to get in to get out
Get in to get out
Got to get in (get out) to get out
Got to get in to get out
Get out, get out, get out...
