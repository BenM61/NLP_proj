Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm staring at the same old crack in the same old wall
I want my life back
I'm listening to the same old crap that I've heard before
I want my life back

Finally got a plan
To be a better man
And not an arsehole man

I won't be very long
Though I may be wrong
I may be very wrong

I'll be back in 15 minutes
When they make me a superstar
When I'm back in 15 minutes
I won't forget who you are
Open doors and recognition
I'll deal you what I was looking for
But I'll be back in 15

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm happy with a fix of fame when I've had my fill
I'll get my life back
They tell me it's a dirty game but I'll play it till
I get my life back
I wanna jump the queue
Like the others do
Stand back, I'm coming through

I won't be very long
Though I may be wrong
I may be very wrong

I'll be back in 15 minutes
When they make me a superstar
When I'm back in 15 minutes
I won't forget who you are
Open doors and recognition
I'll deal you what I was looking for
But I'll be back in 15

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hold on, it may be a rocky ride
Hold on, I hope that you're satisfied
But I will try
So give me 15

If I never buy a ticket
I'm never gonna win at all
But I'll be back

I'll be back in 15 minutes
When I may be a superstar
But when I'm back in 15 minutes
I won't forget who you are
Open doors and recognition
I'll deal you what I was looking for
But I'll be back in 15

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
