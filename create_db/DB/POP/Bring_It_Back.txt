I just want you closer now
I just wanna breathe your air, grab your hair
I just wanna take you home and show you off
I know he's the one involved but I'm in charge

Bring it back
You need to bring it back
You need to bring it back to my life, girl

I know you happy where you at but you was happier with me
All the times at the beach, all the sand in your toes
All your friends, hatin' hoes
They just mad 'cause we be goals

(Please bring back your loving)
'Cause you've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back to my life, girl

Thought somethin' was wrong with her
All night, would talk on the phone with her
All night, been thinkin' 'bout you and what
We gonna do when nothin' is to do
You know I been missin' your smell
I been missin' the way you raise hell
I been missin' the way your stories tell
I mean it when I told you, your skin was so golden
I miss it
Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss it
Wait 'til I see you, watch how I kiss it
Kiss it and squeeze it
I just wanna please it
We startin' out easy
But we takin' off
I need you to love me
Love me, love me so strong
Love me, love me so strong
