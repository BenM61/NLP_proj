Show me your hands, your nails, your scars.
Show me where it hurts.
Show me the wounds, the cuts, the trails,
That lead back to where it happened first.

I only wanna see you.
I only wanna know, 
Who you really are

So tell me the worst. 
I'll tell you mine.
I got close before,
But I turn back every time.

It hurts I know
It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do

So tell me the worst,
It's your only hope.
Don't go back again.
Don't save yourself from falling.

Imagine we drove across this country,
But didn't quite make it to the sea.
Imagine we're halfway through a movie,
And then you just ran out on me.

If that's all you're gonna give me...
Is that all you wanna take?
'cause that's just not enough.

So tell me the worst.
I'll tell you mine.
I got close before,
But I turn back every time.

It hurts, I know.
It's the bravest thing you'll ever have to do.

So fake your words.
Have you just put off,
What you should have done years ago?

I wrote this song about you
But you know it's also where I fall down
Why don't I cool out

I show my worst
I got close before,
But I turn back every time

It hurts I know
It's the bravest thing you'll ever have to do

So tell me the worst, 
I'll tell you mine
I got close before,
But I turn back every time

It hurts, I know.
It's the hardest place you'll ever have to go.

So tell me the worst.
It's your only hope.
Don't go back again.
Don't save yourself from falling...

Tell me the worst.
Tell me the worst.
