Go while the going is good
Knowing when to leave
May be the smartest thing that anyone can learn, go

I'm afraid my heart isn't very smart

Fly while you still have your wings
Knowing when to leave
Won't ever let you reach the point of no return, fly

Foolish as it seems, I still have my dreams
So I keep hoping, day after day, as I wait for the man I need
Night after night and I wish for a love that can be

Though I'm sure that
No one can tell where a wishes and hopes will lead
Time, how I feel there is happiness just waiting there for me

When someone
Walks in your life, you just better be sure he's right
'Cause if he's wrong, there are heartaches and tears you must face

Keep both of your
Eyes on the door, never let it get out of sight
Just be prepared when the time has come for you to run away

Sail when the wind starts to blow
But like a fool I don't know when to leave
