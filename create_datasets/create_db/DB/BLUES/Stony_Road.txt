This is the story
Oh this is the way
Gospel of reason
When the pain came to stay
The life of a loser
Who wins with a smile
The sinners redemption
In the tears of a child

Me & Katie
We go dancing down the stony road
See her laughing through the pain
Of such a heavy load
Me & Katie
We go dancing down the stony road

You're looking for sugar
To kill the grey
You're looking for the laughter
To take the pain away
God don't give nothing
No you got to steal your own smile
Learning to find it,
In the tears of the child

And me & Katie
We go dancing down the stony road
See her laughing through the pain
Of such a heavy load

Me & Katie
We go dancing down the stony road
Let's go dancing, let's go dancing
Dancing down that stony road
