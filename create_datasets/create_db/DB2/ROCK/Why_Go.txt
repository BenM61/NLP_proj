She scratches a letter
Into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday
Another child
Won't feel as alone as she does
It's been two years
And counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed
By some stupid f*ck
And mommy agrees
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could play pretend
She could join the game
She could be another clone
Why go home?

What you taught me
Don't come visit
Put me here
Mommy dear
