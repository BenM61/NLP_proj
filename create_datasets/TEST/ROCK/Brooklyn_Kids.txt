Girl is on a white sheet
She's tripped in a trance
While her friends go out and dance
She's alone don't ask me why
This kid from Brooklyn cries

Boy struts on the main street
He's dressed for affect
But his eye's reveal he's really red
He's all alone don't ask me why
This kid from Brooklyn cries

And their both just a mile apart
Just streets away from a kindred heart
But they might as well
Be an ocean between them
There might as well
Be an ocean between them

You and me just can't relate
We got love given on a plate
Is it love or is it fate
Were not alone

Same girl in the sunshine
Such a perfect shape
And he can't talk, he just passed again
She walks alone don't ask me why
This kid from Brooklyn cries

Same boy doing cell time
Hanging his head, Pickup didn't go quiet as planned
He feels alone don't ask me why
This kid from Brooklyn cries

And their both just a mile apart
Just streets away from a kindred heart
But they might as well
Be an ocean between them
Yes there might as well
Be an ocean between them
