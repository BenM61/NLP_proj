Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room

Darling I've been working all week (yeah)
I've got so much on my plate
Always saying "poor me"
Although my boss is an a-hole
That's when you call me
Said you've been making a plan
To hit the road with me (yeah)
I'll pick you up after and

We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love 'til daylight
I love it when you play with my hair
You know it feels so nice
And I'll do what you like
Naked in the moonlight
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singing

Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You ooh ooh ooh ooh (ooh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You ooh ooh ooh ooh

I'm singing hey babe
Two jobs on minimum wage
Although the rent's late
Still got a smile on my face (ha ha ha)
We ain't got the sunshine
But we got hearts in our chest
To feel the love like this
Stronger than anyone else

We'll hit the drive-thru, like Lil' Wayne
We ain't got no platinum chains
But hand-me-downs are all the rage (aye)
So let me spend this pocket change (oh)
We'll drink beer like it's champagne (champagne)
We'll stay out kissin' in the rain
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singing

Baby, I ain't got no money (I ain't got no money)
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they (yeah) pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You ooh ooh ooh ooh (uh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You ooh ooh ooh ooh

Oh, I know baby we ain't got no money
All we got is love
But I know that can see us through
It might sound crazy
By why do we need sunshine?
When we can stay and sip warm beer
While holed up in a room
That's how we spend my summer on you (my summer on you baby)

Baby, I ain't got no money (I ain't got no money)
All I got is time (hey)
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You ooh ooh ooh ooh (uh)
Oh I will spend my summer on you
You ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh I will spend my summer on you
