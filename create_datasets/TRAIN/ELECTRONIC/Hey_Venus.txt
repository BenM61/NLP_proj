For sure for sure and actual 
You swear by all that's factual
Insane elastic joy despair
Figures dance and bebop 
Take me away from the drop 
I cannot help but stand and stare 
Sawdust casanovas 
Are dying to take over 
Lipstick on bankrolls it's a deal 
Telling stinkin lies 
Cheap chat and shifty eyes 
Double the price you gotta steal 

Hey Venus 
Hey Venus 
Wants us all so bad 
Hope it drives her mad 

Holy Rollin' thinkers 
Kneejerks and lovesick drinkers 
Eyeball eachother through the haze 
Swapping tales of woe 
Ozone and GI Joe 
They can they do and guess who pays 

Hey Venus 
Hey Venus
Wants us all so bad 
Hope it drives her mad 

Time to spit it out 
Wash it down the spout 
You don't have to Kiss because you pout 
All those high hopes locked up inside 
Let 'em out 
Put your doubt aside 

Hey Venus 
Hey Venus
Wants us all so bad 
Hope it drives her mad 

Hey Venus 
Hey Venus 
Wants us all so bad 
Hope it drives her mad
