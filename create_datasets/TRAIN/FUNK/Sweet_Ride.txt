Sweet ride
Give up, you won't survive
You'll never get out alive
This world won't let you
I bet you 
And if it did 
What's it gonna get you?
What counts is a-how you feel inside
 
Girls, love's the sweet ride, mmm
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet ride
 
You'd better hang loose
Don't come undone
It's better to walk than run
Each day is just something to glide on
And each night's made to slip and slide on
What counts is a-how you feel inside
 
Girls, love's the sweet ride
It's such a sweet, sweet ride
Yeah, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet ride
Sweet, it's such a sweet, sweet ride, yeah
 
Hang loose
Don't come undone
It's better to walk than run
Each day is just something to glide on
And each night's made to slip and a-slide on
What counts is a-how you feel inside
 
Girls, love's the sweet ride
Love's such a sweet, sweet ride
Mmm, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet , sweet, sweet ride
Sweet, such a sweet, sweet ride
Yeah, it's such a sweet, sweet ride
You'd better hang lose
You'll never survive
'Cause love is such a sweet, sweet ride
Sweet, such a sweet, sweet ride
Sweet
