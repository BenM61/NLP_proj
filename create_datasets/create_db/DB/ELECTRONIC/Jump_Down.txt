I woke up to find
Your face on my mind
The sun always shines, On my garden.
I told you before 
Just knock on myh door
Cause you know the score, It's my party.

You ran away with my spoon
You've stolen my heart
Always laughing
I jumped over the moon
Right from the start
You always make me feel good

[Chorus]
Jump Down 
I've never believed in love
'Til now, I've never believed in us
Jump Down (gotta jump down)
I've never believed,
I've never believed in love
That's why I'm letting you know
(Gotta jump down)

You're always around
Just stamping the ground
The letter I found was yours truly
It's so plain to see 
What you wrote to me was
Positively unruly

You ran away with my spoon
You've stolen my heart
Always laughing
I jumped over the moon
Right from the start
You always make me feel good

[Chorus]

Whoah letting you know
Whoah I don't what you to go
Oh you make me feel good

[Chorus]

(Yeah yeah letting you know)

[Chorus]

Jump Down
