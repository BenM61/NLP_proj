Feel the winds on the ridges, 
See the whirls in the meadows.
The ice-capped reed announce that the air is colder.
I feel the strength of my heart quiver inside me, 
But I have no cure for the lunger in your eyes.

So don't ask that question 'cause 
I don't know the reason why it must be just like this.
No don't ask that question, believe me, 
I don't know why it has to end this way.

The wind will carry me away.
The wind that would have killed us both, it saves my life. 
Your wish I'll keep in my mind, 
And if it won't come true our dream will dream.

I don't know why it must be like this 
So please don't ask That question 'cause 
I don't have the answer.
I don't know why it has to end this way 
So please don't ask that question 'cause 
I, I don't know why.

So don't ask that question 'cause 
I don't know why it must be like this.
No don't ask that question 'cause 
I, I don't know why it has to end this way.
