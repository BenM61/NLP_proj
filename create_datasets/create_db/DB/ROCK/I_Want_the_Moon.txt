Wrong name wrong face wrong time wrong place
Mass chant vigilante bad taste rat race
We aren't the side who runs but never buys
We are the ones who run but never hide

And I want the moon
I don't expect too much from honeymoons
And I want the moon
Some stand some stare some laugh or much don't care

Passing time passing phase stupid bastard rat race
There comes a line when you step out of tune
There comes a clause and a respectfully yours
And I want the moon we're gonna be there soon

I want the fucking moon I want the moon
I don't expect too much from honeymoons
Business man busy mind contrite like shite
Nothing like injustice nothing like a song to sing

Choose to give icons of our age
And choose to live with one foot in the grave
And I want the moon
I don't expect too much from honeymoons

And I want the moon
A peaceful place that we call home
I'm over the fucking moon
And I want the moon

We don't make bargains and don't deal with markets
And I want the moon
We won't make bargains and don't deal with markets
