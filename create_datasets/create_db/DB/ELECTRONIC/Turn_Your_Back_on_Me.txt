Loved you like no other
I loved you like a brother
What do I discover
I know I won't recover

I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Loved you like no other
I know I won't recover

Turn your back on me yeah
Now you turn your back on me
Turn your back on me now
Oh you turn your back on me 
Turn your back on me yeah
Now you turn back on me
Your back on me, your back on me
Now you turn your back on me

Much more than I ought to
I loved you like a daughter
Got me in deep water
And now I've got to face the torture

I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Much more than I ought to
I loved you like a daughter

Turn your back on me yeah
Now you turn your back on me
Turn your back on me now
Oh you turn your back on me 
Turn your back on me yeah
Now you turn back on me
Your back on me, your back on me
Now you turn your back on me
