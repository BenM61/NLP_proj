The world is full of strange behaviour
Every man has to be his own saviour
I know I can make it on my own if I try
But I'm searching for a great heart to stand me by
Underneath the african sky
A great heart to stand me by

I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
To hold and stand me by
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
Under african sky
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
I see the fire in your eyes
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
That beats my name inside
Sometimes I feel that you really know me
Sometimes there's much you can show me

There's a highway of stars across the heavens
The whispering song of the wind in the grass
There's the rolling thunder across the savanna
A hope and dream at the edge of the sky
And your life is a story like the wind
Your life is a story like the wind

I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
To hold and stand me by
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
Under african sky
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
I see the fire in your eyes
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart
That beats my name inside
Sometimes I feel that you really know me
Sometimes there's much you can show me

Guka 'mzimba (body grow old)
Sala 'nhliziyo (but heart remain behind)
