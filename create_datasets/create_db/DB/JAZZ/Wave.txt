So close your eyes
For that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

You can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above, don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

When I saw you first, the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

By now we know the wave is on it's way to be
Just catch the wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together

When I saw you first, the time was half past three

Just catch that wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream
Together
Together
Together
