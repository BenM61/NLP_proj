Fussin' and fightin', we back at it again
I know that it's my fault, but you don't understand (no)
I got memories, this is crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my niggas
I should try to decide, wanna let you in, but no
That means memories, and it's crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know

Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out
Damn, girl, I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Why can't I get it right?
Just can't let it go
I opened up, she let me down
I won't feel that no more
I got memories, this is crazy
She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you, baby, but I can't help it
'Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it
And I, I apologize for makin' you cry
Look me in my eye, and promise you won't do me the same

Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out
Damn, girl, I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold, cold world
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold, cold world
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up, better keep your eye on me girl

Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out
Damn, girl, I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Girl, I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
