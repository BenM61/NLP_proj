i got that fever that jungle fever
 you know the reason that i long to go
dusky maiden  dark haired siren congo sweetheart

im comin back to you
wild eyed woman native dreamgirl jungle fever
is in my blood for you

every hear a kettle drum pounding out of beat
ever fight the silence and the madness and the heat
thats the thrill im cravin and the music is so sweet

oh the congos callin and im longin to go
