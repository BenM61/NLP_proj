Something threw me in the dirt 
Kinda got my feelings hurt 
We was burnin' somewhere down the wind 
I had to get up and climb that hill again 

Little Lucy's such a doll 
Like to climb her garden wall 
But she only sees me as a friend 
I got to get up and climb that hill again 

I gotta bury my pride, drag this line 
Over that hill one more time 
Gotta get up in the morning, make my way 
Over that hill again 

I gotta bury my pride, drag this line 
Over that hill one more time 
Gotta get up in the morning, make my way 
Over that hill again 

Tempers flare and the words are spoken 
You close one door and another opens 
You hear the music and you're wondering 

You got to get up and climb that hill 
Get up and climb that hill 
You got to get up and climb that hill again
