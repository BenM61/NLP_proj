Bend or break
Its a lesson in love
You can laugh or cry
But eye to eye
You're due to find out
You're sure to find out there ain't no rules

You can win or lose
But you can't choose
That's a lesson in love
There's nothing for nothing
Don't wait until tomorrow
It's a lesson in love
A lesson in love

It's a lesson in love (that's what your missin')
It's a lesson in love (you better pay attention)
It's a lesson in love

You can win okay
Bend or break
Its a lesson in love
You can laugh or cry
But eye to eye
You're sure to find out
You're sure to find out there ain't no rules
And only made for same fools
Lesson in love
