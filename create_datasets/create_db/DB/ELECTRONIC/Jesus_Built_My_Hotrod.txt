Soon I discovered that this rock thing was true
Jerry Lee Lewis was the devil
Jesus was an architect previous to his career as a prophet
All of a sudden, I found myself in love with the world
So there was only one thing that I could do
Was ding a ding dang my dang a long ling long

Ding dang a dong bong bing bong
Ticky ticky thought of a gun
Every time I try to do it all now baby
Am I on the run

Why why why why why baby
If it's so evil then?
Give me my time, with all my power
Give it to me all again (wow)

Ding a ding a dang a dong dong ding dong 
Every where I go

Every time you tell me baby
When I settle down
Got to get me a trailer park
And hold my world around
Why why why why?

Ding ding dong dong dong ding dong
Dingy dingy son of a gun
Half my time I tell you baby
Never am I all for sure

Why why why why why baby
Sicky sicky from within
Every time I stick my finger on in ya
You're a wild wild little town bitch

Now how 'bout ding a dang dong dong dong ling long
Dingy a dingy dong a down

Every time you tell me baby
When I settle down
Got to get me a trailer park
And hold my world around
Why why why why?

In my dang a ding a ding a ding dong 
A sticky sticky son of a gun
Ding a danga danga dong dong ding dong 
Why why never know

Why why wack a dong a dang ding dong
Then you take it on the bill
Ding dang dong don't dong 
Whoa!

Half the time I talk about it all now baby
You know what I'm talkin' about I said

The memory is on the bed

If my time was all as is yours 
Make me burn a wish

When my time with you is brutish
No I'll never not ever

Why why why why why why baby heavy hell 
Alone and it's here it's this thunder
The thunder oh thunder
Oh!

Jesus built my car
It's a love affair
Mainly Jesus and my hot rod

Yeah, f*ck it!
