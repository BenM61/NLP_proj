Don't put yourself down
Don't be hard on yourself
You didn't do wrong, baby don't
Blame yourself

I know how you feel
I've been there myself
It's what the devil my fare
What do you care
Can you control yourself?

I won't stick around
To watch you get colder
I know I couldn't be told,
Don't suppose
Now I'm a little older

The fault was all mine
I don't blame you if you blame me
I know I was wrong
I just cannot contain this

I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this
I just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this
I just cannot contain this

And if it's a crime
Then can you explain to me
Where do I belong

I just cannot contain this

Can, not
Contain this
Just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this

I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot, just cannot contain this
I just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this
I just cannot contain this
Just cannot contain this
I just cannot contain this

Can, not
Contain this
Just can not
