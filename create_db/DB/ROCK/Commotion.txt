Traffic in the city turns my head around
No, no, no, no, no.
Backed up on the freeway, backed up in the church,
Everywhere you look there's a frown, frown

Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone

People keep atalkin', they don't say a word
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw
Talk up in the White House, talk up to your door,
So much goin' on I just can't hear

Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone

Hurryin' to get there so you save some time.
Run, run, run, run, run
Rushin' to the treadmill, rushin' to get home,
Worry 'bout the time you save, save

Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone

Com, commotion,
Git, git, git, gone
