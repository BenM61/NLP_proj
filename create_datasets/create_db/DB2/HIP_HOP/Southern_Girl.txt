Sing a lang sang  sing a lang song 
Sing a lang sang  sing a lang song 
Twang  twang  twang  twong 

I'm from the South 
I'm a Southern Girl 
Home of the burning church 
Don't know much about the world 

Home of the pocket stones 
Home of the booty songs 
Home of the finger wave that lasts 
All night long 

Home of the On and On 
Home of the dominoes 
Home of the two piece and the cat fight 
Home of the teeth that's gold 

Home of the never miss 
Home of the platinum hits 
I'm a Southern Girl (Southern Girl) 

Countryfied 
Everything I eat is fried 
Gotta Southern drawl 
I'm so country y'all 
Well that's way down South 
Yeah it's way down low 
Check my Southern fried style 
And my Southern flow 
(Southern Girl) 

Countryfied 
I like my Tofu fried 
Got about a hundred friends 
That ain't caught on the trends 
Don't know about the internet (mm-hmm) 
Don't know about the radio (mm-hmm) 
Don't know about the television 
all I know is bout my flow 
My kinfolk sent me out 
to make money for the house 
Hooked up with my boy Rahzel 
I sure hope the record sell 
(Southern Girl) 

Southern Girl, and I'll rock your world 
Fly as a bumble bee (buzz) 
Can't nobody f*ck with me 
I'm a Southern Girl 
From way down South 
Got a dirty wave 
'Cause I got a dirty mouth, dirty South
