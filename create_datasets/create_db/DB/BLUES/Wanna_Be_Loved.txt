I want to be loved, but by only you
I want to be loved, but by only you
Because I never had a love as true

Your kisses so sweet, honey your love is life
Your kisses so sweet, honey your love is life
Come on and love me, honey love me tonight

I want to be loved, but by only you
I want to be loved, but by only you
Because I know, I know, your love it true
