Alright, let go, before I get gold, gold, gold
Chameleon, keeps me a bit gold
Come on, chameleon

The pyramid tells me I said so
Oh, oh, oh
Chameleon, keeps me a bit gold
Oh, oh, chameleon

We could rock away
Leading, walk away
Do you understand?
Do you know what I say?

We could rock away
Leading, walk away
Do you understand?
Do you know what I say?

Come through the flicker of the sun with me
Hanging out, come to the center of the sun with me
Saying "We could rock with our rhythm wise"
We could rock with our rhythm wise
We could rock with our rhythm wise
We could rock (rock, rock) ah, hey

Footsteps knocking to make sure
Knocking, knocking, knocking banging loud, ah, hey
Footsteps knocking to make sure
Knocking, knocking, knocking on the floor

Alright, let go, before I get gold, gold, gold
Chameleon, keeps me a bit gold
Come on, chameleon

The pyramid tells me I said so
Oh, oh, oh
Chameleon, keeps me a bit gold
Oh, oh, chameleon

Yeah, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

Come through the flicker of the sun with me
Hanging out, come to the center of the sun with me
Saying "We could rock with our rhythm wise"
We could rock with our rhythm wise
We could rock with our rhythm wise
We could rock (rock, rock)

We could rock away
Leading, walk away
Do you understand?
Do you know what I say?

We could rock away
Leading, walk away
Do you understand?

Yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah
