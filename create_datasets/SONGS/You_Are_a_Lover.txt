You are a lover from today
Can you afford to dump a friend?
Will you ignore me again?
Will he always be there?

And now you are walking hand in hand
Demonstrating something unreal
I know it feels good to depend
Will he always be there?

It's not a shame nor a glory
Just a romantic tale
Maybe you'll never be sorry
I'm not always quite right

You are a lover from today
(This is the first day)
Can you afford to dump a friend?
(One friend less)

Will you ignore me again?
(Once again)
Will he always be there?

And from the corner of the street
I see you kissing his face
Does he smell really sweet?
Will he, will you--I'm sad, aren't I?

You are a lover from today
It's a romantic tale
I will dream of you tonight
And it all will happen to me
