Who can explain the forces of nature
Why do opposites attract
Aren't we just animals after all
At night when the sky is black

I want you so bad
It's the craziest feeling I ever had

I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you)
I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you)
Take off my pants, my shirt, my socks
And my shoes
I need to be naked with you
I need to be naked with you

If you don't want me, I'll be devastated
I'm so much in love with you
Waiting, not knowing, baby I hate it
Tell me what you want me to
I want you so much 
That I live and I breath only for your touch

I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you)
I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you)
Take off my pants, my shirt, my socks
And my shoes
I need to be naked with you
I need to be naked with you

All these clothes just come between us
Let's go where no one can see us
My skin, my lips
Need to meet your fingertips

I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you)
I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you)
Take off my pants, my shirt, my socks
And my shoes
I need to be naked with you
I need to be naked with you
