See how the fluffy clouds move by us (See how the clouds move by).
See how the morning mist can hide us away, (hide us away)
And how the day (and how it's) is so much fun!

Isn't it groovy in a daydream? (Dreaming today)
Doesn't it seem the day could never end? (Could never end)
And so, my friend, we're one.

Baby, it's funny how I can feel so sunny?
When you're beside me, we can fly! 

Oh, we can fly!

Hey, Mr. Wind, just keep us sailing. (Keep us sailing along)
High in the sky, there's no curtaining our fun,
So everyone, come on!
Hey, you on the ground!
Take a look up, and see what we've found!

Nothing to tie us, bluebirds come up to guide us.
When you're beside me, we can fly! 

Oh, we can fly!
We can fly! Hey! Everyone on the ground, let's fly!
