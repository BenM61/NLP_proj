I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy

She don't care what her momma says
No she gonna have my baby
Taking all that I have to take

People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like takin' on the town
Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and you's a drunk
But I love her like no other

And in the dark we say we don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

People call us renegades
Cause we like living crazy
We like takin' on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and you's a drunk
But I love her like no other

And her daddy he says he don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we gonna
