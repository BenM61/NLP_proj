If we all sing one song 
One song of love 
One song of peace 
One song to make all our troubles cease 

One hymn, one theme, one hope, one dream 
Imagine what tomorrow would bring 
If we all sing one song 
If we all learn the words 

Just think how great the song would be 
And since the song is in freedom's key 
One voice you'd hear, so pure, so clear 
Imagine what tomorrow would bring 

If we all sing one song 
There's just one sun that warms our day 
The same moon and stars light our way 
This little ball whirling in space 

It's our only home, our only place 
If we all sing one song 
One song of love 
One song of peace 
One song to make all our troubles cease 

Imagine what tomorrow would bring 
If we all sing one song 
If we all sing one song 

One song of love 
One song of peace 
One song to make all our troubles cease 
Imagine what tomorrow would bring 

Just imagine what tomorrow would bring 
Just imagine what tomorrow would bring 
If we all sing 
If we all sing
One Song!
