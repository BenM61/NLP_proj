There's a place in the sun for anyone
Who has the will to
Chase one and I think I found mine
Yes I do believe I have found mine.
So, close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh.
Let me kiss you, oh.

I zigzagged all over America
And I cannot find
A safety haven
Say, would you let me cry on your shoulder
I've heard that you'd try anything twice

Close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh.
Let me kiss you, oh.

But then you open your eyes
And you see someone that you physically despise
But my heart is open
My heart is open
To you
