Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour

Murderers you're murderers
We are not the same as you

Genie let out the bottle
Funny ha ha funny how

When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing

When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side

To the shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells

Shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells

They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing

This is the gloaming
