She don't need no rocket ship (rocket ship rocket ship)
Just close her eyes and takes a trip
Baby's big on aviation (aviation aviation)
Baby loves a levitation (levitation)
Yes she's a spaceface going round
She's never coming down (coming down coming down)
My little spaceface floating round
She's never coming down (coming down)
Never coming down
Never coming down (coming down coming down)
Baby's talking to the stars
Ain't got time for idle wars (space space space)
And I don't worry anyway
As long as I know she's ok (shes ok)
Yes she's a spaceface floating round
She's never coming down (coming down)
My little spaceface floating round
She's never coming down (coming down coming down)
She's a spaceface floating round
She's never coming down (coming down)
My little spaceface floating round
She's never coming down (coming down coming down)
Never coming down (coming down)

don't know what you see
I'll be there if you wait for me
I will soon be home
I'll be there if you're not alone
Ah spaceface
My little spaceface
Ah spaceface
Never falling down
Never falling down
Yeah, she's a spaceface floating round
She's never coming down (never coming down)
My little spaceface floating round
She's never coming down (never coming down)
Never coming down

Never coming down
Never coming down

She never coming down
