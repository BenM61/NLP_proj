You must regret the day that you left me 
(Uh huh he don't deserve you(deserve you) he gunna regret that he hurt you (hurt you)) x2

Letoya!

I made your cool
You wasent that dude until I started with you.
I gave you swagg
In a duffle bag
You left the best you had
Now you gunna act like that

I got you right
I changed your life
Suicide doors I consigned
Gucci rags, Louis travel bags
You left the best you had
Baby dont look so mad

You must regret the day that you left me.
You must regret the day that you left me.
Still tryna get back(get back) 
Still tryna get back(back back) with me ohhh
Still tryna get back(get back) 
Still tryna get back(back back)with me ohh.

V.I.P was all on me
Now your at the bar with one or two drinks
Popping game
You look so lame
Without me your pimpin ain't the same

First class flights 
Dipped in ice
I had your neck and wrist 
Oh so bright
Poppin tags 
Is a thing of the past
You lost everything you had 
Chasin them scallywags

You must regret the day that you left me.
You must regret the day that you left me.
Still tryna get back(get back) 
Still tryna get back(back back) with me ohhh
Still tryna get back(get back) 
Still tryna get back(back back)with me ohh.

Ludacris Raps:
Hey sexy 
Tell em that its over
Tell em you ma baby 
And my coop is ya stroller
Tell em that louis vuitton scarf is ya bib
Or that you call me daddy and my house is ya crib 
And if he cries I know how to control that
Give some bottles of this conjure cognac
Just to shut him up
She said you wasent half the man I am so I guess she had to double up
He still tryna get back like the soldiers dreamin that its time to wake em up like folgers
I just hold her 
You use to put a load her
 shit up on her brain but you lame now its over
I keep her by mi side like a holster
I plan to make a full house and I anit talkin bout poker 
But I might poke her
And just stroke her
Cuz imma bout to treat her like a real man suppose to.
Ludaaaa!

You must regret the day that you left me.
You must regret the day that you left me.
Still tryna get back(get back) 
Still tryna get back(back back) with me ohhh
Still tryna get back(get back) 
Still tryna get back(back back)with me ohh.
