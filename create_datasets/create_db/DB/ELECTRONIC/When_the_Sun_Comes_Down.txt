Time to wake up
In every nation
Go feel the vibration
That takes me away

Me people stand up
To fight desperation
As we're raising, raising
Until the break of day

Hey

I will lift you up
We can stir it up
Feel the love around
When the sun comes down

People give it up
'Cause we're rising up
Like the sun (like the sun)
So hold on

I will lift you up
We can stir it up
Feel the love around
When the sun comes down

People give it up
'Cause we're rising up
Like the sun
So hold on

Right

Come share my dream
No facing, no fighting
Me love like deep shining
All that it way

Hey

Me people get off
To join this foundation
As we're raising, raising
Until the break of day

I will lift you up
We can stir it up
Feel the love around
When the sun comes down

People give it up
'Cause we're rising up
Like the sun
So hold on

I will lift you up
We can stir it up
Feel the love around
When the sun comes down

People give it up
'Cause we're rising up
Like the sun
So hold on

Come on down
And share all your dreams
The time has come
To gather the rainbow colors
Open up your heart you will see we can
Hold on, hold on

The road is clear
So gather all your friends around and
Take them one by one by the hand
To a peaceful, lovely place

Hold on

I will lift you up
We can stir it up
Feel the love around
When the sun comes down

People give it up
'Cause we're rising up
Like the sun
So hold on

I will lift you up
We can stir it up
Feel the love around
When the sun comes down

People give it up
'Cause we're rising up
Like the sun
So hold on
