Goodbye
Should be sayin' that to you by now, shouldn't I?
Layin' down the law that I live by
Oh, maybe next time

I've got a thick tongue
Brimming with the words that go unsung
I simmer, then I burn for someone
The wrong one

I tell myself to let the story end, oh
My heart will rest in someone else's hand
My why-not-me philosophy began
And I say

Oh, how am I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday, hey oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday

"Maybe" it's a vicious little word that can slay me
Keep me when I'm hurting and make me
Hang from your hands

Well, no more (no more)
I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
If I make it at the thought of you, what for? (what for?)
It's not me anymore

And I'm not the girl that I intend to be
I dare you, darling, just you wait and see
But this time not for you but just for me
And I say

Oh, how am I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday, hey oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday

Say it's comin' soon,
Someday without you
All I can do, is get me past the ghost of you
Wave goodbye to me
I won't say I'm sorry
I'll be alright, once I find the other side of
Someday
Oh, oh
Whoa, oh
Oh
Oh, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

Oh, how am I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday, hey oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
Someday
