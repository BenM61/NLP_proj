Ego trippin' got you step
Steppin' on someone else's toes
I'm not your sister not your mother
It's not fun being left alone
Staying out all night long
Wondering when you'll be back home
Tired of being on my own

Mind trips got me trippin' out
Mind trips I can do without
Mind trips pushing me around
Mind trips turn me upside down

Always talkin' about how good
About how good you can make me feel
How can you tell me it's true love
When you're out there playin' the field
I don't need the pain no more
Break my heart I'll close the door
Ain't livin' life just like before
Time to stop the crazy games that you're
Playin' with my heart

Mind trips got me trippin' out
Mind trips I can do without
(Boy you've got me trippin')
Mind trips pushing me around
(You've got me trippin' out)
Mind trips turn me upside down

Lying cheating so misleading
Hurtin' scheming so deceiving
Ruinin' all the plans I'm makin'
Time to stop the crazy games that
You're playin with my heart
