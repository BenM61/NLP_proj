You're on your own, in a world you've grown
Few more years to go,
Don't let the hurdle fall
So be the girl you loved,
Be the girl you loved

I'll wait, so show me why you're strong
Ignore everybody else,
We're alone now
I'll wait, so show me why you're strong
Ignore everybody else,
We're alone now

Suddenly I'm hip
Is this darkness of the dawn
And your friends are gone
When you friends won't come
So show me where you fit
So show me where you fit

I'll wait, so show me why you're strong
Ignore everybody else,
We're alone now
We're alone now
We're alone now
I'll wait

Suddenly I'm hip
Is this darkness of the dawn
And your friends are gone
When you friends won't come
So show me where you fit
So show me where you fit
