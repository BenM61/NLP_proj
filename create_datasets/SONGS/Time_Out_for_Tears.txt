Time out for tears
Because I'm thinking of you;
Time out for tears,
My darling, now that we're through

You know that I
Never wanted our plan to end,
And you know that I
Would be willing to try again,
Try again

Time out for tears,
My heart is yearning for you
All through the years
Here's what I'll do;

I'm gonna spend my time,
And dance and dine,
Playing with somebody new,
But there'll be time out for tears
Whenever I think of you

I'm gonna spend my time,
And dance and dine,
Playing with somebody new,
But there'll be time out for tears
Whenever I think of you
