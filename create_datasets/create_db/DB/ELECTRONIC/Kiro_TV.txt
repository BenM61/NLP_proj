Ok, you had sedatives and cold champagne
They say 'that must be the price of fame'
It's not a joke if you can choke on the thought of it
You're not my friend to defend if you're loving it
So Kurt I heard that you squeezed somebody's hand
It doesn't hurt if you think about your fans

Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen

They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again want your heroes dead

So high, if you think of the fans
So high, if you think of the fans

Ok, they got your file down at the CIA.
They say you're worse than Manson for the USA
It's not grief if you can see through the source of it
It's only true if you're bruised by the force of it
So Kurt I heard that you opened up your eyes
They call it work but it don't make it civilised

Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again want your heroes dead

Ok, time takes your cigarette
They say it puts it in your mouth then you'll forget
No longer "live 105" can you hear me
The life expectancy of any popularity
So Kurt I heard that the side-show bet your life
It doesn't hurt but the worst go nevermind
