Oh, no
Yeah, yeah

She's got green eyes, and she's 5'5"
Long brown hair all down her back
Cadillac truck
So the hell what
What's so special about that?
She used to model, she's done some acting
So she weighs a buck o' five
So I guess she's alright if perfection is what you like

Oh, oh, and I'm not jealous, no, I'm not
Oh, oh, I just want everything she's got
Oh, oh, you look at her so amazed
I remember way back when you used to look at me that way

Tell me, what makes her so much better than me (so much better than me)?
What makes her just everything that I can never be?
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can't remember when it was me

And now you don't feel the same
I remember you would shiver every time I said your name
You said nothing felt as good as when you gaze into my eyes
Now you don't care I'm alive
How did we let the fire die?

Oh, oh, and I'm not jealous, no, I'm not
Oh, oh, I just want everything she's got
Oh, oh, you look at her so amazed
I remember way back when you used to look at me that way

Tell me, what makes her so much better than me (so much better than me)?
What makes her just everything that I can never be?
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can't remember when it was me

That made you smile
That made you laugh
Even if it makes you happier than you have ever been, oh me
That was your world (me)
Your kind of girl
Nothing about me has changed
That's why I'm here wondering

What makes her so much better than me?
(What makes her so much better than me?)
What makes her just everything that I can never be?
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can't remember when it was me

What makes her so much better than me?
(What makes her so much better than me?)
What makes her just everything that I can never be?
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can't remember when it was me

When it was me
When it was me
When it was me
