You tell me love ain't been your way
'Cause you've been searching but good ones are hard to find
Said you won't settle for less than what your heart is asking
And life's too precious just to be wasting time
You disappoint me, it's something that's so familiar
You get them hopes up high to watch them fall again
So you stopped trying to find your one in a million
And the language of your love, can't nobody comprehend

Well listen to this
See I got news for you
'Cause you don't know how I do
I got ways to make you smile
That they never knew about
Reaching corners of your mind
That no one's tried to find
Think your time for love is through
Well I got news for you
Oh I got news for you, yeah baby

Your body's already with satisfaction
I've shown you pleasures, girl
You thought you'd never feel (never feel)
Said you were flying like the world was far below us
You said there's no way that I could take you higher still

Well listen to this
'Cause I got news for you
I still got work to do
And you're thinking that I'm done
That's when love just begun
Reaching corners of your mind
That no one's tried to find
And you think my love is through
Girl I got news for you
Ooh I got news for you, yeah
I got news for you
Whoa have I got news for you

Don't you worry about me leaving, no, no, girl
Ain't trying to be deceiving, never, no
You said I feel good to be true
Baby I got news for you

Don't you worry about me leaving,
Ain't trying to be deceiving,
You said I feel good to be true
Baby I got news for you

I got news for you
'Cause you don't know how I do
I got ways to make you smile
That they never knew about
Reaching corners of your mind
That no one has tried to find
Think your time for love is through
I got news for you

See I got news for you
'Cause you don't know how I do
I got ways to make you smile
That they never knew about
Reaching corners of your mind
That no one's tried to find
Think your time for love is through
I got news for you
See I got news for you
Ooh I got news for you
You, you baby
