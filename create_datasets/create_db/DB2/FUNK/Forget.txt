Waste all your time writing love songs, but you don't love me
All too familiar when it feels wrong
I think you're just lonely

Do you mind?
I found another new way to look at
Use your time, to pack away your every verse and every rhyme

Forget, all the words that let you break my heart
Forget, that I'm the person tearing you apart!

Remember way back when you played me
I lost that hand
So please don't try serenade me
I am a one man band

Say goodbye
Don't need to hear you play
So many other ways to relax
So pack away your every verse and every rhyme

Forget, all the words that let you break my heart!
Forget, that I'm the person tearing you apart!

Forget, all the words that let you break my heart!
Forget, that I'm the person tearing you apart!

I think it's time for me to leave
But I gave this piece of mind for free
So if you hear my sound advice, there is no need to tell you twice
There is no need to tell you twice!

Forget, all the words that let you break my heart!
Forget, that I'm the person tearing you apart!

Forget, all the words that let you break my heart!
Forget, that I'm the person tearing you apart!

So if you hear my sound advice, there is no need to tell you twice!
