Well there's something there that's frightning
It lives close to your heart
Something makes you scared
And it tears you apart

And you send a prayer for mercy
But it won't release your soul
So you try to break away
But it tears down the wall

You can feel it comin' closer
And there's nowhere you can turn
It takes away your freedom
It gets your soul to burn

Cause that's the evil
The evil in you

It chains your soul forever
In a room without a door
And you can feel it's now or never
That you got to join the war

As you raise your hand against it
You can feel the rising force
And you know that you will stand it
As you raise your burning cross

As a lightning cracks the sky
With a shine you've never seen
And the walls of darkness open up
And you stand in between

Cause that's the evil
The evil in you

As a lightning cracks the sky
With a shine you've never seen
And the walls of darkness open up
And you stand in between

Cause that's the evil
The evil in you
