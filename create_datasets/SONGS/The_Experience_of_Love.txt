I know you dream a lot
Holding on to lies
And you wait around
For someone to know where you hide

In your dreams, you feel a lot
But you keep it all inside
And you close your eyes
It helps keep you alive

But the experience of loving
Won't take all the pain away
Just understanding for the first time
What you feel inside, love is in your life
(The experience of love, first time)

And having come this far
Cherishing your dreams
You have realized now
How they help keep you alone

And the experience of loving
Won't take all the pain away
Just understanding for the first time
What you feel inside, love is in your life

(Leave the dreams behind)
Breathing in the scent of love
(Leave the dreams behind)
Sensing life in everything under the sky

And the experience of loving
Won't take all the pain away
Just understanding for the first time
What you feel inside, love is in your life

(The experience of love, under the sky)
Searching forever
(The experience of love, under the sky)
Won't take all the pain away

(The experience of love)
For the first time
(Under the sky)
Love is in your life
(The experience of love)

Take it below, feel the flow
Hold it close, don't let it go
(The experience of love, under the sky)
It won't take all the pain away
(The experience of love)

For the first time
(Under the sky)
When love is in your life
(The experience of love)
For the first time
(Under the sky)

Searching forever
(The experience of love)
For the first time
(Under the sky)
