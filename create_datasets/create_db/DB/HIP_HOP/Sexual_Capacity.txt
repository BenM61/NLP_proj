Girl, I've had some good,
I've had some bad in my days.
I never knew someone like you would come my way.
To tell the truth, I can't help but be a little afraid
I think your love might be a little too much for me.

[Chorus]
Now we can get sexual
Girl, I want to' be down everyday and night (sugar)
Now we can get sexual
Just as long as you know my sexual capacity
Now we can get sexual
I'm die-n'- I'm tryin- I want to' (I'm die-n'- I'm tryin'-ooh.....)
I'm afraid that your lovin might just be a little too much for me.
(Afraid, might be, too much)

....girl
I've paid the dues, I've made the rules all before
I've seen them beg, I made them plead for more
But I've never seen nothing better babe,
I am a little afraid I think your love might be-a little too much for me.
yeah! and I say....

Repeat Chorus
Girl your love might be-a little too much for me. (a little to much)
Girl your love might be, sexual capacity (a little too much)
Girl your love might be-a little too much for me. (a little too much)
Girl your love might be- a little too much-a little too much for me. Yeah!

I want to'- I want to' be down
I want to'- I want to' be down
I want to'- I want to' be down
I want to'- I want to' be down

Repeat Chorus
baby I.....
I want to be with you (wanna' be)
there's nothing I won't do (nothing I won't do-baby)
I said, I want-to be-with you.
Your a little too much, a little too much for me.
there's just somethin' I want to' say to you, baby (I want to' be down...
I just can't handle it. (now we can get sexual.....
no no no no....
Ooh...
