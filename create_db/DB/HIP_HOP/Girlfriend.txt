Ridin' through the city I ain't know that she was with it
She was tryna get with me so I had to get busy
See I met her at the Lennox she was tryna buy some Jimmy's
And it aired like Serena like she had to play tennis, aye
Swervin' on corner like skrrt
She said can I text you I'm like sure
And I got on Gucci like burr

Work at the Blue Flame she doin' tricks up on this pole
