Hey, what the hell was on your mind that day'
I heard the wind outside your father's car
And felt the weight of life

Now, I try to get inside your head somehow
The storm is coming and it might get loud
So listen while you can
I know you care

Roll down the windows, the sun will play along
We'll forget the difference between right and wrong
I feel the summer, the light we grew up with
We'll forget the past dear, and learn to live for this

Hey, remember what I said before the waves
Came crashing down and turned us inside out
The ocean's something else

Will you ever change'
The way you fiddle and you rearrange
The little pieces of your life you keep
So close to your chest
I know you care

Roll down the windows, the sun will play along
We'll forget the difference between right and wrong
I feel the summer, the light we grew up with
We'll forget the past dear, and learn to live for this
