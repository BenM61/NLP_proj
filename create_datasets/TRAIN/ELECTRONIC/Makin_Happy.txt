Makin'happy
(Happy, so happy)
(So happy) ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
(Happy) on a dark street in the back seat of his car
Him and her, where they're goin', they're goin' too far
On the floor by the door of her house
She screams "Ah-ooh", she sounds just like a mouse
Now picture you with me on a lonely beach
We'll see how high we both can reach
Can you hear us all say, ooh-wee
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Why don't you make me happy
Why don't you make me happy
Ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh
(So happy) you see him sing her in the rain in the middle of night
You just couldn't put up, put up a silly fight
You're in the tub, scrub and scrub, ah-ooh-ah
My baby just couldn't miss out on some of that fun
Now picture you with me on a lonely beach
We'll see how high we both can reach
Can you hear us all say, ooh-wee
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Why don't you make me happy
Why don't you make me happy
Ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh
(So happy)
Ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
On a dark street in the back seat of his car
Him and her, where they're goin', they're goin' too far
On the floor by the door of her house
She screams "Ah-ooh" (oh), she screams "Ah-ooh" (oh)
She screams "Ah-ooh" (oh), she screams "Ah-ooh" (oh)
She screams "Ah-ooh", she sounds just like a mouse
Now picture you with me on a lonely beach
We'll see how high we both can reach
Can you hear us all say, ooh-wee
Ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(Happy) just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) why don't you make me happy
(So happy) why don't you make me happy
(So happy) just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) ah ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) why don't you make me happy
