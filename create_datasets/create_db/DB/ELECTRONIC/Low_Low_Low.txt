I'm a member of an ape-like race
At the asshole end of the twentieth century
This film's a thriller of the mind
Will we destroy our homes, release ourselves from the
Weights of gravity?
I'll be amazed if we survive

Low, low, low
This race to space
We'll learn to release ourselves from the weights of gravity
Our highs are higher than our lows
This world's a state of mind
I can hear your thoughts much too clearly
From slime to ape, we'll learn to fly

Low, low, low
Oh, we're so powerful
Watch these giants collide
So individual, will we ever find peace of mind?

Low, low, low
