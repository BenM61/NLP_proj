Out on the road
Late at night
The highway is so inviting
Since you said that we were through
I remember what you told me
I'm trying to drive away these blues

I can do a lot of things
But let me tell you girl
I can't make it by myself, in this great big world
The price I pay for loving you

Deep in my mind
I'm trying to fight
This lonely feeling that I face tonight
Never thought I would lose
I can't shake this awful feeling
I'll never stop loving you

I can do a lot fo things
But let me tell you girl
I can't make it by myself in this great big world
The price I pay for loving you

Do I love her anymore
Or is it loneliness that I feel
Do our hearts still beat as one
Or are we held together by the years
The price I pay for loving you

I'm goin' home
It's started rainin'
Got to find a phone, hope that she's waiting
Gonna say I've been a fool
Put my head back on my shoulder
Take a little time and see things through

I can do a lot fo things
But let me tell you girl
That I can't make it by myself in this great big world
Oh what a price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for loving you
There's a lot of things in this world
I've yet to learn
There's a whole lot of things
