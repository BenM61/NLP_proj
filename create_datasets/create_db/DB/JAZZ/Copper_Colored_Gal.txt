Copper colored gal of mine, 
I love you 'cause you're so divine, 
Say you'll always be my clinging vine, 
Copper, copper, copper, copper colored gal of mine! 

You've done something to my heart, 
You've upset my applecart, 
Tell me, honey, when the moon will shine, 
Copper colored gal of mine! 

Oh, gee, sweet as can be, 
You're aces with me, 
I mean, aces high, 
Me, oh my! 
You know why! 

Come on, honey, name the day, 
The weddin' band is on its way. 
Life with you would always be divine, 
You copper colored gal of mine!
