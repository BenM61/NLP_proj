So what do you do?
Oh yeah I wait tables too
No, I haven't heard your band
'Cause you guys are pretty new
But if you dig
On vegan food
Well come over to my work
I'll have em cook you something that you really love

'Cause I like you

Wait, who's that guy?
Just hangin' at your pad
He's lookin' kinda (bummed)
Yeah, you broke up that's too bad
I guess it's fair
If he always pays the rent
And he doesn't get bent
About sleepin' on the couch when I'm there

'Cause I like you

Just a casual, casual easy thing
If it isn't, it is for me
And I like you

And I feel whoa, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
