The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see
For the moon refused to shine
Couple sitting underneath the willow tree
For love, they pined

Little May was kinda 'fraid of darkness
So she says "I guess I'll go."
Boy began to sigh, looked up to the sky
Told the sky his little tale of woe

So shine on
Shine on harvest moon
Up in the sky

I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July

Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon
So shine on
Shine on harvest moon for me and my gal

Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon
So shine on
Shine on harvest moon for me and my gal
