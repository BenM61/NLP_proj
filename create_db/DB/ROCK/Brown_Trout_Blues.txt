ime rolls the back wheels of my mind
You helped me put the brakes on 'cos you're kind
I wonder where you learned to be so good
I wonder if I'm doing the best I could

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
You wouldn't know me if I was
You'd say I was a stranger just because
You'd say I wasn't weak enough for you
You'd want me just to feel as you do too

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
You shouldn't tell me what to do
I'll only take the brakes off if you do
And roll around like marbles on the floor
Please pick me up and roll me out the door

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but

I guess I'm happy as I am
Sometimes I find it hard to be a man
It easier just to play the same old game
Of trying to forget my bloody name

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
How are you? I'm Mr,
I know what I'm called
It's just you got me
You've got me
You've got me stalled
