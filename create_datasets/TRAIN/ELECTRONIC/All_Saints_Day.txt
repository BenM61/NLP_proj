All very well for saints to have their day
To fly away to prey another day
Down here I'd rather face the fire
than aspire for the heavenly choir
'Cause I've got my faith put in its place
Swept out the light beyond a trace
'Cause I took a look in their book
and there's nothing about this life of mine

For I am willing to believe
Wishing to be strong, fighting on your side
For I am willing to believe
Swimming in your tide, crying your tears
