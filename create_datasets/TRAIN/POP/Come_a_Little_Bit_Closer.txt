In a little cafe
Just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there givin' me looks
That made my mouth water

So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man Jose
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say, yeah

"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"

So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss, so exciting

Then I heard the guitar player say
"Vamos, Jose's on his way"
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah

"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"

Then the music stopped
When I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say
"Man, you know you're in trouble plenty"

So I dropped my drink from my hand
And out through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to Jose, yeah

"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"
