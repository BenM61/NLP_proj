Walking down the highway, traffic's coming my way
All I see are flashing lights
People wearing blue suits wanna know the real truth
How many did I have tonight? 
Looking at the wreckage anyone would guess that all inside had died
But I'm alive

Wake up in a strange place, angels over my head
One of them is shouting clear
Thousand bolts of lightning bring me back to life
And it's a miracle that I'm still here
As I'm coming to, I'm screaming out, I need you by my side
And I'm alive

No, I didn't pray to god
No, I never saw the light
No, I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No, I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just closed my eyes and all I saw was you

No, I didn't pray to god
No, I never saw the light
No, I didn't watch my life go flashing right before my eyes
No, I didn't do the things that they all said that I would do
I just closed my eyes and all I saw was you
