Gunshots fill the air - salute our bliss
Night bursts into flames - greets the final kiss
Death comes without a sound - rings the wedding bell
Target hits the ground - honeymoon in hell

Shot - shot by both sides
In a war that won't cease
They gave their lives
Unheard cry for peace

Cities under siege - where the snipers strike
Lovers out of reach - yearning in the night
Take your lover's hand - meet your destiny
Down in no one's land - for eternity

Crossfire!
