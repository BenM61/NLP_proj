Now you've got to breathe
It's only where your feet fell
People are so cool
Somebody wants you
A lover come back,
I wanna dance like her,
Like nobody's watching
But nobody's watching

Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
Feel real
Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing

Even when you know
Hits you hard,
Leaves slow, comes back fast
When you can't take
You don't swallow your pain
Been around once
It'll be around again

Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
Feel real
Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing

That's the time it took
To calm these things
Better to have been with than live without it
Hold yourself, howl and scream
Finally feel everything joining underneath.

Now you
Now you've got to (breathe)
Now you
Now you've got to
Now to breathe, breathe, now to
Now you've got to
Now to breathe, breathe, now to
Now you've got to
Now you've got to breathe
It's only where your feet fell
People so cool
Somebody wants you
A lover come back,
I wanna dance like her,
Like nobody's watching
But nobody's watching

Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
Feel real
Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing

That's the time it took
To calm these things
Better to have been with than live without it
Hold yourself, howl and scream
Finally feel everything joining underneath.

Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
Feel real
Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
Feel real
Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
Feel real
Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
