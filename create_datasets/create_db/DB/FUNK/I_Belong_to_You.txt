I wouldn't change 
A single thing about you baby 
You shower my world with your love 
You got a way baby 

About cha baby 
That lets me know that 
There's no other man 

You take care of home 
I was lost until I found you 
Refuse to live without you 
As long as you are good to me 

I belong to you 
You belong to me 
I belong to you 
The love we share comes naturally 

I used to think 
I knew love before I met you 
You love my defenses down baby 

I let you in 
To my heart 
And you unlocked true 
Love in me 

I belong to you 
You belong to me 
I belong to you 
The love we share comes naturally 

So hard to find true love baby 
Don't want to live without you 

I know this love is forever 
'Cause it shows in every little thing you do 
Always make a way to see love through 

I belong to you 
You belong to me 
I belong to you 
The love we share comes naturally
