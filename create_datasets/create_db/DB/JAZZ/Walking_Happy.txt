There's a kind o' walk you walk
When the world's undone you,
There's a kind o' walk you walk
When you're walking proud

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When the neighbors shun you
There's a kind o' walk you walk
Sets you 'bove the crowd

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When somebody loves you
That's very much like walking on a cloud

Good fortune found you, chappie
And your lives are happy, Valentine
When you're walking happy
Don't the blooming world seem fine

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When you feel like crowing
There's a kind o' walk you walk
When you're on your way

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When your pride is showing
There's a kind o' walk you walk
Today's your day

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When the world's a rainbow
And you heart is popping like a popping jay

So you had best believe it, chappie
You're finding life is finger snappy
The day you learn that walking happy
Gives the world a shine

So just keep walkin' happy with your hand in mine
With your hand in mine, keep your hand in mine
Love your hand in mine
