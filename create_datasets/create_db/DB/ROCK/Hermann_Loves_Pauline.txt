Hermann Loves Pauline, and Pauline loves Hermann
They made love and gave birth, to a little German
They called him MC squared, cos he raps like no other
An asthma sufferer, like Ernesto Guevara

Too much Monte Kristo number four
(Her and I believe)
Pass the ventolin I need some more
(They had more)
We have ways of making you think
(To do)

We have ways of making you think
(Than simple balancing)
We have ways of making you think
(Two point four family)
We have ways of making you think
(Sanity)
We have ways of making you think
(Personality, a ha ha)
They told me over a drink

They never noticed him at school
They tell me he kept himself to himself
He used to sit and stare up at the ceiling
Hermann loves Pauline
They never noticed him at school
They tell me he suffered poor health
He used to vacantly stare out the window, feeling under

Why do you do
What they tell you?

Marie Curie was Polish born, but French bred
Ha French bread
Of course she ended up dead from radiation
Slow invisible suffocation

Down the twenty- four hour garage, or any service station
I lead my life in a quest for information
Since surrounded by pies and books
Middle-aged drivers and deranged cooks ah ah a

They never noticed her at school
They tell me she kept to herself
She used to sit and stare up at the ceiling

They never noticed her at school

She used to vacantly stare out the window, feeling under
