Brother are you really here?
The package I received is gone
Are you a phantom detective
Can you read my soul backwards?
I will glide with you
If you are a backwards ghost
I will hire you
Brother are you really home
Holy as a blessed worm
Paradise ambassador; bring me to your room
And I will throw you rocks today
"Watch them pass right through" you say
"This is not a game or test
We both have done some grieving'"
Brother with your vast reward
Treasury who can't afford
Surgeries in innocence abounds
And I have read in paper books
My eyes are glands on twisted hooks
Never have I felt or looked
So sorry for you now
Brother are you trained to spy
One eye open, one eye dry?
When I die will you be my neighbor?
Tell me things I'd like to know
Dress it up from head to toe
Let them know to and fro,
From here and tomorrow
Brother are you really here?
The message I received is gone
Are you a phantom detective?
Can you read my soul backwards?
I will glide with you
If you are a backwards ghost
I will hire you
