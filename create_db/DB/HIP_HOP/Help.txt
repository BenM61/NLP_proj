G-Unit
Uh, a one two, a one two
Uh, a one two, a one two
Yeah
Uh, a one two, a one two

Excuse me miss, you must be some kind of a model
Enough to make a shopper run out of the column
Enough to make a weak nigga go mano why mano
Guess what you strong as rum out of the bottle

God bless you when he made me
I mean he blessed me when he made you I got a little game to
They know me everywhere I go that's what fame do
Where we can get it on the low what's your name blue?

You stuck in your ways but I know how to change you
Arrange you tell you things like your my angel
There's no rules when it comes to this, write down your number miss
They call me Banks, my government is Chris

They feel me in the burbs, love me in the bricks
Four inch whips, on a buggy six
First class trips and the bubbly's Cris
I work so hard to live like this

My past make me so weak
But you make me stronger
'Cause everything was upside down
Now I'm right back where I belong

Help, I think Cupid got me
Shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin' my cool
So I'm doin' things I don't do

Yeah, I got it hop in the ride so I could holla
My favorite girl outside of my Impala
I ain't gon' say you a dream I don't gotta
You could walk around in the street with no problems

I pick up all the G that he speaks so don't bother
The innocent role ain't workin' work harder
I ain't tryin' to lock you down I'm no father
But maybe we can go for it if you just listen

It's hard as hell for a man in my position
They pickin' your girl out you gotta know the difference
I wonder if it's even in one in existence
Enough to keep my attention to go the distance

And I'm have to look hard to find a better one
'Cause you sex is a 187 'hon
You get a nigga doin' shit I ain't never done
So now even when I'm on tour I let her come

My past make me so weak
But you make me stronger
'Cause everything was upside down
Now I'm right back where I belong

Help, I think Cupid got me
Shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin' my cool
So I'm doin' things I don't do

You're not the ones like I'm used to
I see us happy in our future
I'm givin' you all I have
My heart, my soul, my laugh

'Cause you are the only thing I need
I could have everything and more
Give you the feelin' you can't ignore

My past make me so weak
But you make me stronger
'Cause everything was upside down
Now I'm right back where I belong

Help, I think Cupid got me
Shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin' my cool
So I'm doin' things I don't do
