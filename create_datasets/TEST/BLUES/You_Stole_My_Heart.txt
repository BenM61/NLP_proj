You stole my heart, my dear
Look what you done with it
You made a wreck of it, sweetheart

You got my lovin', dear
You must be proud of it
You should be kind to it, sweetheart

I would live for you, I would die for you
I am your love divine to hear you say
And mean it dear, that you are only mine

But if you are happy, dear
To break my heart in two
I'll bear this pain for you, sweetheart, yeah

I would live for you and die for you
I'm your love divine to hear you say
And mean it dear, that you are only mine

If you are happy, dear
Breakin' my poor heart in two
I'll bear this pain for you, my sweetheart
