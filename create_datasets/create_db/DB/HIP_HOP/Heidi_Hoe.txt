Hi hoe or bye hoe if you're lookin' for a sucker

Pucker your lips do flipslike Mary Lou 
Just because I fucked you doesn't mean that I'm a marry you 
Bury you I will do after I bill you 
Kill you hoe cause your shit smells like mildew 
Pe ew think you need some soap and a rag 
Or better yet Black, Flag, you scally wag 
Tag, I didn't mean to dis dis, hoe butt 
But you need to stay such, do not touch 
Much disrespect goes out to you 
And your parents, too, for havin you 
Haven't you been introduced to a douche 
I guess you said f*ck footloose, and got pussy loose 
No juice, you shoulda dried up, like a prune-a 
Mister mechanic this place needs a tune up 
For the pink Cadillac cause it's block is off 
And have more use, than a public park 
For recreation, givin' up the body is a hobby 
I'm tellin' Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it) 
Hoe hoe hoe, Merry Christmas

Eni-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-miney-moe 
Careful to catch a tiger, after you catch a tiger 
You can catch a hoe, there's your hoe, kiss a hoe, f*ck a hoe 
Dis a hoe, I'm Peavey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago

Sittin' on the dock of the bay, I say hoe 
Say hoe?! (Hoe!!) Do you know, do you know?

An undercover trick, a toe a tac a tic 
Naked at, frick-a-frat, plus her puddy wat 
Come here k-k-k-k-k-k, yo come here you little puddy cat

You squaw-pie, tack-haired, motherfuckin' jiggaboo 
You can suck a dick or two or three or four or mo' here 
But first get colon eye birds off your forehead 
My nigga Coe said, that you're an around the way girl 
You're fuckin' everybody around the way, 
And then all around the world 
And you still can't find yo' fate 
But you had a couple of babies I mean her butt's like gravy 
The lady is a tramp snake hoe yo and all of that 
F*ck her sixty-nine you get the eighty-six and don't call me back 
Your black ass bunion 
There's a party in your mouth bitch, 
And everybody's comin'
