Secrets (secrets) are no fun
Secrets (secrets) hurt someone
Let me tell ya how it all began 
A little secret got out of hand

I ran into him just by chance
at this party we were talking then we started to dance 
the music bangin' then he leaned in close
my mind is tellin' me that I should go (but I stayed)

in a moment of weakness (a mistake)
but I kept it a secret
Soon enough I found 
Secrets have a way of getting out

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise if you'll just come back to me I swear no secrets, no deciet
I'll be your angel oh so sweet no secrets will I keep

Every night I light a candle
every morning well I say a little prayer
In hopes that when I open my eyes
I will find you standing there 

I confess a crime against our love 
my lonliness is punishment enough
Forgivness is devine 
everyone keeps secrets sometimes

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

Angels in heaven above
I know I sinned against love
Grant me this one miracle
And I'll be a saint from now on

Look in my eyes and it's that that you see it
It's been two weeks since my confession
and still he's not back in my arms
My love for you is the truth cause my heart keeps no secrets
heaven just give me a sign, tell me his heart is still mine

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

Cross my heart
