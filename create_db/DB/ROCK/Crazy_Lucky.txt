There are six and three quarter billion people in this world
And 51 percent of them are girls
You roll your eyes like I'm full of it,
But I Googled that shit
And if the world is four times bigger than the moon
Then tell me, how on Earth did I find you
With just two grains of sand blowing on the beach
Damn that's deep.

It's like faith, God, or The Big Bang
It's just one of them things that you can't explain
And I don't need to know why
Maybe we're crazy crazy lucky,
Maybe we're crazy crazy lucky.
And I'm just one in a billion guys
But the way, the way you love
Has got me feeling crazy crazy lucky
Feeling like oh oh oh
Like we're crazy lucky
There are so many reasons that we shouldn't have met
I could've turned right when you turned left
But the world's got a funny way of stacking the deck
Don't forget
Too much heartache, too many nights
So many coulda, woulda, shoulda but you never tried
I can't figure out if we were meant to be
Or just crazy lucky

It's like faith, God, or The Big Bang
It's just one of them things that you can't explain
And I don't need to know why
Maybe we're crazy crazy lucky,
Maybe we're crazy crazy lucky.
And I'm just one in a billion guys
But the way, the way you love
Has got me feeling crazy crazy lucky
Oh, whoo whoo, hey, whoo ooo hey, crazy crazy

It's like faith, God, or The Big Bang
It's just one of them things that you can't explain
And I don't need to know why
Maybe we're crazy crazy lucky,
Maybe we're crazy crazy lucky.
And I'm just one in a billion guys
But the way, the way you love me
Has got me feeling crazy crazy lucky
But the way, the way you love me
Has got me feeling crazy crazy lucky
Feeling like oh oh oh
Like we're crazy lucky
Crazy lucky
