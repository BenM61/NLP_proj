The sky is red but I can't see the sun
Or the moon
I don't know if there's a storm to come

I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god
I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god

Dogs are barking there's a ghost in the room
He throws the books off the shelves
Turns the lights off too

Priest is standing there he says he knows my god
Priest is standing there he says he knows my, knows my god

But still it shows
Everybody knows
Who gets left behind
Gets blown away by the wind
And washed away by the tide

Ooah waah waah waah

Being dead is not as easy as it looks
You know I can't sit still because these pills that I took
The side effects they get the best of my rage
There's a big red dragon coming out of its cave

I packed up all my things but then I lost my bag
No matter how much I cry I know I'll never get it back
Sorry girl for taking you for a ride
When I just crashed the car and then I left you, yeah I left you inside

But still it shows
Everybody knows
Who gets left behind
Gets blown away by the wind
And washed away by the tide

Ooah waah waah waah

I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god
I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god
I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god
I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god
I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god
I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god
I'm not gonna wait for an oh my god

Ooah waah waah waah
