It has been established throughout this whole western hemisphere 
By I and I the Rastaman, that he is the fullness of this creation
The architecture and builder, the life giver, the keeper of all mankind
Every nation, kindred and town
Must call upon Jah Rastafar

This is outernational
This is outernational

Act, but not to reflect on the act
Victory and and victorious are the same
Seek detachment, fight without desire

Got too many white boys 
Got too many white boys 

Jah Rastafar
Jah Rastafar

DJ a wonder the original sound by the talk of the town
Some boy come like it don't have him own like a dog without bone 
You get me, original Dennis Al Capone who come like a ting from a town, send cross

I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I've got it made

This is outernational
Jah Rastafar

Jah Rastafar
