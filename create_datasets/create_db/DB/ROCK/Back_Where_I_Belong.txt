Take me out of my mind
I once could see but now I'm blind
Too tired to try
And walk away this time
Place yourself in my shoes
You just might see what I got leave
I got it all to loose
I'm such a fool

Let's go
I can't take this
We could be together
Let me taste your kiss
Hold on to my hand
If we get lost I'll take you home
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
I'll go back
Back where I belong

Touch don't look down on me
It's only me and you
To tango it takes two
It's only me and you
I'm such a fool

Let's go
I can't take this
We could be together
Let me taste your kiss
Hold on to my hand
If we get lost I'll take you home
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
I'll go back
Back where I belong

Wasted on my eyes
Feeling just like I feel
Every single night
Everytime like a movie reel
Right back to the start
Right down to where it burns
And you feel my heart

Let's go
I can't take this
We could be together
Let me taste your kiss
Hold on to my hand
If we get lost
I'll take you home
And I'll go back

Let's go
I can't take this
We could be together
Let me taste your kiss
Hold on to my hand
If we get lost
I'll take you home
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
And I'll go back (I'll go back,I'll go back, I'll go back, I'll go back)
Back where I belong
And I'll go back
Back where I belong
