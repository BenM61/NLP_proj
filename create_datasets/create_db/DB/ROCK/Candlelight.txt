I am alone, surrounded by
The color blue
Inside a poem, the only 
Words I ever knew
Washing my hands, of the 
Many years untold
For now I am banned, 
My future is to unfold 

[Chorus]
Would you take my 
Candlelight
Would you take my 
Candlelight, and oh
Would you take 
My candlelight
Away from me 

I am blind
My eyes
Covered
From 
The 
Outside

For I have lied, 
Now all there is left 
For me to do is hide
Take in a deep breath, 
And I lift my head
For I am a new man
And I arise from my bed 

[Chorus: x2]

This is all there is, 
I can see that now
But I have to be careful with it, 
Now it's been found
So fragile, but powerful, 
Yeah this is the light
Light of my destiny stay with me, 
Through every night

[Chorus]

Would you take my
Candlelight
Would you take my 
Candlelight
Would you take
My candlelight
Away, away from me.
