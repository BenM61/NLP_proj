Lessons learned, and bridges burned to the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire tables turned
And I'm the one who's burning now well I'm doing all right
Till I close my eyes and then I see your face and it's no surprise

Just like that I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would yeah
Swallow my pride now I'm crawling back to you
I'm out of my head can't wait any longer
I'm down on my knees I thought I was stronger
Just like that just like you said I'd do
I'm crawling back to you

Time can heal, but the scars only hide the way you feel
And it's hard to forget how I left you hanging
On by a thread, everything I said
I regret it yeah I was doin' all right
Thought I could make it then I see your face and
It's hard to fake it

And just like that I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would yeah
Swallow my pride I'm crawling back to you
I'm out of my head can't wait any longer
I'm down on my knees I thought I was stronger
Just like that like you said I'd do
Yeah I'm crawling back to you

You could find a way to forgive everything I know you would
And I would take it all back if only I knew that I could.
Lessons learned and bridges burned to the ground
And it's to late now to put out the fire.

And just like that I'm crawling back to you
