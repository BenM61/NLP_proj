My heart is sad and lonely 
For you I sigh, for you dear only 
Why haven't you seen it 
I'm all for you body and soul 
I spend my days in longin' 
And wondering why it's me you're (ogling) 

I tell you I mean it 
I'm all for you body and soul 
I can't believe it 
It's hard to conceive it 
That you turn away romance 
Are you pretending 
It looks like the ending 
And less I could have one more chance to prove, dear 

My life a wreck you're making 
You know I'm yours for just the taking 
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul 
My life a wreck you're making 
You know I'm yours for just the taking 
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
