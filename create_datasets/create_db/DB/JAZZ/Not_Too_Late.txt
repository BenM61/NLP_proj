Tell me how you've been
Tell me what you've seen
And tell me that you'd like to see me too

'Cause my heart is full of no blood
And my cup is full of no love
I couldn't take another sip even if I wanted

But it's not too late, hmm
It's not too late for love

My lungs are out of air
And yours are holding smoke
And it's been like that now for so long

And I've seen people try to change
And I know it isn't easy
But nothin' worth the time ever really is

And it's not too late, ooh
It's not too late for love
For love
For love
For love
