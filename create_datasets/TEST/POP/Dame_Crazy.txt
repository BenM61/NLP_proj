Dame crazy, you're always telling me that I'm dame crazy
Though I'm an eager beaver, I know you know me
Like a book, all I ever do is look

Dame happy, my claim to fame is that
I became happy, it took a day to do it
But don't get jealous

I know you know who
Yes, the one dame I'm crazy about is you
I know you know me
Like a book, all I ever do is look

Dame happy, my claim to fame is that
I became happy, it took a day to do it
But don't get jealous

I know you know who
Yes, the one dame I'm crazy about, silly about, goofy about
The one dame I'm crazy about is you
