You know that sleep is getting hard to get
'Cause you never know what you'll forget
And I've got to know of all the news
'Cause one day there'll be news for me
I never let a headline by
'Cause every one will catch my eye
And though it's tough to keep alert
You never know what could hurt me
But it gets me down
You know it gets me down
It really gets me down
Yes it gets me down
Info Freako, 
There is no end to what I want to know
There's what you feel 
And what you know
And it wasn't all that long ago
I found that Info Freako thing 
Now nothing ever gets to me
But it gets me down...
Info Freako, 
There is no end to what I want to know
But it means I'll have the edge over you
And it means I'll always have the edge over you
And you know there's nothing that you can do
Info Freako,
There is no end to what I want to know
