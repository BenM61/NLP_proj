So I picked one up the other day
does that mean I'm a bad girl?
And if i take of all my clothes?
Well that makes me a bad girl

What if life itself goes to shit?
now that I've been pushed around
Well tell me something I don't know
'Cause I've held off way too long now

And its not the way you hold me,
hold me responsible
I'm not who you think I am
Have I fooled the whole world?
Nobody knows
I'm a very, very bad girl
(Yeah I'm a bad girl)

So I wrote this song for sanity
And it tells me I'm naive
But if he heard this melody
He'd see all over me

And it's not the way you hold me
Hold me responsible
I'm not who you think I am
Have I fooled the whole world?
Nobody knows (no oh) nobody knows
I'm a very, very bad girl
(Oh I'm a bad girl)

And its not the way you hold me,
Hold me responsible
I'm not who you think I am
Have I fooled the whole world?
Nobody knows, (no oh) nobody knows

Well there's no point in you believing,
I'm a saint when I'm deceiving
Everybody thinks I'm someone else

I'm a very, very bad girl
Oh I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a very, very bad girl
