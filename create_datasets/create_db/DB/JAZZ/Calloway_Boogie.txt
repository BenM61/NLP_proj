Here's a little tune, we're gonna play it for you
T'ain't nothin' to it and it's easy to do
Called the Calloway Boogie
It's the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day

If you like music with a boogie beat
Here's a little ditty that's really all reet
It's the Calloway Boogie
It's the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day

I woke up with the blues the other day
The cats started jamming and they blew 'em away
With the Calloway Boogie
The Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day

We play waltzes, bebop and jive
But here's the kind of music that keeps you alive
It's the Calloway Boogie
It's the Calloway Boogie
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day

If you like boogie with some hi-de-ho
Just listen to me, here's the way it goes
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi (hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi)
Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho (ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho)
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day
