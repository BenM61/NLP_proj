Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.
