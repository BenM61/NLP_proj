As we dwell inside the safe zones that we've made
Where nothing but earthly pleasures seem to matter
The only light we see is from the screens
No will to feel or explore the forgotten dimensions

Some day we'll catch a glimpse of eternity
As the world stands still, for a moment
And I guess we will be making history
When we all join hands just to watch the sky
(For a moment...)

Our selfish lives have made us all go blind
One day we'll awake by a bright light on the horizon
In one second every eye will see the same
And this blinding light will draw all our attention

Some day we'll catch a glimpse of eternity
As the world stands still, for a moment
For the very first time and it's meant to be
We'll forget about ourselves and share the moment
(For a moment...)
