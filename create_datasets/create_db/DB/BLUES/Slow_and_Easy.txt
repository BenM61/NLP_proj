Slow and easy, babe, that's how I like my love
Nice and pleasin', oh, it's really wonderful
Movin' gently, hey, it's so good to me, yes, it is
Move in simply and then let it build up gradually, baby
Takin' time with love just makes it better
So let's relax and reach our ecstasy together
But let's do it slow and easy, baby
Keep it like that, baby, that's how I like my love

I like it slow and pleasin', oh, it's really, really, really good to me
Hurried love is like a good meal down the way
It's up and gone before you really get to taste
Let's do it slow and easy babe, that's how I like my love
Slow and easy, now

No need to rush our love 'coz it ain't goin' nowhere
So let's enjoy this time, the time we both have to share
We've got to take it slow and easy, baby, that's how I like my love
I like it when you're movin' simply, oh, that's how I like my love

I like it slow and easy, baby, take your time, baby
Slow and easy now, no need to rush, baby
I like it slow, slow and easy, I said I like it slow and easy, baby
Take your time, baby, there's no need to rush, baby
