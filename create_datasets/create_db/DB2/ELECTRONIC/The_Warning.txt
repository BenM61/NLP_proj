Excuse me sir, I'm lost I'm looking for a place where I can get lost
I'm looking for a home for my malfunctioning being
I'm looking for the mechanical music museum 

This is a warning I'll spell it out for you, for you
This is a warning I'll spell it out for you

Excuse me miss I'm a dog on heat
I'm a complicated being with love songs to beat
I'm a problem solving baby who could march all night
I'm a mechanical music man and I'm starting a fire

Hot Chip with break your legs, snap off your head
Hot Chip will put you down, under the ground

Excuse me child, I am trying to see all the colors and wonder your brightness can be
Return to nothingness and joy just might be right
But prepare yourself for a mechanical fright

This is a warning I'll spell it out for you, for you
This is a warning I'll spell it out for you, for you

Hot chip will break your legs, snap off your head
Hot chip will put you down, under the ground
Hot chip will break your legs, snap off your head
Hot chip will put you down, under the ground

Excuse me son, I'm found I'm looking for a place where I was once found
There's nothing in a world where the melody is broken
There's always some way to make the silence be spoken

Hot chip will break your legs, snap off your head
Hot chip will put you down, under the ground
Hot chip will break your legs snap, off your head
Hot chip will put you down, under the ground
