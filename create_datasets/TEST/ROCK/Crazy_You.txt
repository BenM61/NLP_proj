Oh crazy you
What am I supposed to do?
Heaven knows I tried to change you
But you just keep getting stranger
I say

Oh crazy you
What the hell's got air to you?
While you're trying to impress me
With your plastic fear injectors

Crazy you
I'm driving in my car
Every light I see is a star
And it makes me feel so happy, what's wrong?

I'm rebelled in sway in time
And the street light's calling my name
And the goldfish keep on singing King Kong

Oh crazy you
Where's the life that we once knew?
With your anger and your madness
All your laugh reveals your sadness
I say

Oh crazy you
Was it all a game to you?
All the friends you left behind you
They're all still there to remind you
Crazy you

Don't beg me 
I don't want to 
I don't want to

Oh crazy you
What am I supposed to do?
Heaven knows I tried to change you
But you just keep getting stranger
I say

Oh crazy you
Where's the life that we once knew?
While the world outside is madness
We can drive away the sadness
Crazy you

I thought that I knew you
But now I see right through you

Don't beg me, I don't want to
Don't beg me, do what you do
Don't beg me, I don't want to
Don't beg me, do what you do
Don't beg me, I don't want to
Don't beg me, do what you do
Don't beg me, I don't want to
Don't beg me, do what you do
