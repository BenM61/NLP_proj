Swallowing it all down whole I'm in my body
So they cannot come and take my soul
Wallowing away my sorrows on nobody
So they cannot come and take my soul

If any palaver needs some honesty
(Honestidade)
Or any disaster needs a remedy
(Desastre)
I go to you, you come to me
And that's just the way it's gonna' have to be

You said we wouldn't do it no more
Should I make my way out the door?
We've made this mistake before
Now it's sinking us to the core
