Better luck next time?
That could never be,
Because there ain't gonna be no next time for me,
No sirree!
Made up my mind to make another start,
I've made my mind up but I can't make up my heart.

I'd like a new lucky day, that would be nice,
But this comes just once in a lifetime, not twice,
So don't say, "Better luck next time", that could never be,
Because there ain't gonna be no next time for me.

So don't say, "Better luck next time", that could never be,
