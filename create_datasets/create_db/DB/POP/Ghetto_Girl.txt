Stay at home now
That little girl was born on the ghetto side of town
She knows every trick in the book and she certainly gets around
She's been with many men since she was only ten
She never stay at home she 's always on the town

Your mamma is wondering where you are
What do you see at night when you're under the stars

Stay at home
Sister stay at home
Don't let your mamma down
Don't be a run around

Stay at home
Sister stay at home
Don't let your mother down
Don't be a run around
Stay at home now

Your mamma is wondering where you are
What do you see at night when you're under the stars
Baby keep on running and you won't get far
You like to travel with all those movie stars
You like a hangin' in the big long shiny cars

Sister stay at home
Don't let your mamma down no no no no
