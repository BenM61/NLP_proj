A prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell
Oh yes I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion
Should I, should I

You better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
You better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good

I think it's also right
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case
Yes I know you keep telling me that you love me
And I really do want to believe
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith
Oh sure babe, anything to please you

But, you better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
You better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good
Good to me

Be good to me

And I really don't see
Why it's so hard to be good to me
You know, I don't understand
What's your plan that you can't be good to me
What I can't feel I surely cannot see
Why can't you be good to me
And if it's not real I do not wish to see
Why can't you be good to me
Why can't you be good to me
Why can't you be good to me
Why can't you be good to me
Why can't you be good to me
Why can't you be good to me
Be good
Be good to me

'Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
'Cause I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
So, you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good
Better be good to me
Better be good
'Cause I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
And I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
Be good to me
Be good
Be good to me
'Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
You better be good to me
Better be
Good to me
Be good
Be good to me
