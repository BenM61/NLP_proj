(Dumb it down)
Coolest, what
(Dumb it down)
FNF up
(Dumb it down)
(Dumb it down)

I'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless
Which means I'm tearless
Which means my iris resides where my ears is

Which means I'm blinded
But I?mma find it I can feel its nearness
But I?mma veer so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer

But I remember I'm not a listener or a seer
So my windshields smear
Here, you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness

The windshield is minstreled, the whole grill is road kill
So trill and so sincere, yea I'm both them there
Took both pills when a bloke in a trench coat
And the locs in a chair had approached him here

Made it clear as a ghost so a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes that they living
Riverton is rosey, pockets full of poseys
Given to the mother of the deceased awaken at war
'Till I'm resting in peace

You going over heads Lu
(Dumb it down)
They telling me that they don't feel you
(Dumb it down)
We ain't graduate from school
(Dumb it down)
Them big words ain't cool
(Dumb it down)

Yea I heard "mean and vicious"
(Dumb it down)
Make a song for the *****
(Dumb it down)
We don't care about the weather
(Dumb it down)
You'll sell more records if you
(Dumb it down)

And I'm mouthless which means I'm soundless
Now as far as the hearing now I found it
It was as far as the distance from an earing to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear of a stewardess in the Lear

She fine and she flying I feel I'm flying by 'cause my mind?s on cloud nine
And in her mind and at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the underground king
Who's also Klingon to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks but I Spinks like Leon

Or lion in the desert, I'm flying on Pegasus, you flying on a pheasant
Rider of the white powder, picker of the fire flower
Spit hot fire like Dylan on Chappelle skit
Yea, smell it on my unicorn, don't snort the white horse
But toot my own horn

You been shedding too much light Lu
(Dumb it down)
You're makin' 'em wanna do right Lu
(Dumb it down)
They're getting self esteem Lu
(Dumb it down)
These girls are tryna be queens Lu
(Dumb it down)

They're tryna graduate from school Lu
(Dumb it down)
They're starting to think that smart is cool Lu
(Dumb it down)
They're tryna get up out the hood Lu
(Dumb it down)
I don't tell you what you should do
(Dumb it down)

And I'm brainless which means I'm headless like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplayless sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang a chain with

Which makes me necklace less like a necklace theft
And I ain't use my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best fair FF jet in the nest

Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even scuba Steve will find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues, my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas

Westside Poseidon, Westside beside him
Chest high and rising almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make you flowered
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves

David Blaine, make it rain, make a boat, I make a plane
Then I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside

You be putting me to sleep
(Dumb it down)
That's why you ain't poppin' in the streets
(Dumb it down)
You ain't winning no awards
(Dumb it down)
Robots and skateboards?
(Dumb it down)

GQ man of the year G?
(Dumb it down)
Ain't rocking over here be
(Dumb it down)
Why don't you talk about your cars?
(Dumb it down)
And what the f*** is 'go yard'?
(Dumb it down)

Make it rain for the chicks
(Dumb it down)
Pour champagne on a *****
(Dumb it down)
What the f*** is wrong with you?
(Dumb it down)
How can I get on a song with you?
(Dumb it down)

Look be, here's my math, my 2way, uh
What's, uh, here take this, stay right there
What my boys talking about
You hot for me, I like you

Listen G they tell me I should come down cousin
But I flatly refused I ain't dumb down nothing
