 took a room in a house of gloom 
Somewhere I could hide my soul 
There I hoped to find a way to ease my mind 
Couldn't face the gloom tomorrow 

I sat until the hours of three or four 
Thinking doesn't help but seems 
I crept to bed and cried myself to sleep once more 
Then I had the wildest dream 

(Street called Hope) in a town named Freedom 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love 
Upon a street called Hope at the house of Welcome 
That's where she opened the door of love 

When I awoke the following day 
Every doubt had left my mind 
My dream it taught me what the prophets say 
Those who seek will always find 

I ran down the stair and out in to the street 
Looking for the nearest phone 
We both said sorry and decided to meet 
To find ourselves a happy home 

You know we're looking for a street called Hope 
In a town name Freedom 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love 
Upon a street called Hope at the house of Welcome 
That's where she opened the door of love
