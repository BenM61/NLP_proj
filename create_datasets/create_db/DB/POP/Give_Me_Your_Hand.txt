Give me your hand let me be ever near
And let us wonder together through the years.
Give me your fate, I vow that I'll be true 
No doubt must ever touch my love for you!

Give me your heart to cherish tenderly,
No greater gift than this could ever be.
Give me your love and make my life divine
God make this day, at last your love is mine!

Give me your love and make my life divine
God make this day . . . 
At last your love is mine!
Words and Music by Dorothy Stewart, 1949
