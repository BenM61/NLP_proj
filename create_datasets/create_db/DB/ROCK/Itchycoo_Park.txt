Over bridge of sighs
To rest my eyes in shades of green

Under dreaming spires
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been

(What did you do there?) I got high
(What did you feel there?) well, I cried
(But why the tears there?) tell you why
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful

I feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun

I'll tell you what I'll do (what will you do?) I'd like to go there now with you
You can miss out school (won't that be cool?) why go to learn the words of fools?

(What will we do there?) we'll get high
(What will we touch there?) we'll touch the sky
(But why the tears there?) I'll tell you why
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful

I feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, hah

It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful
