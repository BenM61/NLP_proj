A thrill a moment, holding hands 
A thrill a moment, making plans 
& as I look into your eyes 
I see paradise & holidays 
& 1000 lovely ways to spend 
A thrill a moment 

A thrill a moment each time you speak 
A thrill a moment, words sound so sweet 
& as the words just fill my heart 
Within my heart, you ring a bell 
That sways & tells how swell it is to spend 
A thrill a moment 

Love, exciting you are 
Hey love, inviting you are 
So wrong, so rare, how sweet, how fair, just a... 

Thrill a moment, just loving you 
Each precious moment I find a new 
Delicious, delightful desire 
To hold you close & leave you never 
& spend a life of love with you forever
