Ay, two mansions in the Hamptons
Money longer than the Ave'
Thirty cars on the alley
Thirty mill's in the valley
Came from the bottom, watch what I do
You bunch of internet thugs, Yahoo
You got a buzz, I'm the whole field
Ask your bitch, I'm a dope deal
Try to book me for my watch
I'll book 'em for a show, let his mama watch
Call the coroner and call the pastor
And grab a casket, my chest christens in the laughter
Talk about New York, big mistake
Got the bank and I ain't fit (that's a stash)
Bet a mill' and I ain't riggin'
On the large, get a Minaj, ain't Nicki

I slap her ass then I dab

Runnin' through New York with a strap (that's a fact)
'Cause we comin' for they head, not they chaps (that's a fact)
Zack runnin' through a chap
Bub runnin' through a chap
Killer runnin' through a chap (that's my nigga)
Hank runnin' through a chap (that's my nigga)
Mitch runnin' through a chap (that's my nigga)
Y'all wonder what it's at
I know I see Max one day
R.I.P Chinx, gun play
Make you backflip, like the front brake
Finna rule, live someday
Chop a bubble like bath water
See the red dots like a camcorder
F*ck on a jet, that's air hoe
Came with the TEC, air hose
