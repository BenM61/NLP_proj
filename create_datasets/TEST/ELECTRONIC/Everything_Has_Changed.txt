It's the groove that makes you wonder 
I mean the beat and the bass like thunder 
I make you sweat 
I make you wet 
This is my mission that I got to get 
That's great 
Like boom boom boom 
Bring the sound and the noise to the room 
Get on the floor now don't be lazy 
Get on the floor now lets go crazy 

People in the place let's talk about 
So get on the floor and turn it out 
Everything that change it goes round'n'round 
You lose control when you hear my sound 
Everything that change it goes up'n'down 
To the rhythm of the night and to the ground 
Dance in the house and you won't let go 
Like a symphony 
In stereo-ere-o 

Everything has changed since you've been gone forever 
All I want is you to be my side 
Everything has changed since you've been gone forever 
All I want is you to be my side 
Feel the heat 
I'm burning deep inside and 
Feel the beat 
Of my heart 
Feel the heat 
I'm burning deep inside and 
Feel the heat 
I know that everything has changed 

People everywhere shake their hair 
Shake it in the air oh yeah 
Ts music from my mind 
And the bass will let it shine 
You got no time to realize my rhyme 
The lyrics are fine 
What's mine is mine 
Let it shine like a sign 
Sign of the time when you're feeling fine 

People in the place lets talk about 
So get on the floor and turn it out 
Everything that change it goes round'n'round 
You lose control when you hear my sound 
Everything that change it goes up'n'down 
To the rhythm of the night and to the ground 
Dance in the house and you won't let go 
Like a symphony 
In stereo-ere-o
