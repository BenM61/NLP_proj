You got it (baby)
You got it (uh-huh)

Her name was Kim, this light skinned girl from Shaolin
Stood by my side when my world was caved in
She cooked for me, fix me up, plus made me happy
Every time she told me she loved me, I said "no" back
Since I was fucked up in the game, migraines
No honey in pockets, all I had was the change
Forty-five feelings, they got the beef
I through the heat to my dome
She said "If you shoot, you ain't the real Pretty Tone"
Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong
Our bond is even more stronger when the night is gone
Say, "Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water running
Baby, oiled down, pots in the oven"
And my lovin'? It's gone when they style old fashion
And, a, don't worry bout that jam, you gonna smash 'em
Whose asking, your still has come
Stay focused, keep it cool, you know I love you
Love you too, babe, thank you

(you out there) you got it (louder)

The more I drowned, the more down he went
As if to say, them other chicks wasn't meant
When she came through, by every square inch possible
Help the kid get on out, every obstacle
Long talks at night, arguments and still try'nna solve
Whether who is right, we mad tight
And the way she, never call the cops on a nigga
Got me, open, even more on her with her bangin' body
My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don't ever stop
Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get's me very hot
Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure
Every time you put it on me, I fiend for more
Think that's the reason why, can't leave, can't lie
Look you dead in the eye
Word to f*ck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest
I'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I'mma bring you to Vegas

You got it
I was down in the sea of love
Going down to a clear cloud
You came and saved me dear (saved me) (Ghostface!)
It's too bad you didn't do it, I ain't never been used to it
The way we stopped them, dear (stopped them dear)

To all the ladies who love they man
Though they f*ck up, and you still let them back in
Make some noise if you cook and you clean for 'em
Out of love, doing juks for them
To all my ladies who love a girl with good brains on 'em
Baggin' to get your name tattooed on 'em
Kiss 'em in the morning, hold 'em, definitely show 'em
We got our crab down, packed when it's time to mold 'em

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh,
(you out there) you got it (louder)
I was down, thank you
