This house is a holy house
Always under construction
People come in
Looking for truth
Or just their own reflection
Depending on what they find
They pat my back or they speak their mind
I want to live in a simple house
I want to live
In a simple house

[CHORUS:]
I want to live in a simple house
I want to live
I want to live in a simple house
I want to live in a simple house

This house looks the best
When it's not cluttered with opinions
When only the words from the Landlord's mouth
Have absolute dominion
From His lips, His lips alone
I want to furnish my humble home
I want to live in a simple house
I want to live

[CHORUS:(2X)]

I want wisdom in the walls
Understanding will weatherproof
I want love to be the theme
From the basement to the roof
Not enough room for second hand news
Can't build this house on human how to's
I want to see His touch in every room
I want to know this house is built in truth
I want to live in a simple house
I want to live

[CHORUS:]
(repeat chorus and fade)
