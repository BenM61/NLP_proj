There's a mist over Broadway
Breathing cool sheets of rain
Lights his last cigarette and
Turns his back to the wind

She says baby I don't know
Just how to explain
And I can't see the sense
And I can't play this game
But he's not even listening
He stares at the ground
And she won't ever know
What was on his mind

Well now he's a rebel without a cause
Hey c'mon let's make a deal
See your name in lights just like Jimmy Dean
Live and die behind the wheel

Opened out on the highway
Leaving her far behind
There's a star down on sunset
He says yeah this one's mine

She says baby I don't know
Just how to explain
And I can't see the sense
And I can't play this game
But he's not even listening
He stares at the ground
And she won't ever know
What was on his mind

Well now he's a rebel without a cause
Hey c'mon let's make a deal
See your name in lights just like Jimmy Dean
Live and die behind the wheel
Well now Mr D whispered in his ear
Hey c'mon let's make a deal
Engines running hot singing Jimmy Dean
Any time there's time to kill

He drove like a demon
And he burned up the screen
But he never looked back no
She just wasted my time

Well now he's a rebel without a cause
Hey c'mon let's make a deal
See your name in lights just like Jimmy Dean
Live and die behind the wheel
Gonna let those horses loose again
Hey c'mon let's make a deal
See them running wild just like Jimmy Dean
Overdrive in chrome and steel
Hey c'mon
Hey c'mon let's make a deal
Well now he's a rebel without a cause
Live and die behind the wheel
