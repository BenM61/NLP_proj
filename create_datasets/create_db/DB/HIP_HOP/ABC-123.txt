See, there comes a time in every 
Man's life when he's got to fall in love, 
And he's got to find the right woman, 
And I think I found it in you 

Woke up this morning to breakfast in bed 
The coffee was hot 
Them eggs I got was right, so right 

Girl I gotta tell you, you're just too good for me 
Oh, the things that you do makes it easy lovin' you, 
Even a blind man can see. 

Every night I get own on my knees 
And give thanks for you 
And the things that you do, 
Cause only a fool would let go of you. 

Lovin' you is so easy for me to do 
It's like ABC-123 
I'm lovin' you, girl 
Just keep lovin' me 

Drivin' in my car I see somethin'
That will look good on you 
Said I can't ignore it 
But Hell, I can't afford it 
What's a simple man like me to do 

If you should ever leave me 
I'd go out of my mind 
Cause I want you, and I need you 
I don't want to be wastin my time 

Every night, I get down on my knees, 
And give thanks for you, 
The things that you do, 
'Cause only a fool would let go of you 

Lovin' you is so easy for me to do 
It's like ABC-123 
I'm lovin you, girl 
Just keep lovin me 

From the bottom of my heart
It's like ABC, simple as 123

Said I feel some love comin on 
Said I can feel it 
Way down deep in my bones 

I want to shout it out loud 
From the mountin tops 
Said I got to let you know 
That I'm never gonna let you go 

Together, Together, oh, baby

Want to give you my love 
Want to give you my time 
Then I want to keep comin'
I want to make you mine 

Yeah, yeah, baby girl 
Baby girl,
Don't want to stop lovin you 
That's all I ever want to do 

I love you 
I give you all my lovin' baby 
It's so easy for me
I'm lovin' you 
So just keep lovin' me
