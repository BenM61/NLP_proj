When we first collided
The timing wasn't right
I showed you the signs
You disappeared into the shadows
Now you're back again
Telling me you do
You do

Don't you recognize a fellow astronaut?
We've been here before
Our movements are elliptical
And when you move towards me
You make me lose my cool
It's cruel

I've been to the moon, don't tempt me
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
And now it's your turn to go for me too

Your words are sparkling
Like the galaxy
It's not enough for me
If you're really mad about me
Show me something real
Prove to me you're true, oh, do

I've been to the moon don't tempt me
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
And now it's your turn to go for me too

So help me, what's the golden rule?
Somebody better let me know
What's a girl to do?
Gone too far, can't hide my heart
Why don't you just show me what to do?
Oh, I love you, I want you
It's such a long way up to the moon
I've been to the moon and the stars for you
Now it's your turn, prove it

I've been to the moon don't tempt me
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
And now it's your turn to go for me too

I've been to the moon so gently
I've been where you are, God help me
I've been to the moon and stars for you
When I was yours just to prove that you're true
