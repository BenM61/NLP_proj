I'll wait a little longer
We're weak and getting stronger
I know it's taking the time to heal
We'll be unstoppable
Don't know what I did it for
I needed to know that it was always real

My head's held high when we walk down the line, honey
Arm-in-arm through the clear night sky
Let's be at peace, we'll fly
Our hearts collide
Can't escape the magnetic side

I was like a satellite spinning away
Almost lost forever and leaving no trace
Floating through the darkest reaches of space
To another galaxy
Our polarity shifted around
There is nothing else left holding us down
But it's just gravitational
We are unstoppable
I just can't escape the pull
We are unstoppable
It's just gravitational
We are unstoppable

Our head's held high when we walk down the line, honey
Arm-in-arm through the clear night sky
Let's be at peace, we'll fly
Our hearts collide
Can't escape the magnetic side

I was like a satellite spinning away
Almost lost forever and leaving no trace
Floating through the darkest reaches of space
To another galaxy
Our polarity shifted around
There is nothing else left holding us down
But it's just gravitational
We are unstoppable
I just can't escape the pull
We are unstoppable
It's just gravitational
We are unstoppable
The stars will guide the way
In the dead of space
You will be my one and only

We are unstoppable
Oh, oh, oh!

The stars will guide the way
In the dead of space
You will be my one and only
