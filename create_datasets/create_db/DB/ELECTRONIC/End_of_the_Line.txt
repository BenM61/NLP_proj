My gun is pumping you're down on your knees
A closer step to death
I think I'm coming, are you ready to receive?
I spray you full with my killer disease

I'll come inside, I'll break you down
Your end of your life
I'll steal your soul, I'm in control
I just made you mine

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
How could this be

Face the enemy and meet reality
How could you be so blind
Now you're tasting death it controls your mind
Suffering years ahead

I came inside, I have broke you down
I ended your life
I stole your soul, I was in control
And I made you mine

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
It's not what it supposed to be

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
How could this be

How could you be so tough?

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
It's not what it supposed to be

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
How could this be

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
It's not what it supposed to be

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
How could this be
