As a young boy daddy used to tell me stories
Do your thing my son the world is yours
The winds of fury will lead to paths of glory
Take it in your stride my son the world is yours

You can only find the gold by digging in the dirt
If your gonna play with fire,then you're gonna get burnt
You can never reach the heights and avoid the hurt yeah
The world is yours

As a young boy daddy used to tell me stories
Do your thing and sing the world is yours
The winds of fury pave the way to paths of glory
Keep your self onside ny son and the world is yours

Yeah you might have it all but you'll still want more
There's a law for the rich and another for the poor
There's a golden key unlock all the doors
And the world is yours

The world is yours
The world is yours,the world is yours

There's a time and a place for everything
Not a man alive you owe a thing
From the stars in the sky to the ocean floor the world is yours

The world is yours
The world is yours, the world is yours

People say they're never gonna turn away
And then when it comes on top
They'll be first to turn their backs away
First whose heads are gonna drop

First to slowly fade away
So remember all your days the world is yours and all the world contains

Well you might have it all but you'll still want more
There's a law for the rich and another for the poor
There's a golden key unlocks all the doors
And the world is yours, the world is yours
The world is yours, the world is yours
