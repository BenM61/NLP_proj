Just close your eyes
We're gonna run this light
We live our lives
Yeah, we're not wasting time
Baby, we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
We're not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

Is it wrong to rock the booze?
We gotta strike a match and light the fuse
Now I'm never looking back
It's time to leave the future with the past

I said it doesn't matter where I go
I am calling all the poets in the battle
I am shouting to the world
Let them know that we won't
Be afraid to step into the fight
When you can't see the light

So close your eyes
We're gonna run this light
We live our lives
Yeah, we're not wasting time
Baby, we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
We're not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

But if you're down I'ma soldier up
You better learn to shoot or learn to duck
There's no retreat and no escape
If we keep dreaming while we're wide awake â€ƒ

I said it doesn't matter where I go
I am calling all the prophets into the battle
I am never going to change who I am
I won't bend under the pressure
When my back's on the ropes
I said it doesn't matter where I go
I am staring down the barrel of a gun
We are shouting to the world
Let them know that we are
Not afraid to step into the fight
When we can't see the light

So close your eyes
We're gonna run this light
We live our lives
Yeah, we're not wasting time
Baby, we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
We're not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money

Well it's a silicone rush
And I'm addicted
I don't understand it
The winner starts kill switch
Saying what I want to
The pleasure comes with pain too
Mostly it's another fight
When it's slowly coming after you

So close your eyes
We're gonna run this light
We live our lives
Yeah, we're not wasting time
Baby, we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get
Get what we can
We're not doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
Doing it for the money
