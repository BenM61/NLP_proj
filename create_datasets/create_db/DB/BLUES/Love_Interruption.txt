I want love to, roll me over slowly
Stick a knife inside me, and twist it all around.

I want love to, grab my fingers gently
Slam them in a doorway, put my face into the ground.

I want love to, murder my own mother and
Take her off to somewhere like hell or up above.

I want love to change my friends to enemies,
Change my friends to enemies and show me how it's all my fault.

I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
Yeah I won't let love disrupt, corrupt, or interrupt me anymore.

I want love to, walk right up and bite me
Grab a hold of me and fight me leave me dying on the ground.

And I want love to, split my mouth wide open and
Cover up my ears and never let me hear a sound.

I want love to, forget that you offended me
Or how you have defended me when everybody tore me down.

Yeah I want love to change my friends to enemies,
Change my friends to enemies and show me how it's all my fault.

Yeah I wont let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt, or interrupt me anymore.
