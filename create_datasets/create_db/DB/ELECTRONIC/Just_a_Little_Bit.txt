Woke up too early this morning
Shaken by a dream I had when I was in danger of losin' you
And I made up my mind
I was gonna tell you when you opened your eyes I thought it through

Wanna be someone
Better than the one who wasn't there when you needed her
Someone who
Wants you, needs you, someone who'd never leave you

[Chorus:]
My almost was not enough
Never sacrificed too much
I'm ready to give
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

(Moooore)

'Cause I was so busy driving
I didn't see the road ahead or where I was going, ignored the signs
Why didn't somebody tell me
The one that I was looking for was there all the time - I was blind

It took a bad dream to show me
Without you there how it would be I realized
I want you, I need you
And baby I'll never leave you

[Chorus]

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

When you wake up
I'll be different
I don't know how I'm gonna find the right words to say
I'll have a whole lot more to give than I did yesterday (just a little bit)

(Moooooore)
(just a little bit)
Yesterday
(just a little bit)

[Chorus]

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

[Chorus]

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)
