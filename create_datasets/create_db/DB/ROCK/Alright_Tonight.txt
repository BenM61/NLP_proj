When I am in your heart tonight 
Everything's gonna be alright tonight
They can never separate us 
Never tear us apart, oh no
And I'll promise you I'll never break 
Never break your heart, oh no

So if craving for you is wrong 
I don't even want to be right ever again
I'll promise you we'll make it somehow
When I am in your heart tonight 
Everything's gonna be alright tonight
Just tonight
