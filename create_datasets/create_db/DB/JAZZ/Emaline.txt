Don't you hear my heart whisper thru your window, Emaline?
It's a lovely night, Emaline, to meander with me,
Have you told your friends, 
Have you told your people, Emaline?
Hurry up and write them a line 
'Bout a weddin' to be, 
In the church there's an old bell ringer,
Just waitin' for the time when I place a ring around your finger, 
makin' you mine,
All I do is pray for that Sunday mornin' sun to shine,
When I promenade down the line
