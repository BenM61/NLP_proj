I can hear the couple fighting right next door
Their angry words sound clear through these thin walls
Around midnight I hear him shout unfaithful woman
And I knew right there the axe was gonna fall

It's because of me
It's because of me

I heard him shout who is he, she mumbled low
He said baby don't you lie to me no more
And I'm listening through these thin walls silently
As he called out my name I was right next door

It's because of me
It's because of me

She was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader
That she was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man that really loves her
In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts

At daybreak I hear him back and say goodbye
I can hear him slam the door and walk away
Right next door I hear that woman start to cry
I should go to her but what would I say

It's because of me
It's because of me

She was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader
That she was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man that really loves her
In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts
