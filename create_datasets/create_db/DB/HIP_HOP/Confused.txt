Every night I dream of places I've never been to, 
so real it blows my mind
Can somebody tell me where could I find these places
And maybe spend some time?
In time I'll see face after face, true and untrue, yeah
All good things come to those who wait for them
I'm still young, I have plenty of time

I'm so confused about the way I feel 
I'm trying with all my mind
And if you ask me why girl please be patient and 
I'll be through when it's time

I like the way I feel and I hope you do, yeah
I'm so curious I need to know
You said I could talk to you, and you would help me
And tell me things that I should know
Oh yeah
As time goes on yeah (you know what?) I'll see the world, baby
Oh I guess sometimes I'll have to grow up wondering
I hope I know what to do when it's time

I'm so confused about the way I feel 
I'm trying with all my mind
And if you ask me why girl please be patient and 
I'll be through when it's time
