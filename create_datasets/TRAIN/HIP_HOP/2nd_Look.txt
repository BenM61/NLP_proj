Mean looks will never have me shook, take a 2nd look

Yeah, mean looks will never have me shook and I know you scared
I do **** like a comic book, I rip 'em up the shreds
Boy, who? I'ma handle ya, get you and your manager
Hit you in your mouth and you be taught to say what's happenin' bro?

**** , ain't no playa 'round but you standing there, looking mean
Shawty, you is not fooling me, who the **** are you supposed to be?
With them shades on, I know you's a fake homes
Keep on looking at me, get your **** face blown

See **** a faker and a foul **** , I smell you before you coming
And a blind man can see that you ain't really 'bout nothing
Mean mugging, you ain't bucking so you need to quit stuntin'
Put this right to ya face and start slicing if I wanted trick

Come get it, ain't no gimmicks, leave you two faced when I'm finished
Push my limit, you repented, leave your whole crew so diminished
Deadly captains and lieutenants sayin' the soldiers won't replenish
'cause I'm in this **** to win it, always with it, don't forget it

Ay, ay, ay, get that understood, ****, you ain't from my hood, ****
I'll break the law with 16 **** at ya head, ****
I'm born to be on top like M J in 94
Beatin' down the block, hide my tweet, it's Crime Mob, ****

I let 'em know, I let 'em know, size the ****, let 'em go
Read ya like a comic book, ya can't run it on me, folk
And I stay on dro, M O be, that's the code
We takin' over the city 'cause I **** say so

Ay, look into my eyes, tell me if you think I'm paranoid
Never that, 'cause I got a team that's known to carry ****
**** rims **** if you try to raise your voice
I make you scream just like a ****
And bruise you quick to prove a point

Read you like a comic book, make you **** simmer down
I pulled the biggest card up out ya hand, ya chance is slimmer now
Get it in ya head that I ain't scared, I'm always coming with it
If you think you stand a chance against the best, then come and get it
