I sleep in the middle of the bed
You don't know, is it fine to hold my hand?
I sleep in the middle of the bed
Sun slips through my cold hands

Do you really want me back?
Do you really want me back?

'Cause I'm over it, over you
All over the town they say I love you
I'm over it, I'm over you
All over the town
They say I love you, yeah
They say I always will
They say I love you, yeah
These wounds, they won't heal

I talk to myself at night
Better still when the lights are turned out
I talk inside my head
Better if nobody knows what I said

Do you really want me back?
Do you really want me back?

'Cause I'm over it, over you
All over the town they say I love you
I'm over it, I'm over you
All over the town
They say I love you, yeah
They say I always will
They say I love you, yeah
These wounds, they won't heal

It's all over the town
You're spreading the word
It's all over the town
You're spreading the word

If you knew me at all
You should all know my answers
If you knew me at all
You should all know my answers

If you knew me at all
You should all know my answers
If you knew me at all
You should all know my answers

They say I love you, yeah
They say I always will
They say I love you, yeah
These wounds, they won't heal

They say I love you, yeah
They say I always will
They say I love you, yeah
These wounds, they won't heal

The sun slowly falls through
