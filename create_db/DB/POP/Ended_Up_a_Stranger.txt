Cacophonous and slippery 4:35 in the mornin'
And I'm drivin' these streets 
Tryin' to capture every sound
My microphone hangs out the back seat window
And what I don't succeed in capturin'
Turns weightless and indifferent 
Lord, I've become a stranger, in my old haunts 

Blips and bleeps
And siren squalls
This town it just gets richer
And it's teeth get clenched 
And I am just a statue
Of a long lost fearless age 
Our maladies our strategies
This microphone my wanderin's aside 
Lord, I've become a stranger, in my old haunts 

Hello desire and what your spooky name implies 
In you, I found my silk and swagger,
The calm before the prize 
And though I once was warned
You'd be the grave in which I'd lie 
With you, I was no stranger, in my old haunts 

Someday I'll hit the turnpike
Speed past a truck stop burnin' 
It'll streak my rear view mirror
It'll fade, a lonely flicker 
And I'll listen to these tapes I've made
My symphony of phantoms
Lord, I've ended up a stranger in my old haunts
I've become a stranger, in my old haunts
