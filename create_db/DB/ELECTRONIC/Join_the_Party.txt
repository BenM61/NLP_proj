Welcome to the show
There's nowhere else to go
So join the party

Get up, get up and dance
Stand up for what you stand
And be somebody

Where do we go from here?
I don't know which way to grow
Why is it so hard to know?
I hope I find out before I go

Nanana
And join the party
Breathe it in, don?t breathe it out
Until you know what it?s about
And join the party

Smoke up - don?t choke
'Cause everything is a joke
So let's get high

Make love in the day
Take your siesta in the shade
And watch the clouds go by

Where do we go from here?
I don't know which way to grow
Why is it so hard to know?
I hope I find out before I go

Nanana
And join the party
Breathe it in, don't breathe it out
Until you know what it?s about
And join the party
