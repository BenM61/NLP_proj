Legends make or break game
Swept up by the rollin' waves of the night
They chase for fame

An' I was too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah, I was too, too hot
Too hot to handle

Wink of an eye, the feelings ran high
A real rock an' roll molest
But I ain't no romance and I ain't no slow chance
Won't get no quick change

Yeah, I'm too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah, I'm too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
