Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you

You're in love Your heart's fluttering all day long
You only stutter because you for tired
Just won't utter the words
I love you

What a little moonlight can do
Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through
You'll get bold
You can't resist him and all you'll say
When you have kissed him is ooh, ooh, ooh

What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do

Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through
You'll get bold
You can't resist him and all you'll say
When you have kissed him is ooh, ooh, ooh

What a little moonlight can do
