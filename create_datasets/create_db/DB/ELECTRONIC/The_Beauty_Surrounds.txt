There's some gold
In my bones
That I told you about.
So I'm pulling out my teeth and
Burying them deep under ground.

There's some lights
In your eyes
That I follow about.
But they're dimming quick, 
And you're getting sick, so now I wander out alone.

All my love
Is circling the drain now.
All my love
Won't bring you back to me.

Oh my God
I'm wasting away.
Pulled flowers at my feet
Lost in the wind.

There's a ghost
In the sky and in
All my fields of stars.
So I'm following the wind and
Singing all my hymns in the dark.
And when I shake your shadow from the trees.

There's a color in your eyes that
Nobody knows but me.
All my love
Is circling the drain now.
All my love
Won't bring you back to me.

Oh my God
I'm wasting away.
Pulled flowers at my feet
Lost in the wind.
