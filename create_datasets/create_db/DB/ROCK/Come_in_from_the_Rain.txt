Take my money, take my pride
Take my little piece of mind
It's alright
Lead me to a better life
Where I'm loved and where I'm wise
It's alright
Now I can see your signs of change
I did not believe

Oh Lord
Let me come in from the rain
Never gonna be the same
Oh Lord
Let me come in from the rain
Never gonna lie again
Never want to lie to you
I did not believe

If I just could turn back time
I would chose another prime
For my life
Hear me praying for a chance
I lay my fate into your hands
And it's alright

Now I discern your signs of changes
I did not believe

Oh Lord
Let me come in from the rain
Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be that fool
Oh Lord
Let me come in from the rain
Never gonna lie again
Never want to lie to you
I did not believe
