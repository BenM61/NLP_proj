I saw bright, open common sense
I do evil things and evil things return
And I'm praying now
Praying for me

You can't hide
I remove from you
Every tiny strength in everything you do
And I'll kick you down
I'll break you with a tender touch

Then the tears cried in the tear garden will be for life

In the west they have made a plague
We have built the ship that sailed it to our veins
And God forbid
Anything should break that chain

At our root, we are connected through
A biology, a universal cruelty
Send me home
Return me to a lonely womb
