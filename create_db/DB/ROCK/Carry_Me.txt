You try to keep the options near
I want you home, I want you here?
The last you saw across the track?(I won't change, you know that)
The rest are never coming back?(I won't change, you know that)

If anybody wants to know
Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road

You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me 
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?(I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me (I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?

It's time I let my mind disarm
I never meant to cause you harm
Just to try to keep the options near
I want you home, I want you here

You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?

You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me (I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me (I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?(I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me (I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?(I won't change, you know that)
You carry, you carry, you carry, you carry me?

If anybody wants to know
Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road

You carry me!
