Well there's one thing I'd like to rearrange
But after everything's already happened & there's nothin' left 2 change
They can take their advice and use it all on themselves
Cause when all the talking stops I want to have something else
I want to have a little faith, I want to know what a guy and a girl
Can do when they're dizzy
Cause they're just not spinning with this world

Aw if we never meet again, if goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past but our bond remains unbroken
If we never meet again

Well there's one thing that I'll never forget
It's the beauty of a friendship that's not over yet
I know how just one smile can be planted like a seed
And I want to do that for somebody else the way it was done for me
I want to have a little faith
There's something better at the end of this path
But these memories get old and fade like photographs

Aw if we never meet again, if goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past but our bond remains unbroken
If we never meet again

Well there's one thing I'd like to even up
You can be what they've made you into or U can make your own luck
U can't blindly fight your enemies, U can't blindly follow your friends
I've seen it happen so many times, I know it's gonna happen again
But I gotta have faith, I gotta know that a guy and a girl
Can still make it even when they're just not spinning with this world

Aw if we never meet again, if goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past but our bond remains unbroken
If we never meet again, if goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past but our bond remains unbroken
If we never meet again
