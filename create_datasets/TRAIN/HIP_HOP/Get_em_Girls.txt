I get the boasters boasting, I get computers putting
Y'all get shot at, call me, I do the shooting
I do the recruiting, I tutor the students
I nurture they brain, I'm moving the movement
Whether Buddhist or Buddha, that's Judist or Juda
I got luger to ruger, hit from Roota to Toota
Chick from hooter to hooter, I put two in producers
I'm the real boss story, the hoolah of Hoosiers

I rock mostly dosey, I roll mostly dololy
I'll leave you wholly, holy, you'll say holy moley
Here come the coroner get 'em, play rolly poley
I'll tell you true stories, how I coldly hold heat
When it's rapping time, I get on extra grind
Fried to fricassee, pepper seed to pepper dine
Jeff Hamilton, Genesis, leather time
Bitches say I'm the man, I tell 'em never mind

They getting nice, they got some ice
Let's get the dice and roll 'em (get 'em girls)
They getting chips, they flippin' bricks
Get the Rots and Pits, tell 'em (get 'em girls)
See acting feisty, getting shiesty
Call her wifey, tell her (get 'em girls)
Just lay back, get your face slapped
We at the race track, eight stacks (get 'em girl)

You acting funny nigga, come dumb, dummy nigga
Killa keeps twenty bikers (I'm getting money nigga)
So you should move away, or join the dude in Play
Hey, so you can say (I'm getting money nigga)
First pal up in the rare, I style up in my gear
Stallion of the year, medallions in my ear
Whips on my fists, houses on my wrists
Your budget on my neck, your spouse on my dick
Posters on the wall, posted on my balls

Dick in her mouth, I tell her (I'm getting money nigga)
Y'all faking the fizzle, I'm caking for shizzle
F*ck a Sizzler steak, my steak stay sizzled
Eight, boom, boom, my ace boon coon
Shake, bake, skate, vroom, vroom (We getting money nigga)
Seventh to eighth, zoom, zoom, boom, boom tune
For I get like that boom, boom room (I'm getting money nigga)
Wreck 'N Effects, zoom, zoom, meh poon, poon
Since the movie, Cocoon, had my Uzi, platooned (I'm getting money nigga)

They getting nice, they got some ice
Let's get the dice and roll 'em (get 'em girls)
They getting chips, they flippin' bricks
Get the Rots and Pits, tell 'em (get 'em girls)
See acting feisty, getting shiesty
Call her wifey, tell her (get 'em girls)
Just lay back, get your face slapped
We at the race track, eight stacks (get 'em girl)

My team is the Goonies we where seen with buffonies
Toonies, best dressed, stay up in Nemesis, and Bloomies
Want to hit it from the back, she agreed that I'm loony
But proceeded to moon me (I'm getting money nigga)
Baby, BS in honey do, Cam, Vs 1 and 2
I'll help you get your son out of P.S. 22
Get him a Maury flow, from the Maury show
F*ck around, y'all gonna be up on the Maury Show
He in boot camp, you on food stamps

Welfare, no health care, a true tramp
And I'm lockey, lockey, leave you pokey, pokey
No Rice a Roni, that's the okey, dokey
Me and Toby homie, make you do the hokey pokey
Pull the pound, up and down, turn yourself around shorty
Here's some weed, burn yourself a pound woodie
Here's a map, go load yourself a town, sporty
I was down forty, now I'm up fifty
Buck fifty, buck quickly, who could f*ck with me, killa

They getting nice, they got some ice
Let's get the dice and roll 'em (get 'em girls)
They getting chips, they flippin' bricks
Get the Rots and Pits, tell 'em (get 'em girls)
See acting feisty, getting shiesty
Call her wifey, tell her (get 'em girls)
Just lay back, get your face slapped
We at the race track, eight stacks (get 'em girl)
