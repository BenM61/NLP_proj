Hey, there people I'm Bobby Brown,
They say I'm the cutest boy in town!
My car is fast, my teeth are shiny,
I tell all the girls they can kiss my heine!
Here I am at a famous school,
I present sharp and I'm acting cool
I've got a cheerleader here wants to help
With my paper let her do all the work 
And maybe later I rape her!

Oh, god I am the American dream
I do not think I'm too extreme 
And I'm a handsome son of a bitch,
I'm gonna get a good job and be real rich!
(Get a good, get a good, get a good, get a good)

Womans liberation
Came creeping all across the nation
I tell you, people, I was not ready
When I fucked this Dyke by the name of Freddi!
She made a little speech then,
Oh she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice but she left the dick,
I guess it's still hooked on but now it shoots to quick!

Oh, god I am the American dream,
But now I smell like Vaseline 
And I'm a miserable son of a bitch
Am I a boy or a lady I don't know which!
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder)

So I went out and bought me a leisure suit
I jingling my change but I'm still kind cute
Got a job, doing radio promo,
And none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo!
Eventually me and a friend,
Sort of drifted along into S&M
I can take about an hour on the tower of power,
As long as I get my little golden shower

Oh, god I am the American dream,
With a spindle up my butt till it makes me scream
An' I'll do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights sayin,' "Thank you, Fred!"
Oh God, Oh God, I'm so fantastic!
Thanks to Freddie, I'm a sexual spastic
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now; I'm goin' down,
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now; I'm goin' down, 

And my name is Bobby Brown,
Watch me now, I'm going down
Haha, yeah, I knew you'd be surprised!
