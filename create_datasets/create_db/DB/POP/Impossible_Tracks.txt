I was carried away
I was carried away
I was moving too fast on impossible tracks
I was carried away

I was easily led
Because I'm easily led
By the moon, by the tide, by whatever you like
I'm just so easily led

Oh my shaking heart
You got me from the start
You got me good
Aim and take a shot
You got me til I drop
Like I knew you would

Oh you get what you give
I don't regret what I did
Well if a real live liar can set you on fire
Then don't you settle for it

Oh don't you take me all this way
To bring me back to earth one day
I'm gonna roll on back on impossible tracks
And get carried away

Oh my shaking heart
You got me from the start
You got me good
You aimed and then you shot
You got me on the spot
Like I knew you would

Oh my shaking heart
You got me from the start
You got me good
You aimed and then you shot
Now I'm coming apart
Like I knew I would
Like I knew I would

There's a full moon over Sunset
Got our feet in perfect stride
And we walk in perfect meter
While we hold our smiles inside

And we hold our smiles inside
Like we're holding back the tide
And we stride in perfect meter
Like the sun won't ever rise

Oh my shaking heart
You got me from the start
You got me good
You aimed and then you shot
You got me on the spot
I knew you would

Oh my shaking heart
You got me from the start
You got me good
You aimed and then you shot
Now I'm coming apart
Like I knew I would
I knew I would
