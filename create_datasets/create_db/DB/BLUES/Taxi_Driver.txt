Yes, I had a woman, woman.
She's nice, kind and every way.
(Do-doodle).
(Do-doodle-doodle-doodle-doodle). 
(Doodle-doodle-doodle-doodle).
I loved that woman so hard.
I couldn't stand to see her go.
Yes, my baby-baby-baby.
She did everything she said.
Yes, my baby-baby-baby.
She did everything she said,
"Yes, I love you, love you, daddy"
I'll love ya till my dying day'. 

(Do-doodle, do-doodle, doo)
Took my baby downtown now.
An bought her fine clothes.
Did everything in the world I could.
But my baby got something.
My baby got something.
My baby got something.
That I sure do love.

(Do-doodle, do-doodle).
She got me walking in my sleep.
An talking in my dream.
Doing things baby, that I sure don't like.
But my baby got something.
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes.
My baby got something.
My baby got something.
Man, that I sure do love.
My baby got something.
My baby got something.
Man, that I sure do love.

(Do-doodle).
(Do, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle).
(Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle).
(Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle).
Well, look-a-here people.
What she done, done.
Got my love, an got me on the burn.
My baby got something.
My baby got something.
My baby got something.
Man, that I sure do love.
Oh!
