There's main steam
With the main dreams
But waterfalls start with a little stream
Even Kubrick started with a small scene
Before it became The Shinning
If your coming from the hood
Work on getting Knowledge
If your from the front like you wanna survive
I didn't choose the battles but the battle chose me
When the bullet first hit my cousin Willsie
I been in the game now 5.3
Lil shorty but got shorties after me
I stay humble from the shit I see
Cause I already know there's only one me

I really would like see the star shine
But I keep getting covered up in hard time
A ooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, and we got no juice
I need a believer

There's more means or more mean
Every Tree started with a little bean
And everything you go through at 17
Will it still count at 70?
If I'm coming from the streets
Then I'm getting money
But my ideas in the bank are worth plenty
I didn't choose the music but the music choose me
The art of hitting your speakers making it bleed
I've been thinking about what effects me
And the will to survive is always in me
Every glass of water grows what I be
And every glass of liquor get me tipsy

I really would like see the star shine
But I keep getting covered up in hard time
A ooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, and we got no juice
I need a believer

It's about people not money
Light up a parliament, turn a car key
I could be a genius, I could be a cheat
It's a thin line and I'm fucking with it
I didn't choose a struggle but a struggle choose me
So I'm dancing on the rubble permanently
I'm cut from the cloth that you made me
When I'm driving down the alley these cats know me
If it's not cook, then we bring heat
If it's got feet then, it's on Neet
Anything on Neet has got that beat

I really would like see the star shine
But I keep getting covered up in hard time
A ooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, and we got no juice
I need a believer
