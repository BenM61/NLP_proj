Days can be sunny,
With never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy.
Birds in the tree sing 
Their dayful of song,
Why shouldn't we sing along ?
I'm chipper all the day,
Happy with my lot.
How do I get that way ?
Look at what I've got

I got rhythm
I got music
I got my maingirl
Who could ask for anything more ?
I got daisies
In green pastures,
I got my maingirl
Who could ask for anything more ?

Ol'Man Trouble,
I don't mind him.
You won't find him
'Round my door.
I got starlight,
I got sweet dreams,
I got my maingirl,
Who could ask for anything more ?
Who could ask for anything more ?
