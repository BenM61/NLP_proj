Naughty baby
Naughty baby
Who will tease you
I can show the way
And know the way
To please you

If you're wanting a beginner
I shan't do
I could make a saint a sinner
When I want to

If you find
The simple kind
Are rather slow, dear
Then you ought to try
A naughty one
You know, dear

But you'll never meet another
Who will be
A naughty baby, naughty baby
Just like me

If you want a girl who's sentimental
One who'll never set you in a whirl
One who will be always sweet and gentle
I am not that sort of girl

But if you prefer a rather swift one
If you think you'd like to run around
With a bright one
I am just the right one

If you find
The simple kind
Are rather slow, dear
Then you ought to try
A naughty one
You know, dear

But you'll never meet another who will be
A naughty baby, naughty baby just like
Naughty baby, naughty baby just like
Naughty baby, naughty baby just like me
