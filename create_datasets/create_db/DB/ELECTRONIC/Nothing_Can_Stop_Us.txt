"Thank you, every, come on
Give her a proper Liverpool hand, you can do better than that
And now ladies and gentlemen, what you've been waiting for"

I've come a long way
You walked into my life
I was tired, in love like a fool
But I know it's gonna work out fine, yeah

I've never felt so good
I've never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now
No, no

I've heard some people say
So wrong, oh, so wrong
Do, do you want to know?
It's true, the touch of your hand, oh

I've never felt so good
I've never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now

I've never felt so strong
I've never felt so good
Nothing can stop us now
