Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Singing " The Stars Of Our Stars".

[Chorus]
The stars of our stars
Came up the first day.
The moon did set.
The sun comes up.
And all the stars did disappear.

Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Dancing to "The Stars Of Our Stars".

[Chorus]

Times at night in the spill of light
You catch a glimpse.
You make a start with an eager heart,
But it always slips.
And then everything shifts.

Stars of our stars.
Dreams of my dreams.
You come to me
Trailing "The Stars Of Our Stars".

[Chorus]
