It's sad to think we're not gonna be here
And it's gotten to the point
Where we just can't fake it
For some ungodly reason
We just won't let it be

I guess neither one of us
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say good-bye

I keep wondering
Wondering
What I'm gonna do without you
And I guess you must be wondering the same thing too
So we go on
Go on together
Living a lie

Because I guess neither one of us
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say good-bye

Everytime I find the nerve
Everytime I find the nerve to say I'm leaving
Memories
Those old memories get in my way
Lord knows it's only me
Only know it's me
That I'm missing you
When it comes to saying good-bye
That a simple word that I just cannot say
There can be no way
There can be no way
This can have a happy ending
No, no
So we just go on
Hurting and pretending
Convincing ourselves to give it just one more try

Because I guess neither one of us
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Farewell my love
Goodbye
