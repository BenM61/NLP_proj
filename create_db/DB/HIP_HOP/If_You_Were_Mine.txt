If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

Everything I dream about
Everything I talk about
One thing I can't live without
I want to get closer to you
Can't stand being far away
Knowing that you don't feel the same way
Watching it bring tears to your eyes

If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

All the words I sing about
All the letters I'd write about
Only thing I want to hear about
Is when I get closer to you
I know there's someone else
And he is only thinking of himself
Doesn't make any sense for you to be lonely

If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

Let me the one you share your
Hopes and dreams with
You'll never be alone again
'Cause I will hold you endlessly
Please don't be afraid to let
Your broken heart guide you
Into these open arms I long
To surround you, baby

If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

If you were mine I'd be your everything
And you'd be the the only thing
That I would ever need
If you were mine I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

Oh yeah
