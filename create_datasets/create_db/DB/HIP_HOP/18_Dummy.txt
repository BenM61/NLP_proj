(18 dummy)
Yeah
(We go 18 dummy)
What they know about this 18 dumb hyphy man

(We go 18 dummy)
Beat me
(We go 18 dummy)

Yep, yep, okay, okay
Go crew
(Go crew)
Fame gang, what it do?

Yeah, cosmetics, okay, okay, yeah
(All day)
Go, go, go
(What, what, what, what)

El Nino, Brooke Ville, R.P, Rap Hill
(And the bay, bay, bay, bay)
Stunner Ville, where the curtains?
They want to be a lot of disturbance

But we all are no baby powder
Same color, red lobster, clam chowder
Ghost ride it, three times I did
Federation, remember the Titans

Throw it personal guilt for a fight here
I'm out here like kites with lightning
Is a rap with Wink on the tri here
We go dumb, so beezes like fight here
If you sleazy all you beezes say we love you, girl

We want to twirl you, so you need to work then
We feel you, girl
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)

We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
(Go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
(Go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy, what?

Yeah, F.A.B. there going hard
18 dummy on your boulevard
18 dummy's that will pull your cord
Go dumb like Wade
(Wade)

Push the cord line, com your baby
Mom got caught, that's all
I'm on, haters can't stop me now
Can get shanks on top of me now

I work my pals, scrappers got miles
Hyphy with pimped ass rims that rip out in style
I can't leave the game alone, they need us
Now we talk a lot and the homies get down

Come daddy, I'm G. Diddy, hands off kitty
Damn, that muda is pretty, give me a sign
Tell me when to go, put it in the air
Don't tell me no
(No, no, no)

(Go, go, go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
(Go, go, go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy

(Go, go, go)
We go 18 dummy
(Yarada)
We go 18 dummy
(You know what we do)

We go 18 dummy
(How does it look like to you?)
We go
(Go, go, go)

Still hyphy acting their age
18 dummy wiping the streets
(Ah)

Got grapes in the bag, go get it
Had a cop looking like Bigfoot hit it
Swing to the left all in the block
Niggas all in the curve block
(Get it hot)

Sideshow, police try to dance it
Niggas going stupid in the AC Transit
Look at mad at it, you heard me
I'm a hood star like early B of the field
(Hatch)

Close to buzzing in the stunner van with gigolo's cousin
I'm from Fairfield, that's what my mom says
Scrapped in my bag pack, looking like Kanye
In the section, handle bars, a scrapper, one just like my car
I go

(Go, go, go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
(Go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy

(Go, go, go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
(Go)
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy

We go
(Go, go, go)

I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)
I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)
I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)

I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)
I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)
I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)

I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)
I was from Pablo
(Yeah, what, go)

Yeah, don't f*ck with me
My whole crew will crush you, 18 dummy
On top of the wipe, stomp that shit
(18 dummy)

Now, now up and you go slide
(18 dummy)
(Yeah)
And I'll hold on you
Then I'll clean my shoes, 18 dummy

We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
We go 18 dummy, we go 18 dummy
We go 18 dummy, we go 18
