Deep in the core of a broken one
I spy the light of a wounded sun
That keeps you from drowning
Keeps you from drowning

Way beneath the weak surface of it all
I spy a girl only three foot tall
That keeps me from drowning
She keeps me from drowning in it all

With the will to stay
And the will to stand still

We break the rules and listen to our own skin
With a visible scar in a broken sidecar
We break the rules and listen to our own skin
We break our hearts and pretty much everything

After the dark and endless wars
I realize that I'm fighting a cause
That ends with us drowning
Ends with us drowning in it all

With the will to stay
And the will to stand still
We break the rules and listen to our own skin

With a visible scar in a broken sidecar
We break the rules and listen to our own skin
We break our hearts and pretty much everything

With the same old star and the same old sun
Built to keep us both in the same old love
And when the present tense meets the present time
Built to keep our worlds in line

We break the rules and listen to our own skin
We break our hearts and pretty much everything

We break the rules and listen to our own skin
We break our hearts and pretty much everything
