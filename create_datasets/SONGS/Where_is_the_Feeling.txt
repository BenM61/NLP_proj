There's nobody better, better than you
You make me feel happy
Happy, happy to know you 
But where is the feeling?
The feeling of security 
When we're not together 

Tell me everything's gonna be alright 
It's just no use, can't get over you 
Anytime you want me to
I can make you happy (I can make you happy)
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do (anytime)
To make you happy 
Tell me I'm crazy

Maybe since you've been gone 
They don't understand that together
Together we're one 
But where is the feeling?
The feeling of security 
When we're not together 

Tell me everything's gonna be alright 
It's just no use, can't get over you 
Anytime you want me to
I can make you happy (I can make you happy)
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do (anytime)
To make you happy 
When we're not together

Tell me everything's gonna be alright 
Anytime you want me to
I can make you happy (I can make you happy)
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do (anytime)
To make you happy 
Anytime
I'll make you happy 
Ooh hey yeah

I'll make you happy
Ooh, I'll make you happy 
Ooh ooh yeah, there ain't nothing 
I wouldn't do, yeah oh oh oh ooh ooh 
Aah, hey yeah, ooh, yeah yeah yeah
I'll make you happy, ooh yeah, ow ow ow ow
Oh yeah I will, oh yeah I will
