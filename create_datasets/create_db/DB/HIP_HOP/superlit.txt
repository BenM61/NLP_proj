I'm gonna get superlit
Only way to get over it
Now that you've done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
I gotta get superlit
I'm gonna get superlit, superlit
Only way to get over it, over it
Now that you've done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
I gotta get superlit

I'm getting superlit on the way to my job
Then I used to pay the bills from my car
They got me the girl that dumped me last month
And I'm stuck paying, her family planned all
Hold the phone there, just a minute, man
You know you can change shit around in a minute, man
Even though you pushing 'round in that mini van
When you come home you know you're gonna get
Superlit
Like you ain't never did before
I'm talking athletics in Nutella on the kitchen floor
And I feel like a got a little luck
And everything is cool until the sun come up
And then it's back to reality, the same old tragedies
Back to my old ways like, Please, don't be mad at me
You know it's just a habit when I had traffic
Even bad news got me laughing

I'm gonna get superlit, superlit
Only way to get over it, over it
Now that you've done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
I gotta get superlit

It's superlit that you do what you did to me
'Cause after what you did to me I'll gotta pretend to be
Superlit I could be whatever I want
With whoever I want, do anything that I want
When I'm superlit
Breaking down the doritos on my mac and cheese
In my kitchen with them other recipes
And wait, superlit
Negative energy will never get the best of me
And you'll never get the rest of me now I'm
Superlit

We're gonna get super, superlit
We're gonna get over, over it
Now that you've done me dirty
Now that you've done me dirty
Now that you've done me dirty
(Come on)

Let's gonna get superlit (hey)
We're gonna get super, superlit (hey)
So if I get over, over it (hey)
So we can get stupid superlit
Again, and again
