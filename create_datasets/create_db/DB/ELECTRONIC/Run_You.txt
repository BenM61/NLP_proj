Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Don't let 'em run you
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Do what you want to do
Don't let 'em run you
It doesn't matter what they say
I won't accept it
in any single way an ah!
Through the floors an ah!
Through the cabling
They're permeating
in through every single day
But I won't be confined
by their regimented boarders
We've got the strength of
over 50,000 souljah's
And we're not duty bound to
anybody's orders
"come on everybody now"
Don't let 'em run you
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let 'em run you
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let 'em run you
Do what you wanna do
Do what you wanna do
Do what you wanna do
Don't let 'em run you
Don't let 'em run you

Don't let 'em run you
They're gonna take it all away
This is a war
and the enemies engaging
But you can see
through their lies
and decide for your life
I won't be confined
by their regimented boarders
We've got the strength of
over 50,000 souljah's
we're not duty bound to
anybody's orders
"come on everybody now"
Don't let 'em run you
