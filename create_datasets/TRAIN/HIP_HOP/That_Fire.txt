I must admit.
I like em dark skin, light skin, thick and thin
I like em every shape, and all types of shades of skin
I like them big thighs, slim waist, and pretty eyes
You got my hormones on the rise so come her girl for this big surprise
Some ladies like it slow, some ladies like it ruff, 
Some like it kinky with them blindfolds and hand-cuffs
I'll taste your rainbow with it sweet, that's on the low keep that discreet
Girl you in for a mid-night treat, so keep it cool cause I bring the heat
That ass is so bro-bust, that waist is so petite put it on me girl im a freak, 
Yo climax goin' be completes, say some words that make you leak
I see you giving me sex faces, you got that ocean asshole in the swimming inside the oasis
You got an extended cab, thick in all of the perfect spots
Break me off with some of that fire, and girl you got that top notch

You like to sweat baby that's a bet, my special affects goin' make you wet.

You ho's is broke ballin', I blow money fo play
The diamond princess, I'm pretty like that pink phantom
Let the top fold, fact the sex is granted

If you can go the distance,one that can take me far

The baddest bitch, I do what I'm saying on these albums

Smilin' at me from the rear, I love the way that them lips grin
Girl you top of the line, you surpass just being fine

Yo ocean got that motion, baby I'm likin' the way you move

You got one hell of a target, lil' mama I ain't a please

Get ready fo hot sex, I bring the package like fed-ex
Under the sheets I'm so elite, come get a taste of this T.E.X.
