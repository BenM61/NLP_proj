Another night slowly closes in and I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin, I pretend you still hold me
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep, I'm in too far
I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone, you were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you 
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame, I will be the flame

Watching shadows move across the wall feels so fright'ning
I want to run to you I want to call but I've been hit by lightning
Just can't stand up for falling apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart over you
You'll always be the one, you were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you 
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame, I will be the flame

I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep, I'm in way too deep over you
You'll always be the one, you were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you 
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame, I will be the flame
