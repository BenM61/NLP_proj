blue roses will blossom in the snow
before I ever let you go
blue roses will grow up to the sky
before I ever make you cry
blue roses...
you need more reassurance
than a frightened orphan child
that I'm always gonna want you
that I'll always be beguiled
so I search for words to tell you
that my love for you is blind
but this fragment of a children's song
is all that I can find
blue roses will blossom in the snow
before I ever let you go
blue roses will grow up to the sky
before I ever make you cry
blue roses...
this nursery rhyme is corny,
it is stranded out of time
yet it's simple and it's honest
the same and since when was that a crime ?
and perhaps whoever wrote it
loved someone like I love you
for in matters of the heart I've learned
there's little that is new
blue roses will blossom In the snow
before I ever let you go
blue roses will grow up to the sky
before I ever make you cry
blue roses...
