Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one

Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one

Always onward, rode the six hundred
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Down the valley on their horses they thundered
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Ah, but once they're down, they really blundered
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Uh-huh, it was the Manfreds

Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one

The soldiers waited at the gate for weeks
(Five, four, three, two, one)
In a wooden horse, to the city they sneaked
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Pulled out and then was it the Greeks?
(Five, four, three, two, one)
Uh-huh, it was the Manfreds

Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one

Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Uh-huh, it was the Manfreds

Five, four, three, two, one
