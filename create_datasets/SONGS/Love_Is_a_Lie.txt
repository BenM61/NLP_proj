Love is a lie
Sucking you dry
Love's not a friend
Until the end

You can call it a game
You can choose your own name
When it's stuck in the vein
There's no greater pain

I've got a bell but no sound
I've got a horse but no hound
And I know I'm, know I'm

Love is a lie
Love is a lie
Love is a lie
And I know I'm going down

Now there was a time
Love was blowing my mind
Not a tear, not a doubt
'Til I figured it out

Now I'm madder than hell
Love is wagging its tail
I holler, I cry
Love is a lie

I've got a bell with no ring
I've got a whip but no sting
And I know I'm, know I'm

Love is a lie
Love is a lie
Love is a lie
And I know I'm going
You can call it a game
But there's no greater pain
When it's stuck in the vein
I know I'm going down

I've got a bell but no sound
I've got a horse but no hound
And I know I'm, know I'm going down
