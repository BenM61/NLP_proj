Woke up Sunday morning, 
Feeling out of tune. 
Wrapped my eyes around you, 
Love came in the room. 
Baby, gonna let my feelings show, 
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more. 

Laughing into midnight, 
Lover being my guide. 
We approach the morning, 
Feeling good inside. 
Baby, gonna let my feelings show, 
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more. 

Paying dues and changes, 
Living day to day. 
Love is necessary, 
To help you find the way. 
Baby, gonna let my feelings show, 
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more. 

[Chorus]
Try not to hide, 
What you feel deep inside. 
If you care, you must dare, 
To be free as the air. 

Fairy tales and stories, 
That we fail to see. 
We will tell the story, 
Of reality. 
Baby, gonna let my feelings show, 
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more. 

Tingle in our heartbeat, 
Rapture on the cloud. 
When softer words are spoken, 
Action speaks out loud. 
Baby, gonna let my feelings show, 
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more. 

[Chorus]

Try not to hide, 
What you feel deep inside.
