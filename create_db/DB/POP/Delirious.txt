I hope you got a safety net
'Cause I'm gonna push you over the edge
The strangest thing, deliberate
Done with intent, without repent

I hope you got some common sense
Turn around and walk away
The strangest thing, deliberate
Done with intent, without repent

I love the pain, I love the game
Come into my arms, come into my arms
You say that I'm delirious
But I'm not the one holdin' the gun

I told you not to come
My victim number-one

You won't let go, you won't give in
Till every part of you is suffering
It's the strangest thing, it's deliberate
Done with intent, without repent

I love the pain, I love the game
Come into my arms, come into my arms
You say that I'm delirious
But I'm not the one holdin' the gun

I told you not to come
My victim number-one
I told you not to come
My victim number-one
I told you not to come (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
My victim number-one (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
I told you not to come (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
My victim number-one (you'll just have to learn the hard way)

I hope you got a safety net
'Cause I'm gonna push you over the edge
It's the strangest thing, it's deliberate
Done with intent, without repent

I love the pain, I love the game (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
Come into my arms, come into my arms (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
You say that I'm delirious (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
But oh, you'll just have to learn the hard way

I love the pain, I love the game (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
Come into my arms, come into my arms (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
You say that I'm delirious (you'll just have to learn the hard way)
But I'm not the one holdin' the gun
