Kissing a strange hand
My city like streetlamps fade
On the edge of an answer you way lust
Beginnings are made
Lover forgive me my guilt is my only crime
And ill carry it round till it breaks me down every time

This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down 
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest most depraved
Of joys

If your afraid to say
But you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth , my love

From hunger you call and it falls upon the ears of faith
A half open mouth and the whole truth that no one would take
Pretend all you want you can cry to your hearts own beat
We will take love and swear upon the things that we just can't keep

This is the time of night when the moonlight shines down 
And we can reveal who we truly are
Within the darkest most depraved
Of joys

If your afraid to say
But you'd like to try
Just give me the safe word and take your hand
And smack me in the mouth , my love

My love?
