Under the lights, through the door
The heat was rising
Silhouettes (silhouettes) in the dark
With bodies moving, mm

Oh, saw a vision I couldn't believe
A fantasy, yeah
Ooh, there you were just right in front of me

Then you started dancing
Like nobody was watching
I met your eye, as you caught mine
You moved a little closer
And whispered something to me
You said, "I'm high," but so was I

But now we're coming up together
Coming up
And now we're coming up together
Coming up, coming up, ooh

In the smoke, dappled light
And good vibrations
Hazel eyes (hazel eyes), porcelain
An illustration

Ooh, saw a vision I couldn't believe
A fantasy, yeah
Ooh, there you were just right in front of me

Then you started dancing
Like nobody was watching
I met your eye, as you caught mine
You moved a little closer
And whispered something to me
You said, "I'm high," but so was I

And now we're coming up together
Ah, yeah
And now we're coming up together
Ah, yeah
I wanna feel this high forever
Ah, yeah
And now we're coming up together
Coming up, coming up, ooh
