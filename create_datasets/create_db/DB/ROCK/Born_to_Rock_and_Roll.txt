Some people born in old Kentucky
They think they're living in a tunnel mine of coal
Other people born not quite so lucky
Giving everything by selling out their soul

I know that everybody's born for something
Just to feed them and keep them from the cold
Sometimes you get to do the things your meant to
And I know that I was born to rock 'n roll

Born to rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul

Always wanted to be a fireman
Just to steer the hook and ladder from behind
Then I thought I'd be a great inventor
But I found it might be too hard on my mind

I know that everybody's born for something
Just to feed them and to keep them
It's all in the cards you hold
Yes I said I believe in magic

And I believe that I was born to rock 'n roll

Born to rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
Gonna rock 'n roll satisfy your soul
