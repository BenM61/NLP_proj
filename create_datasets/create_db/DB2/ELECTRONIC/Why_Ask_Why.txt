I made a list
I'm all packed up
I'm ready to go
Hear my last stop

I'll soon be far away
You can watch me go
Or you can change your mind
Come with me on the road

You give up aloud
In light of what we've got
We've won more than we've lost

Why ask why?
Now's the time to change your mind
Don't say no
You know I have to go

But if you stay here, give me love for now
And give me one for the road, before I go

But if you stay here, give me love for now
And give me one for the road, before I go

Come with me
Now when we're young
And when we go
I'll be where you're from

Why ask why?
Now's the time to change your mind
Don't say no
You know I have to go

Why ask why?
Now's the time to change your mind
Don't say no
You know I have to go

But if you stay here, give me love for now
And give me one for the road, before I go

But if you stay here, give me love for now
And give me one for the road, before I go
