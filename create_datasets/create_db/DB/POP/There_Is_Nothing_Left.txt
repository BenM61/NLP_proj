You will die
We walk through the fire
Just to die
Just to die

And the hope I had for the first time in my life
I let it die

I wanted to love you
But in my heart
There is nothing left
I wanted to haunt you
But in my heart
There is nothing left

I thought that we were important
But we don't matter at all
At all

Put your hands on my face
One last time
And say goodbye

I wanted to love you
But in my heart
There is nothing left
I wanted to haunt you
But in my heart
There is nothing left

I don't want to say goodbye
But I have to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye
But I have to say goodbye

I don't want to say goodbye
But I have to say goodbye
I don't want to say goodbye
But I have to say goodbye

I wanted to love you
But in my heart
There is nothing left
I wanted to haunt you
But in my heart
There is nothing left
