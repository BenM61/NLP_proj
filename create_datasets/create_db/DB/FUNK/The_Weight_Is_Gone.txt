Everyone knows the things you do
All of the grief you put me through

Every time you tell me how it's gonna be
Draining all my energy
Dunno what you do to me
Every time you tell me that you need a change
But you could never stay away
You know you break my heart
Every time you leave

Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone
Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone

Everyone knows that we're a lie
You're just afraid to say goodbye

Every time you tell me how it's gonna be
Draining all my energy
Dunno what you do to me
Every time you tell me that you need a change
But you could never stay away
You know you break my heart
Every time you leave

Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone
Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone

Oh baby, ooh, uhmm

Every time you tell me how it's gonna be
Draining all my energy
Dunno what you do to me
Every time you tell me that you need a change
But you could never stay away
You know you break my heart
Every time you leave

Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone
Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone
Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone
Feels like the weight is gone, the weight is gone

Oh baby, ooh, uhmm
