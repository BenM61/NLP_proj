Whoa, yes, it's me
And I'm walking in the rain
I'm looking for my baby
Her name is Ida Jane

And if she don't come back today
I'll give her prayers away

The sun is shining
But it's raining in my heart
Because Ida Jane
Has broken my heart

And if she don't come back today
I'll give her prayers away

I believe I'm losing
I'm losing my mind
Because Ida Jane
She can't be found

And if she don't come back today
I'll give her prayers away

The sun is shining
But it's raining in my heart
Since me and Ida Jane
Have been apart
