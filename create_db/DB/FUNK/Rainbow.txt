There's a rainbow in my heart
That reminds me of how we parted
And I, I know my love is gone forever
But deep down in my heart I'll love her forever

There's a rainbow, ohh in my heart
Baby, baby, baby, come on my baby
Now listen to me

I'm down on my knees, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Please listen to my plea, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm looking up above oh, yeah, up above
Praying for your love

Baby, baby, baby, come on now my baby
Come on stop this rainbow
Come on now baby, and stop this rainbow

And I know the things I done to you was wrong
I'm asking you to give me one more chance
Just one more chance to prove to you
That I know I was wrong

And I realize now baby, and I realize now baby
That love only comes once and when it comes you better grab it
'Cause it may not come no more
