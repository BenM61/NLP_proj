I can see the light behind your eyes
Even in the summer shade outside
When every single day
Will never feel the same
A single minute can't be wasted

I can see the colours of your mind
Time and time I get 'em left outside

When every single day
Will never feel the same
A single minute can't be wasted

Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes
Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes
Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes
Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes

When every single day
Will never feel the same
A single minute can't be wasted

Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes
Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes
Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes
Tell me, tell me there's no goodbyes
