We don't really need a crowd to have a party

Just a funky beat and you to get it started
And oh

We'll dance the night away.
We're having big fun and the party's just begun
Yeah

We're having big fun
Big fun!

It won't take a lot of thought for you to do it

You just feel the groove and baby
Then you move it
And oh

Dance the night away.
We're having big fun and the party just begun
Yeah

We're having big fun
Big fun!

I think you're ready
Freddie
Now its time to join the party

Baby
Let's get stoned into the pool

Getting ready to find you
Oh
Tonight!
We're having big fun
The party's just begun
Yeah

We're having big fun
Big fun
We're having big fun!

We can dance all day until the daylight

And when we feel that's just like we know

We can dance the night away.
