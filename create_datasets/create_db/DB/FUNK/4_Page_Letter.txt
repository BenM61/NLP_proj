Yo, turn my music up
Up some more, up some more
Up a little bit more

Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one particular guy
I was too shy so I decided to write

I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time

People always say that I've played myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me
Baby when I get the nerve to come to you
Promise me that you won't diss me

I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time (oh I'm writin' you)

I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch 'cause the mailman's coming (oh yes he is, oh hi)
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch 'cause the mailman's coming

I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time
I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better
Get it on time

I'm sending him a 4 page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time
Get it on time, oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah

Oh yeah yeah
