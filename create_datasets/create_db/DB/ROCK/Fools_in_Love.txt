Fools in love
Well, are there any other kind of lovers?
Fools in love
Is there any other kind of pain?

Everything you do, everywhere you go now
Everything you touch, everything you feel
Everything you see, everything you know now
Everything you do, you do it for your lady love
Your lady love, your lady love, your lady love

Fools in love
Are there any creatures more pathetic?
Fools in love
Never knowing when they've lost the game

Everything you do, everywhere you go now
Everything you touch, everything you feel
Everything you see, everything you know now
Everything you do, you do it for your lady love
Your lady love, your lady love, your lady love

Fools in love they think they're heroes
Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again

Fools in love
Gently hold each other hands forever
Fools in love
Gently tear each other limb from limb

Everything you do, everywhere you go now
Everything you touch, everything you feel
Everything you do, even your rock 'n' roll now
Nothing mean a thing except you and your lady love
Your lady love, your lady love, your lady love

Fools in love they think they're heroes
Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again

Fools in love they think they're heroes
Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again
