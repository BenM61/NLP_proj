I have to smile I have to show
I have to be nice all the time
I have to say hello baby
I have to wake up every day

I have to write I have to shout
I have to play records all night
I am in a loop I am the loop
I have to make up dress up show up

I have to sing I have to tease
I have to kiss so many cheeks
I got the flav I got the tricks
I have to put guests on the list

I have no right to complain
I have to pretend to pretend
I have to shine I have to sign
I have to never trust you blind

Smile, show, write, shout, sing,
Tease, shine, sign...
