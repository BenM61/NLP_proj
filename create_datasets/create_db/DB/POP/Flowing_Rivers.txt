The stage is set another show must go on
The spotlight's burning down into my face
The drummer sits up high upon his rostrum
Guitarists play each other face to face
And when it's over , I'll stop and wonder
And never understand
'cause leaving this was never in my plans
And when I'm playing all I see is things you'll never find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

Deceiving and receiving was my pastime
to every girl who liked my written lines
They'd think that any moment I'd be their guy
But crying never justified my lies , oh no
And next time 'round will be the same
They never understand that hurting them was never in my plans
My songs will slow like passing clouds
Something in each line
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

I've got to go , I've finished what I came for
Playing every city , state to state
Singing every town that learned to like me
Modest payments paid for what I ate
Ah, you're standing there , tears in your eyes
You once called me a man
And loving you was never in my plans
We'll go together , you and I , till we both find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

We'll go together, you and I , till we both find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind
