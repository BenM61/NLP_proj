Tell me what you see when I pass by
Shadow a cloud or a light in the sky
Am I getting it wrong or am I getting it right
Well all I can take it one, one step at the time

Look at me I'm trying
Every day I fall down
Make mistakes, get back up
Try again, next time that, see me
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking

Some people say walking takes too long
But I say with walking you can't go wrong, no
Why should you rush your way through life?
You won't get very far running all the time

Look at me I'm trying
Every day I fall down
Make mistakes, get back up
Try again, next time that, see me
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking
I'm walking I'm walking I'm walking

What does my life say about me
Can anyone see
Does it show I rock with the greatest?
I can't get back the time I spent
Use the rest of it to show all the world how I made it

I put one foot in front of another, yes I do, yeah
And I keep on
I 'm taking it one day at a time
And I am steady walking
Yeah 'cause I know that Jesus walks with me
Yes he does, said I know that Jesus walks with me, yeah
So I keep on, yeah, yeah
Said I keep on walking, walking
Said I am walking, yeah
