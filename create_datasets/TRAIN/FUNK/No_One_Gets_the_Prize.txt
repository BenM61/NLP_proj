No one, no one gets the prize
No one, no one
No one gets the prize

We were best of friends
It all began
He came in to town and changed the plan
I knew she felt, the same as me
Which one of us would it be

Just in fun, fight begun
Before long a web of hate was spun
She pretended same as me
Oh, but friends again we'd never be

No one, no one gets the prize
She told him lies, and I told him lies
No one, no one gets the prize

She schemed and dreamed and told him dirt
That I was wrong for him
I told him all the boys she'd hurt and I would number them
He was the ray of light that made our hearts live
But either one of us knew really how to give
So we scandalized and criticized
And then we learned how to despise

No one, no one gets the prize
She told him lies and I lied, I lied yeah
No one, no one gets the prize
No, no, no

Yeah, yeah
Back off
Tried to steal him, tried to steal him
Tried to steal him
Runnin' behind my back
Tried to steal him
Tried to show him where it was at

Watch it now
No, no I won't take second place
No, no tell him to his face

We were friends for so, so, so long
Messed around, now he's gone gone gone gone

No one, no one gets the prize
No, no
No one, no one gets the prize

I wasn't alive, a love that's satisfied
No one, no one gets the prize
It wasn't fair, the love I couldn't share
No one, no one gets the prize
No, no

No one, no one gets the prize
No one, no one gets the prize
She lied, I lied, we lied
No one, no one
