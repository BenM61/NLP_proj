Can you tell me a story
From the end of the night
Girl you tell me to break the ice
And the love will go fine
Can you tell me you think straight
Plot a course in the landscape
Just tell me you're fine

We are the people
We are here alone
We are explorers when beat goes on
We're on a journey to the morning sun
Together

Got a face for the front page
You should join me sometime
I wanna dream up a new age
If the planets align
With a hunger for never
Windows stretching forever
Just tell me you're fine

We are the people
We are here alone
We are explorers when beat goes on
We're on a journey to the morning sun
Together

You'll get through with a little love
Just you wait and see
You'll get through with a little love
Just you wait and see

Keep my hands up pointing to the sky
Until the daylight comes, into our minds to rescue us
Keep my hands up pointing to the sky
Until the daylight comes, into our minds to rescue us
Keep my hands up pointing to the sky
Until the daylight comes, into our minds to rescue us
Keep my hands up pointing to the sky
Until the daylight comes, into our minds to rescue us

We are the people
We are here alone
We are explorers when beat goes on
We're on a journey to the morning sun
Together
