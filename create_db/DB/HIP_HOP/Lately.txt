Pretty young thing sexy young girl 
I've been thinkin' bout 
How we used to share one world but that's over now
Life without you just aint life and its killin' me
'Cause we just walked away turned our backs
On the beautiful dreams
I want you back coz im in need (all I need)
All I need to know is have you thought about me

Lately, all the trouble we used to get in my baby
Lately, in the backseat of my Benz now baby
Lately, we'll let the top drop you'll get on top baby
Lately, hav u thought about me thought about me

Theres got to be a way
I want you back coz im in need (all I need)
All I need to know is have you thought about me

Lately, all the trouble we used to get in my baby
Lately, in the backseat of my Benz now baby
Lately, we'll let the top drop you'll get on top baby
