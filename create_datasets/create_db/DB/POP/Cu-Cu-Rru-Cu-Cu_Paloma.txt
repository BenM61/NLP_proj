Softly the night wind singing
Tells me it's bringing my love to me
With every breath it's sending
Love never ending across the sea
My heart and I are trying
To keep from crying
But we are lonely
Fly little bird go winging
And please lead him home safely to me

Cucurrucucu Paloma
Cucurrucucu Paloma
Bring him back to me forever
Let us always be together

What good is my tomorrow
When filled with sorrow just like today
I need him here to hold me
Here to enfold me, always to stay
So little bird please find him
And then remind him I am so lonely
Fly little bird, go winging
And please lead him home safely to me

Cucurrucucu Paloma
Cucurrucucu Paloma
Bring him back to me forever
Let us always be together

Cucurrucucu
Cucurrucucu
Cucurrucucu
Let us always be together
