It's a desert sky
Full of broken dreams
But it ain't as bad
As it really seems
I'll go miles and miles
On this lonesome road
I got a heavy heart
But I never ask no one to carry my load

American house, American shoes
Gimme that thing called American blues
American work, American pay
Gimme a little love, I'm American made, yeah

I was lyin' down
On a bed of sand
I saw Crazy Horse
Holding out his hand
Said lift me up
To where the eagles fly
Because I feel so good
I swear to God I ain't never gonna die

American house, American shoes
Gimme that thing called American blues
American work, American pay
Gimme a little love I'm American made, yeah

Woo
American house, American shoes
Gimme that thing called American blues
American work, American pay
God almighty I'm American made

American dreams, American pie
Everybody gettin' that American high
American life, American made
Guaranteed, certified American made
Guaranteed, certified American made
Guaranteed, certified U.S.A.

Made in America, U.S.A.
Made in America, U.S.A.
