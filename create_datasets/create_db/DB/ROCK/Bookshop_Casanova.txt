After all the lights go low, we find ourselves alone
We could be just anywhere but no one's going home

You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers
You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers

Now see the dying summer moon
It's shining just for me and you
And the night that seems so alone is gone, gone, gone

Weave the sunlight in your hair, catch it in your arms
I can see you movin' in, I'm easy and I'm calm

You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers
You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers

Now see that dying summer moon
It's shining just for me and you
And the night that seems so alone is gone, gone, gone

I see that dying string
It's shining just for me and you
And the night that seems so alone is gone, gone, gone
Good night, good night
