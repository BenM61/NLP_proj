Let's have relations
You and me, me and you
You and me, me and you
Me and you
Hook up?

Let's have relations
You and me, me and you
You and me, me and you
Me and you
Hook up?

We'd never know
How could we know?
How could we know the stars would align
We'd never find each other
Star crossed
Star crossed tonight

Let's have relations
You and me, me and you
Me and you, you and me
Me and you
Hook up?

I'm saying
You and me, me and you
You and me
Hook up?

I think it's crazy, we've never met before
I'm wondering if we were supposed to meet in another life

I'm wondering
If tomorrow never comes
I don't want the sun to rise

If I could find you
Find you in the dark
Then I'm alright
And just maybe we
Maybe we, maybe we will play tonight

Let's have relations
You and me, me and you
You and me, me and you
Me and you
Hook up?

All I really want is
You and me and me
Hook up?

I see the lights
Shining on you, tonight

And my friends say
That we should try, we should try
We should try it out, right

I think it's one thing
To promise yourself to me
But I'm wondering if you can give me
A chance to see

Tonight

Let's have relations
You and me, me and you
You and me, me and you
Me and you
Hook up?

Let's try it out now
You and me, me and you
You and me, me and you
Hook up? Hook up?
Hook up? Hook up?

Well I don't think you understand me when I say to you
That I'm really trying to know you better
Yeah, really trying to be with you baby
I really want you to let me in
Let me in, let me in, oh babe
Let's have relations all the way
