We ought to bake a sunshine cake
It does more good than a big thick steak

Start with a tablespoon of trouble
Then add a smile and let it bubble up
We ought to bake a sunshine cake
It isn't really so hard to make
Fresh tears, a pound or two of pleasure
Kind words you needn't use a measure cup

It's not from a recipe book
You don't have to be a good cook
Or run to the oven and look

With such a simple dish, all you do is wish
So why not bake a sunshine cake
Of course it may keep your dreams awake
FRANK:
Friends say there's nothing like the flavor
Don't wait to do your friends a favor
And for goodness sake, let's bake a sunshine cake

It's got vitamins A, vitamins B
Vitamins L-O-V-E
If you're fat, it's for that
If you're thin, stuff it in

What's wrong if you get a double grin
We ought to bake a sunshine cake

It's not from a recipe book
You don't have to be a good cook

Or run to the oven and look
With such a simple dish, all you do is wish
So why not bake a sunshine cake
Of course it may keep your dreams awake
Friends say there ain't nothing like the flavor
Don't wait to do your friends a favor
And for goodness sake, let's bake a sunshine cake
