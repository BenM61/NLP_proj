Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
Is it the way that you're movin'
The way that you're makin' my heart beat
Is it the sound of your voice
The way that you're talkin' to me
Is it the scent of your hairThe look of your smile,Idon't know

Is it the way that you're dressed
You believed you're the best
No,I thing it's the look in your eyes
Bang,bang,bangYou drive me insane,sane,sane
Bang,bang,bang
Bang,bang,bang,insane,sane,sane
Bang,Bang
Na,na
Bang,bang

It it the look of your face
I'm Losin' my base (can't see you)
Is it the style of your walk
Or the way you talk,I don't know

Is it the way that you're dressed,That you believe you're the best
No,I thing it's the look in your eyes
Like bang,bang,bang
Bang,bang,bang,insane,sane,sane
Bang,Bang
