He's stone-cold dead in de market
He's stone-cold dead in de market
He's stone-cold dead in de market
I killed nobody but me husband

Last night I went out drinking
When I came home, I gave her a beating
So she catch up the rolling pin and went to work on my head
Till she bash it in

I lie cold dead in de market
Stone-cold dead in de market
I lie cold dead in de market
She killed nobody but her husband

I lick him wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
I lick him wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
I lick him wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
And if I kill him, he had it coming

Man, he's stone-cold dead in de market
He's stone-cold dead in de market
He's stone-cold dead in de market
I killed nobody but me husband

My family they swearin' to kill her
My family they swearin' to kill her
His family they swearin' to kill me
And if I kill him, he had it coming

I lie cold dead in the market, child
Cold dead in the market, child
I lie cold dead in the market
She kill nobody but her husband

There is one thing that I am sure
He ain't goin' to beat me no more
So I tell you that I doesn't care
If I was to die in the electric chair

Man, he's stone-cold dead in de market
He's stone-cold dead in de market
He's stone-cold dead in de market
I killed nobody but me husband

Hey, child, I'm coming back and bash you on your head one more time

No, no, man, you can't do that

You stone-cold dead in de market, murderer
Stone-cold dead in de market, de criminal
He's stone-cold dead in de market
I killed nobody but me husband
