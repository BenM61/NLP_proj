Hurry up and beat the rush
Be the first to cut us down
That would seem to be the cool thing to do 
You know me so step the f*ck back kid
Don't assume to judge me or my crew
I don't have to run anything by you

Talk your shit and I'll stay true 
Mad love to those choose 
To watch our backs 
We won't forget it
We're stoked that we met
We're glad you care, you were 
There for us when we needed you most 
We couldn't have made it through
Without you there
Mad respect goes out to you

You're what I mean when I say crew
I remember much more good than bad 
I so love what I do 
To the bad I've got something for you
I've friends and people that I love 
And love me back
No matter what you say no matter 
What you try to do

Hurry up and beat the rush
Be the first to cut us down
That would seem to be the cool thing to do 
We never liked you anyway
Sip your cunty latte
And shove it up your fuckin' 
Ass when you're through

To the bad I've got something for you
See I've got friends and people that 
I love and love me back
No matter what you say no matter 
What you try to do
