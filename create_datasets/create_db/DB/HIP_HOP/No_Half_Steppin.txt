Track, track, track, track, track masters
Hinchmen, keep it moving
Motown, Sharissa where you at

I was just about to say I'm sorry for being late
But I can't say nothing
The accusations you gripe and you complain
You always mad about something

You'd be wilding out if you knew I had packed my things
But I ain't saying nothing
The decision of a lifetime, I'm having second thoughts
About you for the last time

Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good, yeah)
Before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(Don't need to bring no kids into this mess)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(For you to think out)
What it takes for you to be my lover

If you gonna love me, love me all the way completely
Baby, no half stepping, give me, give me what it takes
To make me feel, if you gonna leave me baby leave today
Ain't got no time to waist this love on no one
Who don't need it, don't know what to do with it

You're checkin' my pagers scrolling down my caller ID
Like trust ain't a factor
When all the while baby you were cheating on me
Did you regret the morning after?

Even though you had these tendencies from the start of this thing
I thought I could change you
You made it easy to decide, there's no way
That I could never be your wife

Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good)
Before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(Don't need to be taking no children into this abuse no, no, no)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(Boy you ain't the one that I wanna take)
What it takes for you to be my lover

If you gonna love me
(If you gonna love me, yeah)
Love me all the way completely
(Yeah, yeah)

Baby, no half stepping
(No half stepping)
Give me, give me what it takes
(Give me this love to make me feel it's real, yeah)

To make me feel
If you gonna leave me baby leave today
(If you leaving, leave)
Ain't got no time

To waist this love on no one
(No half of you)
Who don't need it
Don't know what to do with it

Uh, Sharissa where you at?
Sharissa where you at?

If you gonna love me, love me all the way completely
Baby, no half stepping
(Yeah)
Give me, give me what it takes

To make me feel
(Keep it moving)
If you gonna leave me baby leave today
(Oh, yeah)

Ain't got no time to waist this love on no one
(No, no time for you)
Who don't need it
Don't know what to do with it

If you gonna love me
(If you gonna if you gonna if you gonna)
Love me all the way completely
Baby, no half stepping
(No baby)

Give, me give me what it takes
(Come on baby I wanna feel right)
To make me feel
If you gonna leave me baby leave today
