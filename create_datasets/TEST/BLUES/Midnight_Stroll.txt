Sunup till sundown
With every step I take
Sunup to sundown
With every step I take
I'll be thinking of you, baby
And the love we gonna make

Put your ear to listening
As soon as night time falls
Put your ear to listening
As soon as night time falls
Once the moon, moon comes up, baby
You'll hear my hungry call

Hmm, that means I want you so
Hmm, I want you so
Hmm, oh babe, let's do that midnight stroll

Look for a long, black Caddie
Driving up your street
Look for a long, black Caddie
Cruisin' up your street
And when I rev, rev my motor, baby
Good God, baby's gonna know that's me

Hmm, I want you so
Hmm, I need you to know
Hmm, oh babe, let's do that midnight stroll

Sunup till sundown
With every step I take
Sunup to sundown
With every step I take
Oh, and I'm thinkin' of you, thinkin' of you, baby
And all the love we gonna make

Hmm, I want you so
Hmm, I need you to know
Hmm, hey hey, let's do that midnight stroll

Let's stroll awhile
Hmm, let's go for a ride, babe
I've got the top down
Got Howlin' Wolf on the radio
Hmm, sunup to sundown
Let's ride awhile
