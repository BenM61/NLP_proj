In the morning 
In the morning
I do what I wanna do
What I wanna do
What I wanna do

One endless summer
After another
I do what I wanna do
What I wanna do
What I wanna do

I made up my mind some time ago
No one's gonna tell me where I can go

California finally my golden dream
Feels so good walking down the street

Sun eye swollen
Across the ocean 
I do what I wanna do
What I wanna do
What I wanna do

I made up my mind some time ago
No one's gonna tell me where I can go

California finally my golden dream
Feels so good walking down the street

In the morning 
In the morning
I do what I wanna do
What I wanna do
What I wanna do
