Right now we could use a little pick-me-up
Seems like the whole damn nation's trying to take us down
When your brother's dying
Mother's crying
TV's lying
All the reason's in the world don't mean shit to me now

See we thought that we saw that he had a gun
Thought that it looked like he started to run
Thought that we saw that he had a gun
Thought that it looked like he started to run

Am I
Am I
Gonna be a witness?
Just gonna be a witness?
Am I
Am I
Gonna be a witness?

Do you need another reason to get up
See how fast they turn when you're looking up
They say your dangerous
Cancerous
Not to trust
Now everybody that's brown can get the f*ck on the ground

See we thought that we saw that he had a gun
Thought that it looked like he started to run
Thought that we saw that he had a gun
Thought that it looked like he started to run
