The sand is sifting by 
I only know that I will die 
And pay my taxes, the rest is touch and go 
I wish I could just catch a glimpse 
Of what's in store 
I've wanted since 
I can't recall 
I never know what to do 
I've never had a clue 

I feel the future 
Don't tell me you don't 
Feel it slip away
