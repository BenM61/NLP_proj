Ol' Howard, po' boy
Ol' Howard he is dead an' gone
Left me here to sing this song
Left me here to sob and mourn (or moan)

Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
God knows, pretty little girl with a red dress on

Ol' Howard is a po' white(?). He goes all around over the plantations. Plays for the sukey jumps. He is the first man to start the sukey jump playin' in the world, and he would go all around, while po' Howard is dead and gone, everybody sings this song about him.

Ol' Howard is dead an' gone
Left me here to sing and mourn
Ol' Howard Po' boy
Ol' Howard, he was a po' boy
Ol' Howard, he was a po' boy
Ol' Howard, he was a po' boy,
