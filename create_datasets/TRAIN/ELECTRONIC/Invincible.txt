I, I'm invincible 
I'm indestructible 
It's my destiny 

I, I'm invincible 
I'm unshakable 
Through the truth in my soul 

You know you just can't kill a man when he's dead
You know the spirit survives (invincible) 
You can't stop the advance of the Kingdom to come 
You know the truth is alive (invincible) 

To be invinicble 
Is unattainable 
Without sacrifice 

Feel, feel the birth inside 
The life that cannot die 
Are you invincible?

You know you just can't kill a man when he's dead
You know the spirit survives (invincible) 
You can't stop the advance of the Kingdom to come 
You know the truth is alive (invincible) 
 
Invincible 
Invincible 

You know you can't kill a man when he's dead 
(You know you can't)

You know you can't kill a man when he's dead 
(You know you can't, you know you can't, you know you can't)

You know you just can't kill a man when he's dead
You know the spirit survives (invincible) 
You can't stop the advance of the Kingdom to come 
You know the truth is alive (Invincible) 

You know you just can't kill a man when he's dead
You know the spirit survives (invincible) 
You can't stop the advance of the Kingdom to come 
You know the truth is alive (invincible) 

You know you can't kill a man when he's dead
