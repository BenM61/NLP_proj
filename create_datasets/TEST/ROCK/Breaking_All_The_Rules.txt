We are the people one and all 
From deliverance to the fall 
From the battle and the heat
To our triumph and defeat 
We are the young ones crying out
Full of anger full of doubt 
And we're breaking all of the rules 
Never choosing to be fools 
We are tired of being used
We are constantly excused 
In the battle and the heat 
In the shadow of retreat 
We are the young ones crying out 
Full of anger full of doubt 
And we're breaking all of the rules
Never choosing to be fools 
We are the people one and all 
From deliverance to the fall 
From the bitter to the brave 
From the cradle to the grave 
We are the young ones crying out 
Full of anger full of doubt 
And we're breaking all of the rules 
Never choosing to be fools
