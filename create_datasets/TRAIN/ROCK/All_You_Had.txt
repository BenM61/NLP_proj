I was down and out
In hallway passing out
From alcohol and nicotin
You stayed up all night
Wondering where the hell I've been
Wondering where the hell I've been
Find a reason why
I live my life looking for medicine
I stay up all night
Wondering where the hell I've been
Wondering where the hell I've been

I was falling down
My legs couldn't carry me
No longer carry me
You let me have my time
Next to the bathroom sink
Next to the bathroom sink

and you gave me all you had

It's been a long long time
I can't remember how long since my body could stand me
I hope that in time
Before too long I can be somebody else than me

You gave me all you had
