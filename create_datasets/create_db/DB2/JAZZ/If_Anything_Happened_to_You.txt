If anything happened to you
I would lose every reason to live
There's no thrill that life could give
If anything happened to you

If anything happened to love
I would love every dream that I own
Or how could I dream alone
If anything happened to you?

I know my heart will always choose you
No one could take your place
And so, if I should ever lose you
I couldn't look my heart in the face

Don't let anything happen to you
I'd be lost if I found we were through
So think what would happen to me
If anything happened to you

I know my heart will always choose you
No one could take your place
And so, if I should ever lose you
I couldn't look my heart in the face

Don't let anything happen to you
I'd be lost if I found we were through
So think what would happen to me
If anything happened to you

I'd be so alone and blue
I don't know what I would do
My love, if anything happened to you
