And we say back way to all the trouble makers
Better fix up your brains because you are the biggest fakers
Come in the place better know who you are
Self defence is no offence
The scales of justice are weighed down on one side
Freemasons on the case you know you're gonna get a rough ride
Hold tight even if you know your rights
It's just a piece of paper unless you're prepared to fight

For ten years one hell of a long time
To rot in a cell when you've committed no crime
Another innocent man forced to carry the can
Free Satpal Ram
Free Satpal Ram
Another innocent man
Whose word against who?
Whose word against who?
The degenerate crew
Out on the town thought they had something to prove
Self defence - only offence - had to protect himself from all the murdering fools
Cutting remarks on account of his race
A plate to his chest and a glass to his face
An Asian fights back can't afford to be meek
With your back against the wall you can't turn the other cheek

And its back way to all the trouble makers
Better fix up your brain because you're the biggest fakers
Come in the place better know who you are
Free Satpal Ram
Another innocent man

Birmingham six
Bridgewater four
Crown prosecution totting up the score
Kings Cross two
Guildford four
Winston Silcott - man how many more ?
Satpal attacked in a restaurant by racists
Now the brother's been locked up on a life time basis
Convicted of murder but what's never mentioned
Self defence was his only intention

ADF once again taking to the stand
Witness the jailing of an innocent man
Kicking up a fuss because it could happen to us
Time to join in the fight back
Because enough is enough
And it's back way to all the trouble makers
Better fix up your brains because you're the biggest fakers
Come in the place better know who you are

Free Satpal Ram
