Take position 
And love will take a stand 
That is the way it goes 
No inquisition 
No cynical demands 
No one should ever know 

Because I'm dancing 
Dancing to your heart 
Dancing to your heart now baby 
Oh what a way to start 

Well I'm trying to find 
All the love we discovered 
That is the way it goes 

No perversion 
In this unconventional love 
No way I'd rather see 
No diversion 
In this unintentional love 
No way I'd rather be 

Because I'm dancing 
Dancing to your heart 
Dancing to your heart now baby 
Oh what a way to start
