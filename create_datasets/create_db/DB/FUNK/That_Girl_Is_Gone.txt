*Oh that girl is gone
And it really doesn't matter
Who was right or wrong, yeah yeah
Oh that girl was mine
And it hurts me so to think
That she won't even try

That girs is gone, gone, gone, gone

Lord only knows
Which way that she may go
Lord only knows
Just what she's lookin' for 
I would beg her if I could
To come back home
If she were here right now
I would put her on the throne
I would make her see just how 
That a man loves a woman, but

(* Repeat)
That girl is gone, gone, gone, gone

Lord only knows 
How long I've tried to be
Faithful to her
In every way
I would beg her once again
To trust in me
She ain''t here no more
And I'm a broken man
And it's easy to say now 
That I understand, but

(* Repeat)

Yeah and it hurts me so to think
That she could be satisfied
That girl is gone

Come home to me, baby
Oh and it hurts me so to think 
That she won't even try
Yeah and it hurts me so to think
That she could be satisfied
That girl is gone
Yeah yeah, oh that girl is gone
Oh the girl is gone...
