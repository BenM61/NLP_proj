Silver jet 
Take me 
I'm all set 
Take me 
Through the sky 
Fly me 
Where the air of Rio sings 
All my hopes right on the winds 

Makes this trip 
Non-stop 
Like my heart 
Non-stop 
Bring me where he is 
Help my heart be his 
Long lost child 
Love waits at the end of the sky 
So fly me to Brazil
