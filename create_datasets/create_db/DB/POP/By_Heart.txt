Hold me close
Baby please
Tell me anything
But that you're gonna leave
As I kiss this falling tear
I promise you I will be here

[Chorus]
'Til the stars fall from the sky
'Til I find a reason why
And darling as the years go by
'Til there's no tears left to cry
'Til the angels close my eyes
And even if we?re worlds apart
I'll find my way back to you by heart

When you go
I'll stop the clock
I won't ever
Let this moment stop
Time is stealin? you from me
But it can never take this memory

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
