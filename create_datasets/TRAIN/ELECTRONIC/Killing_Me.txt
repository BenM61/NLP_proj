There's no solution for any our problems
Our living room, just turns into a battlefield
I try to duck down but it feels like I'm falling
Losing round by the way you're shooting back at me

Why don't you see that I'm dying, see that I'm dying
Do you really want me, to die for you
Why don't you see that I'm dying, see that I'm dying
Do you really want me, to die for you?

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me
You're just killing me

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me
You're just killing me

This is how it started, and this is how it ends
It's getting quiet, I'm walking out the door
I'm so tired, no reason to pretend
We lost the fire, we froze into the core

Now I see that you're crying, see that you're crying
But it doesn't feel like you're crying over me
You would know that I'm lying, know that I'm lying
If I would tell you that I still believe

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me
You're just killing me

And every word you say
Feels like a knife in my head, like a bullet in my back
You're just killing me
You're just killing me

You just killing me
You just killing me
And every word you say
