Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair,
'Cause you say that you found another man,
Tuesday break heart, guess you just don't care,
'Cause you found you another man

I want to be with you when you're all alone,
I want to be with you when you feel you got, got another man,
You see oh, baby, all alright

I want to be with you when the night time comes,
I want to be with you when the daytime comes,
I want to stay, oh baby, lemme, baby with you

Tuesday heartbreak seem to be a drag,
When you know that you love her especially,
Catch up baby, catch up with my dreams,
Maybe then I could see you all the time

But I want to be with you till the night time comes,
I want to be with you till daytime comes,
I want to stay and never go away,
Oh baby, it's alright

I want to be with you till night time comes,
I want to stay with you till the morning runs,
I want to, baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby it's alright

I want to be with you till night time comes,
I want to be with you till the daytime comes,
I wanna stay, oh baby, get away, it's alright
I want to be with you till daytime comes
