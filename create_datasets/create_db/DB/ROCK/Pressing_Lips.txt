The god who made us made me mortal too
He gave me no special powers I could use on you
I've done all I can do
I can't give you the moon or the stars

But you can have the contents of my
Melancholy heart
What could mean more than a kiss right now
If you need a grand gesture, close your eyes and show me how (darling)

Pressing lips (honey)
Kiss me quick (sugar)
Mark my face with tangerine lipstick
Kiss me like you'll never

See me again (my angel)
Pressing lips
I could never want you more than this
Some boys will tell you they can make you complete

I won't presume that I'm the only thing you need
How unfair that would be
I can't move a mountain, swim a river deep
I won't make you supernatural promises

I can't keep
What could mean more than a kiss right now
If you need a grand gesture, close your eyes, I'll show you how (darling)


She's on her tip-toes to reach her mic
She smiles at Stewey
God, what a beautiful night
