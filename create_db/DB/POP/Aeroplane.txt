I saw your name in a telephone book
As someone unlisted someone unknown
I guess you want to disappear
To another world
Where you're left on your own

And I know we could close our eyes
And fool ourselves
With nowhere left to hide
I thought that giving up
Would be easier
But it's harder not to try

Cause in your heart is a hurt that's growing
You're like a window to my world
Where no begin is where you are

I love you like an aeroplane
That's taking me home again
I'm standing here in line
Cause some love just takes time

I love you like an aeroplane
That's taking me home again
If you're searching for the truth
It's in the feelings I have for you
It's in the feelings I have for you

They say
Some things are forever and
Some things they only last a day
It it's not getting better
If it's difficult
Doesn't mean you turn away

I know you live your life 
Like a melody
A song that wants to grow
I thought that giving up
Would be easier
But it's harder letting go
Cause in your heart is a hurt that's growing
You're like a window to my world
Where to begin is where you are

I love you like an aeroplane
That's taking me home again
I'm standing here in line
Cause some love just takes time

I love you like an aeroplane
That's taking me home again
If you're searching for the truth
It's in the feelings I have for you

I saw your name in a telephone book
As someone unlisted someone unknown
I guess you want to disappear
To another world
Where you're left on your own

And I know we could close our eyes
And tell yourself
That's there's not much we can do
But I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up
On these feelings I have for you
Yeah these feelings I have for you
These feelings I have for you
These feelings I have for you
These feelings I have for you
