20 long miles from town, my old car broke down 
The clutch is shot & the sound is so hot 
Oh what I'd give to be home 

19 miles from town, my old car broke down 
The battery's dead, man like I said 
Oh what I'd give to be home 

18 miles from town, my old car broke down 
The fan belt's slippin' & the engine's missin' 
Oh what I'd give to be home restin' my bones 

17 miles from town, my old car broke down 
Just my luck, I've got the fuel pump's stuck 
Oh what I'd give to be home 

(When the sun's so high up in the sky) 
& I'm tryin' to get home to my baby 
(When I get that far, I'm gonna get rid of this car) 
It's got to go, it's got to & I don't mean maybe 

16 miles from town, my old short broke down 
My tire's down, no spare around 
Oh what I'd give to be home 

(instrumental) 

15 miles from town, my old car broke down 
The battery's dead, man like I said 
Oh what I'd give to be home 

14 miles from town, my old short broke down 
...& fade
