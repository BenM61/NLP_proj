Funny how I'm on myself with you
Than I ever knew
If I see that its eleven I'll say its seven
To spend more time with you
So here you know what I'm saying

To you this evening
Think it through
You thought I was your best friend
There to your defense
I reach for someone new

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on to what we have
Yesterday is gone and the night is long
We'll hold on to what we have

Even though I've been with someone else
I'm so happy when I'm with you
And here we are again on some lost weekend
Yeah we are one or two
So here you know what I'm saying

To you this evening
Think it through
You thought I was your best friend
There to your defense
I know that I had you

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on to what we have
Yesterday is gone and the night is long
We'll hold on to what we have

Nothing leaves your mind but breaks your heart
But we both knew this from the start
I could mend your life, or ease your pain

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on to what we have
Yesterday is gone and the night is long
We'll hold on to what we have

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on to what we have
Yesterday is gone and the night is long
We'll hold on to what we have

Hold on to what we have
Hold on
Hold on
