Baby I will soon be leaving
and I know that you are feeling down
But every week I'll send a letter
To let you know my love will never change
I promise you I always feel the same

So remember in your heart
Baby when we are apart
There is no need for crying
'Cause even if I am

Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll Still be feeling the way I do
And Now I want to hold you baby
'Cause I'm gonna miss you like crazy
Even if I'm halfway around the world

Baby when the miles are growing
You and I will still be growing strong
No matter what your friends are saying
Don't give up on what you're waiting for
'Cause one day I'll be knocking on your door

So remember in your heart
Baby when we are apart
There is no need for crying
'Cause even if I am

Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll Still be feeling the way I do
And Now I want to hold you baby
'Cause I'm gonna miss you like crazy
Even if I'm halfway around the world

If I could you know that I would find a way
To stay for good but I must go now
I want to hold you baby
I'm gonna miss you like crazy even if I'm
Even if I'm halfway around the world

Halfway around the world
That won't stop me from loving you
Halfway around the world
I'll Still be feeling the way I do
And Now I want to hold you baby
'Cause I'm gonna miss you like crazy
Even if I'm halfway around the world x2
