Words are cheap and "I love yous" are free 
So unless you mean it, don't spend them on me 
Don't look twice if you're keeping score 
Cause heartaches are high priced and I've paid it before

I've taken some wrong roads and I've lost track 
Of lovers who gave them hearts then wanted them back 
So I need someone who needs someone too 
But spare me the memories, if you're just passing through

Do me with love
Don't do me wrong
You know my heart's been broken to long 
And I've had one to many tears to fall 
So do me with love, do me with love
Or don't do me at all

Do me with love
Don't do me wrong
You know my heart's been broken to long 
And I've had one to many tears to fall 
So do me with love, do me with love
Or don't do me at all

So do me with love
Do me with love
Or don't do me at all
