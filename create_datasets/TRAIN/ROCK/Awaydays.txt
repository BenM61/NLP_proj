You never needed anyone
You never loved companion
Solitary swimming against the tide
Uh uh uh

You never left your neighbourhood
But always dreamt of hollywood
Now you feel that empty hole inside
And nowhere you can hide

On awayayaydays
A stranger lost in paradise
On awaydays ohohoh
On awayayaydays
You're dancing on the drifting ice
On awaydays
On awaydays

It's only when you're far away
That you remember why you stayed
It's only when you're lost you truly find
Uh uh uh

It's only when you taste success
You notice that your life's a mess
All the wealth and fame was in your mind
How could you be so blind?

On awayayaydays
A stranger lost in paradise
On awaydays ohohoh
On awayayaydays
Pleasure is a lonely vice
On awaydays
On awaydays

Instrumental

Everything is slipping
Out of mind and out of hand
And there's something lost and missing
And you just can't understand
Oh you'll never understand
