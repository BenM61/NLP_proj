Hello?
Yo I'm in the booth I'ma call you right back
Nah I just gotta put this one part down I'ma call you back
I'm at the studio man what
Man quit playin' with me man
No for real don't play like that
Are you, are you serious?
How you know?
Put that on everything
Damn
I'ma call you back
I'ma call you back

Every time I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called I told you
Baby I'm workin' (no)
I was out doin my dirt (oh)
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt
(I) was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (just listen)
Thinkin' like I didn't have you sittin' at home
Thinkin' about me
Bein' a good girl that you are
But you probably believe you got a good man
I mean I never would do the things I'ma 'bout to tell you I've done
Brace yourself
It ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else (oh no)

I know you hate me
I know I hurt you
But there's more
Listen
