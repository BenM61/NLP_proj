Hold everything
You've got to if you need to flow
I couldn't think
I was hoping on that nebula
Hold everything
I couldn't if you need to flow

I needed him
But Lord, you know it's sin to sin
Hold everything
When will you notice that it's ... ?
When will you go?
When will you see
That we are on our own
Let go of everything
You know it's only ...

Shower me with kisses blue
Don't do those things
Ooh that the other people do
Let it lie, I feel fine
Empower me all the time

You know that I feel fine
You know you want to use it
You know that I feel fine
And I know you won't abuse it

I hope everyday's gonna feel like this
And hope everyday i'm gonna use it
