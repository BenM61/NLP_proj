Let it hang out baby, let it hang out now, now na-na now
Let it hang out baby, everybody work out

Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue

Let it hang out baby, do the Baltimore jig
Let it hang out baby, boomerang with me

Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue

Really got it bad child, drink a bottle of turpentine
When you wake up in the morning, feelin' kinda fine
Let it hang out baby, let it hang out now, now na-na now

You better watch your step girl, don't step on that banana peel
Now if your foot should ever hit it, you'll go up to the ceiling

Hang it in baby, hang it in baby
Hang it in baby, hang it in baby
Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue

Let it hang out baby, let it hang out now, now na-na now
Let it hang out baby, everybody work out

Hang it in baby, hang it in baby
Hang it in baby, hang it in baby
Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue
