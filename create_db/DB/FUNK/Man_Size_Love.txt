Standing in the shadows 
Calling out his name 
Who wants to play my game 
Baby can't you hear me? 
Don't you feel my fire? 

I've got more than you can handle 
All that you could want 
Boy you'll be a winner 
If you turn me on 
Come and be my lover 
Stay with me tonight 

I want a man size love 
Passion and control of my tenderness 
Baby won't you hold me 
Show me, can you show me what a man size love is 
Give me a king size kiss 
Thrill me with the things that I understand 
Can't you see I need it 
Show me you're a man size man 

Anytime you're ready 
I'll be waiting here 
Longing for the magic 
Of the night well share 
Wrap yourself around me 
Baby let me know 

I've got dreams that I can give you 
Arms to hold you tight 
Sunshine in the morning 
And the stars all night 
Once I show you heaven 
Boy you'll never let it go 

I want a man size love 
Passion and control of my tenderness 
Baby won't you hold me 
Show me, can you show me what a man size love is 
Give me a king size kiss 
Thrill me with the things that I understand 
Baby can't you feel it? 
You can hold my heart in your hand 
Give me a man size man 

Listen 
Well find a rainbow 
Where well go 
And well love the night away 
Bring me your action 
Of passion 
Before it gets to late 

I want a man size love 
Passion and control of my tenderness 
Baby won't you hold me 
Show me, can you show me what a man size love is 
Give me a king size kiss 
Thrill me with the things that I understand 
Baby can't you feel it? 
You can hold my heart in your hand 
Give me a man size love
