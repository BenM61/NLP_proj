Stars leave the morning 
Sleep clouds my view 
Don't let them come round here 
And call to you 
I didn't notice 
It's a crime too few 
I didn't know it's 
It's a crime to feel 

And I tried to sleep alone 
But I couldn't do it 
You could be sitting next to me 
And I wouldn't know it 
If I told you you were wrong 
I don't remember saying 
I don't remember saying 
I don't remember saying 

I'll be a shadow 
In the cedar room 
And leave just a memory 
Alone with you 
I didn't see that 
It's a call too soon 
I couldn't see that 
It's a call to you 

And I tried to sleep alone 
But I couldn't do it 
You could be sitting next to me 
And I wouldn't know it 
If I told you you were wrong 
I don't remember saying 
I don't remember saying 
I don't remember saying
