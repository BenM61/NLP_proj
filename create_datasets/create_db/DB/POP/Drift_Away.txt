Day after day I'm more confused
I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginin' to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin' on you to carry me through

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

And when my mind is free
You know your melody can move me
When I'm feelin' blue
The guitars come through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You helped me along, you're makin' me strong

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Give me the beat boys and free my soul (free my soul)
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away (drift away, I wanna drift away)
Give me the beat boys and free my soul (free my soul, free my soul)
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

(Come on and take me, take me) Give me the beat boys and free my soul 
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away (free my soul, free my soul)
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away (wanna drift away, drift away)

Give me the beat boys and free my soul (give me the beat boys)
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
