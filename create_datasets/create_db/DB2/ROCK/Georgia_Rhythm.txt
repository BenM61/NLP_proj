Livin' out of a suitcase
Sleepin' in hotel rooms
Rental cars and airport bars
And dog day afternoons
My occupation is a picker
And music is my game
Sometimes it makes me crazy
But I would not change a thing

So, lay down a back beat
And crank up your trusty Gibson, son
Let's give it everything we got just one more time
Lovin' the life we're livin'
Playin' that Georgia rhythm
Nothin' else ever made me feel so fine

Four o'clock in the morning
Waitin' for a plane
We passed around the bottle, Lord,
And we don't feel no pain
Life out here on the highway
Has its ups and downs
But last night the Georgia rhythm
Tore up another town

So, lay down a back beat
Crank up your trusty Gibson, son
Let's give it everything we got just one more time
We are lovin' the life we're livin'
Playin' that Georgia rhythm
Nothin' else ever made me feel so fine

Rising above the madness
Homeward bound again
To normal ways and lazy days
And old familiar friends
Some conversation with my lady
Some love long overdue
God knows I hate to leave her
But I got a job to do

So lay down a back beat
Crank up your trusty Gibson, son
Let's give it everything we got just one more time,
We are lovin' the life we're livin'
Playin' that Georgia rhythm
Nothin' else ever made me feel this fine

Let's give it everything we got just one more time
