Want to get it all behind me
You know everything reminds me
I can't be myself without you
Want to crawl down deep inside
The springs inside the mattress
Where I cry my dirty secrets
'Cause I just can't shake this feeling
That I'm nothing in your eyes

And if I knew heartbreak was coming
I would've set out running
Past the city houses
And the ditches on the highway
Weave between the seasons
Under bridges in the valley
'Til the winds out on the prarie
Whipped the tears from my eyes

Want to get it all behind me
You know everything reminds me
I can't be myself without you
Want to crawl down deep inside
The springs inside the mattress
Where I cry my dirty secrets
'Cause I just can't shake this feeling
That I'm nothing in your eyes

Well if I knew heartbreak was coming
I would've set out running
Across the muddy river
And the smokestacks on the bank
Swallow that horizon
Hunger beyond hunger
'Til the cloudy blue Pacific
Took the air in my lungs

And if I knew heartbreak was coming
I would've set out running
'Cause I just can't shake this feeling
That I'm nothing in your eyes
