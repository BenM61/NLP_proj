When the little blue bird who has never said a word
Starts to sing, "Spring, spring"
When the little blue bell in the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring, "Ting, ting"

When the little blue clock in the middle of his work
Sings a song to the moon up above
It is nature that's all
Simply telling us to fall in love

And that's why birds do it
Bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

In Spain, the best
Upper sets do it
Lithuanians and letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the fins
Folks in Siam do it
Think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines
Without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Sponges
They say, "Do it"
Oysters down in oyster bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold cape cod clams
Against their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish, do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks 'em I know why ask if shad do it
Waiter bring me bring me shad roe
Come on and bring me, bring me shad roe

In shallow shoals
English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Now if the birds and the bees and the trees do it
The monkeys and the birds, bees do it
In, in water gates they quarrel but they do it
And if they can make up and still do it baby, how about me and you?

Hey let's do it now
Let's do it, let's fall in love
