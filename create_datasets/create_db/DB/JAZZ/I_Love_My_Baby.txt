I love my baby, my baby loves me
Don't know nobody as happy as we
She's only twenty and I'm twenty one
We never worry, we're just havin' fun

Sometimes we quarrel and maybe we fight
But then we make up the following night
When we're together we're great company
I love my baby, my baby loves me

I love my baby, my baby loves me
We're hotsy-totsy, why shouldn't we be
She gives me kisses, each one is a smack
But you should hear 'em when I give 'em back

Sometimes we quarrel and maybe we fight
But then we make up the following night
When we're together we're great company
I love my baby, my baby loves me
