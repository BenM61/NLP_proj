You're still clutching that bottle of wine
Like it's the fucking essence of your heart and your mind
You tell me that you're engaged, so we're on the same page
I don't give a f*ck, girl, tell me is it Tuesday?
'Cause I need to pick up my son in the morning
I ain't got no time to be listen to your stories
I know that you're beautiful, I know that you're hot
So you got a lot of problems that these other girls do not
Chilling at your spot with a couple friends of mine
Tell me how you'd like to spend the time
She says let's go to the roof
I'll show you how I feel if you ever needed proof
A kiss on the lips, hands on her hips
She's taking a sip, the alcohol drips

Monday night, I'm tired as always
This girl's alright 'cause I don't require knowledge
For just one night
I'll turn that blind eye, I be Prince Charles' Princess Diana
Sitting on your rooftop
Watching the moon drop
Your hand in mine
Here comes the sunshine

Sex on my mind, I look at the clock 
And there's just no time she's touching my stuff
Push and rewind, kush in the grind
Durrr, she's so fine, you could never mind her
I gotta go
Tomorrow there's a late session in the studio
She says no, you should stick around
We could have some fun I won't make a sound 
'Cause your best friend passed out puking in the bedroom
Now she's got her ass up, girl, I need some headroom
I can see the light, I say good morning but it's

Permanent midnight

It's Monday night, I'm tired as always, this girl's alright
'Cause I don't require knowledge for just one night
I'll turn that blind eye, I be Prince Charles' Princess Diana
Sitting on your rooftop, watching the moon drop
Your hand in mine, here comes the sunshine
Sitting on your rooftop, watching the moon drop
Your hand in mine, here comes the sunshine
