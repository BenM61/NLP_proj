Sitting here in limbo
But I know it won't be long
Sitting here in limbo
Like a bird without a song
Well, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the dice to roll
Sitting here in limbo
Got some time to search my soul
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I don't know where life will lead me
But I know where I've been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I've seen
Tried my hand in love and friendship
But all that is past and gone
This little boy is moving on

Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the tide to flow
Oh, I'm sitting here in limbo
Knowing that I have to go
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the dice to roll
Sitting here in limbo
I got some time to search my soul
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting in limbo, sitting in limbo
Sitting in limbo (sitting, sitting in limbo)
Sitting in limbo (sitting, sitting in limbo)
Waiting for the dice to roll (sitting, sitting in limbo)
Sitting-sitting in limbo
