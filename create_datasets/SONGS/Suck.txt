You want to do it like they do it on TV
You'd be important if you were famous, oh please
Try a little more then try a little harder
Trying not to think is harder than you think

So just leave the motor running, throw away the fucking key
You fucked up from the beginning
Celebrate stupidity, down on your knees
Suck my rock, suck my rock

You still do it like it's straight to video
If you were famous you'd be better for sure
Try a little more then try a little harder
Trying not to look is harder than it seems

So just leave the motor running, throw away the fucking key
You fucked up from the beginning
Celebrate stupidity, down on your knees
Suck my rock, suck my rock

Cut twice before you measure
Don't look either way
Who wants to live forever
When dying is on sale today

You want to do it without dignity or shame
15 seconds later we won't know your name
Try a little more then try a little harder
Trying not to fall is not trying at all

So just leave the motor running, throw away the fucking key
You fucked up from the beginning
Celebrate stupidity, down on your knees
Suck my rock, down on your knees, suck my rock
