It keeps you up
From the back of your mind
To the tip of your tongue
Reaching out lookin for mine

I'll be your cigarette
Light me up and get on with it
I'll be hard to forget
Good or bad I'm just a habit
Good or bad I'm just your habit

Sweet relief
That's what you come and get from me
I give up everytime
You want it you got it I'm burnin down

I'll be your cigarette
Light me up and get on with it
I'll be hard to forget
Good or bad I'm just a habit
Good or bad I'm just your habit

And you try to put me down
Everytime you come back around
And you try to put me away
Tell yourself you'll kick it someday

I'll be your cigarette
Light me up and get on with it
I'll be hard to forget
Good or bad I'm just a habit
Good or bad I'm just your habit
