Gettin' a message? A message for me
I'm caught up in love, and I'm in ecstasy
What can I do now, when nothing's the same?
And all that I know, I wanna do it again, well tell me now
Life is so simple when you are with me
'Cause when we're together, I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy

Everybody go!
All you pretty things, get on board this mothership
All you've got to be is ready for action, baby

Don't think I'm twisted, as a matter of fact
Welcome me now to the second act
Well I fought off robots, and a man in a suit
Wear off the soles of your monkey boots, well tell me now
I can't get enough of the sunshine
I can't get enough of the moonlight
And all the colors that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on
Trying to hold on
Can't get enough of the oceans
Can't get enough of the mantra
All we will feel is ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy

Everybody go!
All you pretty things, get on board this mothership, I said
All you've got to be is ready for action, baby

Well tell me now
I can't get enough of the sunshine
I can't get enough of the moonlight
And all the colors that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on
Trying to hold on
Can't get enough of the oceans
Can't get enough of the mantra
All we will feel is ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy

Everybody go!
All you pretty things, get on board this mothership, I said
All you've got to be is ready for action, baby
Ready for action, baby
Ready for action, baby
