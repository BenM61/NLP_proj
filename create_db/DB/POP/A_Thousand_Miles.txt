Making my way downtown walking fast faces pass
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I need you and I miss you and now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky do you think time
Would pass me by cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me

'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you and I miss you and now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky do you think time
Would pass me by, oh cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't want to let you know I, I drown in your memory I,I don't want to let this go
I, I don't

Making my way down town waking fast faces pass
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead making my way making a way
Through the crowd

And I still need you and I still miss you and now I wonder if I could fall into the sky do you
Think time, would pass us by cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you now

If I could fall into the sky do you think time would pass me by cause you know I'd walk a thousand
Miles if I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight
