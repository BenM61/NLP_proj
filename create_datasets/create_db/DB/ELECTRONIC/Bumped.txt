All I needed was your love
Even now it's obvious
All I needed was a turtle dove to make it right
Chattanooga, Tennessee
One night on a Tuesday
Friday Sunset Babylon
I bumped in to you
Grabbed the first cab that I saw
But lost my destination
Looking at deserted streets
I bumped in to you

All I needed was your love
Even now it's obvious
All I needed was a turtle dove to make it right
All I needed was your touch
Closer now be obvious
All I needed was a gentle push to paradise

Saturday in Timbuktu
Monday in Bulawayo
Slow boat takes me to Kowloon
I bumped in to you
Sailing down the Amazon
Even up the Nile
Late night bars in Buffalo
I bumped in to you

All I needed was your love
Even now it's obvious
All I needed was a turtle dove to make it right
All I needed was your touch
Closer now be obvious
All I needed was a gentle push to paradise

All I needed was your love
Even now it's obvious
All I needed was a turtle dove to make it right
All I needed was your touch
Closer now be obvious
All I needed was a gentle push to paradise

All I needed
All I needed was your love
All I needed
All I needed was your love

Saturday in Tumbuktu
Monday Bulawayo
Got a sense of deja-vu
Oh

All I needed was your love
Even now it's obvious
All I needed was a turtle dove to make it right
All I needed was your touch
Closer now be obvious
All I needed was a gentle push to paradise

All I needed
All I needed was your love

All I needed was your love
Even now it's obvious
All I needed was a turtle dove to make it right
