I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far, that's okay because you know
I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me that's okay because you know
I hear the making up's fun
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Say "Where's the faucet?"
Someone's knocking like they know but
Baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

Well I got your sweet little twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice because you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree, they don't understand
You're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Say "Where's the faucet?"
Someone's knocking like they know but
Baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light (light, light)
And girl you know

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

How do I even explain what I've got with you
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody will ever understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me, 'cause there's only one me and you, yeah
There's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
There's only one me and you

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I tried
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride
Ooh, I can't make them understand
But you know I'm a southern man
A man of the woods and you're my pride
A man of the woods is my pride
Now let the beat ride like
