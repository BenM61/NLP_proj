Money, who needs it
Let me live a life free and easy
Put a toothbrush in my hand
Let me be a travelling man
I'm a roadrunner, baby
Roadrunner
Roadrunner
I'm a road runner baby, 
Can't stay in one place too long 
I'm a road runner, 
You might look at me 
And I'll be gone 
Well you can love me if you wanna 
But I do declare 
When I get restless 
I got to move somewhere 
Yes, I'm a road runner baby, 
Anywhere is my home 
And I love the life I live 
And I'm gonna live the life I love 
Roadrunner baby 
Roadrunner Roadrunner 
Don't want no woman to tie me down 
Gotta be free baby to roam around 
All my life I've been like this 
You can love me at your own risk 
When the dust hits my shoes 
I got the urge to move 
'Cause I'm a road runner baby, 
Gotta keep on, keepin' on
 And I live the life I love 
And I'm gonna love the life I live 
Roadrunner baby
 Roadrunner Roadrunner
