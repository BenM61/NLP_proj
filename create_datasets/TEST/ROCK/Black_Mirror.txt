I walk down to the ocean
After waking from a nightmare
No moon, no pale reflection

Black mirror, black mirror
Shot by a security camera
You can't watch your own image
And also look yourself in the eye

Black mirror, black mirror, black mirror
I know a time is coming
All words will lose their meaning
Please show me something that isn't mine
But mine is the only kind that I relate to

Le mirroir casse
The mirror casts mon reflet partout

Black mirror, black mirror, black mirror
The black mirror knows no reflection
It knows not pride or vanity
It cares not about your dreams
It cares not for your pyramid schemes
Their names are never spoken
The curse is never broken
The curse is never broken

Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: mirroir noir!
Black mirror!
Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: mirroir noir!
Black mirror!

Black mirror
Black Mirror

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me where them bombs will fall
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me where them bombs will fall

Black mirror!
Black mirror!
Black mirror!
Black mirror!
Black mirror!
Black mirror!
Black mirror!
