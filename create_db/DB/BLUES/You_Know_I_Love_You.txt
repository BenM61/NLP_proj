Now Darlin' you know I love you,
And love you, for myself
But you're gone,and left me for someone else

I think of you, every morning
I dream of you, every night, and with love,
To be with you always

When night began to fall,
I cry, alone
And I wish, I can hold you in my arms tonight

Oh, darlin', you know I love you,
And love you, for myself
But you're gone, and left me for someone else
