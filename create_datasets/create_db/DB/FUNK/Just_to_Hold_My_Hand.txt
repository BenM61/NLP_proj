I want to know do you love me?
Tell me do you care?
Will you let me hold you baby?
Take you anywhere?
Tell me, will you let me be, let me be your friend?
Will you let me hold you?
Until then, yeah, don't you know baby
That the truth is the lie?
Ask yourself, dear, if you're doing me right
Cause I want to love you
Oh but not just to let you sit, sit and hold my hand
Baby, just hold my hand
Now I want to love you, oh but not just to let you sit
Sit and hold my hand, baby just hold my hand

When I first met you, we took a long long walk
While we were walkin baby, we had a long long talk
I told you how I wanted you, and all the things I'd do
If you'd only prove that you loved me too
Yeah, I want to tell you how it thrills, a how it thrills me
To call your name
If we don't make it, you've got yourself to blame
Cause I'm gonna love you, oh but not just to let you sit
Sit and hold my hand
Sit and hold my hand
Sit and hold my hand....
