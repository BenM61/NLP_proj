Come
Closer
Feel what you've been dyin' for
Don't be afraid, baby
Touch it and explode
Understand, understand that I love you
Oh, but more than that, I want you
Everybody always told me 
"Good things come to those who wait"
But I've got so much on the menu
I just can't, I just can't, I can't wait baby
I can't wait baby 
I can wrap my legs all around you girl
'Cause sugar, you know you're just the kind of lover
That I've been looking for
Tonight why don't we skip all the for play, mama
And just get down here on the floor

Scandalous
I'm talkin' about you and me
Marvelous
Baby, baby, can't you see
Anything you've ever dreamed of
I'm willing to be
Tonight it's gonna be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be your fantasy

My dearest
My dearest

Whisper
Whisper a question
With my body (body) I'll scream a reply
Anything's acceptable
Just ask me and I'll try it
To hell with hesitation
To hell with the reasons why

Scandalous
I'm talkin' about you and me
Marvelous, baby, baby, can't you see
Anything you've ever dreamed of
I'm willing to be
Tonight it's gonna be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be your fantasy

Baby
Baby
Baby

Oh girl, the things you make me do!
Genius is the only way to describe you
Anything you've ever dreamed of, baby
Just ask me, I'll do, I'll do
I'll do it for you, baby

Anything at all
Spirits rise and spirits fall
Anything you ever dreamed off, I'm willing to be
Tonight is gonna be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm, tonight I'm gonna be your fantasy

Scandalous
Talkin' about you and me
Marvelous, baby, baby, can't you see
Anything you've ever dreamed of
I'm willing to be
Tonight it's gonna be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be your fantasy

Scandalous
