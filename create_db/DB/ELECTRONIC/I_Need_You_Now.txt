I'm fine, don't believe it
You know me enough to know that's a lie
I'm close, hard as it is to say
To total disaster, barely holding on

I need you now
I need you now, don't turn away
I need you now, oh, please don't turn me away
I need you now, I need you now

Out here where I've been spinning
It's nearly impossible to slow down
One night of your company
Might be the only thing to keep me sane

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
(Don't turn me away)
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
(Don't turn me away)

I need you now
I need you now, don't turn away
I need you now, ohh, please don't turn me away
I need you now, I need you now

How many times have I come to you vulnerable like this?
I know you have the right to question, but please don't ask
I need you now

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
(Oh, I need you now)
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
(Don't turn me away)
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
(Don't turn me away)
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming

I need you now
I need you now, don't turn away
I need you now, ohh, please don't turn me away
I need you now

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming 
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming 

I need you now, I need you now, I need you now
