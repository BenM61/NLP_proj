Like a cloud
Ushered in by wind
You were just a reaction to my confusion
A hybrid of hundreds of troubles
People felt us connect and ran for shelter

And there are blackouts in L.A. tonight
There's an evident lack of light tonight
An increase in desire
You'll catch me
Hanging out on a wire
Cutting the voltage to your power line
(And the lights go out)

Like a love
Ushered in by bliss
You came to me like a realization
But your look could sharpen a knife
Now all I hear is tearing of paper

And there are blackouts in L.A. tonight
An evident lack of light tonight
An increase in desire
You'll catch me
Hanging out on a wire
Cutting the voltage to your power line
(And the lights go out)

Now you
Cannot affect me
I feel
No electricity
Now you
Cannot control me
I feel
No electricity

(And the lights go out)
And there are blackouts in L.A. tonight
There's an evident lack of light tonight
An increase in desire
You'll catch me
Hanging out on a wire
Cutting the voltage to your power line
(And the lights go out)
