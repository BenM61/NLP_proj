The one who's watchin' over my shoulder get a life!
I see your arms are nailed to the cross, but your eyes are so alive
I never thought you're lying but now it's turned around
So many hearts are dying you let them down
Over and over again

Can't reach you, can't meet you
I give you everything I've got
You hear me, don't leave me
It's my message to you, God
Can't see you, can't feel you
I've lost just everything I've got
Forget me, you've left me
It's my message to you, God 

We're busy burnin' witches the way we learned from you
We're good at killing creatures, so teach us something new, come on!
One of your own creations is kind of hard to understand
You, freak of nature - just tell me why did you create us man?

Traces on the floor, I can't hear the door closing me
Right inside my dream, it's a sign from him let me be
Sunrise through the dust future is the past chasin' me
Shadows on the wall, voices down the halls calling me
Over and over again
