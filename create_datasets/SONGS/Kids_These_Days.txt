There's something about the thing that you just said
There's a dialogue for the dead it's in your head
I would like to believe so, flower made long ago
You were soft and easy with your flow

Oh, oh, man, kids these days, I heard you say
Don't know how to move slow
Oh, oh, man, kids these days, I heard you say
Don't know how to move slow

There's a melody I hum that no one wrote
You got a way with words that makes me drop the phone
Cigarettes and the TV set, collecting dust, collecting debt
I gotta make a point, remember not to forget

Oh, oh, man, kids these days, I heard you say
Don't know how to move slow
Oh, oh, man, kids these days, I heard you say
Don't know how to move slow
Oh, oh, man kids these days

And I know and I know and I know and I know
When it's right, it's right, it's right
And I know and I know and I know and I know
When it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong

And I know and I know and I know and I know
When it's right, it's right, it's right
And I know and I know and I know and I know
When it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong

And I know and I know and I know and I know
When it's right, it's right, it's right
And I know and I know and I know and I know when

Oh, oh, man, kids these days, I heard you say
Don't (don't) know how to move slow (know how to move slow you say)
Oh, oh, man, kids these days, I heard you say
Don't (don't) know how to move slow (know how to move slow you say)
Oh, oh, man kids these days (man kids these days)
