What is this beautiful thing we've found
It's so shiny, bright & round
So I went into town
And bought a little patch of ground
And I put a shop on top
And bought myself some stock
Oh, my little cornershop
Oh, my little cornershop
Oh I'm so happy I could scream
In my little store on the green
Where everything is fine
Where everything is fine
So fine
I found some corrugated steel
And banged it to the window with my heel
And now nobody's going to get in
After half past ten in the evening
In the evening...
Oh my 2nd little
Oh my 3rd little
Oh my 4th little...cornershop
Oh my 5th little
Oh my 6th little
Oh my 7th little..cornershop
Oh I'm so happy I could scream
In my 8th little store on the green
Where everything is fine
