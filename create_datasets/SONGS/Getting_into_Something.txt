I'm getting into something
You got me into something good
Like I knew you would
I'm moving into something
You move me into something easy
And it pleases me
Took me by surprise
I never saw the light
Until you turned it on
You got me into something
God knows I'm hitting on life
And I wonder why the sun ain't shining where you are you know
It's alright baby it ain't over
Oh it's only ours to loose
What is gone well we can't use together
So it's alright baby it ain't over
I didn't mean to hurt you

I'm getting into something
You got me into something wild
And I'm getting high
I'm pulling into something
You pull me into something deeper
Oh it's deeper now
Took me by surprise
I never thought that I would give it out again
You got me into something
God knows I wanna be as close as I'll ever be
Something's getting into me
You know it's alright baby it ain't over
Oh it's only ours to loose
What is gone well we can't use together
So it's alright baby it ain't over
I didn't mean to hurt you
It was nothing
I was dreaming
But I'd rather live believing

The time you got addictive
I was somewhere getting used
When you were self-abusive
I put out and got abused
With you I don't feel the need to qualify my life
Lets get it on before it's gone
Just meet me at the corner cos it's alright

Baby it ain't over
Oh it's only ours to loose
What is gone well we can't use together
So it's alright baby it ain't over
I didn't mean to hurt you
It was nothing
I was dreaming
But I'd rather live believing
