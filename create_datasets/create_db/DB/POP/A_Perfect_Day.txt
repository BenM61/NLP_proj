The sun has set and golden clouds
Gleaming in the evening sky
I must confess, I'd always hoped
Today would pass me by

Oh dad, I really hate to see
The sadness in your eyes
We always knew this day would come
It can't be a surprise

We had a special day together
You were always my best friend
But the princess and the old king
Knew this day would end

A perfect day, a perfect day with you
Just a perfect day of perfect hours, no other word would do
A perfect day, a day for you and I
Now the evening shadows chill my heart and I can't say goodbye

It was always I who said, "I'll see you soon"
When you were young
So many things we left unsaid
So many songs unsung

Dad, don't worry now I'm grown
It'll be okay
You taught me well, so trust me now
And I'll be on my way

We had a special day together
You were always my best friend
But the princess and the old king
Knew this day would end

A perfect day, a perfect day with you
Just a perfect day of perfect hours, no other word would do
A perfect day, a day for you and I
Now the evening shadows chill my heart and I can't say goodbye

A perfect day, a day for you and I
Now the evening shadows chill my heart and I can't say
I'm leaving home, goodbye
