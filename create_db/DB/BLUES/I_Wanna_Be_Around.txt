I want to be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I
Somebody who will swear to be true like you used to do with me
Just keep on giving us love and we can sing our songs
Because of you (you, you , you, you)
You touched our souls and then sparked this melody
And that's why
We're singing this symphony especially for you

I want to be around to see how he does it when he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits, so fine
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
That's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Like you, like you broke mine
