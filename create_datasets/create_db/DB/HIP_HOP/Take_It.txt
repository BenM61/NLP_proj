[Chorus]
Shake it I want to see you shake it 
I ain't gon' fake it I want to see you naked it
Girl you got figure make a nigga want to taste it
Lay your face on the pillow cases 
And see if you can take it

Yeah dis cat in the business
600 on the back of my benzes 
It's nothin
I lay back in my drop and get my roll on
I took my old jon back to the lot like take it
And my shit be mind blown
Big face watch 5 different time zones
And they ain't rinestones
They a couple of thou
And this just one of my styles so take it

[Chorus]

Daddy you know I want to shake it
The way I shake it make you want to break it

Ain't nothin' stop frontin' what's poppin' boo
If you want it all you got to do is come take it

Daddy I know you gon' make it
And when you make it you still gon' take it

Stand up if you makin' somethin'
Stand up if you takin' somethin' OK?

Some niggas want to live this life but can't live it
I know what it's like to want it and can't get it
I know what it's like to be broke
That's why every time I get a good price on a shit
I'ma take it
Everything I write is a quote
And for that butta you be bitin the toast
I'm back on my grissel and my raps official
Any chance I get to clap my shit man i'ma take it
You should ride for ya man and if worst come to worst
You should die for ya man
But if I run up and pull it and shoot at your man
Would you jump in front of the bullet and take it

[Chorus]

If it ain't one thing damn it's anotha'
Hand in hand I sold grams of butta
Man I was drug dealin 'cause I love the feelin' of handin' a couple grand
To my motha like take it
Look I'm off the chain
I get all the bitches all the brain
My sound goin' down in the hall of fame
And all y'all gon' call the name Cassidy
And i'ma take it flip it bounce it and switch it up
I take herbs by tha ounces and twist it up
Listen up wit the mic in my hand it's like I got ya life in my hands and
Ima take it

[Chorus]

Take it!
