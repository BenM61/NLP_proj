[VERSE 1:]
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She'lost in peaceful dreams
So I turned out the light
As I lay there in the dark
And a thought crosses my mind
If I never wake in the morning
Will she ever doubt
The way I feel about her, in my heart

[CHORUS:]
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
She's my only one.
If my time on earth were through
She must face this world without me
So the love I gave her in the past
Would it be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes.

[VERSE 2:]
Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret, that my true feelings for them
never were revealed,
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where's no second chance
to tell her how I feel

[CHORUS:]
If tomorrow never comes
will she know how much I loved her,(how much I loved her)
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
she's my only one.
If my time on earth were through
She must face this world without me
So the love I gave her in the past
Would it be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
So tell it to someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes.
