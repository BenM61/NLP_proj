I can sign for one, two
Or three or four
Get three weeks off in a year or more
Save up and get my very own SLR
'Cause I can drive my very own tank
Yes, I can

Can you see the bullet's high velocity
It can blow a man's arm off
At the count of three
If I get my hands on one of those
I'm something to watch out for
'Cause I can drive my very own tank
Yes, I can

Don't care whereabouts, they send me now
Send picture postcards
To my old mother and father
So when I get home
They'll have someone to be proud of
'Cause I can drive my very own tank
Yes, I can, yes, I can maim
