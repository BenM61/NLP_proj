Lovable!
There's no use talking,
You're so lovable!
When we go walking I throw out my chest,
Say, you're the best;
Others just imitate
Kisses that you create!

Lovable!
You got a way of epttin'
That just drives me wild!
Say!
Heaven above-able,
Made you so lovable,
Love me, lovable child!
