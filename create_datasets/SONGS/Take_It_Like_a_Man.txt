I get a little bit ambitious
That's why you love me
Because you can't resist it
You'd do anything for me

You want out but we're off the ground
So pick up your parachute
Cause I'm not gonna let you down
I won't let you get away, not that easy anyway

I know what I want and I want you for the cause
How does anybody get anything done? You depend on us
But you'll never get to heaven as the radical son
Just keep it up, you soldier

You want out, I can't help
I've got to make you understand
You gotta take it like a man

Do you need a dozen roses?
Would you like a box of chocolate?
Is it really such a deep cut?
That I have to come and stitch it up?

Yeah, I get a little crazy with the razor blades
Go on and call your mama if you need a band aid
But everything worth it, hurts a little bit
You don't want to run away and I won't let you anyway

Cause we're doing it for the cause
How do you suppose I get anything done? You're making it so hard
Cause you'll never get to heaven as the radical son
Just keep it up, you soldier

You want out, I can't help
I've got to make you understand
You gotta take it like a man

I want you for the cause
How does anybody get anything done? You depend on us
You'll never get to heaven as the radical son
Don't be running off 'cause this is love

What did you think it was?
Ooh, the thing is love, love
So don't go

You want out, I can't help
I've got to make you understand
You gotta take it like a man

Take it like a man
You gotta take it like a man
You gotta take it like a man
