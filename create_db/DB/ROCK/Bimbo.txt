Does your mommy know 
That your going down the road 
To see a little girly oh

Bimbo, is a little boy 
Who's got a million friends
And every time he passes by 
They all invite him in
He'll clap his hands 
And sing and dance 
And talk his baby talk
With a hole in his pants 
And his knees stick out 
He's just big enough to walk

Bimbo got two big blue eyes
Hat light up like a star
And the way to light them up 
Is to buy him candy bars
Cracker jack and bubble gum 
Will start his day off right
All the girlies follow him 
Just to beg him for a bite

When you going to grow
Everybody loves you little baby bim B O

You never catch him sitting still
He's just the roving kind 
All though he just a little boy 
He's got a grown up mind
He's always got a shaggy dog 
A pulling at his clothes
And everybody calls to him 
As down the street he goes
