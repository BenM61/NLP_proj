Lately she's found the strength to go out 
And have some fun
It hasn't been long since love went wrong
And they broke up
There's no diamond on her finger
Just a lingerin' memory
And a ring where a ring used to be

There's a ring where a ring used to be
She's still chained to the man who set her free
A circle that would join them for all eternity
Is just a ring (just a ring)
Where a ring (where a ring) 
Used to be

You think you know her well enough
To take her home
She likes you too but you'd better learn
You've got to go slow
You can hold her but you can't touch her
The closer, and you'll see
There's a ring (there's a ring)
Where a ring (where a ring) 
Used to be

There's a ring where a ring used to be
She's still chained to the man who set her free
A circle that would join them for all eternity
Is just a ring (just a ring)
Where a ring (where a ring) 
Used to be
just a ring (just a ring)
Where his ring (where his ring)
Used to be
