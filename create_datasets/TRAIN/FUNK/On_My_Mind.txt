Mind, mind, you think I would
Mind, you think I would, mind
Mind, you think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh, my mind
Mind, mind, you think I would
Mind, you think I would, mind
Mind, you think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh, my mind

Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Mind, mind, mind, mind

Why on earth would I leave
If you were everything I wanted you to be?
When I saw what you did, who you were with
Got me questionin' the things that I believe

So I ask myself, do I let you go?
Or do I keep you in the frame of my mind?
Now I'm growing wise to your sugar-coated lies
Nothing's sweet about my misery, yeah

I finally found what went wrong
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh
I finally found the wrong in you
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh
I finally found what went wrong
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh
I finally found the wrong in you
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh

Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Mind, mind, mind

You again, why'd you call?
I don't need to hear you cryin' out my name
Unlike before when you and I laid eye to eye
Now it's time for you to taste the bitter end

So I ask myself, do I let you go?
Or do I keep you in the frame of my mind?
Now I'm growing wise to your sugar-coated lies
Nothing's sweet about my misery, yeah

I finally found what went wrong
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh
I finally found the wrong in you
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh
I finally found what went wrong
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh
I finally found the wrong in you
You think I would mind
Oh, you think I, oh

Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
Don't want to feel you
Don't want you on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Mind, mind, mind
