[Chorus]
My leather so soft my top so soft
I probably have it off, these niggas so soft
And I go so hard
Bitch I go so hard, 
She said my leather so soft my top so soft
I probably have it off, these niggas so soft
And I go so hard
(Bitch I go so hard)

Yeah look
I get money ho f*ck what you talkin' 'bout
Straight out the slaughterhouse straight out the dragon's mouth
Fire you can't put out 
Tires are standin' out
The coupe look pigeon-toed 
I be in a different mode
I be wit' them different hoes 
No I mean them different hoes
I mean them Weezy bumbaclot different hoes
And as far as terrific goes
They kiss that dick wit' no mistletoe's
Diamonds and pearls and pussy holes 
Snortin' coke til they nose bleed
I'm sittin' high on them inches I'm in the nosebleeds
I'm on a paper chase, until my toes bleed
Then I get on these beats and let my soul bleed
I put 'em in ya head and watch the holes bleed
My rag always red, like when them hoes bleed
Now that's coldbleed, no I mean cold blooded
And I'm so southern that's why my leather so soft

[Chorus]

Nigga on the yacht smokin' Cohibas nigga, yeah!
She soft as a bush nigga she purple like kush nigga
We high on that money nigga we get it from cook nigga
Hit her wit' that crook nigga fuckin' wit' crooks nigga
Know we 'bout that money and we stackin' like books nigga
Know what I do nigga them teardrops is true nigga
We stay so fly ride Bentley coupes nigga
Rolls Royce ganishes and asses by the beaches
Blowin' on that puff and we drivin' foreign features
Higher than whoever nigga know we 'bout that cheddar nigga
Know I got a Tommy gun gave one to my young'n, son
And we got it together
Forty-seven fifty-one you gon' hear us when we come, daddy

[Chorus]

You see the paper gon' come 
If not I'm gon' get it
I gotta die wit' money 'cause I wasn't born wit 'it
It was 9-27
82 baby do Charity
Hospital aka the city zoo 
No pity due to no one 
Nobody not all man
They dropped us in the game and everybody's tryna ball
And the small hand'll touch ya 
The large hand'll cut ya
But until that day 
I'll be a motherfuckin' stunna, nigga

Ball 'til I fall I done did it for my dawgs
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for y'all
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for me nigga
Ball 'til I fall that's the way it's gon' be nigga
Up in the early I done did 'fore  sunshine
Candy on the paint every time I touch mine
Nine stay cocked 'cause I'm good wit' firin' mines
Alligator wit' the suede ridin' them 25's

[Chorus]

Yeah
