I've been missing you for so many days
I keep wanting you, Lord, in so many ways
I can't get you off of my mind
But true love is so hard to find

I want yet another day
Ooh, I need another day
Darling, let me have another day
And I can be anything that you want me to be,
Now, now, ooh

The sweet things you used to do to me
Sometimes, well, you used to say them to me
I can't forget those lovely days, now
But this is the price I'm about to pay

Ooh I want another day, Lord
You can let me have just one more day, yeah
Ooh I need one more day, yeah, Lord
And I will do anything that you want me to do,
Now, ooh my, ooh my, Lord

I will do anything that you want me to do, now
Say anything that you want me to say, yeah, yeah
Buy you anything you want me to buy
And I can cherish you till the day I die

If you let me have another day
Please let me have one more day
Ooh I want just one more day, Lord
And I can be everything that you want me to be

Ooh, ooh now, ooh
Just one more day, now no
You can let me have just another day, now
Please I want this day
And the day after and the day after
And I want all the days
I want all the days
And I want you here
And I want you here by my side
And I don't want you do leave me
And You can let me have one more day
And I can love you long for the rest of my life I can cry, cry, cry

Please, let me have just one more day
Just another day
Let me have all my days
Let me have, let me have all the days I gotta,
I Gotta I gotta have just all the days
