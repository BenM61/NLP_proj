Stars up in the sky
Said your heart won't lie to me
You speak and dreams are real
Free to follow what you feel

Close your eyes and see
Life's no mystery
Dreams become reality
Close your eyes and see

Sight of heart instead of mind
Open eyes still travel blind
We stumble in the dark
See things clearly with your heart

Close your eyes and see
Life's no mystery
Your dreams become reality
If you close your eyes and see

Come and fall through clouds of doubt
Fall through clouds of fear, clouds of fear
Fall into my arms baby
Touch this feeling, feeling's believin'

Follow your heart
Close your eyes and see
Life's no mystery
Dreams become reality

Close your eyes and see
See with you your heart
See with your spirit
Not with your mind, not with your eyes
Close your eyes
