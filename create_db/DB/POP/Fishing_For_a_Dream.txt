Let's go fishing for a dream
Let's find some place new
Somewhere we can be ourselves
Some of the time

Lose your heart, I lose my mind
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
Nothing is too good there for my girl
All of this world, is gonna see you shine

Let's do loneliness in style
Let's put on moonlight mile
And feel those radio waves flow
And don't say you won't...

Lose your heart, I lose my mind
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
Nothing is too good there for my girl
All of this world, is gonna see you shine

Oh lose your heart, and I'll lose my mind
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
Nothing is too good there for my girl
All of this world, is gonna see you shine
