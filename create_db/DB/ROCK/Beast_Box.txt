The beast box
The beast box

Elvis Presley's body perfectly preserved

There's a lot of stories going around
I don't think it's right
Are the neighbors really thinking
Like you and me?

I woke up this morning
As clear as a bell on Judgment Day
I think it came open yesterday
They've opened the beast box, haven't they?
They've upset the beast box, haven't they?

Beast box
Beast box
Beast box

In this dream I'm inside the beast box with my kid brother
And there are all these scenes of terrible suffering going on
And I'm starting to feel really, really ill

In a dream I'm inside
I'm with my kid brother
There are scenes of awful suffering
We're avoiding looking at each other

Then he's pointing to the handrail
It's long of burnished chrome
And saying in that stupid voice of his
Some of this would look really good
In the bathroom back home

I woke up this morning
As clear as a bell on Judgment Day
They've upset the beast box
They've opened the beast box, haven't they?

Beast box
Beast box

They've opened the beast box, haven't they?
