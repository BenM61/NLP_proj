(Bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
(Bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)
(Bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
(Bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)

Why don't you just go away
I can't seem to get my head straight
There's so much I need to say
It could take all day

Yeah, but what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Your bad mood just ties my hands
Turns my cartwheels into head stands
I've done everything I can
Gave all I have

Ever what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons why

You don't help me none
So warn down, so torn up
Still in love

Yeah, what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Woman, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)
Oh, baby, tell me why
