Yeah, I don't know why I got those type of blues tonight, but uh
Something, it's alright, something told me tonight to uh
Get it like I was gettin' it when I first started
And it's such a great pleasure to be on this show tonight Ladies and Gentleman
Tell uh, it's given me a thrill inside, you know, and I wish that
You may think I'm puttin' you on, but uh please believe me
For somehow or another,I hate to say this, but uh,
We get a better thrill out of playing over here then we do at home
So uh, haha, but uh, I must, thank you, I must say this that uh
Regardless to how an entertainer feel it are always the people that makes him feel okay
So that's why we always get the question asked us, during the course of a tour
Do you ever get lonesome by it for not beeing at home, you know
People can make you feel at home
And when I, thank you very much
And when I get that feeling like that I go be that and
Play a tune that goes something like this

Just ten years ago
People what I would do
No one would ever know
Just ten years ago
People how I would live my life
No one would ever know
The things that I think I would do
Ooo, no one will never know

I sit down in my dark room sometime
Tears rollin' down from my eyes
I sit down in my dark room
Tears rollin' down from my eyes
Yeah, play the blues
You know, I began to wonder
Oh, what makes a man like poor me cry

Well I might as well forget all about it
Lord and try to live my live just like it is
Lord I might as well forget all about it
And try to live my live just like it is
And you know I want to tell you people
Oh I would like to go back ten years

Play it on down for me now!

Yeah!
