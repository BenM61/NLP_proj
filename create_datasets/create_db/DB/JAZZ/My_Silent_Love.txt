I reach for you like I'd reach for a star
Worshipping you from afar
Living with my silent love

I'm like a flame dying out in the rain
Only the ashes remain
Smould'ring like my silent love

How I long to tell
All the things I have planned
Still, it's wrong to tell
You would not understand

You'll go along, never dreaming I care
Loving somebody, somewhere
Leaving me my silent love

You'll go along, never dreaming I care
Loving somebody, somewhere
Leaving me my silent love
