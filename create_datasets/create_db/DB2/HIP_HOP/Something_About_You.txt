How, how can it be
That a love carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate, could suffer so hard
From the game played much too often

And making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years, it's not so wrong
To be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

And there is something about you, baby, so right
I couldn't be without you, baby, tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one could say that
You didn't feel a million things
In a perfect dream of life

Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
Not so in love, it's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh, when you need to hear
The time that told the truth

There is something about you, baby, oh so right
Don't wanna be without you here tonight
And there is something about you, baby, oh so right
Don't wanna be without you here tonight

And there is something about you, baby, oh tonight
Don't wanna be without you here tonight

(Something about you, baby, oh so right)
It's what makes the world go round
It's what makes the rivers flow and
(Don't wanna be without you here tonight)

It's what makes the sparrows sing, and
It's what makes the flowers grow, and
(Something about you, baby, oh so right)

It's what gives the babies breath, and
It's what gives the sun its shine
(Don't wanna be without you here tonight)
It's what makes the Phillies play
