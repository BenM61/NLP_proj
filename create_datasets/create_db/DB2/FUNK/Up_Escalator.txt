From Sunset Boulevard to Chateau-lait
You've been a child of your age and you made it pay
It's dog eat dog, you're licking your lips
One more time snakehips, cash in your chips

On the up escalator
You're on the up escalator
But you're living in an upside down world

There's mother sick people turning up at your door
But your bodyguard explained
You don't live there no more
Your money is the lowest form of wit
As you bite the hand that feed's you for the hell of it

You're on the up escalator
And you like the way it feels
On the up escalator
There's alligators at your heels

Between the big and the bad times
It's just skinny little line
You're on the up escalator
But you're living in an upside down world

All of your life you've been shopping for redemption
Buy now, pay later

On the up escalator
You're on the up escalator
But you're living in an upside down world

Whoever steps in your way, they must be crushed
You've got everything worked out, but it can't be rushed
Shame, shame, your conscience kicks you again
Still there's plenty of things to help you numb the pain

You're on the up escalator
And you like the way it feels
On the up escalator
There's alligators at your heels

Between the big and the bad times
It's just skinny little line
You're on the up escalator
But you're living in an upside down world
