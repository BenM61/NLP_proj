This house used to feel so warm
The heater works but I'm chilled to the bone
Oh, this room never felt so big
There's not enough conversation to fill the empty spaces
Now how can you love someone and not know them at all?

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside

I talked, you used to hear me so well
Now all the best conversations are with myself
Oh I wish I knew what's pullin' you away
But the space that's grown between us gets a little bigger everyday
How can you love someone and not know them at all?

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside

It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise, oh yea
It's a thin disguise, livin' our life behind a thin disguise, yea
It's a thin disguise, yea yea
