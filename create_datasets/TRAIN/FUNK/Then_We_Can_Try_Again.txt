When the path of your heart's clear
And you let no one else near
Then we can try again
Don't wanna cry again
When your love for me is true,
Then I can surely depend on you
The we can try again
Don't wanna cry again

I'm leaving, but still hoping that you'll find a way
To bring me back to you and make me wanna stay
But you'll let an intruder break into, making me a loser
So I'm giving you some time
To decide things in your mind

On the day that you prove to me
That you can love with sincerity
Then we can try again
Don't wanna cry again
If you can patch up my broken world,
Make me believe I'm your only girl
Then we can try again
Don't wanna cry again

Boy, you made me blue and I'm leaving against my will
'Cause the day without you just makes my life stand still
But if it could help us be in love, I'll put my trust
And if love will prove how strong,
I'll come back where I belong

Ooh baby (then we can try again)
Ooh baby, baby (then we can try again)
Ooh (then we can try again)
Ooh baby (then we can try again)

When you make up your mind, then come
And tell me I'm your only one
Then we can try again
Don't wanna cry again, ooh
In a minute, I hear your voice
Telling me I'm your only choice
Then we can try again
Don't wanna cry again

When the path of your heart's clear
And you let no one else near
Then we can try again
Don't wanna cry again, ooh yeah
When your love for me is true,
Then I can surely depend on you
Then we can try again
Don't wanna cry again
