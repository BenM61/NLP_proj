I can't just sit around feeling upset
Dwelling on my loneliness
Maybe if I step out
Go get some sun
Maybe today I'll get something done
Kick off the covers
But I don't move
Even though I know what to do

I gotta sing it out, sing it all to myself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of me
And it's time to listen

I wanna be swallowed up
In an ocean of love
That's all I keep thinking of
But I can't make the water move
Water moves on its own
Gotta be okay for a while alone
Look out the window, feeling the glare
Wish I knew how to come up for air
But when I can't see the light
And I wanna hide
When I feel like I'm losing my mind

I gotta sing it out, sing it all to myself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of me
And it's time to listen

I'm so tired and I know why I spent too long
Trying to change all these thing I can't control
And now I finally let it go
Watch the sky open up and turn the fall into a dive
See that I'm gonna be just fine

Al I want is to feel strong
Well I know who I can count on

I gotta sing it out, sing it all to myself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of me
And it's time to listen

You gotta sing it out, sing it all to yourself
There's no one to run to
There's a voice inside of you
And it's time to listen
