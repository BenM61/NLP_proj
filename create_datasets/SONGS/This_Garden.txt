I never thought I'd see the day 
When you became what you've become
It's easy now just to look away
And leave your conscience on the run 
Spend so much time not looking for answers 
Someone else's to blame
As long as you don't take the drop 
To you it's all the same

Blood, sweat and tears
Really don't matter
Just the things that you do 
In this garden

Some time I like to get away
Chase a thought and fly 
The people here will never change 
They're too scared to look outside
Community spirit neighborhood watch 
Curtains twitching all the time 
Got to have a look at what next door's got
Cause your credit's on the line 

The other day I saw a fox
He was running for his life
His eyes were wide but his mind was shut
To the redcoat's bugle calls 
But when he got home his path was blocked
By some 'sportman's' clever guise 
And if this how far your culture's got
Then I deny it

The crackdown starts
The law descends and the nightmare starts again
Though they tighten the security net 
There's always one who gets away
