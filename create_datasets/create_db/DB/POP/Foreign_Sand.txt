Here we go, ain't it grand
Here we stand on foreign sand
And we're not alone

Why do we fear what we don't understand
Can't we reach out our hands to try to just say hello
Try to plant a seed, fulfill the need
To make it grow, just say hello
And when you're far from home try to learn from what you see
Your eyes will tell you everything you need

Why do we dread what we don't really know
Come not as concubine, come not as foe
Come with intentions clearly shown
Try to plant a seed, fulfill the need
To make it grow, just say hello
And though you're far from home try to learn from all you see
Your mind will tell you everything you need, everything you need

Here we go ain't it grand here we stand on foreign sand
And we're not alone
Red, yellow, black and white
Every man stand in the light, stand not alone

It's not a lie, it's not a sham we play for keeps, it's not a scam
No bigotry, we're hand in hand it ain't a cinch, we make a stand
We learn to live on foreign sand, just say hello

Why do we despise when we can't even speak
We keep on spreading lies
As far as we know it's the only way to be
Try to plant a seed, fulfill, the need
To make it grow, just say hello
And though you're far from home try to learn what you could be
Your heart will tell you everything you need
And though you're far from home try to learn what you could be
Your heart will tell you everything you need

Even though you stand, here you stand on foreign sand
Ain't it grand here we stand, on foreign sand
Together we stand, on foreign sand
Together we stand, here we stand
On foreign sand
