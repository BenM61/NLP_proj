THE GAUCHO SERENADE
Glenn Miller

Every night when the moon is shining
Bright down in Rio De Janiero
Comes a gent with a mellow instrument
And a colorful sombrero,
Then he sings and the melody he brings 
So tenderly played 
Is called the Gaucho Serenade.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 
Si, Senor he's a happy troubadour 
On a patio you'll find him.
Si Senor, he will go from door to door
Leaving happiness behind him.
All the sweet Senoritas hurry out to join the parade
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 
The Gaucho Serenade
