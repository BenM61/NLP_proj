Left the car at the petrol station
Standing there for all to see
There's the boat to see up
Starring back at me

I took a handful of all the people
Got to hear their minds and heard the screams
Always wrong
Sick of stuff and spill the dream

She is all around you, in you and me
Games of our own creation
Fall at our hands and feet

Stop the fight it's useless
You can always stand and ask for more
Always wrong
So tell me what you're fighting for

You can't stop the lights from turning on
Though these words brought back
They come hard and strong

You can't stop the lights from turning on
Though these words brought back
They come hard and strong

You can't stop the lights from turning on
Though these words brought back
They come hard and strong

You can't stop the lights from turning on
Though these words brought back
They come hard and strong

So don't look out the window
Be sure to lock your door
As she is coming for us
As we're sleeping on the floor

Tell your heart to reach for something more
All is wrong, watch people spill their dreams
Yes it's all around us, it's in you and me
The games that we created, fall at our hands and knees

Stop the fight it's over
We will watch others fall
It's freedom yet for granted
What on earth are we're fighting for

You can't stop the lights from turning on
Though these words brought back
They come hard and strong
It's the chemical make up biology

You can't stop the lights from turning on
Though these words brought back
They come hard and strong

You can't stop the lights from turning on
Though these words brought back
They come hard and strong

Stop the lights from turning
Stop the lights from turning on
Stop the lights from turning on
Stop the lights from turning

Stop the lights from turning on
Stop the lights from turning, stop the lights from turning on, stop the lights from turning
