i remember
leaves were falling down in St.Germain
it was a cold november
you went away
an' i got a dream

nobody knows who i am
maybe you would understand
anybody knows what i am
down in a secret land

nobody knows how i try 
not to tell another lie
anybody knows in the end
i'll find a secret land

i need you
i feel you
i can't life without you
so long

i know that
we parted
i'll stay in this town
cause i miss you so

i feel it
i mean it
the secret that i'm gonna show

an' i turn back
i see that
all my love had to fail
but i miss you so

nobody knows who i am 
maybe you would understand
anybody knows what i am
down in a secret land

nobody knows how i try
not to tell another lie
anybody knows in the end
i'll find a secret land
