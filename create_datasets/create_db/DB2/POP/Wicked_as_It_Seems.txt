It's just as wicked as it seems
Just run out of dreams
Better of two evils, babe
It's one time too much
Baby how can I say what's in my heart, what's in my heart
Come a long way, well since you beat it up

As wicked as it seems yeah
Why don't you get, get all over me
Why don't you get, get all over me
Just a two way street, but now it goes one way
And now for me there's no way out, one time
Why don't you get, get all over me

As wicked as it seems
It's playtime, but it's far too late
It's gonna too hard on, hard on it, hard on it
What you gonna give
It's not enough, not enough for me
So I soften the blow, so the bruises don't show
I've got the expertise
No broken necks
No broken hearts
Well, we used your deck
All I did was play the cards, now the check
Now I find it's not enough, it's not enough for me
Now you want to give, is not enough, not enough for me

As wicked as it seems
Why don't you get, get all over me, one time
Why don't you get, get all over me
It's easy getting in
Why don't you get, get all over me
But it's a hard way out babe
Why don't you get, get all over me
