Say it again, ooh baby
Please say it one more time for me
I dont believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me

Weve been friends, real close friends
For a long time
I can tell theres somethin heavy
Hangin on your mind
Action speaks louder than words
I was sure you said it right when you said
Last night I love you

Say it again, ooh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I dont believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me
Say it again and again and again and again

Sittin here with your head in a crazy spin
Dont be afraid to let this love affair begin
Hold me, tell me whats on your mind
Ill always have the time to hear those words
I love you

Say it again, ooh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I dont believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me
Say it again and again and again and again

Hold me, tell me whats on your mind
Ill always have the time to hear those words
I love you

Say it again, ooh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I dont believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me

Did I hear you say you love me
I need to hear you say you love me
Ohh!

Say it again, ooh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I dont believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me

I dont believe I heard you right
I wanna say it again
I dont believe I heard you right

Say it, say it again
I dont belive I heard you right
Say it, say it again
I dont belive I heard you right

Say it again, ooh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I dont believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me

I dont believe I heard you right
