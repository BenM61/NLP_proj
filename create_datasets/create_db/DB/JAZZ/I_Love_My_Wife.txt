My thoughts may stray
My eyes may roam
The neighbor's grass may seem much greener
Than the grass right here at home

If pretty girls excite me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you didn't know
I love my wife

My mind at times
May dwell on sex
If someone's rating dreams
Then most of mine I guess are double X

So dimpled knees delight me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you hadn't heard
I love my wife

Like bait that wriggles
And it makes catfish bite
A lady jiggles
And my eyes gotta light

Upon so sweet a sight
And if I shake
Break out in spots
Don't fret, it's not swine fever dear

Your swine has merely got the hots
If rosy lips invite me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you couldn't guess

I love my wife
My mind at times
May dwell on sex
If someone's rating dreams

Then most of mine I guess are double X
If rosy lips invite me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you couldn't guess

Or hadn't heard
Or didn't know

I love my wife
I love my wife
I love my wife
Mmm
I love my wife
