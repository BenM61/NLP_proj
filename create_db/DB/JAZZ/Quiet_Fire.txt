I'm burning up quiet fire
Take my hand do with it what you will
I'm in dire need

Cause'
All I want is somebody to love me like I do
All I want is somebody to love me like I do

You walk away nothing left to say but bye, bye blue eyes
And I, no I don't understand

Cause'
All I want is somebody to love me like I do
All I want is somebody to love me like I do

Well you can call me half crazy call me certifiably nuts
All for love
What do you get for letting me win so easily?
Put up your dukes baby what are you made of?
This isn't right no this isn't right you know that
I'm not one to fuss but what have you done to me you hardly 
Make love to me now oh my poor hearts about to bust right out of its seams

Cause'
All I want is somebody to love me like I do
All I want is somebody to love me like I do
