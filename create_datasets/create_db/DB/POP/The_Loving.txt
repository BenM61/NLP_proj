All around the world, every boy and every girl
Need the loving
The humble and the great, even those we think we hate
Need the loving

Soldiers of the queen, all the hard men that we've seen
Need the loving
Babies at the breast, those in power and those suppressed
Need the loving

Let's face it you just can't hide
Your first taste'll send you reeling
Like a firework to which we're tied
Be prepared to go through your ceiling now

The loving's coming
The loving's more than just an AD man's vision
The loving's strumming
On your heart strings, so loud that you can't help but listen

Sailors on the seas, or the clergy on their knees
Need the loving
All the rich and poor, even those we fight at war
Need the loving

That thing that we need most of
That stuff we should try before we've died
Everyone is begging to be loved
With a free gift, a working heart inside

The loving's coming
The loving's advertised in all the papers
The loving's humming
Your favorite song but for once it won't annoy the neighbors

The loving, the loving

All round the world, every boy and every girl
Need the loving
Cold-hearted or warm, every single person born
Needs the loving

Way out there in space, think we'll find that alien race
Needs the loving
And just to end the list, everything that could exist
Needs the loving

The loving's coming
The loving's coming
The loving's coming
