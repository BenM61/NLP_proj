There's a new kind of dancing
It's gonna be your rage
You just leave yourself behind
Like an actor on a stage

Cop a different pose
From the pose you're in
Shine a different attitude
From underneath your skin

Attitude dancing (strut around the floor in a new attitude)
Attitude dancing (any attitude is the proper attitude)
Attitude dancing (don't be afraid to change your attitude)
Attitude dancing (free up your spirit with a new attitude)

It don't even matter
If you stretch or shake
And it don't really matter
What moves your body makes

And it don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Only one thing matters, that's your attitude
Your attitude, attitude dancing

Attitude dancing (strut around the floor in a new attitude)
Attitude dancing (any attitude is the proper attitude)
Attitude dancing (don't be afraid to change your attitude)
Attitude dancing (free up your spirit with a new attitude)

It don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
The only thing matters is your attitude

Your attitude, attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a new attitude
Do the locomotion in a new attitude
Do the mashed potato in a new attitude
Do the hully gully in a new attitude

Find a role you like
Capture it and freeze
And then turn it around
A hundred and eighty degrees
Or if you're at a loss
Just observe some natural dude
And turn into a mirror of his attitude (attitude)
Attitude, attitude dancing
