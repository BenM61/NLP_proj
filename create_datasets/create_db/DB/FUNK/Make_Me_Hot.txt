Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete
Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete

We was in the club
That's where I saw you
It was my nigga Pete
He was a tall dude
Wanted to get your number
So I could call you
Coming to missy's aunt's
Oh Pete don't fall dude

Just make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete
Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete

Pete my singer don't know how to sing
Just make me hot
Pete I ain't got no hook
Just make me hot
Pete I don't know how to write sixteen bars
Just make me hot
Pete, oh just make me hot

Just make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete
Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete
