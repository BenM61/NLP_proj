A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sail on the sea
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me
You were made for me

A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me

We'll have our quarrels
And you'll upset me, but
What can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you
And I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you

As sure as there's a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me

A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sail on the sea
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me
You were made for me

A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple, an apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me

We'll have our quarrels
And you'll upset me, but
What can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you
And I'll never, never, never, never, never, never leave you

As sure as there's a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free, no no
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me
