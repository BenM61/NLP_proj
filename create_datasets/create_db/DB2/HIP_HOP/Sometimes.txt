Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything and
Sometimes, I'm so alive
Sometimes, I feel like I can zoom cross the sky and,
Sometimes, I want to cry 

Most people try to aim to please
But a lot a them are kinda weak in the knees
Learnin' late about the birds and the bees
Falllin' in love and want to bee set free
Playin' ball at the age of thirteen
Everybody's growin up with a dream
I never noticed what could happen to me
Time flies when you're walkin' the streets
One minute gotcha holdin' an ace
The next minute gotcha fall on yer face
A mean city is a nasty place
Only a rat can win a rat race!
Peace to the people who be fallin' away
To make it home today
And peace to the people who be tryin' to find
Som kinda life

Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything and
Sometimes, I'm so alive
Sometimes, I feel like I can zoom cross the sky and,
Sometimes, I want to cry 

Sound body and sound of mind
Sound of the rhythm and sound of the rhyme
Somebody marchin' all out of time
Biggest mistakes are the humanest kind
Judge not, lest you be judged
The court room or the billy club
Blood bubblin' thicker than mud
The heart beat rub-a-dub-dub
Show love and love who you know
Family wherever you go
Tokyo to Acapulco
Bravissimo, magnifico
Peace to the people who be losing their head
Peace to the people who be needin' a bed

Love to the people who be feelin' alone
Spreadin' love upon the microphone
Hope to the people who be feelin' down
Smile to the people who be wearin' a frown
Faith to the people who be seekin' the truth y'all
All of the time, and I say

Sometimes, I feel like I can do anything and
Sometimes, I'm so alive
Sometimes, I feel like I can zoom cross the sky and,
Sometimes, I want to cry
