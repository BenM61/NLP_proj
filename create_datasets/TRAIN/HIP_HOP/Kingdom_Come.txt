I don't know what what life will be in H.I.P.
H.O.P. without the boy H.O.V.
Not only NYC I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

When Kingdom Come, You ready?
When Kingdom Come, I'm ready
When Kingdom Come... I'm ready

Now everywhere I go they like Hovi back
About the corner office I be cold as sack
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at?
Got to admit a lil' bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evil I'm so involved
I'm showin' growth I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and yeah goin' God
I'm so indebted I should of been debted
Sellin' blow in the park this is knowin' my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
Just when you thought the whole world fell apart, I
Take off the blazer loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth Superman is alive

I will be... Kingdom New York
I will be... New York
Not only NYC I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

When Kingdom Come, You ready?
When Kingdom Come, Uh-Huh
Not only NYC I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

I hear "Hurry up Hov" when I'm out in the public
These niggas like that you love it you be it your up it
You breathe it we need it bring it back for the hustlers
Have you dust off the hammer dance can't touch this
C'mon playboys bring your cars back out
Cause your boy Hov is back you know them broads comin' out
Got 'em dancin' on the bankhead like they from Bankhead
Pour crystal so they ask what we drinkin'
I thought dudes
So I moved on
And it's much bigger issues in the world I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom so I still feel I'm from the bottom
Underdog before my cake and still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon bring my cords and spark the light in the dark
Peter Parker Spider-Man all I do is climb the charts

I will be... Kingdom New York
I will be... New York
Not only NYC I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back in broad shoudlers the ball hover
Who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York New York we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was 6 17 they gettin' money down south
Bou-Bou Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp see ask my homie Bun be	
I run the streets the streets don't run me
Y'all run we chill still waters run deep
I repeat sing along with me
I repeat sing along with me
I run the streets the streets don't run me
Ladies sayin' where you been Superman
When niggas spendin' 10 million and media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your Roc signs in the air, yeah

I will be... Kingdom New York
I will be... New York
Not only NYC I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
