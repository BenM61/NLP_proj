I'm really tired of my concrete jungle
Six days a week is way too much
I'm gonna make
The great escape
Go on little getaway

I'll go get my beat up motor
Start it up and head for the green
Of endless countrysides
And go somewhere I've never been

I'll stop
Kiss my blues goodbye
Breathe until I
Soar outside my crazy nights
And live the riviera life
I'll stop
Thank you for today
I'm sure that by
Candlelight, I'll be alright

And live a riviera life
The road can wind like my hidden hair bow
You clear my face so I can feel the breeze
And down below
It's Monaco
And mister, I don't know a soul

I'll drop off the keys at valet
Look out my window bay
One afternoon martini
Wouldn't want it any other way

I'll stop
Kiss my blues goodbye
Breathe until I
Soar outside my crazy nights
And live the riviera life
I'll stop
Thank you for today
I'm sure that by
Candlelight, I'll be alright

So whenever
My eyes get weary
I'm not fearing
What life brings
Forever
When times make me teary
I'll know what I was meant to do
I've nothing at all to lose

I'll stop
Kiss my blues goodbye
Breathe until I
Soar outside my crazy nights
And live the riviera life
I'll stop
Thank you for today
I'm sure that by
Candlelight, I'll be alright
