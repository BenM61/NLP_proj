Would you like a woman who's been around the world
Would you like a woman who is like a little girl
Would you like a woman who is strong and tough
Would you like a woman who could never, ever get enough

Would you like it on a yacht
Would you like it on the dock
Would you like it in a plane
Would you like it on a train

Do you like it
Do you like it like that
Does it make you hot, baby
Is it givin' you a heart attack
Do you like it, like it

Would you like a woman who is just a little mean
Would you like a woman who is just a little naive
Would you like a woman who is sensitive to your touch
Would you like a woman who wants to tie you up

Would you like it in a car
Would you like it in a bar
Would you like it on the street
Would you like it on your feet

Do you like it
Do you like it like that
Does it make you hot, baby
Is it givin' you a heart attack
Do you like it, like it

Would you like a woman who is like a work of art
Would you like a woman who is gonna break your heart
Would you like a woman sweet and shy and plain
Would you like a woman you could never tame

Would you like it in your bed
Would you like it in your head
Would you like it in on the phone
You must cause you're all alone

Do you like it
Do you like it like that
Does it make you hot, baby
Is it givin' you a heart attack
Do you like it, like it
