There's no more room for anything more

Uh yea, now girl step up to Kiss
You sippin' red zyphandile, step up to crys
The coupe got 19's, the chain's got nice gleam
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
Your ass is fat, your frame is little
Got the door knockers on with your name in the middle
On the dance floor gettin' it in with me
Might let you and your friend hit me
Soon as the wind hit me
I live dare, legendary the top of the globe
So there is no more room for anything more
And I state my name, my names to claim
Jadakiss I done came here and changed the game
Now we at the point where your birthdays is costly
Got you a scotted outfit and a teacup yorkey
Head so crazy that its killing me softly
Sit down tell me how you want and how you need me
Its the bomb Mary and Clue please believe me
