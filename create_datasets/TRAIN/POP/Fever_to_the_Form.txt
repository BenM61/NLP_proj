So Whether music or madness
Live by one of the two
By one of the two

Go on, fill your heart up with gladness
Not a moment too soon
Not a moment too soon

Should we ration the reasons
To the charts that ignore
Of this I've never been sure

So i will follow the feeling
And sing fever to the form
Oh my fever to the form

'Cause the very thing you're afraid, afraid of
It keeps you clean but unclear
Clean but unclear

Is the dirt that you're made, you're made of
And thats nothing to fear
No, its nothing my dear

How did i know what you're thinking
Maybe i thought it before

Maybe that's why i'm at your window
Hear me at your door
Singing give me some more

Oh fever to the form
Won't you hear me at your door
Singing give me some more

'Cause you were never empty
And we've been here before
Yes, we've been here before

But now theres always plenty
Yet still we ask for more
Singing fever to the form
