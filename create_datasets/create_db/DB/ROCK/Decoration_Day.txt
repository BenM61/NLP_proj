It's Decoration Day. 
And I've a mind to roll a stone on his grave. 
But what would he say. 
Keeping me down, boy, won't keep me away. 

It's Decoration Day. 
And I knew the Hill Boys would put us away, 
But my Daddy wasn't afraid. 
He said we'll fight till the last Lawson's last living day 

I never knew how it all got started 
A problem with Holland before we were born 
And I don't know the name of that boy we tied down 
And beat till he just couldn't walk anymore. 
But I know the caliber in daddy's chest 
And I know what Holland Hill drives. 
The state let him go, but I guess it was best 
'Cause nobody needs all us Lawson's alive. 

Daddy said one of the boys had come by 
The lumber man's favorite son. 
He said, beat him real good but don't dare let him die 
And if you see Holland Hill run. 
Now I said, they ain't give us trouble no more 
That we ain't brought down on ourselves 
But a chain on my back and my ear to the floor 
And I'll send all the Hill Boys to hell. 

It's Decoration Day 
And I've got a family in Mobile Bay 
And they've never seen my daddy's grave. 
But that don't bother me, it ain't marked anyway. 
'Cause I got dead brothers in Lauderdale south 
And I got dead brothers in east Tennessee. 
My Daddy got shot right in front of his house 
He had no one to fall on but me. 

It's Decoration Day 
And I've got a mind to go spit on his grave. 
If I was a hill, I'd have put him away 
And I'd fight till the last Lawson's last living day. 
I'd fight till the last Lawson's last living day. 
I'd fight till the last Lawson's last living day.
