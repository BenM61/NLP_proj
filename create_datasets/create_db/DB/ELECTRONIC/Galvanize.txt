Don't hold back
Cause you woke up in the mornin', with the mission to to move, so I make it harder
Don't hold back
If you think about it, so many people do, be cool man, look smarter.
Don't hold back
And you shouldn't even care, bout those losers in the air, and their crooked stares
Don't hold back
Cause there's a party over here, so you might as well be here, where the people care
Don't hold back

The world, is holdin' back
The time has come to
The world, is holdin' back
The time has come to
The world, is holdin' back
The time has come to
Galvanize!

C'mon, c'mon c'mon.

Don't hold back
If you think about it too much, you may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
Don't hold back
You think its time you get up, crunch time, like a sit up, come on keep pace
Don't hold back
Put apprehension on the back burner, let it sit, don't even get it lit
Don't hold back
Get involved with the jam, don't be a prick, hot chick, be a dick.
Don't hold back

The world, is holdin' back
The time has come to
The world, is holdin' back
The time has come to
The world, is holdin' back
The time has come to
Galvanize!

C'mon, c'mon c'mon.

My finger, is on the button
My finger, is on the button
Push the button
