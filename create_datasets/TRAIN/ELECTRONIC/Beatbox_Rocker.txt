I'm a beatbox rocker
And you dancing to my beat
And you dancing to my beat
And you dancing to my beat

I'm a beatbox rocker
And I never say the same

I'm beatbox rocker
And you dancing to my beat
And you dancing to my beat
And you dancing to my beat

And you dancing to my, dancing to my
Dancing to my beat 
Dancing to my beat 

And you dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing...
