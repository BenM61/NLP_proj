Life is better than the days behind
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine,
No aggravation that we can't get through
A situation for the lucky few

And everyday is just a little more
Of time together to be happy for
I'm happy even when the times are rough
'Cause any time with you is good enough

When we love like we do
Love like we do

I don't believe in hatred anymore
I hate to think of how I felt before
When anger overwhelms your very soul
It's hard to realize you'll ever know

When we love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do

Life is better than the days behind
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine,
No aggravation that we can't get through
A situation for the lucky few

When we love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do
Love like we do

Oh, love love
Oh, oooh, love love
Oooh
