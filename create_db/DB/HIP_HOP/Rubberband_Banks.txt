Mathematically with a pistol I do triginomatry
Humbly eat up a n**** like a piranna be	
Ridin in tha cutless same color as a bumble bee

Paint tha chevy sad blue, you know my devi sad blue
Ride straight past you

Thirty aught sixes blast you

Diamonds look like pa**ion fruit

Ride through tha hood
You know tha 'burban look like snapple juice
Bricks from black facts, from summa hill pappa 2
Rapper who, b**** you know I'm tha best thang smokin
Hit him in tha neck with tha tek and leave ya throat smokin
Dro rollin, b**** I got a million for ya million (what)
We up in these hoods, trappin buildin after buildin
