Peeling the skin back from my eyes I felt surprised
That the time on the clock was the time I usually retired
To the place where I cleared my head of you
But just for today I think I lie here and dream of you

I've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in
But if the sweat pours out, just shout
I'll try to swim and pull you out

A howling wind that blows the litter as the rain flows
As street lamps pour orange colored shapes, through your windows
A broken soul stares from a pair of watering eyes
Uncertain emotions force an uncertain smile

I've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in
But if the sweat pours out, just shout
I'll try to swim and pull you out
