Hello, oh Zay, what's poppin'?
Oh, I'm finna pull up
I just left the bank

I just left the bank, I just left the bank, I just left the bank, I just left the bank
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah), I just left the bank (uh), I just left the bank
I just left the motherfucking bank (yeah, yeah), nigga I just left the motherfucking bank (yeah, yeah)
I just left the motherfucking bank, yeah, I just left the motherfucking bank

I just left the bizank
Smoking on that stizank
Swerving in a foreign, on the E-way, on that drizank
And my lil' bitch with me, she so thick, that it's a shizame
Yea we got the same car, but mines cost more and it's faster
Naw, I don't like rappers, and my lil' bitch badder
Every other day, I'm at the bank making deposits
I carry a bookbag, I can't do nothing with a wallet
Nine times out of ten I probably got them racks on me
Ten times out of ten, you know I got a strap on me
All this gold and diamonds 'round my neck like I'm King Tut
You ain't seen me bitch, then you ain't seen nothing

I just left the bank, I just left the bank, I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah), I just left the bank (uh), I just left the bank
I just left the motherfucking bank (yeah, yeah), nigga I just left the motherfucking bank (yeah, yeah)
I just left the motherfucking bank, yeah, I just left the motherfucking bank

Walked in the bank smiling
Walked out the bank laughing
Cartier on my glasses
Dumping gelato ashes
Fifteen, start trapping
Ruger under my mattress
I ain't never owed a nigga shit
And I even pay all my taxes (I don't owe a nigga shit)
I just the left the bank
House by the lake
I just cut the front yard, had too many snakes
Ain't nobody straight
In these streets nobody safe, ay
I can't f*ck with these niggas 'cause they broke and petty
Rose gold Patek, backseat watching Bentley
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend
Makaveli

I just left the bank, I just left the bank, I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah)
I just left the bank, I just left the bank (yeah), I just left the bank (uh), I just left the bank
I just left the motherfucking bank (yeah, yeah), nigga I just left the motherfucking bank (yeah, yeah)
I just left the motherfucking bank, yeah, I just left the motherfucking bank

Nine times out of ten I probably got them racks on me
Ten times out of ten, you know I got a strap on me
All this gold and diamonds 'round my neck like I'm King Tut
You ain't seen me bitch, then you ain't seen nothing
