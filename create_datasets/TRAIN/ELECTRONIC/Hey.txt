I seen the look in your face
Telling me a story
You don't have to be alone
I love to see you smiling
Why you try to hide it?
Don't you know you've got it all?

I know when you're gone
You do your thing
And you live like you want
I know when you're gone
You're just looking for a little sign of love

I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey, hey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey, hey
I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey, hey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey, hey

See the way you moving
No need for introducing
You're everything a man could want
You and I, we both know
Only one with this course
Baby let me take you home

I know when you're gone
You do your thing
And you live like you want
I know when you're gone
All you're looking for is a little sign of love

I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey, hey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey, hey

I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey, hey
Hey, won't you stay with me?
I said hey, hey

I said hey
Won't you come with me?
I said hey, hey
Hey, oh won't you stay with me?
I said hey, hey
