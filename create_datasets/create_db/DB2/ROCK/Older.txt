Showing you never want cover
What you hold honey you hold well
Holding it out won't be tougher
And I know honey I know well
The thought is fulfilling your label
And talking honey talking on
It's fake though I know that you're able
Just sleeping honey, I'm sleeping well

Older, we want, closure you're holding on top
When your life is on hold
Be there, I don't
I don't want to leave you alone
I'm talking my mind, 'cause I'm done
Enough

Calling the exchanged words
What you hold honey you hold well
The past is a world of retained hurt
And I know honey I know well
Wonder the reason you changed for
And talking honey talking on
Time will escape you can be sure
Just sleeping honey, I'm sleeping well

Older, we want, closure your holding on top
When your life is on hold
Be there, I don't
I don't want to leave you alone
I'm talking my mind, because I'm done
Enough
