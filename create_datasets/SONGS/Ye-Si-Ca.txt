I was young and alone
And my heart searched the world for a home.
She was free like a bird
And sang songs to me I never heard.
She sang ye-si-ca

She sang ye-si-ca.
Well
the sound of her voice
Made it plain that she knew about boys.
I brought wine to her taste
And we didn't let much go to waste.
We sang ye-si-ca

We sang ye-si-ca.
And the boys in the band at the hotel
They played it all over again.
I knew it by heart in the morning
And her body was more than a friend.
She sang ye-si-ca

She sang ye-si-ca.
Late at night when the wind
Passes by like the touch of her skin.
It will bring to my mind
A song and the sweet smell of wine.
She sang ye-si-ca

She sang ye-si-ca.
She sang ye-si-ca
I sang ye-si-ca.
And the boys in the band at the hotel
They played it all over again.
I knew it by heart in the morning
And her body was more than a friend.
She sang ye-si-ca

She sang ye-si-ca
we sang ye-si-ca.

And the boys in the band at the hotel
