Yeah, I'ma set it off, c'mon now
Yeah, oh, this that hot shit y'all set it off
New Monica shit, c'mon

You remember when I was just a young one
And I was to afraid to quickly let you show me thangs
Hol up, hol up, big show DJ?s
This joint so crazy put the needle back on the record
Let's do a double take

Now listen, baby I'm a dirt bag
I don't know the different faces, I can't take it
But I got a jeep, so you lead and I?ll follow
Lunch up in a diner, if ya act right we dine in the Bahamas

Now wow, lil' momma, I'm a gangsta
Anywhere ya wanna go I'ma take ya
Oh, my God you caught my eyes like from 20 yards
You so damn fine

Listen, I don't eat peaches but the way you look to night
I just might take a bite, come closer, feel that
It?s a woman and a man and a latex

Out the shower, hotel flowers on the bed
Choice of wine, white or red
Hey, what more can I say
Monica, Dirt Bag, A T L, M I A

You remember when I was just a young one
And I was to afraid to quickly let you show me thangs
Not sure if I was ready for some good love, and I'm 'bout to set it off
Can you please be gentle, 'cause I am the fragile kind
And even though I'm ready for the move of my time
Now buckle up yo seat's while I set it off

Baby, let me set it off, do you mind it I get it off
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call, if you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off

I know your anxious but please let's make a compromise
I'm so energized, all in my neck, my back, my thighs
Make sure the lock is safe before I set it off

Baby let me set it off, do you mind it I get it off
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call, if you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off

Mama said it, you can tell them Mo Said it
And you betta not forget it, now don't sweat it
And we can really go at it, if you let it let's protect it
Now I bet it be good is you ready
But the jump of heavy, my style varies
The club down I shut it, how I do it, I set it in me

Baby let me set it off, do you mind it I get it off
Set it off, set it off
All it takes is one phone call, if you wanna get it on
Set it off, set it off

Breakdown, here we go
I'll set it off, I'll set it off
I'll set it off, I will set it off
I'll set it, I'll set it, I'll set it, I'll set it
