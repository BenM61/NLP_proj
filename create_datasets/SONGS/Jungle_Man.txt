Deep inside the soul hole of mother earth
Father time came with a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy but I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone came felonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire from way down down down under

I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

Erupting from the ground in Hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete his funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds they make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man it's time to take take take take the throne

I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I 

I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

I am a jungle man I am a jungle man I am a jungle man
