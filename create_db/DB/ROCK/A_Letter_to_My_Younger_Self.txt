A letter to my younger self
I don't know where to start
Every time I begin, I just tear it apart

I could play the big "I am"
Show you how to be
What choices to make and what futures you'd see

And I know
How hard it is now
On Battersea Bridge with a mind full of rain
I know I could never go back there again
But if there was one thing I wish I could say

Let somebody love you
Let somebody love you

A letter to my younger self
What a weird idea
What would I tell you, and what would you hear?

Do I have to say to you
That we don't really change
After all I've been through how I'm still just the same

And I know
How hard it is now
But there'll come a day when you turn it around
Facin' your demons on the underground
And if there is one truth I'm sure I have found

Let somebody love you
Let somebody love you

Let somebody love you
Let somebody love you
Let somebody love you
