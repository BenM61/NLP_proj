I was lost in France
In the fields the birds were singing
I was lost in France
And the day was just beginning
As I stood there in the morning rain
I had a feeling I can't explain
I was lost in France in love

I was lost in France
In the street a band was playing
And the crowd all danced
Didn't catch what they were saying
When I looked up he was standing there
And I knew I shouldn't but I didn't care
I was lost in France in love

Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing

I was lost in France
And the vines were over-flowing
I was lost in France
And a million stars were glowing
And I looked round for a telephone
To say 'baby I won't be home'
I was lost in France in love

Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing

And I looked round for a telephone
To say 'baby I won't be home'
I was lost in France in love

Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
Ooh la la la ooh la la la dance
Ooh la la la dancing
