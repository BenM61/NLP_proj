Oh
Oh

You talk a good game
Oh
I really wanna believe you
Oh oh
But I got questions in my head like
Is it true? What to do?
I don't wanna see myself
Played a fool, baby ooh
Uh uh
No way, I prefer you keep it real with me

'Cause I, I
I don't think I could take, another broken promise
Why do things the hard way, when you can just be honest
And Imma do what I'm supposed to do, if you tell me you got us
Why do things the hard way? (hard way, hard way)

'Cause if you give me your love then I give you mines back
If you get to acting up I cut you off like that
I, don't think I could take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way? (Hard way, hard way)

If love, is free
And talk, is cheap
Don't make me pay for all your mistakes boy
Finally go, just be free
Thought you'd get to know me
Don't tell the same stories

You talk a good game
Oh
I really wanna believe you (ooh)
Oh oh

Don't think I could take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way, when you can just be honest
And Imma do what I'm supposed to do, if you tell me you got us
Why do things the hard way? (hard way, hard way)

'Cause if you give me your love then I give you mines back
If you get to acting up I cut you off like that
I, don't think I could take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way? (Hard way, hard way)

Promises and promises you say they all counterfeit
If we start off telling lies, does loving never amount to shit?
You really think me, I'm the one? Or you just like the sound of it?
If the motive's all wrong, heartaches what you bound to get
Give me one shot, let a ball quit
Imma kill it girl,
Full clip you wearing all white, I'm in all black
We standing by the boardpit
You say I do, I say I do, I'm tired of all the bullshit

I don't think I could take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way when you can just be honest
And Imma do what I'm supposed to do if you tell me you got us
Why do things the hard way? (Hard way, hard way)

'Cause if you give me your love then I give you mines back
If you get to acting up I cut you off like that
I, don't think I could take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way? (Hard way, hard way)

Talk a good game
Really wanna believe you
