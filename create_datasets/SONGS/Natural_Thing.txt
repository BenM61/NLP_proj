Keep coming on so strong, yeah
Gotta keep it coming on

It's a natural thing
Wherever I decide to go, we go together
It's the only route to take
We're on our way, the only way
Change for the better

(It's a natural thing) I don't have to prove it
(A natural thing) we know how to use it
(It's a natural thing) making out, we know we're right
(A natural thing) 'cause time is on our side

Coming on, keep coming on so strong, yeah
Gotta keep it coming on
Coming on, keep coming on so strong, yeah

Every moment precious
We'll take our time, we're gonna shine
We are forever
The tide is on the turn
Now here to stay, you've got to learn
We're strong together

(It's a natural thing) I don't have to prove it
(A natural thing) we know how to use it
(It's a natural thing) making out, we know we're right
(A natural thing) time is on our side

Coming on, keep coming on so strong, yeah
Gotta keep it coming on
Coming on, keep coming on so strong
