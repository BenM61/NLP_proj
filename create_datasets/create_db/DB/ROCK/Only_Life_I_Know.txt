She looked her best in life when she was seventeen.
Of all the girls at school she was the prettiest that I'd seen. 
And I guess I'd say she loved me but I always knew she'd go. 
'Cause she deserves much better than the only life I know.

The only life I know, only life I know. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

Well you do what you can anywhere you are, 
He was the only mother too young to go to bars. 
She wore a Jack Daniels t-shirt and the black faded to grey. 
And she deserves much better than the only life I know.

The only life I know, only life I know. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

The only life I know, only life I know. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

Now all our friends warned me she would leave me soon. 
She never really fit in, aw she'd stand out in a room. 
And it's the kind of town where your first love is your last. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

The only life I know, only life I know. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

The only life I know, only life I know. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

She left home with that winning smile and she's never coming back. 
And I just couldn't argue, she'd already packed her bags. 
I hope I never find her in a truck stop on the road, 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

The only life I know, only life I know. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.

The only life I know, only life I know. 
She deserves much better than the only life I know.
