Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney boo, boo, boo 
Poor me
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
When he came last year (poor Santa Claus)

Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
He won't come back I fear (boo)

There he was in middle of the chimney
Roly-poly, fat, and round
There he was in middle of the chimney
Not quite up and not quite down

Santa, please, come back to my chimney
Back to my chimney, back to my chimney
Santa, please, come back to my chimney
You can come back here (please do)
'Cause daddy made a brand new chimney
Just for you this year

Oh Ella is a little girl
Who's trying to be good
Yeah I find that things don't always
Turn out as they should
Why just last Christmas Eve she waited up
For Santa to drop by
But I nearly missed him
And here is the reason why

Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
When he came last year (poor Santa Claus)

Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
He won't come back I fear (boo)

There he was in middle of the chimney
Roly-poly, fat, and round
There he was in middle of the chimney
Not quite up and not quite down

Santa, please, come back to my chimney
Back to my chimney, back to my chimney
Santa, please, come back to my chimney
You can come back here (please do)
'Cause daddy made a brand new chimney
Just for you this year

Santa Claus come on down the chimney, please come back this year
