(Shaggy)
Let me hear you say, somebody say oh hoooo
A girl like you is like a brand new automobile drive any man crazy
You passing around my avenue again baby
Your style is so repetitious it's about time Shaggy and Wayne Wonder start to get vicious

(Wayne Wonder, Chorus)
Doing something different for a change
What a sexy body girl I have you in my range - SHAGGY
May not be sufficient but I'm doing just fine

(Shaggy)
When we do it different baby-love it is together
She want a rub a dub lover have her under cover
When we do it different baby love it is together
She want a rub a dub lover have her under cover

Baby love I admire the way you move the way you groove
I love the way you dance even when you step upon my shoes
It's my dream to sweep you off your feet and take you on a cruise
A romantic intersection I'm just here to pay my dues

Never see a girl that I love this right
It's kinda wicked it's kinda wild
Taking it easy under cool profile
You're so smooth and you're so mild
I don't care what your friends may say
I'm going to love you any way
Because they don't know about those days
When you gave good love to me downstairs

(Wayne Wonder, Chorus)
Doing something different for a change
What a sexy body girl I have you in my range
May not be sufficient but I'm doing just fine

(Shaggy)
Girl I love you I got to confess
My heart skip a beat I feel the pressure in my chest
Girl the way you got me going I wonder if you god bless
Are you a cut above the rest here to put me trough the test
I wouldn't mind love you up and give you nothing less
Your coca cola figure in that skin tight dress
Hold me in your
