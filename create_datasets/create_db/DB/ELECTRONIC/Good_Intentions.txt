I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good

I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

I promised I'd be good
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good

But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you
