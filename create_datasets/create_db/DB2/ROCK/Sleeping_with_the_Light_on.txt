Along she came
With her picture
Put it in a frame
So I won't miss her
Got on a plane
From London Heathrow
It seems such a shame, Yeah

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now
That she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on

Heard she's engaged
But to her best friend
No one's to blame
Here's where it all ends
And I feel the pain
Cos I'm without her
And I feel the pain

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now
That she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on

I see the sight, with a different light,
Words cannot describe the way I'm feeling,
'Cause I've been searching in my head,
For the words I thought she'd said,
For too long.

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now
That she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on

Oh Yeah

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now
That she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now
That she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
