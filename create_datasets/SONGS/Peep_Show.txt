Show me a memory
And that's where I'll long to be
Please don't ask for more from me
'Cause memory is all I'll be

But I can live in your minds eye
Live, in your heart
I'll love you in your dreams
But please don't try to hold me in your arms

Show me a fantasy
And that's who I'll long to be
Please don't ask for more from me
'Cause fantasy is all I'll be

But I can live in your minds eye
Live, in your heart
I'll love you in your dreams
But please don't try to hold me in your arms

But I can live in your minds eye
Live, in your heart
I'll love you in your dreams
But please don't try to hold me in your arms
