What if everything you had, 
You had to give back? 
Would you be the same? 
I don't think you would 
There's so many things that you don't appreciate 
No!Â  

[Chorus]
All that you haveÂ  

And have you ever really thought 
About all that you've got 
More than what you own 
Your family and your friends 
Without which you would be left here all alone So when you're feeling down 
Just take a look around 
And look at all you have 
And you'll see that things are really not that badÂ  

[Chorus]

All that you have 
Things aren't that bad 
With all that you have.
