Pain myself into the corner, a thousand miles from here and now,
No reflections into hold me down, let's look around, do I belong?
Space electric blue is calling, a northern star on my credit line,
Running short of it or borrow time you blow my mind, out of control

I feel my ship is sinking yeah I'm giving in,
Afraid to fly afraid to fall in love,
On a kaleidoscope of roller coasters,
I won't look down ''cause fear I've met,
Takes me to an all-time love, on a mountain of, I don't know

You give me vertigo
Sleeping satellites are waking, turning cycles in my head,
Information highway leave me ashtray , it's ok,
But I don't want to know where I'm going 'til I get there

I feel my ship is sinking yeah I'm giving in,
Afraid to fly afraid to fall in love,
On a kaleidoscope of roller coasters,
I won't look down ''cause fear I've met,
Takes me to an all-time love,
You give me vertigo

Oooohhh
Something????
? I'm crush landing on the cloud blue, so let's leave this plane, skydive away,
Skydive away

I feel my ship is sinking yeah I'm giving in,
Afraid to fly afraid to fall in love,
On a kaleidoscope of roller coasters,
I won't look down ''cause fear I've met,
Takes me to an all-time love, on a mountain of, I don't know
Don't let go, oh no, it's vertigo, oh oh no, no, don't let me go, oh oh no,
Take me, take me, take me
