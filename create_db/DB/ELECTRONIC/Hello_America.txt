Oh, I know, it turn out fine
That's no lie - oh it's my time
Don't break my lonely heart, baby baby
All I want is everything
Restless heart and diamond rings
Don't play with my heart, baby baby
Give me one more chance to win
Baby, truth are not a sin 

Hello America - I know I'll have to go
I'm not that super tough guy
From a TV show
Hello America - I feel like going home
I still believe in fairytales
And my chance will come
Oh wheels they are turning - turning tonight

On wings of love fly with me
Take me as your souvenir
Don't break my lonely heart, baby baby
Lock my heart - throw the key
Drowning in my fantasy
Don't play with my heart, baby baby
Give me one more chance to win
Baby, truth are not a sin
