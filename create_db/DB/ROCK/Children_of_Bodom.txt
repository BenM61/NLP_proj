In the silence of darkness, among the shadows of the dead we hear
And a wolf howling hungry to wake up children of the graves
(Unripe vengeance!) The cult that serves as revenge
Has put forward its fangs to declare a fucking war (war)
Only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by
The altars of Bodom where everything but death is a lie (death is a lie)
To spill your blood to become our wine
We'll reborn reality where only the wild will survive (wild survived)

(Kill!)

The clash of wickedness veils lake Bodom blood red
We have gathered our souls to praise the triumph of death

Children Of Bodom, angry are rising
Running amok slaying with a sense of desire
From the twilight of the past, (among) the victims who died
Something wild has survived

Only calmless spirits (of corpses) are passing by
The altars of Bodom where everything but death is a lie
To spill your blood to become our wine
(We'll reborn reality where only the) wild will survive

(This is something dark, I find your fears
We have gathered our dark souls to embrace the righteous pull of death
You'll obey the dark
You'll become one of us
Taitors)

Children Of Bodom, angry are rising
