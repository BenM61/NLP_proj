I made my wish a rose
Covered in old spangles, beside
A river froze, Felicia I miss you

The stately homes of England
How beautiful they stand
Lately it's a lonely love I know
Blown rose, go

I made my wish a rose
Wrapped in desire, she cries
Let me know, Felicia where are you?

The stately homes of England
How beautiful they stand
Lately it's a lonely love I know
Blown rose, go

I'm aching with you
We're breaking, I plead
Don't go easily my love
Felicia

The stately homes of England
How beautiful they stand
Lately it's a lonely love I know
Blown rose, go

But you say you don't feel it like I do
I'm so lost when
You say you don't feel it like I do
Crawl into my heart
Blown rose
Blown rose
Blown rose
Blown rose
