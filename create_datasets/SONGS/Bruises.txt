Bloodshot, tired and torn apart
I'm at my best when I con barely start
I fall down easy but I get up slow
I really, really hope that the bruises don't show

Cut mysetf and I tasted my blood
Dragged my name right through the mud
I fall down easy but I get up slow
I really, really hope that the bruises don't show

If I came to you late at night
Would you answer to my call
I can't do anything to make it all right
This is how you learn to fall

Cracked my skull and I hit the floar
I don't want to talk about it any more
I fall down easy but I get up slow
I really, really hope that the bruises don't show
