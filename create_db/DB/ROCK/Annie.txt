Oh, look stand tall, Annie
See the world grow small, Annie
But when will it fall, Annie, when will it be

Winter has come, Annie
No friend in the sun, Annie
And when it's gone, Annie
Where shall we be?

All those colors have faded
When ol' Jack comes to call
Don't tell him no, tell him maybe
Oh now, Annie, may God bless us all
Oh yes Annie, God bless us all

Did the children they call, Annie?
Every leaf must fall, Annie
God bless us all, Annie
Where ever will be
