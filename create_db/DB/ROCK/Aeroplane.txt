I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That mother fucker always spiked with pain

Looking in my own eyes "hello"
I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rear view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear "have no fear"

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That mother fucker always spiked with pain

Sitting in my kitchen hey girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad "said 'bout me"

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain

Just one note
Could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from
The song she wrote
Could f*ck me where I lay
Just one note
Could make me choke
One note that's
Not a lie
Just one note
Could cut my throat
One could make me die

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
