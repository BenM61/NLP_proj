You said I've been waiting outside your door
Biding my time hoping soon I might be recognized
Sometimes you leave without even a glance
Passing me by like I don't set a chance
Only a smile would make all of my waiting worthwhile

Chorus:
For as long as the world keeps turning
My fire will keep on burning
For your love
For your love

Maybe I'm searching for what I can find
Maybe your different than what's in my mind
Oh, but nevertheless a feeling just can't be denied

Chorus

I can't sleep at night
No, I can't eat a bite
I can't run
I can't hide
Without you I might die
