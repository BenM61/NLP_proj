Conspiracy Of One 
Red over white
It's one last fatal scene
Brought on by someone unseen

Moving on their own
Bring on the night
And bring us all to our knees
All are gone and none agreed

One who acts alone 
Nobody wins
Nobody hears us fall
Nobody wins

When it's done
Conspiracy of one
