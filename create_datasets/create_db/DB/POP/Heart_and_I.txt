I hope there's a golden age
I pray for my sanity
Where we don't have to answer to anyone 'bout anything

This is not like a brochure
Flying cars and sex machines
We are all so compliant
'Cause everything is what it seems
And it can't be the satellite
To tell you how loved you are
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

You've been bending so long now
You think it's standing up
And they line up behind you to build you up, buttercup
We can lose all meaning
Quicker than a credit card
And not everyone's healing, so try your best and don't love too hard
Cause they can't build a satellite
To tell you what's in your heart
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

Will I ever feel the waking
Naked as a lullaby
Don't ask me to explain again
I can't lie to my heart and I

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

My heart and I
My heart and I

I've been feeling so lonely
Feeling so low
So low I almost let go.
