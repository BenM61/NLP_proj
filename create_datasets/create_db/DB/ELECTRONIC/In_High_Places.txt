Look down from in high places
Lift off the ground
Without a sound, yeah
We move through open spaces
The wind, it pulls
The sky gets close, yeah
Could we get much higher?
Could we get much lighter?
Navigator to heaven
Check out, did you check your heart?
This cloudless blue
This starlight night, yeah
Shoot out into the shining
That devil moon. (That devil moon)
He sings of love, yeah
Can we get much higher?
Can we get much lighter?
Navigator to heaven
The stars, so close we touch them
They seem so small
They make me wonder
Far out in formation
Five thousand moons
Floating balloons
Couldn't get much higher
Couldn't get much lighter
Navigator to heaven
