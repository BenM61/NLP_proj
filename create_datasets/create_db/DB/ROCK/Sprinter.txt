Word of life, I'm so retreat
I picked it up and took a swing
My pastor told us don't you worry
Even he has found his glory
Why, why's a sprinter then?
Leaving the sea den

The pastor lost his position
Went down for pornography
So I found myself some ground to stand
Bound to be the better man
'Cause I was a sprinter then
Leaving the sea den

Round up, moving and holding a pattern
Circle around in a logic
Under a pack I plead to stay
Then went down for a deep sea den

'Cause I was a sprinter then
Die in the sea den
I was a sprinter then
Die in the sea den

There's freedom to, and freedom from
Dream of the one from everyone
There's freedom to, and freedom from
Dream of the one from everyone
Well what I did is what is done
The Baptist in me chose to run
But if there's still time to choose the sun
I'll choose the sun, I'll choose the sun
I'll run it back, I'll choose the sun
I'll run it back to everyone
If there's still time I'll choose the sun
I'll run it back to everyone
