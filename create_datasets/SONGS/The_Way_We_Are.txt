Just to be here, just to feel, you know
There's been too much pressure in the border
And I need to calm down
Just to breathe here, oxygen in and out
There's been too much poison in the system
Festering toxins I am in round

Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air

We expire, but we got a life to live
And just lay, lay where we only forget
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are

Feel all, stop and slowly shock, to know
When we're to give, start the engine
To see the remiss, the homing sound

Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air

We expire, but we got a life to live
And just lay, lay where we only forget
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
This the way we are, the way we are, the way we are

The patience run, running, rushing for the...
Oh, and we parted from the heart.
