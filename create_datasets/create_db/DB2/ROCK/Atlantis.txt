The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land, that from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails

To the East Africa was a neighbor, across a short strait of sea miles
The great Egyptian age is but a remnant of The Atlantian culture
The antediluvian kings colonized the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth
On board were the Twelve:
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist
The magician and the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice and let us sing and dance and ring in the new

Hail Atlantis!
Way down below the ocean where I want to be she may be
Way down below the ocean where I want to be she may be
Way down below the ocean where I want to be she may be

Way down below the ocean where I want to be she may be
Way down below the ocean where I want to be she may be

Oh glub glub, down down, yeah
My antediluvian baby
