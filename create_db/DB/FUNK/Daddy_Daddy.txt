Daddy, Daddy, Daddy love me strong
I don't mind if it's all night, Daddy

Daddy, Daddy, Daddy right or wrong
I'm gonna need you for a long time, Daddy

Gotta love me, Daddy
From now on
That's whacha got to do

When you thrill me like you thrill me
With a toss that always fills me with love
Sho fine

In the morning when the clock strikes four
You're the lover that I'm going to depend on
to love me Daddy, never let me go
That's all I ask of you

I'll try to show you
How I need your two arms to hold me
When I'm lonely

So, tell me Daddy
are you going to thrill your baby
like I want you to

Love me Daddy for a long, long time

When you hug me and you kiss me
give me love that I'll be missing
I'll feel so good

Daddy, Daddy, Daddy hold me tight
Want to feel your tender arms all around me

Daddy, Daddy while the moon is bright
Sweet, gently, tight

Hold me in the morning
Hold me every night

Thrill me Daddy, thrill me
Till I scream with all my might

Ooh, long, long time

When you thrill me like you thrill me
with a touch that always fills me
with love so fine

Daddy, Daddy you're a real consternation
Daddy, Daddy you're a real sensation
Daddy, Daddy we're a great combination
