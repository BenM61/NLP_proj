Oh, baby
Girl, don't pull the rug from under my feet (don't do it, baby)
Don't leave, don't leave me so, I'm talking in my sleep
This could be the start of a nightmare
Waking up and not finding you there
It would be more that I could stand
Oh, baby
Girl, don't leave me so I'm pacing the floor (don't do it, baby)
'Cause that's, that's what I'll do if you close the door
Maybe I've been too hung-up on myself
But don't change me by putting my heart on a shelf
'Cause that's more than I could stand
Why you wanna leave me?
Why you wanna go? 
I promise not
To never, never hurt you no more
Oh, please don't leave me
Please don't go
By causin' my heart to ache
Causin' it to break
We, we've still got a lot of love to give (yeah)
So turn around, baby (turn around)
While there's a lot of life to live
Leavin' me would ruin all of my plans
It would be like tying the both of my hands 
And that's more, baby, than I could stand
Why you wanna leave me?
Why you wanna go?
