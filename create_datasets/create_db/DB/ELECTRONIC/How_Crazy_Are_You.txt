Here I walk down the avenue
Looking at the pretty view
Maybe there's a reason
I got my eyes on you
There you go like a movie star
How I wonder who you are
Listen, babe, do you believe when I say?

You the kind of man walking out of my dreams
Straight into my life (I want to sing halleluja)
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
I wouldn't do for you, 
I want to say yes to ya

So crazy am I, crazy 'bout you
How crazy are you?
So crazy am I, crazy 'bout you
How crazy are you, are you
Crazy 'bout me?

Been a while since I felt this strong
This time it just can't be wrong
Baby, you're the reason
I been waiting for so long
I reach out for you hands
Hey babe, there's no second chance
Trust me darling
Do you believe when I say?

I climb the rocky mountains
I swim the deepest sea (I want to sing halleluja)
I said there's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
I want to say yes to ya
