It's impossible to see
All the things we used to be
And it's impossible to say
Why I always feel this way

Yes I know it's up there
But I don't know if I can
Yes I know it's up there
But I don't know if I can

It's impossible to find
The feeling that we left behind
And it's impossible to stay
When you make me feel this way

Yes I know it's up there
But I don't know if I can
Yes I know it's up there
But I don't know if I can

Yes I know it's up there
It was lost in the air

Yes I know it's up there
But I don't know if I can
Yes I know it's up there
But I don't know if I can
