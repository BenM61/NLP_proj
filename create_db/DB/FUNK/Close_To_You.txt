I've been looking for the words to say
I've been looking baby night and day
Just to show how I feel
Thoughts of you and me inside my mind
You've got my head spinning all the time
I'm so into you
And I just can't forget the first day we met
You made me shiver
You're taken me up and down, swinging me round and round
Nothing feels better, better than being with you
Whenever I want your love you're all that I'm thinking of
No one else in this world will do I want to feel close to you
Whenever I want your love you're all that I'm thinking of
No one else in this world like you
I got to be close to you
There's a little piece of me you found
You took my heart to a higher ground
Don't you ever let go no
I told you baby how I feel
Now I'm asking you is this for real
Would you let me go?
Cause I just can't forget
The first day we met
You made me shiver
You're taken me up and down, swinging me round and round
But nothing feels better, better than being with you
