Hey, listen to my story 'bout a gal named Daisy Mae
Lazy Daisy Mae
Her disposition is rather sweet and charming
At times alarming, so they say 
She has a man who's tall dark handsome, large and strong
To whom she used to sing this song

Hey, Daddy, I want a diamond ring, bracelets, everything
Daddy, you oughta get the best for me
Hey, Daddy, gee, don't I look swell in sables?
Clothes with Paris labels?
Daddy, you oughta get the best for me 

Here's *'n'amazing* revelation
With a bit of stimulation
I'd be a great sensation
I'd be your inspiration

Daddy, I want a brand new car, champagne, caviar
Daddy, you oughta get the best for me 

Hey, Daddy, I want a diamond ring, bracelets, everything
