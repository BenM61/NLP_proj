No I don't lack ambition
Can't you see what I hate
That it's you who is sinking
Locked behind iron gates

You should know
You're falling into fiction
I can tell
You're on some foolish mission

You're black eyed soul
You should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy
You will find
Your own space and time

You call me superstitious
Tie me up with your deceit
I could never be malicious
Though I seem so bittersweet

You should know
You're falling into fiction
I can tell
You're on some foolish mission

You're black eyed soul
You should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy
You will find
Your own space and time

Black eyed soul
You should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy
You will find
Your own space and
Time

Yeh, you should know
You're falling into fiction
I can tell
You're on some foolish mission

You're black eyed soul
You should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy
You will find
Your own space and time

Black eyed soul
You should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy
You will find
Your own space and time

Black eyed soul
You should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy
You will find
Your own space and time
