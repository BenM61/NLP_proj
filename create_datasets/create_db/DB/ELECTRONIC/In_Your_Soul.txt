Ever since I was a little kid
I have always thought
I could run faster than the wind
Stare up to the sky with open spaces
I could live and die
Man you can't find that in no book
Never find that in no book
Someone will drag you down
And try to knock you under
Hey mama said with her words of wonder
Don't matter cause, cause it's in your soul

I have always felt
That I had to prove it to myself 
No salvation from the firin' line
A million dreams won't set you free
God I know there's something trapped in me
There's no refuge from the ride
No shelter ever saved a man his pride
Give you pain and never feed your hunger
I won't close my eyes when it rain and thunders
Don't matter cause, cause it's in your soul

And when the night is overcome 
And I've been racin' down a road
That's got no trace, no face
If I could live by the words I've sung
And carry all the choices I've made
I swear, I swear I'll be there

Hey mister don't shadow box with me
Cause I don't want to someday be
An old man cursin' what I might have been
No I realize what I see
That the wind was never chasin' me
And I don't feel so alone
I can close my eyes I'm goin' home

Behind the clouds the sun is shinin'
Some rain will fall no use cryin'
Oh no, oh no not me
Got a picture in my head that won't let go of young man running in search of 
Count your blessings
Cause it's in your soul, oh it's in your soul

In your soul, oh no
Ever since I was a little kid
I have always thought
Young man running
