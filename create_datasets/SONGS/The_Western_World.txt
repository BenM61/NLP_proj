We are the dregs
Of the western world
The steroid boys and video girls
We are the viral internet stars
And the anchor man
Can't stop crying

We are the dead with
The dreaded disease
The nuclear sons for you and me
Let's go all right all right let's go
What the f*ck are you saying?

Now I don't wanna
Live here anymore
(Gonna watch it burn)
We are the best
And we'll fight to the death
'Till there's nothing left
Worth fighting for
In the western world

This is the end of evolution's rise
The feeding frenzy of the uncivilized
The paparazzi parasites
And the vultures can't stop feeding

This is the face of our vanity
The tabloid death of inhumanity
Let's go all right all right let's go
What the f*ck are you saying?

Now I don't wanna
Live here anymore
(Gonna watch it burn)
We take the best
And we spit out the rest
And always leave them
Wanting more.
In the western world

We are the dregs
Of the western world
The steroid boys and video girls
We are the viral internet stars
And the anchor man
Can't stop lying

We are the dead with
The dreaded disease
The nuclear sons for you and me
Let's go all right all right let's go
What the f*ck are you saying?

Now I don't wanna
Live here anymore
(Gonna watch it burn)
We are the best and
We'll fight to the death
'Till there's nothing left
Worth fighting for

Now I don't wanna
Live here anymore
(Gonna watch it burn)
We take the best and
We spit out the rest
And always leave them wanting more
In the western world
In the western world
In the western world
