I want a man to hold me tight 
I want a man to kiss goodnight 
If he's young and free, just send him to me 
Experience unnecessary 

I want a man with lots of charm 
I want a man, no false alarm 
The kind of guy who kiss my tears when I cry 
Experience unnecessary 

If he is big and strong and willing to learn 
There are such thrills in store 
And when the lights are dim and I'm close to him 
I'll teach him what my lips are for 

I want a man around the house 
I want a man not just a mouse 
We'll spend a cozy life as husband and wife 
Experience unnecessary 

If he is big and strong and willing to learn 
There are such thrills in store 
And when the lights are dim and I'm close to him 
I'll teach him what my lips are for
