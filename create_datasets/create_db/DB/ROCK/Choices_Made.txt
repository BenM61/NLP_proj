There was a time when I washed out with the tide that came in your opinion
I second guessed what I knew was right
It was just to please and so I did it as a friend
In need of friends, what I'm looking for

'Cause it won't cut it anymore
Take a seat and watch
It counts too much
It's your decision, so what are you gonna do?

I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice
And I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice

The trouble when you go with the flow, you might set yourself up to give
Out more than you can
A situation that'll come your way,
Something you don't approve, but you couldn't see

And you're right if you're feeling bad
Lose yourself following a fad
So stick around with who you found will listen to what you gotta say
And is it easy?

I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice
And I don't need you to make my choices
I can speak, you can hear my voice

And everyone's not looking for approval
Sometimes you gotta go it alone
Don't work too hard being normal
Just work hard on what you want

So I don't need you to make my choices
I don't need you to make my choices
I don't need you to make my choices!
Make my choices

I don't need you to make my choices!
