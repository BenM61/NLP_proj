Look a here, Bill, I'd come to you one day
I was tryin' to make a way
And you was cryin' and you told me
One day you would tell me who you were cryin' for
Who were you cryin' for?

Mama, yeah
What did you want with your mama?
A drink of water, Mama
Well, go ahead and tell me how Mama treated you

Mama, Mama, oh Mama
Mama, Mama, Mama, oh Mama
Mama, whoa, Mama, what you want from me?
I want a drink of water, Mama

Ooh, ooh, ooh, Mama, whoa, what you want, son?
I want a little drink of whiskey, Mama
Yes, I just wanna get drunk, Mama
Whoa, come staggerin' one more time

Mama, Mama, please ma'am answer me, Mama
Thank you, Mama, thank you, Mama
Thank you, Mama, for every little thing you did
