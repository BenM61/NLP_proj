Oh the suns going down
The nights coming in
I got a brain for business and a body for sin
So shoot like a rocket 'cause my engine is hot 
If you want what's forbidden 
Baby that's what I got 

Sex drive
Sex drive
Sex drive
Sex drive
Sex drive
Sex drive
Sex drive it sees no gender or color 
So lets get together and collide with each other
Sex drive aw you know how it feels
Get out of my car and get under my wheels

Sex drive
Sex drive
Sex drive
Sex drive
French kisses a thing of the past
Were too young to die so we'd better live fast
The dying is easy the urge is so hard
If your looking for funking then get into my car

I'm a Mercedes Benz why don't you jump in
I got a rear view mirror you can watch us in
The harder you drive the smoother I go
I got my engine running

Sex drive it sees no gender or color
So lets get together and collide with each other
Sex drive aw you know how it feels
Get out of my car and get under my wheels 

Oh the suns coming down
The nights coming in
I got a brain for business and a body for sin
So shoot like a rocket 'cause my engine is hot
If you want what's forbidden baby that's what I got

Get under my wheels
Get under my wheels
Get under my wheels
