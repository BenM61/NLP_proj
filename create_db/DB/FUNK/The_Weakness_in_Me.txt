I'm not the sort of person who falls
In and quickly out of love
But to you I gave my affection
Right from the start

I have a lover who loves me:
How could I break such a heart?
Yet still you gained my attention

Why do you come here
When you know I've got troubles enough?
Why do you call me
When you know I can't answer the phone?

Make me lie, when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of an unknowin' fool
You make me stare, when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me?

Why do you come here
And pretend to be just passing by?
But I need to see you,
And I mean to hold you
Tightly

Feeling guilty, worried,
Waking from tormented sleep
This old love has me bound
But this new love cuts deep

If I choose now, I'll lose out
One of you has to fall
But I need you, and you

Why do you come here
When you know I've got troubles enough?
Why do you call me
When you know I can't answer the phone?

Make me lie, when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of an unknowin' fool
You make me stare, when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me?

Why do you come here
And pretend to be just passing by?
But I need to see you,
And I mean to hold you
Tightly
