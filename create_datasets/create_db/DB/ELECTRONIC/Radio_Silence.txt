I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me
We lived in love with each other so long
I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me
I don't know how you feel
I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me
I'm sorry, I don't know how you feel
I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me
Just please, more time
I don't know how you feel
I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me

Just please, more time
I'm sorry, I don't know how you feel
I don't know how you feel
It's hard to tell if I don't know how you feel

But in my heart
There's a radio silence going on
But in my heart
There's a radio silence going on
But in my heart
There's a radio silence going on

I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me
There's a radio silence going on
I can't believe this, you don't wanna see me
I don't know how you feel
I'm sorry I don't know how you feel
I don't know how you feel
