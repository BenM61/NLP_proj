All over the night, the beat goes on
Can you hear it? Can you feel?
Through the years music keeps running
The beat keeps running on, on and on

And I'll always be feeling it, and I won't slow down
Just as long as those wheels go round
I'll be riding that fast train to Memphis
On that sweet are & be	
Till that green grass way down home grows up over me

Somewhere in this world a child is born
He can her, he can feel it
Just like me, he'll keep it running
He'll keep it running on, on and on
