Dance with me... Whaaat?
Dance with me... Say what, say what? 
Tango with me... Say what, say what?
Tango with me... Say what, say what?
Dance with me... Say what, say what?
Dance with me... Say what, say what?
Tango with me... Say what, say what?
Haha, bring it in

Ooooh, I love what you got on
A tight see-through dress with some green and pink thongs
Word is bond, can I pick you up in my eight-five-oh
Or do you want to pick me up, in your black limo
Here goes, an evening that's memorable
A year ago you didn't like me 'cause I had no dough
Whoa, a black man on a mission, wishin'
That your crazy ass would listen, hear 'bout what you been missin'
I know you want to do it, I know you want to ride it, my pony
Get on me, bone me, act like you own me
Then I gotta feel your crazy ass out homie, what?

Oooohhh, luv 2 luv ya, baby
Oooohhh, luv 2 luv ya, baby
Oooohhh, luv 2 luv ya, baby
Oooohhh, luv 2 luv ya, baby
(Timbaland:)
I love you baby, I love you baby what?
I still love you, say what say what?
Uhh, I love you baby, uh uh uh uh I love you baby
What? I love you baby
Tell me how much you love me

Tim, come over here and take my address
I undress in a black neglige like Faye Dunaway
Run your fingers through my hair and squeeze my nipples
Love the way you're talkin' in my ear like that baby tickles
Later for uptown, no time to go downtown
I'm wild, since you see Club Clit, now take a look around
Dive in, my Billy Ocean, crazy drunk now
Quick to respond, when I come just keep it there now
Move over please, 'cause you're drivin' me nuts
You went past my sugar-wall straight to my guts
I came, you come, you still do amaze me
