The boy had a way with words, he sang, he moved with grace
He entertained so naturally, no gesture out of place
His road in life was clearly drawn, he didn't hesitate
He played, they saw, he conquered as the master of
As the master of his fate

The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognize
Material ambition that her gentleness disguised
She gave herself to him certain of his fame
Wanted him for luxury for limelight and his name

And then he sang to her

I love you for your silence
I love you for your peace
The still and calm releases
That sweep into my soul
That slowly take control

I love you for your passion
I love you for your fire
The violent desire
That burns me in it's flame
A love I dare not name

His rise was irresistible - yeah, he grew into the part
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art
No base considerations of some glittering reward
The prize was knowing that (his work) his work was noticed and adored

Hey
I love you (yes I love you) for your silence (for your silence)
I love you for your peace (for your peace)
The still and calm releases
That sweep into my soul
And slowly slowly takes control

He told the truth
Yes, he told the truth (and he told the truth)

Accepting every honor with (with) a masterly display (display)
Of well rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way
He started to believe that he was all they said and more (and more)
She forgot, she forgot the reasons (reasons) she had wanted him before
Yeah

I love you for your passion (for your passion)
I love you for your fire
The violent desire
That burns me in it's flame (burns me)
A love I dare not name

The still and calm releases (releases)
That sweep into my soul (sweep into my soul)
That slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly)
Slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly take control

And when at last they fell apart she wished that she could be
The hardened heart of yesterday, as cynical as he
By changing for the better she had changed things for the worse
The words that made them happy once now echoed, echoed as a curse
Aaahaaahaahaahaaa
