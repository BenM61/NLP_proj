Met her out of town 
In a small cafe 
She had the motion of the ocean 
How her hips did sway 
She had everybody lookin' back 
And everybody tookin' back 
And anything she wanted all the guys 
Obeyed 
Now she was a site for sore pupils 
And she likes to flaunt it cause she knows she got it 
And she does the most intoxicating things 
To make a man with worries 
Feel everything is okay 

[Chorus] 
She's got powers 
And I think I want to get in her spell 
Powers 
Every bone inside me of all my cells 

She holds you down but when you need a push 
She keeps it honest 
She reflects 
Then she'll force you to look 
You dig everything about her 
From her head down to her follicles 
There's a heaven in her smile 
She'll steal your heart like a crook 
Now she knows 
Exactly what you want and when 
And she goes 
To any measures just to see you get it 
And she flows 
Like the now 
I think that she was Nephertiti in a life 
Before this present life was took 
She got powers 

[Chorus] 

P-O-W-E-R-S 
Fizz and bubble when I see her yes 
Want to see just how deep her abyss gets 
Lost in the magic of her secret bliss 
She is a bonafide keeper just 
Want to travel inside and seek her depths 
Mystique so fresh 
From the west coast to the east coast 
It's a death blow make a Negro get 
Spun up in her web she don't need no net 
People low and behold 
She knows just 
What I need make an ego 
What I need make an ego 
Fly like an eagle 
Feelin' regal, o b-o-y 
O she's so fly 
Lethal injection 
Frozen in my step like deep in breath 
Keepin'a brethren like me in a head spin 
Doc take a rain check 
She is the medicine 
 
She got some tricks and she got some treats 
She'll shake the ground underneath you 
Knock you off your feet 
She got everything you dream about 
Everything you think about 
Hear melodies and sounds of music 
When she speaks 
She stays persistent with her energy 
And she plays 
Those games when its time to play 'em 
And she ages 
Like the finest kind of wine 
And just a whiff of her ferment 
Will make your knees get weak
