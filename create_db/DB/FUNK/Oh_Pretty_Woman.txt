Oh, pretty woman
Sure's the rising sun
Says all your cheap paint and powder
Ain't gonna help you none
'Cause she's a pretty woman
Right down to her bone
So you might as well
Leave your skin alone
chorus:
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Oh, pretty woman
What you gonna do?
You kept on foolin' around
Till I got stuck on you
So you can drop your mess
And come down off your throne
Stop using my poor heart
As just a stepping stone
chorus
Oh, pretty woman
That's all right for you
Now you just go on doing
What you wanna do
But someday when you think
That you've got it made
You're gettin' water deep enough
So you can't wade
chorus
Oh, pretty woman
Oh, pretty woman
Oh, pretty woman
Oh, pretty woman
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Can't make you love me
No matter what I do
Oh, pretty woman
