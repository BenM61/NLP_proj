Till then, my darling, please wait for me
Till then, no matter when it may be
One day I know I'll be home again
Please wait till then

Our dreams will live though we are apart
Our love will always stay in our hearts
Till then, when all the world will be free
Please wait for me

Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every gain must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time

Till then, we'll dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till then
