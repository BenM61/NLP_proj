Cake walkers may come, cake walkers may go,
But I wanna tell you 'bout a couple I know;
High steppin' pair,
Debonair,
When it comes for bus'ness not a soul can compare!

Here they come, 
Look at 'em demonstratin',
Goin' some, 
Ain't they syncopatin'!
Talk o' the town,
Teasin' brown,
Pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em down.

Dancin' fools, ain't they demonstratin'
They're a class of their own!
Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em,
You may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em!
Strut your stuff,
They're cake walkin' babies from home.

Oh, here they come, 
Look at 'em syncopatin',
Goin' some, 
Ain't they demonstratin'!
Talk o' the town,
Teasin' brown,
They pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em down.

Dancin' fools, ain't they syncopatin'
They in a class of their own!
Oh, the only way to win is to cheat 'em,
You may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em!
Strut your stuff,
Strut your stuff,
Cake walkin' babies from home.
