Been sleeping over for the past couple of weeks
Making a habit out of it, yeah
When I woke up, I saw your toothbrush on the sink
It kinda scared me, I'll admit

If there's a line, I think that we crossed it
Second time you stay the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

Last stop before it gets messy
Last stop before it gets heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets messy

I try to tell myself that you gotta take it slow
I always jump in way too fast, yeah
If you wake up and I'm not there
It's nothing personal
Just got some problems from my past

If there's a line, I think that we crossed it
Second time you stay the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

Last stop before it gets messy
Last stop before it gets heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets messy
Before it gets messy

If there's a line, I think that we crossed it
Second time you stay the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

Last stop before it gets messy
Last stop before it gets heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets messy
