There's a new world comin'
And it's just around the bend
There's a brand new mornin'
That belongs to you and me

A new world comin'
The one we had visions of
And it's comin' in peace
It's comin' in joy
and comin' in love yea yea yea

There's a new world comin'
And its just around the bend
There's a new day dawning
the one that's for you and me

A new world comin'
The one we've had visions of
and it's comin' in peace
comin' in love
comin' in peace
comin' in joy
and comin' in peace
comin' in joy
And comin' in love

And I saw another sign in Heaven
Great and marvelous
Seven angels having the seven last plagues
for in them is filled up the wrath of God

And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire
And them that had gotten the victory over the beast
And over his image
and over his mark
and over his name,
stand on the sea of glass
with the harps of God all around them.

There's a new world comin'
and its just around the bend
There's a new day dawning
