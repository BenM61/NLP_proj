Brighton Hill, where the sky changes its color 
Hopes are high, there's no other place I'd rather be 
Find your dream by a tree out in the meadow 
Where the flowers are yellow, life is what it seems 
Brighton Hill is a feelin' within me 
Anybody goin' that way? 
Brighton Hill is a friend and will be 
Till my dying day 
Till my dying day 
I've got a lot of livin' to do 
I've got a lot of livin' to do 
Brighton Hill, with its green fields of clover 
That's where kindness reigns over everything around 
And livin' good on a bicycle Sunday 
You can have such a fun day up on Brighton Hill 
Brighton Hill is a feelin' within me 
Anybody goin' that way? 
Brighton Hill is a friend & will be 
Till my dying day 
Anybody goin' that way? 
Brighton Hill, a feelin' within me 
Anybody goin' that way?
