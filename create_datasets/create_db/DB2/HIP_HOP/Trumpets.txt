Countin' trumpets on the wall firey flame will kill us all 
And I hear trumpets ringing in my head before I go to sleep 
Takes me back way back when we were young and we were friends 
Now I'm home alone smokin' cigarettes waitin' by the phone 
Sweet Virgina blue skies early mornin' sunrise 
I can see your spirit dancin' next to mine 

I know that you'll never be the same again 
We can just roll on down this road my friend 
I know that you'll never be just never be alone 
I know that you'll be there when I will say goodbye
 
Hold on tight baby lean when I lean 
Both arms tight lady follow my lead 
Let your hair down feel it blow in the breeze 
I'm a' take you to a place that you'll never believe 
Riding on the wind disappear in the sky 
Never ask why spread wings and fly 
Sunbathe in the sunrays and dream 
Listening to Dave play and Stevie sing 

I know that you'll never be the same again 
We can just roll on down this road my friend 
I know that you'll never be just never be alone 
I know that you'll be there when I will say goodbye
 
Countin' trumpets on the wall firey flame will kill us all 
And I hear trumpets ringing in my head before I go to sleep 
Takes me back way back when we were young and we were friends 
Now I'm home alone smokin' cigarettes waitin' by the phone 
Sweet Virgina blue skies early mornin' sunrise 
I can see your spirit dancin' next to mine 

I know that you'll never be the same again 
We can just roll on down this road my friend 
I know that you'll never be just never be alone 
I know that you'll be there when I will say goodbye
