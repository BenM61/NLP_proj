Since the day I left you I hear your voice in every sound
Since the day I left you I see your face in every crowd
It won't go away

But every time I feel you near
I close my eyes and turn to stone
Cause now the only thing I fear
Is seeing you’re better off alone
Yeah

Cut out my eyes and leave me blind
Cut out my eyes and leave me blind

With the weight of the world upon me I can’t hold my head up high
So if you see me on the street turn away or walk on by

Cause after the beauty we’ve destroyed
I’m cascading through the void
I know in time my heart will mend
I don’t care if I never see you again
Yeah

Cut out my eyes and leave me blind
Cut out my eyes and leave me blind

Girl, I told you
After all we’ve been through
I don't wanna be by myself
Girl, I told you
That it would tear me in two
If I see you with someone else

Cut out my eyes, And leave me blind
Cut out my eyes, And leave me blind
Cut out my eyes, And leave me blind
