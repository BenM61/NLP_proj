Feeling down when the autumn has come
Stormy days and the leaves keep on falling.
I don't like the town when the autumn has come
Clouds are grey and there's fog outside.

Feeling down when the winter has come
Frozen feet and the snowflakes are falling.
I don't like the town when the winter has come

Dirty streets and it's cold outside.
I don't care for a riding sleigh 
Get your share for the rainy day.

Rain in may wipes your worries away.
Take a dose take off your cloths
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in may.

Feeling down when the summer has come
Burning heat drops and sweet keep on falling.
I don't like the town when the summer has come

Dusty streets and it's hot outside.
I don't care for a sunny day 
Get your share for the rain in may.

Rain in may wipes your worries away.
Take a dose take off your cloths
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in may.

Rain in may wipes your worries away.
Take a dose take off your cloths
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in may.
