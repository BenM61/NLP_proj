(Fell in love I fell in love)

Yes I fell in love last Monday
With a girl I met last Sunday
As I held her hand tears fell like rain
From the girl I met last Sunday

(I fell in love)

Her hands were soft as cotton
Her face could never be forgotten
That's how I know I love her so
Yes the girl I met last Sunday
Her eyes was bright as the moonlight
Her lips were cherry red
I know that I love her
And the sweet little things she said
Yes I fell in love last Monday
With a girl I met last Sunday
Now we doin' fine
She's mine all mine
Yes the girl I met last Sunday
