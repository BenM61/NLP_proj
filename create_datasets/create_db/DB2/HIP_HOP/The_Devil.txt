In the light of my darkness

I took the devil off my train
He laughed and got back in the game
He started messing with my head
And threw a pretty girl out of my bed

Though I smile to my man downstairs

I took a chance and started a fight
With a girl from the other side
He put me in a bad bad light
And she only stayed for one night

In the light of my darkness
You'll see me smile to my man downstairs
He's just a part of what life is
The part of you who just don't care

I took the devil off my train
He laughed and got back in the game
He started messing with my head
And threw a pretty girl out of my bed
I pushed the devil off the road
Did 180 and watched the car explde
The light wave blinded my eyes
The devil messed up my life
