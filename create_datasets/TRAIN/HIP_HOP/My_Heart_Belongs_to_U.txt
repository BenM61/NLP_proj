Anything you want from me
You got it

You can have my love
You're the girl of my life
Am I all you're dreaming of
Yes you're my desire

I wanna give you so much
for the things that you give to me
Just take my love baby
because you are so dear to me

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need
there's nothing I won't do

I say whatever you want
my heart belongs to you
I say whatever you need
I'll be right here for you

Once in a lifetime
You will find someone like you
and now that I have you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna give you so much
I will give you my all and all
over and over again lady,lady,lady
lovin' you too much baby
is not, is not, is not a sin

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need
there's nothing I won't do

I say whatever you want
my heart belongs to you
I say whatever you need
I'll be right here for you

Anything you want I'll do it for you
in the morning
whenever you want it (makes no difference)
in the evening
whenever you need (late in the midnight hour)
when the night fogs (you know that I got it)
you know that I got it
so baby just call me
you know that I'll do it

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need
there's nothing I won't do

I say whatever you want
my heart belongs to you
I say whatever you need
I'll be right here for you

I say whatever you want
my heart belongs to you
