Packed all my clothes, shut the door,
Back on the road to success
Hopped in my two-seater just me in the dream been of (baby)
Stick to the hurts and burst spitting words of encouragement, (baby)
And if you feel what I'm feeling
Then don't be scared to say it women, say

[Chorus]
I got this, every single breath another step on my road
I got this, I'm from the south side trying to get to my goal
I got this, ain't no stopping me,
Come on follow me if you feel the need
I got this, better believe I got this, believe I got this

So many tried to bring me
When I got up and knocked me down
Didn't keep me from moving
I flip the world upside down
They said the sky was the limit
I put my footprint all in it
'Cause I've been there
I'm looking down every move
And if you feel like I do
Put your hands in the air

[Chorus]

God believes smile at me cause when I fall I won't drop
Something in me won't let me stop until I reach the top
I keep going, I keep showing the whole world everyday I'm growing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything in me says I got this

[Chorus]

I got this, every single breath another step on my road
I got this, I'm from the south side trying to get to my goal
I got this, ain't no stopping me, come on follow me if you feel the need
I got this, better believe I got this, believe I got this
I got this, I got this, uh, I got this, I got this
I got this, I know you know I got this, you better know I got it, you got it, you know it
I got this, I got it, yeah
