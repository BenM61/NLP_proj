I feel insane every single time
I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
And that's the way it stays

So how long did I expect
Love to outweigh ignorance?
By that look on your face
I may have forced the scale to tip

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane
(I'm not)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Set it off)
Come back again, it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart
From the things I've done to you
It's hard to face but the fact remains
That this is nothing new

I left you bound and tied
With suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin
But deep inside I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane
(I'm not)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Set it off)

Come back again, it's almost easy
(You learned your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(It's still your fault)
Come back again, it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
Now let me make it right
(Make it all right)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane
(I'm not)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(Set it off)

Come back again, it's almost easy
(You learned your lesson)
Come back to me, it's almost easy
(It's still your fault)
Come back again, it's almost easy
