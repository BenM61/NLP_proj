Hey baby baby may I have a word with you
I been watchin' you from over here
I been wondering if I can get to know you
I think you got what I want and all I'm askin' for 
So baby could you spend some time
Bet I can find a way to make ya mine

Oh my baby, who you drive me crazy
I can't even ask for more cause boy
I think you got it all
Oh my baby, who you drive me crazy
I can't even ask for more cause boy
I think you got it all

Ooo you make me feel so good
I'll do what you ask me to
Ooooh you make me feel so right
Every day and every night

Ooo let me tell you how much
I'm in love with you
From the moment that I saw ya face
I never ever thought about you being replaced 
I know that I found the guy that I been looking for
I threw my other numbers out the door 
'Cause I know I don't need them anymore

Oh my baby, who you drive me crazy
I can't even ask for more cause boy
I think you got it all
Oh my baby, who you drive me crazy

Every day and every night

Oooo you make me feel so good
I'll do what you ask me to
Ooooh you make me feel so right
Every day and every night
