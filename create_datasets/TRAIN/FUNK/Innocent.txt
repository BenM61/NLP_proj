Girl, girl

Hey listen girl, I can't explain
What happened to me, oh, no
I just looked at you, babe
And suddenly my body felt weak, over you

Oh, I really should leave but I got to stay
I want you, girl, in my own way
What can I do to make you see
That I really need you too

We are innocent, oh baby girl
Innocent lover, in heat, in my life
We are innocent, sugar baby
Innocent love for more than one night

Baby, something inside is telling me
Your love is so sweet, so, so nice
And you can be sure, babe
That I'm gonna do you just right, just, just right

Oh, oh, no useless games, I'm gonna play
'Cause I bet you want me in the right way
Sugar, you're fine and sure to please
So I'll give my mind so freely

Innocent, baby girl, innocent lover, in heat, in my life
Baby, don't you know I really want you
Innocent, girl, innocent lover for more than one night
Than one night, baby

Innocent, girl
Innocent lover, in heat, in my life
I need a lover in my life
Innocent, innocent lover for more than one night

I really should leave but I got to stay
I want you, girl in my own way
What can I do to make you see
That I really need you too

Innocent

I'll give you love, I'll treat your right
Don't worry, girl everything will be all right
Innocent, I need a girl, that's sugar fine
Sure to please, and wanna be mine all mine

Innocent
Innocent lover, in heat, in my life
Innocent, innocent lover
For more than one night

Innocent, girl
Innocent lover, in heat, in my life
I need a lover in my life
Innocent
