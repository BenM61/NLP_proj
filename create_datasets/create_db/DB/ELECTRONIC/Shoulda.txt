Walked when I shoulda run
Ran when I shoulda walked
And don't I know it
And don't I know it

Walked when I shoulda run
And I ran when I shoulda walked
And don't I know it
And don't I know it

You get inside me
Even when you went beside me
And I go into hiding
And I know I never leave it alone

'Nother round of if onlys
Of all the ways you can know me
How I take time going slowly
All the time that I did on my own

Still I walked when I shoulda run
And I ran when I shoulda walked
And don't I know it
And don't I know it

Well I walked when I shoulda run
And I ran when I shoulda walked
And don't I know it
And don't I know it

And your head's in the ocean
Too deep to know where you're going
Hoping time can be frozen
And you'll end up where you really belong

But the days keep on rolling
We live in different moments
And our hurt is unfolding
Everyday that we do and we don't

Still I walked when I shoulda run
And I ran when I shoulda walked
And don't I know it
And don't I know it
Well I walked when I shoulda run
And I ran when I shoulda walked
And don't I know it
And don't I, don't I, don't I, know it
No no no no no

Sign for what's been
Sign for what never
The line under what's been
The line for what never

And the years are collected
I pray that we are regretless
You and I - the connected
You and I and the blood and the bone
