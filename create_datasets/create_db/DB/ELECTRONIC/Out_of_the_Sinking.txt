Past midnight's hold
Where the world's awaiting
I'll wait for you love
But I close my eyes, as there's pain too in paradise
Hey baby say, just what you're thinking
Know I know it, yeah, feel I'm sinking
Know I feel it, I know you feel it too
Across the water, there's a boat that
Will take us away

It is shining for me
All I need to be
But I can't find the key
The one to make me believe

Late at night
When the world is dreaming
Way past the stars
That ignore our fate, all twinkle too late to save us
So we save ourselves.

Hey baby do, just what you're thinking
Know I know it, yeah, feel I'm sinking
Know I feel it, I know you feel it too
Across the water, there's a boat that
Will take us away

Far from the madness, out of the sadness
Into sunlight, out of the sinking
You know I feel it, I know you it too 
Across the water, there's a boat that will take us away
And there we will stay
