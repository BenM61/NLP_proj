When I touch you I can feel you shivering,
I can feel your heart is beating fast,
We are alone in this crowded room,
Oh tonight there is something happening,
And it's something that should never be,
But there's a flame over you and me;

And I can see the fire on water,
I can see the light shining in your eyes,
I know that I can't stop it now,
'cause I've been caught in the heat of the sun

There's a place in an ancient fortress,
High above the worries of the world,
I'd love you there for a long, long time,
And we'll discover all our deepest secrets,
And let the spirit go flying free,
Until the dawn breaks over the sea;

It's burning like fire on the water,
I can see the light shining in your eyes,
I know that I can't stop it now,
'cause I've been caught in the heat of the sun,
Yes I've been caught in the heat of the sun,
Oh let it shine on me,
And I can see the fire on the water,
I can see the light shining in your eyes,
I know that I can't stop it now,
'cause I've been caught in the heat of the sun,
Yes I've been caught in the heat of the sun,
Oh let it shine on me;

And I can see the fire on the water,
Can't stop it now
