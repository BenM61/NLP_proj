Come on now sugar, come
I really don't wanna go home
Stay with me, be a friend
These streets so cold
And my mind's full of goals
Come up now we take your car
I know a sleazy bar
Not far downtown you get tacos for free
And it's open all night, come on hang with me

I got money, I got money (I pay for you, I pay for you)
I got money, I got money (if you pray for me, would you pray for me)

Stay with me tonight
We can count the street lights
Stay with me alright
Let's bring it all back to life
Don't fade away
Stay

I like it here, f*ck work
Plus you said your boss is a jerk
I need you now, don't bang on me
Imma break your shit, let's do what we
Always used to do
Stupid around like two fools
Nights are longer, I feel alone
You look after me, it hurts

I got money, I got money (I pay for you, I pay for you)
I got money, I got money (if you pray for me, would you pray for me)

Stay with me tonight
We can count the street lights
Stay with me alright
Let's bring it all back to life
Don't fade away
Stay

One more
Come on
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)
One more (one more, girl)
On me (come on)
Then we go home
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)
One more (one more)
Come on (come on)
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)
One more (one more)
On me (on me, girl)
Then we go home (then we go home)
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)

Stay with me tonight
We can count the street lights
Don't fade away
Stay with me alright
Let's bring it all back to life
Don't fade away
Stay
