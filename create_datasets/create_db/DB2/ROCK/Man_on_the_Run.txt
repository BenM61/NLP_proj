See yourself in this
I know the way you wanted
It's slow to the beyond

She gave me nearly everything
Kiss of life and everything in between
A dynamite and we disappear
Like smoke on horizon

Thought that I could lean on you
Forever, forever

Man on the run
You better step aside
Man on the run
Running for his life
Man on the run
Racing through the balance
Racing through the balance

Time waits for no one
Feel the walls closing in
My mind spins like helicopter blades

I never thought to be here now
The warning signs were so unclear
We could chase our busted dreams

Man on the run
You better step aside
Man on the run
Running for his life
Man on the run
Racing through the balance
Racing through the balance

Man on the run
You better step aside
Man on the run
Running for his life
Man on the run
Racing through the balance
Racing through the balance

Man on the run (man on the run)
Man on the run (man on the run)
Racing through the balance
Racing through the balance
