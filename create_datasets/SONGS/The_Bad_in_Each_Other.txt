Speak clearly he said, but didn't see
He acted that way and hello will be like a cut
Fill me up and pour me out, realize the doubt
We had the same feelings at opposite times

When good man and good woman
Can find the good in each other
And good man and good woman
Bring out the worst in the other
The bad in each other

Where to love to find it now
When we'll become two
Floating into the blue and the neon river
The sadness can move either without or with him

The good man and good woman
Can't find the beauty in each other
And the good man and the good woman
Bring out the worst in the other
When good man and that good woman

Can find the good in each other
Then good man and good woman
Bring out the worst in the other
The bad in each other
