False accusations led to a fight
I was so wrong, she's gone tonight

I was so wrong, I can see it now
Jealously had twisted me somehow
Yes, it did and I know it did

False accusations, I can't take back
My mouth was moving but you know that my mind was off track

I was so wrong, she's gone now
Jealously had twisted me somehow
Yes, it did

Jealousy, jealousy, it's got me so mad
Red is all I see
I heard one rumor, let my anger fly
But she had an air-tight alibi

Jealousy, jealousy, it's got me so mad
Red is all I see
I heard one rumor, let my anger fly
But she had an air-tight alibi

Hey, hey, hey

False accusations, made her so mad
She packed the few good things we had

I was so wrong, yeah, yeah, I can see it now
Jealously had twisted me somehow
Yes it did, and I know it did

You know that I made
False accusations
False accusations
