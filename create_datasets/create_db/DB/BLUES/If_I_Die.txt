Rain is falling on my head,
Pretty soon I might be dead.
The end is here, Lord, it's plain to see
I guess my country's made a fool of me.

If I die, please make sure,
Someone will bring me home.
If I die, tomorrow,
Someone will be all alone.

Family's children standin' by,
Mother finds it hard not to cry.

A look of sadness on their face,
Tryin' hard not to show a trace.

If I die, please make sure,
Someone will bring me home.
If I die, tomorrow,
Someone will be all alone.

One last question before I go,
One last answer I must know.
Tomorrow morning I'll be alone,
Can you tell me why I can't be home?

If I die, please make sure,
Someone will bring me home.
If I die, tomorrow,
Someone will be all alone.

If I die, please make sure,
Someone will bring me home.
If I die, tomorrow,
Someone will be all alone.

I don't wanna die, but if I die

If I die, please make sure,
Someone will bring me home.
If I die, tomorrow,
Someone will be all alone.
