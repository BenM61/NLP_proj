If I lost you now
It would take my heart from me
I can't imagine life without you
The love of you, baby
Lately I confess
I've been short on tenderness
Too much time on work, I guess
Not enough on you
Now if I forgot to tell you I love you
I really got no excuse, no excuse
Because you're beautiful, my one desire
You're my soul's inspiration
And if I didn't say it, well I do now
You're my sweet inspiration- baby, baby
If I'm feelin' low
I've only got myself to blame
'cause I can always share the load
When I'm near you- uh, huh
You can rescue me, baby
You bring out the best in me
I'm the girl I want to be
When I'm near you, huh
I may need reminding to say I love you
But heaven know that I do, yes I do
Because you're beautiful, my one desire
You're my soul's inspiration
And if I didn't say it, well I do now
You're my sweet inspiration- baby, baby
From the day I met you, baby
Yes, I knew instinctively
Whatever our future
Together we were gonna be, baby
Huh, my baby
Nothin', nothin's sweeter to me than you, baby
You, baby
Yes sir I love you, baby
Hey-now, I love you baby
Hey, ahh yahh
