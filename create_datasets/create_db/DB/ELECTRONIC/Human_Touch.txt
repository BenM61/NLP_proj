Good love is so hard to find
We got it right for a while
Do you get lonely at night?
We don't have to go higher, we don't have to go

The lights, cold nights, remember when
I call you every now and then
So good, that on and off again
And on again

Oh, why don't you come over?
Baby be close to me, just like you used to be
Oh, one more night to hold ya
We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch
We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch

I always loved how you kiss
And I'm overdue for a fix
Just with a touch of your lips
I want you to come home, I want you to come home

The lights, cold nights, remember when
I call you every now and then
So good, that on and off again
And on again

Oh, why don't you come over?
Baby be close to me, just like you used to be
Oh, one more night to hold ya
We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch

Baby I love how you love in the in between
Baby I love how it feels when you're holding me
Baby I love how you love in the in between
Baby I love it, I love it
Oh, why don't you come over?
Baby be close to me, just like you used to be

Oh, why don't you come over?
Baby be close to me, just like you used to be
Oh, one more night to hold ya
We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch
We don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch
