We're alright
There's been better days, some will say they start again tonight
Alright
Rum punch drunk
Sold a leg or two, to paradise, we're left at the front
Hold on

So, I am calling out to you
Sent from overseas
Let's stay together
I'm down on my knees
I'm howling at the moon
Snatching at your ear
Futile
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Calling out to you
Sent from overseas
Let's stay together
I'm down on my knees
I'm howling at the moon
Snatching at your ear
Futile
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Those cargo pants hide all manner of sin
Their demon demeanour gets let out on a limb
The reel of weed, they just can't mess with the facts
You don't love me, my dear, I don't know how to react

So, I am calling out to you
Sent from overseas
Let's stay together
I'm down on my knees
I'm howling at the moon
Snatching at your ear
Futile
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Calling out to you
Sent from overseas
Let's stay together
I'm down on my knees
I'm howling at the moon
Snatching at your ear
Futile
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
