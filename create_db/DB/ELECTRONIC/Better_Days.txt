What are you hiding from?
You are part of the sum
What has been going on?
Your confidence is gone

You have seen better days
You have lived better ways

What are you waiting for?
Answers that question more
Uninvited they will come
Are you expecting some?

You have seen better days
You have lived better ways

Only time will tell
What will come of you
Only crime could sell
What you're trying to

Were are you heading to?
What plans will you pull through?
With trouble in the wings
Will you risk anything?

You have seen better days
You have lived better ways
