I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love-love
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love-love

Hey darling, sorry that I'm leaving you, my friend
Don't hold me, all of that keeps teasing me again
Again, aga- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, again
Again, aga- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And I bet you, hide for me this pleasure over pain
But who loved you, it's easy enough, it rains on me again
Again, aga- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Again, again, again

I was a fool to love you (I was a fool to love)
Yeah, we could've had it all, all
I was a fool to love you (I was a fool to love)
Yeah, we could've had it all, all
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love

It's funny how we play these mindless games, my friend
They hold me back with insecurities again
Again, aga- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's time for a stronger me, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

So I'm giving you up, giving you up
It's the only way, I'm not gonna save us
Get over my shoulder
You won't have to tell me again
Again, aga- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Again, again, again

I was a fool to love you (I was a fool to love)
Yeah, we could've had it all, all
I was a fool to love you (I was a fool to love)
Yeah, we could've had it all, all

My goodbye to you
Self-assurance is taking me over
Yeah, yeah, it's time I let you
Slip from my shoulder, I'm wise and I'm older

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was a fool to love you (I was a fool to love)
Yeah, we could've had it all, all
I was a fool to love you (I was a fool to love)
Yeah, we could've had it all, all
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you
I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love-love
