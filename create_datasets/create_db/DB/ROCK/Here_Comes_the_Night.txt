Well here it comes, here comes the night.
Well here it comes, long lonely night.

I could see right out of my window,
Walking the street-my girl, with another guy.
His arms around her like she used to do with me,
Whoa, and make me wanna cry,

Yeah-yeah-yeah.
Here it comes, here comes the night.
Here it comes, here comes the night.

And there they go,
It's funny how they're looking so good together,
I wonder what's wrong with me.
Why can't I accept the fact that she's chosen him,
And she's left me.

Yeah-yeah-yeah.
Here it comes, here comes the night.
Here it comes, here comes the night.

Whoa-whoa-whoa
She's with him,
He's turned the lights down low and holding her,
Just like I used to.
Yeah, an I can see her closing her eyes
And telling her lies just like she told me too.

Yeah-yeah-yeah.
Here it comes, here comes the night.
Here it comes, long lonely night.
Well here it comes, here comes the night.
Here it comes, long lonely  night.
Yeah-yeah-yeah.
Well here it comes, here comes the night.
Here it comes, long lonely night.
