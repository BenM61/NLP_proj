I watch life inside of you grow
Every month a little bit bigger
All the things that bothered your soul
Make me smile and go crazy

I wanted to start it with you
But somebody said we ain't ready
I admit inside me lives fear
Fear I never wanted to show you

They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes

We could've moved to LA
It's always sunny bright out there
If I had it my way
We woulda stayed where we started

I wanted to start it with you
But someone said we ain't ready
I admit inside me lives fear
Fear I never wanted to show you

They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
They will always haunt my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
