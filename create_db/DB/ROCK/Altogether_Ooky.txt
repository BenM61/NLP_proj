Caught you
Sniffing my boxers
Who the f*ck does that
At Red Lobster?
Creepy
Like when Tom Cruise laughs
That's how your finger
Felt in my ass

I'm gonna come to your house on the back of a horse with
A bunch of villagers carrying torches
Most of whom dislike monsters like you, girl

The way
Your kisses tasted
Skeeve me the hell out
Like shitting naked
Why would
I wanna stay friends?
Rather get raped by
Clowns again

I'm gonna come to your house on the back of a horse with
A bunch of villagers carrying torches
Most of whom dislike monsters like you, girl

I'm gonna go to your house on the back of a horse with

I rub the lotion on the skin
Or else I get the hose again
I rub the lotion on the skin
Or else I get the hose again
I rub the lotion on the skin
Or else I get the hose again
I rub the lotion on the skin
Or else I get the hose again
I rub the lotion on the skin
Or else I get the hose again
I rub the lotion on the skin
Or else I get the hose again
