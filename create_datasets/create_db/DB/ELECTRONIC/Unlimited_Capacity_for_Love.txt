The end's not in sight, it's gone way too far,
This could turn our another unwinning war,
It wasn't inherited, certainly not a joke,
So many human hearts, hanging in hope,
Unlimited capacity for love,
Unlimited capacity for love.

And now I must add another to love in my life,
It's one thing to say, to do is another,
If I'm capable of adapting without pressured expense,
In a schizoid society in a classic moral sense,
Unlimited capacity for love,
Umlimited capacity for love.

How young I am now, stop counting the weeks,
We're safe from the vois, where they're still counting sheep,
Put the phone to the floor, you'll hear my heart beat,
Some people get married, but I'll never chat,
Unlimited capacity for love,
Unlimited capacity for love.

The end's not in sight, it's gone way too far,
This could turn our another unwinning war,
It wasn't inherited, certainly not a joke,
So many human hearts, hanging in hope,
Unlimited capacity for love
