Oh, when the saints go marching in 
Oh, when the saints go marching in 
I want to be in that number 
When the saints go marching in 

Oh, when the sun, refuses to shine 
I still, want to be in that number 
When the sun refuses to shine 

Oh, when the saints go marching in 
Oh, when the saints go marching in 
I'm going to sing aloud and thunder 
Oh, when the saints go marching in 

Oh, when the saints go marching in 
Oh, when the saints go marching in 
Yes, I want to be in that number 
When the saints go marching in 

Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in  
I still want to be in that number 
When the saints go marching in
