I'm sick of motherfuckers trying to tell me that they're down with Prince
I was just a baby when I heard him playing Vanity 6
And now it's such a ripoff got to get to my Electric Six
Show 'em how it's done I think you got to get shown up rich

Snare drums pound on the 2 and 4.
If you've got a kick drum get on the floor
? some more
All the ? get out the door
?
? if you know what I mean
?
Gettin' down with your royal badness

Been working night and day on my CV since I was seven years old
Didn't know a dollar from a sniff of your raspberry cologne
Ladies beg your pardon can I show no bitches good to go
Where were you ?
