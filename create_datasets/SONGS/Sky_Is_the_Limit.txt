Sun is coming up over the hill
I can hardly sit still
I got the will and I'll find a way
I am not afraid
Waited for the chance
All of my life
I can't watch it go by
Now is the time
It's our choice to make
Every breath we take
No more praying
Off your knees
Play your heart out
Till your finger's bleed
Yesterday's history
Tomorrow's a mystery
But today we're gonna shine

So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly

So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly

Reaching for a higher elevation
A new destination
New revelation
Find it in your heart
That's where you start, yeah
So, no more praying
Off your knees
Play your heart out
Till your finger's bleed
Yesterday's history
Tomorrow's a mystery
But today we're gonna shine

So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly

So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly

Nothing to fear
But fear itself
You got nothing to lose
So give it hell
I'm not wasting more dimes
On wishing wells
We gotta rise up high

So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly

So put your hands up
And touch the sky
'Cause the sky is the limit
Tonight
We are all born to fly
