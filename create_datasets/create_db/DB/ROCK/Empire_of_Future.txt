See the fire that burns through people
It's so strong and bright
Was no error of human kindness
Didn't turn out right

In the ending the infinite danger
Had nothing to do with my life
That's when I realized that
I was the stranger
Watching the two worlds collide

Welcome to the the empire of future
This can't be for real
Welcome to the empire of future
You know it must be believed
Welcome to the empire of future
Its all things revealed
Welcome to the empire of future
It is forever the answer

There were no lies brought to me back then
I would have done no harm
A skin that feels like a python that breathes
A trail must be leaving its mark

Now he tells me that I will live to be old
Fear comes over my system realizing
The fortress of his hand will make you see more clearly

In the ending the infinite danger
Had nothing to do with my life
That's when I realized that I was the stranger
Watching the two worlds collide

Welcome to the the empire of future
This can't be for real
Welcome to the empire of future
You know it must be believed
Welcome to the empire of future
Its all things revealed
Welcome to the empire of future
It is forever the answer

In place of secrets that are known
If it weren't for grief
There would be no blindness here
If it weren't for me
