Da da da da, da da da, da da
Here I go
Da da da da, da da da, da da
Goodness knows

You can see, I've come so far
So kiss me quick
I swear upon the stars, they're mine
I swear upon the love you'll find

So nobody knows, wherever I go it's you
Wherever I go, doesn't it show it's you
So many things I wanted to bring to you
Wherever I go, I want you to know it's you

Talking in my sleep, I sing my song
Caught inside the same dreams
As though nothing's wrong
Time is everything but it's not my gift

Da da da da, da da da, da da
It's everything I wish

I swear upon the road I'm on
I'd give you all I have, I'm strong

So nobody knows, wherever I go it's you
Wherever I go, doesn't it show, it's you
So many things, I wanted to bring to you
Wherever I go, I want you to know it's you

Talking in my sleep, I sing my song
Caught inside the same dreams but not for long

So nobody knows, wherever I go it's you
Wherever I go, doesn't it show it's you
So many things, I wanted to bring for you
Wherever I go, doesn't it show it's you

So nobody knows, wherever I go it's you
Wherever I go, doesn't it show it's you
So many things
