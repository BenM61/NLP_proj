A star fell out of heaven, right into my arms
A star fell out of heaven, right into my dreams
And since that very moment, life is so divine
I never heard a star speak before
This one said will you be mine?

Then roses fell from heaven to be my bouquet
And dew rained down from heaven to christen the day
A miracle had happened, as they sometimes do
A star fell out of heaven and turned out to be you
