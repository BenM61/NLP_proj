Oh Father, release me
My bones feel like stone
And I know when the game is up
It's up

It's obvious (Obvious)
The universe (Universe)
Is trying to tell me to let go
(Trying to tell me to let go)
I'm sorry but (Sorry but)
I've given up (Given up)
I've given up (Given up)
I've given up (Given up)

And I feel some relief now I know
And I love you but I really have to go
My fate (My fate)
My fate don't mean a thing (My fate)
My fate (My fate)
My fate (My fate)
My fate don't mean a thing (My fate, say it)

Oh, mother, believe me
I know what this means
And it's easy
I see no other way

It's obvious (Obvious)
The universe (Universe)
Is trying tell me to let go
(Trying tell me to let go)
I'm sorry but (Sorry but)
I've given up (Given up)
I've given up (Given up)
I've given up (Given up)

And I feel some relief now I know
And I love you but I really have to go
My fate (My fate)
My fate don't mean a thing (My fate)
My fate (My fate)
My fate (My fate)
My fate don't mean a thing (My fate, say it)
