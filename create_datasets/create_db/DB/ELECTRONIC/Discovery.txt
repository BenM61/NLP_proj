When you want the score,
When you need a helping hand.
When you find closed doors,
When you're back where you began.
Keeping those secrets,
Telling those lies.
Can anybody tell me what's the big surprise? 

Discovery.
Who has the chance to know it all?
Discovery.
Give me some truth and stop makin' me cry!
Discovery.

How can you sleep?
How can you turn away?
Thinking so cheap,
Someday you're gonna pay!
You're keeping secrets,
I can see in your eyes.
Can anybody tell me why the big disguise?

Please, give me some chance.
Give me some confidence.
Would you please set me free?
Oh, someone, deliver me!
Who's keeping secrets?
I got my spies.
Does anybody think we live in Paradise?
