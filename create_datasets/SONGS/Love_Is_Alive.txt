It wakes me up at night
Needs to share its light
It doesn't get how dark it is outside

Warms the rising sun
It kisses everyone
It doesn't remember the hate of yesterday

Oh, can't you hear it in my voice
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes
Love, love is alive in me

When my golden crown
Becomes a cup of doubt
I try to remember all I need is all around

Oh, can't you hear it in my voice
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes
Love, love is alive in me

Oh, can't you hear it in my voice
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes
Love, love is alive in me

Oh, can't you hear it in my voice
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes
Love, love is alive
Oh can't you feel it in my touch?
Know that I'll always have enough
Love, love is alive in me
