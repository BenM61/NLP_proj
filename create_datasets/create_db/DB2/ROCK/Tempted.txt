There's a girl trying to steal my heart 
And I'm tempted 
Even though she can tear it apart, I'm tempted 
In her eyes there's mystery, 
Every time she smiles at me 
I know how it could be and I'm tempted 
Each time she looks my way, I'm tempted 
Just a little more every day, I'm tempted 
It's so hard to resist, 
The thought of her sweet kiss 
Can't take much more of this, I'm tempted 

Tempted and tried, deep down inside 
I can't deny that I'm tempted 

Ever since she caught my eye, I'm tempted 
Just one look and you'll know why I'm tempted 
So if I'm burned by the flame, 
There's no one but me to blame 
'Cause every time she calls my name, I'm tempted 

Tempted and tried, deep down inside 
I can't deny that I'm tempted 
Tempted and tried, deep down inside 
I can't deny that I'm tempted 
I'm tempted, I'm tempted, I'm tempted
