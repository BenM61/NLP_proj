In the (Caged Choir)
Ruby met (Panda?)
An insane boy who have control of the world
Power will meet the boy
Why does power always sink the boy?
Why does power always more the boy more.. more..
Was the boy (powercord?)
I am here

I would sell me soul to devil
If I can be on top of the world x4
Be on top of the world
He was funny and fine sweet sweet good boy
(said he liked me like power)
Dreams a boy not like before.. oh no
I am not a boy I cannot hold the powers hold the powers
(the man with an angel in the cab?), I don't carry her powers
Heart and soul I know what I want,, oh no
I am not a boy I cannnot hold the powers hold the powers

Matchbook seeks matchbook seeks maniac
Matchbook seeks matchbook seeks maniac

I would sell me soul to devil
If I can be on top of the world x4
Be on top of the world
