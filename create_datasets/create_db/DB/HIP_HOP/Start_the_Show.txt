Now let's start the show
Step out of the cold
We come from the go
To the top of the globe

The pimps and the hoes
The foes and the stones
Whoever you rap for, we back for some more
Get back to the show, you know

Ladies and gentlemen the see-O double-M O-N
Synonym for fresh, truth is the emblem

Hard core since I was next door to Cleminem
Cold as the winter when fake niggas is shiverin?
Shakin? in they Timberlands, you as played as Bennigan?s
Hot for a minute now you just don't remember him

I've been a master since P was no limitin?
Stick to sayin?, no gimmickin?, no mimickin?
Q infinitin? down old blocks spendin' it
Why?all have fucked the police like Ren and them

Pelican brief these niggas on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid
Noble like Drew Ali, many have come
But few have been chose to be a true emcee

You sing along with it inside you knowin? it?s wack
Yung who? Oh, he the openin' act

Now let's start the show
Step out of the cold
We come from the go
To the top of the globe

The pimps and the hoes
The foes and the stones
Whoever you rap for, we back for some more
Get back to the show, you know

L-l-let's go, it?s a festival in hip hop, we do it non-stop
Pop your bottles, Chicago niggas do it in staccato
Choppin? notes from our homies, f*ck a model
And Ferragamo whose shoes givin? dudes the motto
Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle

Your life sure is hollow, shoulda kept it local
Rappin? over vocals, sound as soft as JoJo
With twelve monkeys on stage it?s hard to see who's a gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer

Feel the passion of this be-boy Rashid now
Half of it is what you say and half is style
Guess it?s time for you to start cashin? out
It?s overfull, tell you guys to put the glasses down

Mass is now, first it?s touch the youth like the Catholic priests
Performances keep me stackin? the sheets

Now let's start the show
Step out of the cold
We come from the go
To the top of the globe

The pimps and the hoes
The foes and the stones
Whoever you rap for, we back for some more
Get back to the show, you know

([Incomprehensible] let's go Chicago!)
(C?mon, why?all can make more noise than that!)
(Get loud why?all, get loud why?all)
(Get loud why?all, get loud why?all)
(Don?t you get louder than that?)
(Louder, louder!)
