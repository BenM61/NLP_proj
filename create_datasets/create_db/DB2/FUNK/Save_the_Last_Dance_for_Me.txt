If I dance every dance with the guy 
Who gives me the eye let him hold me tight
If I smile every smile for the man 
Who holds my hand 'neath the pale moonlight
I won't forget who's takin' me home
And in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine 
Like sparklin' wine, and I'll have some fun
I'll laugh and sing, but while we're apart
I won't give my heart to anyone
And I won't forget who's takin' me home
And in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

Baby, don't you know I love you so 
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never, ever let you go
I love you oh, so much

If I dance, and I carry on 'til the night is gone
And it's time to go
And if he asks if I'm all alone, can he take me home
I will tell him no
'Cause I won't forget who's taking me home 
And in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

And I won't forget who's takin' me home
And in whose arms I'm gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me
Mmm, darlin', save the last dance for me
And oh, no, no, no, darlin'
Save the last dance for me
