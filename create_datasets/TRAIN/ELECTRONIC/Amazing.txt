Dangerous feelings break out my soul
It's just the meaning of being alone
I need you here wherever you are
I need you now to take me so far
I wanna run like the speed of the sound
I was somewhere, I'm sure you're around
You give me now the meaning of life
With you I'm feeling alive, oh 

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing, oh

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing
