Saturday morning the sun is high so I can underline
All of my hopes to get out from my tears
So I, I can brighten

Will be sunshine in me
I'm living a life inside a broken life
Will be sunshine in me
I'm living a life inside a blinding life

I can't stand off it
I'm turning around the same thoughts behind
I can't stand off it
I'm turning around the same thoughts behind

Everyday morning I can play with the sun but I see you again
I wanna forget all your lies so I can go ahead, so I am

Will be sunshine in me
I'm living a life inside a broken life
Will be sunshine in me
I'm living a life inside a blinding life

I can't stand off it
I'm turning around the same thoughts behind
I can't stand off it
I'm turning around the same thoughts behind
