Oh, I heard you were trouble
And you heard I was trouble
But your name is a wave washing over me
No games, just a slave to you totally
Cause I don't care about what they say about you, Virgo
And you don't care about what they say about me, Virgo
But you know what they say about trouble

Pull me down if you want to
And I hope that you want to
'Cause I want to be your man
And I wanna say it loud
You can show me where trouble goes
Tell me secrets only trouble knows
'Cause you wanna be my girl
And you wanna say it loud

I want you to know that I've got your back
Even when the whole foundation seems cracked
Two punk kids up against the world
Yeah, trouble, there goes trouble
We could be king and queen of the moonlight
Two young lovers
And when the moods right
You hear me say "I want you"

Pull me down if you want to
And I hope that you want to
'Cause I want to be your man
And I wanna say it loud
You can show me where trouble goes
Tell me secrets only trouble knows
'Cause you wanna be my girl
And you wanna say it loud
And you wanna say it loud

So pull me down if you want to
And I hope that you want to
'Cause I want to be your man
And I wanna say it loud
You can show me where trouble goes
Tell me secrets only trouble knows
'Cause you wanna be my girl
And you wanna say it loud
Oh, and you want to say it loud
