I saw it in your eyes
I saw the creature deep inside
You opened up your cage
Pathetic insect
Drawn to flame
I'm falling apart
Inside your holographic heart
Lost souls dancing
And now the lie's collapsing

There's something inside you that isn't right
There's something that haunts your dreams at night
There's something that you have lost
And you're bringing it down
You're bringing it down
On top of us

I see the crimson thief
Hanging on heartstrings
Dripping bleach
Victim with hands in sleeves
Your lying swan sings
As I reach
I'm falling apart
Inside your holographic heart
Lost souls dancing
And now the lie's collapsing

There's something inside you that isn't right
There's something that haunts your dreams at night
There's something that you have lost
And you're bringing it down
You're bringing it down
On top of us

Silly me
I thought I had it
I came so close this time
I knew your heart was plastic
I still thought I could make it mine
Surrender you my mind
Your creature is inside...
Devouring me alive

There's something inside you that isn't right
There's something that haunts your dreams at night
There's something that you have lost
And you're bringing it down
You're bringing it down
On top of us
