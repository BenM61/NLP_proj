This street
Is haunted like a beast
That doesn't know its face
Is frightening to behold

All the
Painted little gnomes
Smiling in a line
Tryna get your votes

There's an architect
Setting fire to her house
All the plans were there
But they built it inside out

No one will endure
What the sign told them they would
Beware of the dogs
Beware of the dogs

My home
Carpet on the stairs
Everyone in bed
Their eyes are white as clouds

Next door
Sounds like bloody war
Waiting for the phone
Telling us to run

There's an architect
Setting fire to her house
All the plans were there
But they built it inside out

No one will endure
What the sign told them they would
Beware of the dogs
Beware of the dogs

There's no Parliament
Worthy of this countryside
All these pious fucks
Taking from the 99'

Now we'll all endure
What the sign told us we would
Beware of the dogs
Beware of the dogs
