If you're waiting for a call
It is double trouble the pressure of it all
This line is due for communication
Not if you've lost all reason

Crank call
Ain't no fun at all

They want love they want a pantomime
To cut you in two that's a sexual crime
They dig the dirt they deal in
They dig the dirt they feed on

Crank call
Ain't no fun at all

Oh yeah, all right
We don't waste time tonight
Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad I'm all right
That tonight

We drop in you in heaven or hell
Ape has taken control
They're breakin' the kids
They're beating the bids
And that is all they feed on

Crank call
Ain't no fun at all

Oh yeah, all right
We don't waste time tonight
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad I'm all right
Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad I'm all right
That tonight

Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad I'm all right

Oh yeah, all right
Why waste time tonight
Oh yeah, all right
I'm mad I'm all right
That tonight
