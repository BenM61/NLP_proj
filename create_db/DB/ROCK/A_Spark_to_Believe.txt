Take me away
It's been so long since I've been where I used to be
There's always more going on than you can see
So let it go, I can't remediate this obligation

Remember?
They said I'd never be anything at all
But look at me

If you ever think that I'm too distant to reach, then open your heart
Ignite the spark to believe
And I hope you don't waste it, because you only get one
It's your life so chase it
One day you'll wake up, it'll be gone

Because this breath of fresh air is all I need
There's always others
I promise they're not me
I'll let it go
I'm no one's object of misplaced affection
and I won't ever change
