Smoked my last cigarette, sat in bed for a while.
Thought of your face, and that brought me a smile.
Wanted another one. Fell back asleep, instead.
Woke and found you sitting there on the bed.

Cigarette, cigarette,
Burning up time.
Cigarette, cigarette,
Watch the smoke climb.
Cigarette, cigarette,
Wasting away.

Just like this cigarette, our time is running down.
Only one hour til you're leaving this town.
Went to the corner store, bought us another pack.
Held my arm around you as we headed back.
I tried to change your mind. Didn't want you to go.
I want you more, it seems, than you could ever know.

Cigarette, cigarette,
