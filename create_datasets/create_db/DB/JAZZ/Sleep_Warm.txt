Sleep warm sleep tight
When you turn off the light
Sleep tight sleep warm
My love

Rest your head on the pillow
What a lucky pillow
Close to you so close to you
All night

Sleep warm sleep well
Let dreams weave you a spell
Sweet dreams of me
My love

Close your eyes now and kiss me
And whisper you'll miss me
Sleep tight
Sleep well
Sleep warm

Close your eyes now and kiss me
And whisper you'll miss me
Sleep tight
Sleep well
Sleep warm
