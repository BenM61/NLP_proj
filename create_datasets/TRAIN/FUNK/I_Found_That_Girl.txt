Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl; 
Mama oh Mama I found that girl.

Mama, life for me now is a new sensation
Just like you said it would be, with the right situation.  
Now love has meaning and I have a goal; 
This feeling inside now makes me a hundred years old, 
Now I understand what it is to be a man.  
The way you explained it to me that day, 
You said only the right girl could make me feel this way, well, 

Mama I think I found that girl, 
Yeah, mama, I think I found that girl.

Mama, she's that beautiful dream that I dream each night, 
She's that bird of love on whose wings I'm in flight.  
She's those words left when there's no more to say, 
She's my sunshine at the end of a perfect day.  
All this lets me find a reason to be alive.  
That day when you set me upon your knee 
You said the only the right girl could be all these things,

Mama, I think I found that girl; 
Well mama, I think I found that girl.

She said, "Son, go on and search around, 
There's a good girl who's out there to be found." and

Mama I think I found that girl; 
Well, mama I think I found that girl.

Mama, Oh Mama, I found that girl; 
Mama oh Mama I found that girl.
