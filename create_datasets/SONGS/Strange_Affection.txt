Give me your bright white eyes
That I might see
The blindness of a narrow-minded flea
We cannot bridge the distance

Don't get too close to me
How deep must you fall down
To understand
That selfishness is always

Built on sand
Waiting for the impact
You got nothing to defend
I'm happy with you, happy with you

Night and day
I'm feeling with you, bleeding with you
Anyway
I can see no reaction

It's a strange affection
I'm serving you, I'm serving you
As a prey
I'm leaving you, deceiving you

Not today
I can feel no reaction
What a strange affection
I'm trapped within a maze

Of lies and fake
Don't have the strength to speak,
To fight or hate
I hang in doubt, my head is cramped

Why did we seek the end
I'm happy with you, happy with you
Night and day
I'm feeling with you, bleeding with you

Anyway
I can see no reaction
It's a strange affection
I'm serving you, I'm serving you

As a prey
I'm leaving you, deceiving you
Today
I can feel no reaction

What a strange affection
