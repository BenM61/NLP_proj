I'll meet you in the city
I'll pick you up at night
I'll drive you trough the suburbs
I'll get you there in time
I'll meet you in the city
I'll stay clear of the light
I'll get us through the checkpoints
Yeah, I know we'll be alright

Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart

And maybe we are sinners
But love, it ain't no crime
I'll get you through the checkpoints
I'll drive us through the night
You know I'll keep your secret
I've locked it up inside
As long as we are moving
Yeah, I know it'll be alright
Yeah, I know it'll be alright

Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart

Oh, Julian

Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
