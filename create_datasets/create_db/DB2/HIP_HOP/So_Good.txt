Could be good 
Could be good
Could be good
Ooh
Could be good

Ooh your love baby
Is so sweet and good to me, yeah
I can give you all my time
If you say that you'll be mine
When your arms are around me
And you're holding me so tight
My life is nothing without you
I can't do without you

If there's a place in your heart we could share
We could both be there together
'Coz you give me so much joy
I'm not sure if it's bad for just me and you

Could be good
So good if we could come together
Could be good
So good if we could last forever
Could be so good, so good together

Oh tell me baby
Can I hold you close tonight
Movin' nearer, hold me tight
'Coz you make me feel so right
You know our love gives me peace of mind
'Coz you're so divine, a special love
'Coz you give me so much joy
I'm not sure if it's bad for just me and you

Could be good
So good if we could come together
Could be good
So good if we could last forever
Could be so good, so good together
So good if we could come together

Hold tight get it right
We can do it
Hold tight get it right
We can do it
Hold tight get it right
We can do it
Hold tight get it right
We can do it

Could be good
Could be good
Could be good

If there's a place in your heart we could share
We could both be there together
'Coz you give me so much joy
I'm not sure if it's bad for just me and you

Could be good
So good if we could come together
Could be good
So good if we could last forever
Could be so good
So good together

Could be good
So good if we could come together
Could be good
So good if we could last forever
Could be good
So good if we could come together

So good, so good oh baby
So good, my darling, so good
So good, so good oh baby
So good, so good, so good
So good
