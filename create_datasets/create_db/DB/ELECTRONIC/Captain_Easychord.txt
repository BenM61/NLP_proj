Let live what must live, die what must die
Birth comes with a death, comes with a rise

Ne retenez pas, resistez pas
Faites vivre ce qui, ce qui doit vivre
Laissez mourir ce qui doit mourir

There are two sides to one's same thing, there are two sides
Breathing is like a tide rolls in, then retires

Foster the frank questions

The plants in my garden
Flourish, seed and perish
