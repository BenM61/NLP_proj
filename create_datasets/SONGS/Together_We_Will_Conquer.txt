Time will always tell 
The reason why we love so well 
Now I know what's right 
Stand the test of time 
Try to picture the answer 
To the question of my heart 
Keep in mind 
What you're looking to find

Together we will conquer 
Together we will conquer

Time will always tell 
The reason why we love so well 
Now I know what's right 
Stand the test of time 
Try to picture the answer 
To the question of my heart 
Keep in mind 
What you're looking to find

Together we will conquer 
Together we will conquer
