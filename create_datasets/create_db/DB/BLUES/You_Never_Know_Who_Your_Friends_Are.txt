I wonder if you are really a friend of mine.
If I was dyin' of thirst wouldja be my glass of wine?
Time goes by so slow ya know
You never really know who your friends are.

I wonder if you are really a friend of mine.
If I were buyin' a house wouldja come and countersign?
Time goes by so fast ya know
You never really know who your friends are.

If you were down
Ya know I'd be there at your door.
I'd shower you with food and money
After all, what are friends for?
They're really such a bore; knockin' at your door
Askin' for some more.

I wonder if you are really a friend of mine.
If I were lying in jail wouldja get outta bed and pay my fine?
Time stands still for everyone
You never really know who your friends are.

Time stands still for everyone
You never really know who your friends are.
