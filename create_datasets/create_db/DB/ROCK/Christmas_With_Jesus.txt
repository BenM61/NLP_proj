And my conscience
Has it
Stripped down to a science
Why does everything
Displease me
Still I'm trying 
And it's so very hard
To ask for a part
In your Christmas
And getting in
Is easy when you're
Friends with Jesus
With Jesus
With Jesus
With Jesus

He's coming
Inside me
Without reason
As I sit here
Waiting
For His signal

And I ask of the Lord
To spare me His sword
Of forgiveness
Cause it's so very hard
To ask for a part
In your Christmas
With Jesus
