Yes, it's true when they say that when the moon is high 
It casts a magic light on lovers
I fell in love with you on a perfect night in June
And darling, I thank the moon

While we walked through the park, the moon was in a cloud
I wanted to cry out loud "I love you"
Just then the moon appeared and two hearts began to spoon 
And darling, I thank the moon

Remember, I was afraid and shy to tell what was in my heart?
Then the moon seemed to say "you're in love"
We kissed and gave love its start
It's true when they say that when the moon's in sight
It casts a magic light on lovers

It made you love me too on a perfect night in June 
And darling, I thank the moon
I thank the moon
