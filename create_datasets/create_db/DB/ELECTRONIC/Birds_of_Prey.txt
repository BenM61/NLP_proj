Suddenly lost inside a fantasy
Everything not quite what it seems to be
Slipping and falling through the looking glass
Catching a glimpse at all that lies behind the masks

You disappear with the dawn
You only see what you want

When you're out with the birds of prey (prey, prey, prey)
When you're out with the birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed
The birds of prey

Taking the blue pill only made you cry
And all that the red pill did was make you forget why
There is no right, there's no wrong
You only see what you want

When you're out with the birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed
The birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed
The birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed
The birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed
The birds of prey

You disappear with the dawn
You only see what you want
There is no right, there's no wrong
You only see what you want

When you're out with the birds of prey
When you're out with the birds of prey
When you're out with the birds of prey
When you're out with the birds of prey
When you're out with the birds of prey
