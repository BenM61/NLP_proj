It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights
To enchant me
If you'll only grant me
The right to hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
Yes, just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights
To enchant me
If you'll only grant me
The right to hold you ever so tight, yeah baby
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights
To enchant me
If you'll only grant me
The right to hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you
