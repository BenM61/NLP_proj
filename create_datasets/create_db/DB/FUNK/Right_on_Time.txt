One shot, all I need I've got rhythm when I bleed
'Til death do us apart
Break my heart so I can start

Supercalifragilistic kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this

It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time, it's right on time (it's right on time)
Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine and get on nineteen ninety nine (it's right on time)

Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here, I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time, it's right on time (it's right on time)
Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine and get on nineteen ninety nine (it's right on time)

(It's right on time)

Well, plain and simple pain I want to but I can't complain
Death row, let us go it's time to blow up for show
All the world reverberated coming through, we motorcaded
Start off when we operated
Turing up in solid stated

Oh Lord
