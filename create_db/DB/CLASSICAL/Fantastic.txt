[will.i.am - Chorus]
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm fantastic [2X]
I'm al...

[Will.i.am]
Nine years of lovin you, that's now flushed down the drain
Six years with a bundle of joy, the last two was the pain
Too immature to handle love, we was just playin games
You used to say I was your everything, now you can't say my name
I never thought that I could survive, without you in my life
If you was wonderin about how I'm doin, baby I'm doin alright
But it don't even look like you would cry, if I was to up and die
Die tomorrow, uh-huh-uhhh, but that's alright gi-irrrl, cause

[Chorus]

[Will.i.am - over Chorus]
Don't even worry 'bout me [2X]
I'm doin good now, doin super baby
Don't even worry 'bout me, I'm super duper baby
I'm doin good now, yeah


[Will.i.am]
Six months and a couple of weeks and not one call from you girl
Three months after we broke down, I moved up in the world
I wanna know what's goin on, what's goin on in your life
I know it's really hard to be my friend, when you were gon' be my wife
We used to love our relationship, but now we just can't relate
I understand why you had to go and change your, love for me into hate
And that's why I believe you wouldn't cry, if I was to up and die
Die tomorrow, uh-huh-uhhh, but that's alright gi-irrrl, cause

[Chorus]

[Will.i.am - over Chorus]
Don't even worry 'bout me [2X]
I'm doin good now, super duper baby
I'm doin good now, I'm fantastic
Fantastic, yeah
