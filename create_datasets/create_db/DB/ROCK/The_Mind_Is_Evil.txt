There's no such thing as a cold, careless heart
And no one is heartless that I've ever known
The things that you wanted were there from the start
And of that bad stuff is there in the mind

it's the mind that is evil

it makes me do all those unspeakable things
Things I can't bear to remember
I put up a fight but my mind always wins
There's nothing to do but surrender

it's the mind that is evil
It's the mind that is evil
It's the mind that is evil

and sometimes I think, if I killed off my mind
Then my heart and I would be free
But somehow it knows what I am thinking about
And it's always that one step ahead of me

when I am angry or bitter, it's never my fault
But nobody seems to believe me
It's out of my hands
I just do what I am told
If I don't then it knows how to hurt me

it's the mind that is evil
It's the mind that is evil
It's the mind that is evil

and sometimes I think
If I killed off my mind
Then my heart and I would be free
But somehow it knows what I am thinking about
And it's always one step ahead of me
