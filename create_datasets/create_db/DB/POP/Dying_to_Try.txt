Take a leap of faith with me
If you believe honestly
That I am yours and you are mine
I know you're scared, and so am I

'Cause I know that love can be so strong
And yet so frail
And there ain't no guarantee
That you and me won't fail

But I'm dying to try
I'm dying to try
I'll keep you safe in my arms
Build a bridge to your heart every day

I'll give you it all
But I'm not gonna lie
'Cause no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly
Will ever learn how to fly, oh

But I'm dying to try, but I'm dying to try
('Cause no one can promise)
(That love will ever learn how to fly) Yeah

I'm dying to try, I'm dying to try
I'll keep you safe in my arms
Build a bridge to your heart every day

I'll give you it all
But I'm not gonna lie
Oh, 'cause no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly

Oh, 'cause no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly
But I'm dying to try
Take a leap if you believe
