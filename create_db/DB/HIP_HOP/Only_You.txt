Jesus, the Notorious just
Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chilling, milk 'em, "Top Billin'"
Silk and, pure linen, me and, Lil' Cease 
Malibu sea breeze, Dom P's, palm trees
Cats named Pablo in milked out Diablos (that's right)
The williest (what?) bitches be the silliest
The more I smoke, the smaller the Phillie gets
Room 112, where the players dwell
And stash more cash than Bert Padell, inhale
Make you feel good like Tony Toni Tone (feels good)
Dick up in your middle like Monie (yes)
She don't know but she setting up to blow me (yes)
Try to style, flying north with a homey (yes)
Escada, Don Dada, player, stay splurging
Game so tight they call it virgin

Ohhhh I, need to know, where we stand
Do we share this special thing called love 
I know I do, what about you
I just can't get enough of your love, I need you in my life

Where do I go, what do I do
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I'm the only one for you

Girl I want, to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life

Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end (Thought I told you that we won't stop)
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart, I need you in my life 

Where do I go, what do I do
'Cause I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I'm the only one for you

Now you can hum all you want to, cum all you want to
Money I'mma front you, girl I wanna flaunt you (that's right)
I'mma always want you when nobody wants you (uh-huh)
If I die now my love'll still haunt you (c'mon)
Mase ain't the one that'll pay for your phone (Mase ain't the one)
Mase be the one that'll take you home (that's right)
Even though I'm not the one that gave you the stone (yeah)
On your days alone I can make you moan
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce
Bad Boy get more money than you can count
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce
I'd do it to you cats for a large amount 
And when the beef come, you no where to be found
While I'll be around 'til the winner is announced (The winner is)
Here you go girl with thousands in ya palms
Why you can't let bygones be bygones (Goodfellas)

Where do I go, what must I do
If I can't live without your love
Thinking of you, makes me feel baby
Like I'm the only one for you

Girl I want to, be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life
