Hey girl, what's ya name

Hey girl, what's ya name
(Girl)
Hey boy, what's ya name

It's the jack
Yeah I'm a dope dealer
On top of that I'm a liar and a stealer
You gotta remember I'm ya nigga homes
Real big like King Kong and Godzilla in the same room
I'm on the run from the boys havin' fun
But I know I'll feel tha' pain soon
Yo, look what I go threw
I know you want me to stay all night
But I gotta flight
To the next state, cop me a zip
So I can concentrate
While I travel tryin' to make my rhymes elevate
And ya trunk raddle at the same time
Feelin' high, feelin' fly man at the same time
I'm in K.C. pushin' kicks
With my nigga freeway rich
I smoked a zip
And one day I'm feelin' crazy
Always hella loaded so the hoes think I'm lazy
But really I'm rich

[Chorus: ]
Hey girl, what's ya name?
(Kazi)
Flossin' in ya 4 dot with ya chain
Posin' in ya half top, tough and braids
Lookin' like you want dick, what's game
(girl)
Hey boy what's ya name?
Lookin' like a rapper, but you prolly push 'cain
Rockin' ya drop top pumpin' game
Frontin' like you really that hard to tame

Fresh out the plane
Pants saggin' with my dick in my hand
Who am I? Bitch, 
I'm you-Z-I yes I still push 'cain
I ain't gone front main
Feelin' it under pressure with my ninjas feelin' pain
I'm a ghetto star
So don't approach sidewayz girl
Might smack ya hard
I'm still young
It might be yo ho that I flip and smash on
Run her over in my big wheel with no mask on
From Africa to England
And back to the bay
Oochies stay hatin'
Girl hey
Oochies stay hatin'

Yo, yo
Yo, yo
Yo, I push the 4's the 5s
It's not a game
Night time livin' life in the fast lane
Quite live at the light
I see the boys to the right
It's a must i get out of they sight
I...tucked the two E
Dumb cop made a Ui (u-turn)
To my left squatin' off was a cutie
Sparkin' up, her car was tough
It must've her man's truck
Mommy actin' like she can't talk
Her look was ill
If looks could kill I'm 'bout to be a dead man
Trapped in the losts of the land
It's not me, really
I just want to get to know ya
If it's right spend the night
Blow trees enormous
You the thug type
Sneak a gun up in the club type
Heavy on the wrist ma you ain't right
Stop trippin' girl quit ya games
Kazi just want to know ya name

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
