It's time I started thinking on my feet
Instead of on my back
Now I got time
Time enough at last

Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
It's been the bane of my life
But I've got time enough at last
I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last

And sometimes people think you're just stupid
But I got time enough at last
I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last

'Cause I got time
Time enough at last
It's just stupid thinkin' 'bout the past
'Cause I got time enough at last
In a city in turmoil
It's hard to extract
The brains from the head of a minor executive
Now I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
And the projectiles hit you
When you least expect it

But I got time
Time enough at last
From a summit of experience
To a pit of its knowledge
'Cause I got time
Time enough at last
Time enough at last boy
Time enough at last
I got time
Time enough at last
