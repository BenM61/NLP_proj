A resurrection morning
The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the ghost controls the soul

Time to surrender your physical being
So I can hear your touch and smell, and start seeing
Life as a precious gift given from God
So I can enjoy my scene and start healing me scars
Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
Come on Lester Cane, you better show me
You're a man of your work, a criminal conduct
You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up
He took the knife, the look on his face got calmer
I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber

It's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word
I'm a G and my bond will never swerve
I dreamed about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it
Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel
Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife
Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life
But it's for a good reason
My spirit needs to be replenished so I walk on my soul and be delinquent

Lifeless, his body left stuck in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, but along a ruthless killer
Crime born syndicate, another sinner
Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seat in this cold world, my heart's aching

Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels on, thinking clusty
Me and the father ain't rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Cane or died I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life you find in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you is one force
There's no limit the way they can take it, time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dawn on exotic moods
Tell the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
So you hesitating - I didn't hesitate but you
When it was my time to go, I'm cocked it and show and prove

A resurrection morning
The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the ghost controls the soul
