Love change we change
One check for love
One lost glove
Never to reappear
Gone forever with the change
Oh it's such a shame
Nothing's true anymore

Give me the love glove
I'll give you love
For a certain price
Give me the love glove
I'll give you love
Gamble and sacrifice

Love I'll give you money
Sweet as sugar pure as honey
Hey don't walk away
You won't have to pay
Love I'll give you gold
Gold you pay the price
I throw the dice
Gamble risk sacrifice

Give me the love glove
I'll give you love
For a certain price
Give me the love glove
I'll give you love
Gamble and sacrifice

Love has changed to you
Who's got the glove
I've got the check
One check for love
I've got the glove who pays the price

Give me the love glove
I'll give you love
For a certain price
Give me the love glove
I'll give you love
Gamble and sacrifice
