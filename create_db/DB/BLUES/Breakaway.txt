It's a chemical attraction I just can't slide by
Every time I look into my baby's eyes
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I surrender
There's a visual attraction and she's branded my soul
Simply can't deny it, she has control
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I remember
She won't let me breakaway
She won't let me breakaway
I said break away, yeah, ah yeah
We were working it though, baby we had a groove
Movin' to the moment when we make our move
But it happened, something happened
And I'm not lying 'bout the pain
She won't let me breakaway
She won't let me breakaway
I said breakaway, yeah, oh yeah
I want the answer, I want my stuff
I'm dealing with a feeling deeper than love
But I'm helpless, so helpless, but I remember
She keeps saying breakaway
Something's saying breakaway
Telling me to breakaway
Keeps on saying breakaway
