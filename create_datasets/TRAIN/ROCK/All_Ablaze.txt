Caught you in a ring of fire
All surround me, such a blaze
Got you in a ring of fire
Lift me as you say my name

Who you gonna get to bring you water
When your well runs dry?
What you gonna tell your little daughter?
Is the reason that her daddy makes her cry

Caught you in a ring of fire
Happy days are all ablaze
Happy days in a ring of fire
Lift me as you, say my name

Who you gonna get to bring you water
As your well runs dry?
What you gonna tell your little daughter?
Is the reason that daddy makes her cry

Sayin' Jesus never died at crucifixion
So, Mother Mary never suffered so much pain
Masqueraders paintin' pictures, flip the scriptures
Don't even know His name

I, I say, say it again, happy days are here
And bells, just don't stop ringin' in the rain
Happy days are all ablaze
All ablaze, all ablaze

I, I say the same again, happy days are here
And bells just don't stop ringin' in the rain
Happy days are all ablaze
All ablaze, all ablaze

Caught you in a ring of fire
Caught you in a ring of fire
