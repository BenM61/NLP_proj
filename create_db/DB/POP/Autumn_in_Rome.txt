Autumn in Rome
My heart remembers fountains where children played 
Gardens where dreams were made

Autumn in Rome
Memories like embers glow 
When I seem to hear, “Arrivederci, dear.”

Walks beneath the pines that grace the golden sky
Stopping now and then to share a lover's sigh, you and I
Let winter come
All my Decembers I'll spend just dreaming of the way we fell in love 
One lovely Autumn in Rome
