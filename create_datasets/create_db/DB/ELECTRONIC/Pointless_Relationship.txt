Lately, it seems she keeps hitting him over the head with one word, "When?"
Should they, go left or right or maybe high or low, why can't he pretend?
That things will stay the same and he can just keep on...

Chillin' out and sleepin' in on monday's
has she been wasting all her time,
'Cause he's so not into waking up and working nine to five all week,
The kids the house the dog and the SUV, will they ever agree?

Sometimes she wonders if they're gonna ever
Live up to who they could be,
The real world is heading for them like a high speed train and,
He's not ready, he wants to stay the same, 
So, he can just keep on

Chillin' out and sleepin' in on mondays
Has she been wasting all her time?
'Cause he's so not into waking up and working nine to five all week,
The kids the house the dog and the SUV, will they ever agree?

She really doesn't know where they stand,
Find a compromise or she'll walk away.
He really loves her but then again,
he wants it to stay the same.

She really wants a change, but he wants to keep on
Chillin' out and sleepin' in on mondays
Has she been wasting all her time? (Yeah)
'Cause he's so not into waking up and working nine to five all week,
The kids the house the dog and the SUV, will they ever agree?

Chillin' out and sleepin' in on mondays
And she been wasting all her time,
'Cause he's so not into waking up and working nine to five all week,
The kids the house the dog and the SUV, will they ever agree?
