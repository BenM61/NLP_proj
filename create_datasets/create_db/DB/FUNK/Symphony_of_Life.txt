Stars are shining in your eyes
And I begin to realise
That our path through times unbroken
Do you know what its like
When a mirror never lies
And the truth remains unspoken

And we dance into the fire
As our spirits take us higher

Do you feel me now
Burning like a flame
If you touch me
I may disappear
Floating through your eyes
How do we resist
The gravity of love
In the symphony of life

There's a place I've never been
Where there's angels gathering
And we talk about the future
When the simple things in life
Can do more to satisfy
With their wisdom be my teacher

You can have all that you desire
But it may not take you higher

Do you feel me now
Burning like a flame
If you touch me
I may disappear
Floating through your eyes
How do we resist
The gravity of love
In the symphony of life

Whoa

Symphony of life

Do you feel me now
Burning like a flame
If you touch me 
I may disappear
Floating through your eyes
How do we resist
The gravity of love
In my symphony of life
