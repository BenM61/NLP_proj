I don't want somebody to love me
Just give me sex whenever I want it
'Cause all I ask for is instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure

Here in the traffic for all eternity
Now how could that speed be where you want to be
So don't you really want instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure

Think that all these folks that date
Do it 'cause the pain is great
Were you thinking anyway

Drinking coffee is your idea of really cool
Don't you expect no crazy chicks to notice you
Sitting there dreaming instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure

Instant pleasure!

If you want someone a friend to be
Guess you'll have to win the lottery
But till then repeat after me

I don't want somebody to love me
Just give me sex whenever I want it
'Cause all I ask for is instant pleasure

Instant pleasure, instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure

Instant pleasure!

Come on and give it to me
Just give me some instant pleasure
Just come and give it to me

Instant pleasure, that's what I asking for
Instant pleasure in the morning
Instant pleasure in the evening
Instant pleasure in the afternoon
Come on and give it to me just give me pleasure

Instant pleasure, come on and give it to me
Come on and give it to me

Just give me some instant
Just come and give it to me instant pleasure
Just come and give it to me instant pleasure
Instant pleasure, instant pleasure
That's what I'm asking for
