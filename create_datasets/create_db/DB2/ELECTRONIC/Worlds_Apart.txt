I keep reaching
But you're not reaching back
You're not reaching back

Trying to get in, fight you through the cracks
Trying to get in, fought you through the cracks 

I guess I'm trying to say
It hurts to feel this far
Million miles away
Next to me, next to me you are
Well if you're sitting right here
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?

If you're so near
then why do you feel this far?
Why are we worlds apart?

Oh, we're not that different you know
I play among the stars and then fall so low
I try to make sense as I go

'Cause nothing
'Cause nothing
'Cause nothing is in your soul

Why are we worlds apart?
And why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?

Why are we?
Why are we worlds apart? 
Why are we worlds apart?

Guess I'm trying to say
It hurts to feel this far
Million miles away
Next to me, next to me you are
And if you're sitting right here
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?

If you're so near
Why do you feel this far?
Why are we worlds apart?

Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we?
Why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
