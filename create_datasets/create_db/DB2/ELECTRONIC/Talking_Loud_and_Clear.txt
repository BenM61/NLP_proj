Talking loud and clear
Saying just what I feel
Lying in the grass
With the sun on our backs
It doesn't really matter
What we do or what we say
With every little movement
We give ourselves away

Opposite and opposite
Decisions are reversed
Facing one another
With words that couldn't hurt
With every little word
You're getting closer to me
Talking loud and clear
Saying just what we feel today

Talking loud and clear
Saying just what we feel
Lying in the grass
We've got time on our hands
Body next to body
With silence all around
We understand each other
But didn't make a sound

Promises and promises
Of vows we shall return
Facing one another
I thought my heart would burn
You turn to move away
But then get closer to me
Talking loud and clear
Saying just what we feel today
