You don't have time
To worry bout where I be going
I'm on the grind making moves
Its about to start showing
We gonna be fine
I want you around when the chips start flowing
Don't stop rolling, cuz I be rolling

If you deserve the world thats what I'm gonna give
Do you thank me even or lately they tell me your leaving
I'm not believing their rumors hating they all premisive

Your hair skin lips skin touch
Everything about you just
Invites me excites me to wanna see
You happy girl
Cars house cash you see
All expensive jewelry
I got it you can grab it
So how u not gonna have it

Your hair skin lips skin touch
Everything about you just

Every step of the way no we gonna be fine
