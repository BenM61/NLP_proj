It's you, it's you (oh, mhm)

You come out from nowhere, disappear and reappear
Houdini would be very proud
I can speculate your fears, wander on your tears
But I just want to hear you sound
And I know your loves a little strange
Your soul is made above your dreams, but tell me who's gonna
There's roads pavment made
With signs along the way, come through somehow (whoa, oh)

[Chorus]
I can be anything you want me to be
I just want to love you
Show you exactly what you mean to me
Honey let me love you

Listen to the way I feel
When love can change you, love arranges you
Heaven is the day god sent you here
Hoping that love don't disappear
Fill you in ways I can't understand
Honey, baby, tell me I can be your man

Let me be anything you want me to be
Baby let me love you
Show you exactly what you mean to me
Honey let me love you
Love you now, love you now (oh, mhm)

And even after years, I need you when you don't
I remain more stubborn then I ever was before
I bet a witness, got a witness for you girl
All night is good cause of you I mean the world
I'll never go, I'm frozen I'm standing here
Won't move until the day I get you near
Hear me when I say, you're the one I want
If you take this script don't let it go (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Baby don't leave or never go (no)
