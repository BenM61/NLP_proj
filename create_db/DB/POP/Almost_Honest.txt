So in the meantime,
You'll be resting on my mind
For the last time,
I would leave myself behind
In the evenings
Raise the glass and tell some lies
Make a pass, impress another girl
She's easy on the eyes
She was easy
And so was I

My reflection
In the window when I ride
For Chicago
She is on the other side
Take a picture, Write a letter to my love
Well I was almost honest, I was almost honest

Been a long time
Since I lay with you in bed
Conversations full of words you never said
I got your message
But I didn't hear the ringing bell
I gave into the loneliness but I didn't give her nothing else
Which direction down this highway that I ride
To Atlanta, she is on the other side
Take a picture
Write a letter to my love
I was almost honest, well I was almost honest

My reflection
In the window when I ride
Could not save us but I swear to God I tried
Take a picture
Write a letter to my love
I was almost honest, I was almost honest cause I was almost honest
