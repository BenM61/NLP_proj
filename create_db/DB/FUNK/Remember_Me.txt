So you confess,
To all the way you've been seeing
Now you feel regret, yeah
But that don't mean shit to me
No, no
So empty what you can say
Take a minute please
It's too little too late
To make it up to me
I hope that those tears refresh your memory
Now when another makes you cry

That's when you, remember me
I'm the one that hurt you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
Remember me
I'm the one that hurt you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby

I guess it wasn't enough
To give you everything, no no
And I guess I should have know better
How could I be so naive
I don't know,
So empty what you can say
Take a minute please
It's too little too late
To make it up to me
I hope that those tears refresh your memory
Now when you're all alone at night

That's when you, remember me
I'm the one that hurt you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
Remember me
I'm the one that hurt you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby

Now when you all alone at night

That's when you, remember me
I'm the one that hurt you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
Remember me
I'm the one who loved you
Remember me (remember me)
I'm the one who loved you (remember me)
Remember me
I'm the one who loved you (I'm the one who loved you)
