I don't mind, you're someone that ain't mine
But someone that I'll get
And you don't know how hard I've tried
To convince myself that I could easily forget
But you let this feeling here inside me
One that never fails to find me

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
Like the days of summer 
On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
In the hopes of one day

I won't lie, I still can say that I 
Admit we went too far
And you won't see me change my mind
But I really wish that I
Could forget the way you are

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
Like the days of summer 
On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
In the hopes of one day

I can see that you're not beside me
But I still feel you shine inside of me

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
Like the days of summer 
On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
In the hopes of one day
