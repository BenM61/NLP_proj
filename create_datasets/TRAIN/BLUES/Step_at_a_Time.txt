Slow down, take it easy
Just a step at a time
You'll find life will please you

Why keep talkin' about tomorrow
Tomorrow is so far away
Stop and look around you, baby
You are lucky if you can make it through the day

Oh listen baby, little baby
Just a step at a time
No need to rush
Try and have a peace of mind

Time is short
And life is too beautiful to rush away
Just a step at a time, at a time, at a time, at a time
No need to rush your little life away

Oh, look at those people in a hurry
They're not sure what they wanna do
Yet they seem so worried but
(?)

Why keep talkin' about tomorrow
Tomorrow's so far away
Take it easy, easy, easy, easy
Take one step, one step at a time
