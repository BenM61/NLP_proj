You just took in hiding, from yourself always slip-sliding, everyday a mask your wearing, trying to show your surviving, on the run from soul 2 soul, but you can never find your goal, you lose the spirit at the cost and now your soul it could be lost. 
When you just had enougth, and you see no way out, its alright don't panic, things can work for your crew. 
And its ok is what I say, when I'm praying away, and there's a hand from on high, god is never failing, 
Everyday is like a battle but we'll overcome, when we get back in the saddle faith will bring us on. 
Everyday is like a battle but we'll overcome, when we get back in the saddle faith will bring us on. 
All the promises I have, hidden deep in my heart, I recall after all, of my worst existence, it simply says that when or less, that feeling blessed in my life, he will send the word I need, to restore contempt me. 
I can always relay on my faith to, get by, we all can if we try. 
Everyday is like a battle but we'll overcome, when we get back in the saddle faith will bring us on. 
Everyday is like a battle but we'll overcome, when we get back in the saddle faith will bring us on.
