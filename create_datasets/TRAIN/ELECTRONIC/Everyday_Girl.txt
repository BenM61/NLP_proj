Yeah, uh, uh uh
Say you're the one for me love
Tell me what's your occupation baby
How's about keeping in touch
Maybe we could have a baby, lady
This is a cure for me now
And I can feel a little closer to ya
Oh how you changed my life
Oh yeah
Come on and go with me, come
So you can meet my people, people
We got a lot to catch up
The sooner we can be gone, we'll be home
Keeping each other warm
Ain't nothing like a lay in the best way
Missing would be a shame
Oh la la
