Non disturbaded
Do not
Disturb

We took the late flight
Close to heaven in the cold half light
All the pleasures of that very first night
Crystal clear in my mind
No complications
Just another reservation
In a beach hotel
We found a room with a view
Lock the door and change the sign

Do not disturb
Do Do Do not disturb
Just you and me together
Do not disturb
Do Do Do not disturb
This night could last forever
Take your time
When you read the sign
It's in black and white
In plain and simple terms
Do not disturb
Oh no

Where is the laughter
I know there must have been
A change of heart
Oh I don't wanna stay here with you
Now the sun won't shine
This total isolation
Seems to cloud our celebration
While I'm waiting all alone in my room
Trying to read between the lines

Do not disturb
Do Do Do not disturb
Now we're not together
Do not disturb
Do Do Do not disturb
This night could last forever
Do not disturb
Do Do Do not disturb
Now we're not together
Do not disturb
Do Do Do not disturb
This night could last forever
Take your time
When you read the sign
It's in black and white
In plain and simple terms
Do not disturb
Oh no

Do not
Oh no
Non disturbaded
Do not disturb
Do not disturb
Do not disturb
Do Do Do not disturb
