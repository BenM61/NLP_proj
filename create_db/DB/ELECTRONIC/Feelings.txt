I'm emotional
You're emotional
Could be why we always argue
Conversations short
We can't open up
It's just become
Much too difficult
I don't know what to do
Don't know what to prove
This is more than me
So much more than you
Can we make it through?
You and I
I can't decide

I just can't decide
If it's you I want
Don't wanna choose between
Having you in my life
Or loosing you for real.

Because I caught feelings
(Feelings)
Are we falling in love with our fears?
I caught feelings
(Feelings)
'Cause we're acting like we're really here, we're not really here
Caught feelings
(Feelings)
I'm not afraid of the pain

I'm a stubborn girl
You're a stubborn guy
Could be why
We fight all the time
If it's not your way
Then it must be mine
Can't communicate
Can't even compromise
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to prove
This is more than me
So much more than you
Can we make it through?
You and I
I can't decide 

I just can't decide
If it's you I trust
Don't wanna choose between
Having you in my life
Or telling you goodbye

Because I caught feelings
(Feelings)
I know how you feel
I caught feelings
(Feelings)
It's almost unreal
Because I caught feelings
(Feelings)
You're short of breath
It's like you've been wounded

I must look like an enemy to you
It's cool
We have to die a little bit you know 
We're so dramatic
Romantic
I love experiencing you
The ups and the downs

I just can't pretend
That you're just a friend
We took it further
Passion still remains
So here we are again

Because we caught feelings
(Feelings)
I feel you
Because we caught feelings
(Feelings)
I'm connected to you
We caught feelings
(Feelings)
So what do you wanna do?
Because we caught feelings
(Feelings)
What do you wanna do?
We can help each other

I can't even believe we're here
After all we've been through
