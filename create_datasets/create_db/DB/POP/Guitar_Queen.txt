She's a guitar queen she blows the blues everywhere she goes
She's a guitar queen she blows the blues everywhere she goes
And she can break In on a dollar and boys heaven only knows
Robert Johnson left her records and Johnny taught her slide guitar
And Bobby left her records, Johnny Hammond taught her slide guitar
She's a kind-hearted lady sinnin' bright like a sinnin' star

Her motors really buzzin'
Generator's got Its sock
It's all under good condition
You make me want to rock

You get deep down In tins connection
Tangle with them wires
You kick down on that starter
Your motion gives me fire
Slide Bonnie ride slide Bonnie
Ride Bonnie ride slide Bonnie
Ride Bonnie ride slide Bonnie
Ride Bonnie ride slide Bonnie etc

She's a guitar queen she's got a movement like a power drill
She's a guitar queen she's got a movement like a power drill
She's the only baby I know that can strut while she's standing still

Her motors really buzzin'
Generator's got Its sock
It's all under good condition
You make me want to rock
