You can pony with Tony
Twist with Mr. Lee
But if you're gonna mess around
Mess around with me

You can cha cha with Charlie
Stroll with Stagger Lee
But if you're gonna mess around
Mess around with me

You can pony with Tony

Hey one more time
Round and round and around hey

But if you're gonna mess around
You better mess around with me
