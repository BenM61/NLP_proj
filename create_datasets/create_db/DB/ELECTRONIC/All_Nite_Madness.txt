Taste of vengeance on my tongue
Break the silence I've become
Glamorous for everyone
On my scene
Can't denie that I deserve
Praise and glory boys and girls
Immortally Iam centre stage
Gracefully

Now I can live
Now I can sing
I can give
Everything
I can be free
Tonight Iam living for me

All night madness
All night madness
People
And the sound
And the faces
All around

All night madness
All night madness
Out there on my own
And iam living for the
All night madness

Consequently I've become
Legendary like the sun
I have stood the test of time
Shining bright
Unmistable devine
Paint my picture in your mind
Emporess iam here to last
Gracefully

Now I can live
Now I can sing
I can give
Everything
I can be free
Tonight Iam living for me

All night madness
All night madness
People
And the sound
And the faces
All around

All night madness
All night madness
Out there on my own
And iam living for the
All night madness

Now I can live
Now I can sing
All night madness
I can give
Everything
I can be free
Tonight Iam living for me

All night madness
All night madness
People
And the sound
And the faces
All around

All night madness
All night madness
Out there on my own
And I am living for the
All night madness
