Last week you got married to a new boy
You met six months ago
He's sweet on you
And he's been carried on a tide of joy
The only way to go

New clique,
You've met his family and all his friends
From years gone by
Was it a rude speech
By the best man
Bet your mother couldn't wait to
Break down and cry so

Go, please go
Because your hair is like a storm cloud
And the sharks swim in your eyes
And I say go, please go
Because your tongue is like a serpent
And your mouth is full of lies
Seeing you here, well that's no surprise
That's no surprise

Good life, I hope you have one
In a nice house
With nice things too
Good job, I hope he keeps one
And you in the style that you're accustomed to

Don't cry because I can't take it
And when you go, I'm gonna do the same
I'm gonna slam the door, pace the floor
Fall down on my knees
I'm gonna cry out your name and say 

Go, please go
Because your hair is like a storm cloud
And the sharks swim in your eyes
And I say go, please go
Because your tongue is like a serpent
And your mouth is full of lies
Seeing you here, well that's no surprise
That's no surprise

All the time we spent,
Well that's all wasted
And those tears we cried
Can all still be tasted
So why don't you
Take away your hips and thighs
Take away your beguiling eyes
Take it all away and then don't come back again,

Just go
