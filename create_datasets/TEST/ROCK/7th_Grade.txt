In the school yard with my friends, we got broken hearts to mend
We're only in the 7th grade, we only think 'bout getting' laid
Split a six pack between the three of us
Get tore back and ride the mini-bus
Hawkin' loogies at sucker crews
Way back then we knew we'd never lose

Wipe the sleep out my eyes, around eleven brush the Ivory
See Selassie an' everything is peace what
I'm all about space cakes and great legs
In French braids smokin' brown dank in eighth grade
It ain't no ting to cut biology as long as we gaffle the role sheet

So now we're making the drop off
We got dinero and props embarcadero's like a hot spot
Yo, remember that yab that act senseless
There she is round and chunky at the town and country benches
Pretentious princess of sheet less mattresses
With Sealy Posturpedic embedded in they asses

In the school yard with my friends, we got broken hearts to mend
We're only in the 7th grade, we only think 'bout getting' laid
Split a six pack between the three of us
Get tore back and ride the mini-bus
Hawkin' loogies at sucker crews
Way back then we knew we'd never lose

I rock the party 'til it's all null void
I never toyed pumpin' lyrical steroid
'Cause I protest with paragraphs perverted
Tipper gets offended no matter how I word it

It ain't no thing to walk on water, baby
Long as you know where the rocks is
Pathetic and pitiful, I break fool and vanish
Panic if you want to, I stumble to my hammock

Panic if you want to, give your crew a call
They don't exist at all, like genitalia on your Barbie Doll
You bitch and moan when pinch up the payroll
Like pimp casserole so uh, pay me ho

In the school yard with my friends, we got broken hearts to mend
We're only in the 7th grade, we only think 'bout getting' laid
Split a six pack between the three of us
Get tore back and ride the mini-bus
Hawkin' loogies at sucker crews
Way back then we knew we'd never lose

Layin' low in the cut crouched P.A. Po peepin' me
I duck out, scorin' my goods outside Antonio's nut house
Stashed it up real well in the Oldsmobile wheel well
Dropped decoys downtown all the boys found was sea shells
With a note claimin' I collected these trinkets at the beach
With ya daughters now here's my final offer

Nada pig zilch zero
I'd rather go blind drinkin' prune, so salud to you puto
Who holds the upper hand now and whose hands are tied
I'm hittin' all my partners up with the liquifry
Moral to the parable what I need to care for
If assholes could fly this place would be an airport

In the school yard with my friends, we got broken hearts to mend
We're only in the 7th grade, we only think 'bout getting' laid
Split a six pack between the three of us
Get tore back and ride the mini-bus
Hawkin' loogies at sucker crews
Way back then we knew we'd never lose
