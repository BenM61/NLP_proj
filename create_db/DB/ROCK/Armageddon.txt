There was a full moon over Memphis
National Guard outside thousands wait for Elvis
Waitin' ever since he died for a miracle gonna happen
His eminence to restore
The sound of thunder crackin'
Signals the beginning of the war to end all wars

[Chorus]
Armageddon carry me home
Armageddon carry me home

Jerry and Linda in the whitehouse
President sleepin' in his shoes red phones ring in the blackout
Ain't got time to lose you-boats off New England
Enemy submarines from Boston to Miami
On a red alert, you better scramble all the F-15's

[Chorus: x2]
