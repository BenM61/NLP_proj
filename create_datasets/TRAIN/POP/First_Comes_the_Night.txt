I still see you wherever you are
I still feel you, you're still in my heart, in my heart.

That's the stuff I kept it just the way it was.
It's the only thing I've got that's left from us.

Don't know why she's gone.
Don't know why she went away.
Don't know what went wrong.
Oh so wrong, so wrong.

First comes the night, baby.
Then comes the day.
First comes the heartache darling, it ain't always gonna hurt this way.
It ain't always gonna feel this way, feel this way.

Thought I saw you walking with your head hung down.
Looking for you searching every place in town.
Close my eyes it's raining makes me think of you.
Hurting and remembering all that we've been through.
Sometimes I want to give up, but something won't let go.
Things are getting better, any day I know, I know.

First comes the night, baby.
Then comes the day.
First comes the heartache, darling.
It ain't always gonna hurt this way.

First comes the night, baby.
Then comes the day.
First comes the heartache, darling.
It ain't always gonna feel this way, no it ain't always gonna feel this way, this way.

I still see you wherever you are
I still feel you, you're still in my heart, you're in my heart
