Got the news today
Doctors said I had to stay
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, know, know
You don't even know

All this time goes by
Still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

Waiting on a cure
But none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, know, know
You don't even know, know, know
You don't even know, know, know

Yeah!

But you don't what you got till it's gone,
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know! yeah, oh, yeah, ohhh, yeah, yeah
You don't even know! know, know!

So I'll wait till kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
I'll be, fine
