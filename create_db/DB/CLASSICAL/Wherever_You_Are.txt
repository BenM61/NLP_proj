Ah

Wherever you are my love will keep you safe,
My heart will build a bridge of light across both time and space
Wherever you are, our hearts still beat as one
I hold you in my dreams each night until your task is done
Light up the darkness, my wondrous star
Our hopes and dreams, my heart and yours, forever shining far
Light up the darkness, my prince of peace
May the stars shine all around you may your courage never cease

Oh

Wherever I am, I will love you day by day
I will keep you safe, cling on to faith, along the dark dark way

Wherever I am, I will hold on through the night
I will pray each day a safe return, will look now to the light
Light up the darkness, my wondrous star
Our hopes and dreams, my heart and yours, forever shining far
Light up the darkness, my prince of peace
May the stars shine all around you may your courage never cease

Ah

May your courage never cease
