Brutal
Sometimes I feel that you're a part of me,
Although it don't seem real it's how I want it to be
But if you can't stay, then I'll understand
You're just sawdust in my empty hand
If you can't decide I'll still be true
Just open wide, I'm here for you

And if you think that you've found a gentle sound,
Where love breaks down; It's alright.
And if you can't overcome what get's you down,
Don't get uptight, It's alright.

I'm a shallow man in an hollow land
On a beaten track under your command
And the sound in my head goes round and round
Like a drunk on the stairs who just fell down
But now it seems like a distant dream
When it all lived long
Wrong with our love supreme
And the sound in my head goes round and round
Like a drunk on the stairs who just fell down

And if you think that you've found a gentle sound,
Where love breaks down; It's alright.
And if you can't overcome what get's you down,
Don't get uptight; It's alright.
It's alright.

Don't get uptight; It's alright.
It's alright.
