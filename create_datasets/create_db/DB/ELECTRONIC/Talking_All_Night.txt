Ain't it funny I'm tied to the magic of your caress
Ain't it lovely how we fit together

Girl you're the best
And it seems like we've been talking forever

And we've been lost in time

Too deep inside

Heat of passion, the hours and minutes don't mean so much
I know the language of love is a tender touch yeah

Now listen baby, now speak slowly, 
make the night last forever, spill the wine
So you'll forget about time
Won't you break down & show me emotions you used to hide so deep inside
