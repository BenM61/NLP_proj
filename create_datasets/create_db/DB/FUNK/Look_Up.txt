I know, I know, I know
That you're not happy here
You don't need to say it
It shows, it shows, it shows,
It's all over your face
You can't erase it, no
I wish that we could face
The things that hold us back
Before we fade to black
Instead we choose to chase
The things we know won't last
They'll never last

But something keeps me hanging on
Yeah some feelings they never go

So, look up
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh oh yes they do, they do, they do

Those words that we don't say
They make the biggest sounds
They call us out (call us out)
'Cause there are quiet truths in pain
And we both feel them now
But still we love somehow, oh
I wish that we could face
The things that hold us back
Before we fade to black
Instead we choose to chase
The things we know won't last
They'll never last

But something keeps me hanging on (something keeps me hanging on)
Yeah some feelings just never go

So, look up
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh oh yes they do, they do, believe me

I love you in my way
Ooh what more can I say
It's constant as the stars
Although we're lost in space
So if separate ways we go
I hope somehow you'll know
Whatever circumstance
You will be in my soul (you'll be in my soul, in my soul)
In my soul

And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh oh yes they do
