What you get is what you see
Let me tell you basically
This is how it's gotta be
Can't - with a girl like me
Can't change my destiny
So if you want to get next to me
Gotta treat me faithfully
Can't - with a girl like me

Two o' clock, I'm all alone
Hear you on the telephone
Telling me another line
Said that you'd be working late
Asking me if I could wait
Run that by me one more time

Keep me hanging on the line
But you're running out of time
Might have been a fool for love, but I'm not blind

If you're looking for a play thing
Every other day thing
I am not the one for you
I'm not looking for a part time
Give me half your heart and
Tell me what you're gonna do

Look into my eyes, let me tell you one more time
I need everything, that's how it's gonna be
With a girl like me
With a girl like me

Broken rings and promises
Gotta be much more than this
I don't have to compromise
Been around enough to know
When it's time to let it go
Do I have to say goodbye

Gonna make it clear to you
Only one thing left to do
Better understand 'cause every word is true

If you're looking for a play thing
