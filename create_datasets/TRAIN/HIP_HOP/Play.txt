Ooh ooh
Ah
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ye
Ooh ooh

I could wait all night and day
To go to a party sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ 'cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song

Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on DJ play that song you know that turns me on
(Dj just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn me on

Dj just play that song, 'cause I want to be dancing all night long
Just play my, play my, play my, play my, play my favorite song

I don't care if everybody's gone turn it up'cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long, feels so right that it can't be wrong
I get chills up and down my spine whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind
Let me here it one more time!

Play, come on play that song
