Woke up this morning and I looked around
So disappointed, I laid back down
Oh, what a dream, what a dream
I had last night

Dreamed I held you in my arms
But I'm still waitin' for that day to come

Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night

Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night

Dreamed we were walkin' down the aisle
The organ was playing "Here Comes the Bride"
You looked out at me and you began to smile
When I looked around everybody began to cry

I opened my eyes, you weren't there
All of my happiness just disappeared

Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night

I opened my eyes, you weren't there
All of my happiness just disappeared

Oh, what a dream
(What a dream)
What a dream
(What a dream)
I had last night

Oh, what a dream
(Oh, what a dream)
What a dream
(Oh, what a dream)
I had last night
