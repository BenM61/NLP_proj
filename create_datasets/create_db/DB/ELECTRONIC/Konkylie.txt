I see in those pearl whites
Wars' last line
Glazed little pearl whites
Blinding the eye
White as the sky up ahead
Open wide
Bright little stars
Let me in with a smile

I see in those bright eyes
Seasons' might
Dazed little bright eyes
Bathed in morning light
Sky op ahead open wide
Proud little love
Let me in with a smile

My little diamond is cut form a scare
Under the linden trees
My little diamond is cut form a scare
Under the linden trees

Under the linden trees

I see in those pearl whites
Wars' last line
Glazed little pearl whites
Blinding the eye
White as the sky up ahead
Open wide
Bright little stars
Let me in with a smile

I see in those bright eyes
Seasons' might
Dazed little bright eyes
Bathed in morning light
Sky op ahead open wide
Proud little love
Let me in with a smile
