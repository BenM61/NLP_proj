Carrying prose
Broke my real friend
The devil bite's dirty, we wax and we wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

Licking our wounds
The devil bite's dirty
Reckoning we'll taste
We wax and we wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

The devil bite's dirty, we wax and wane

Caring is a bury gin shot
The devil bite's dirty
Up to the wee wanes

Oh, we laugh in their faces

The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
