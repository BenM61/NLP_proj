Even if I was lonely, even if I was broke
Even if all the dogs in the pound let me know
Saying it's never over, it never ends
Grab the guns and the ammo, let us descend
To the darkest of prisons and break their defense
We will rattle the cages, rules will be bent
Oh, remind us our days are all numbered not spent
And peace, it comes easy, like mist on a ridge

Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out
Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out

All the horoscopes tell us to break all our ties
To our families and loved ones we leave when we fly
To these cities we think we need in our lives
Oh, you Manhattan jungle, you tangle our pride

Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out
Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out

All the buildings, they lean and they smile down on us
And they shout from their rooftops words we can't trust
Like "you're dead, you are tired, you're ruined, you're dust
Oh, you won't amount to nothing, like tanks full of rust"
But we scream back at them from below on the street
All in unison we sing, our time's been redeemed
We are all of the beauty that has not been seen
We are full of the color that's never been dreamed

Where nothing we need ever dies
Where nothing we need ever dies
Where nothing we need ever dies

Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out
Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out

Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out
Breathing in, breathing out, the salt in my mouth
Gives me hope that I'll bleed something worth bleeding out
