Dress
We come to grips with our wrists, we come to sound with our mouth
We sing of what we think we know, mother, father, skin and flaws
and we move just like the birds, moving amidst the other birds,
and we move just like the fish, rolling away from larger
and I know i protect the light of lichen
But oh you look like a morning star, to see who we are, oooooo
and I know you're protecting the light of lichen
But oh you look like a morning star, just see who we are, oooooo
You look good in the west, see how you clap those hands
You look good in the south, see how you use your mouth
You look good in the east, all elbows and knees
To the honey dipper, to the sound shifter
Oh dont you know you want to
See that moonrise in the rear view
Just like you had wanted it to
Temperature drops, the hot tart cools
Ready oh the radio calling to you
Right out loud she said it
For crying out loud they meant it
Sing that song like i know you can
Work your jaw like a blind man
Call like call like you own the land throw up your hands, make demands
You look good in the west, see how you clap those hands
You look good in the south, see how you use your mouth
You look good in the east, all elbows and knees
To the honey dipper, to the sound shifter?
You look good in the north, whip your hair back and forth
You look good in the east, door, the wall, move your feet
You look good in the south, make your makers proud
You look good in the west, you look good in a dress
I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel, oo oooo ooooiooo oooooiooo
Sound with our mouth, we call it grips with our
We call it grips our wrists
We call it sounds with our mouths
We call it grips with our ahh, ahhh
