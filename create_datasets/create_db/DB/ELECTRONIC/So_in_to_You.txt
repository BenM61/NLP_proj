When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes

Now I stand here, helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else

Thinking how it's gonna be
Whenever I get you next to me
It's gonna be good, don't you know
From your head to toe

Gonna love you all over, over and over
Me into you, you into me, me into you
I'm so into you, I'm so into you

When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes

And now I stand here, helplessly, yeah
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't get to nothing else
I am so into you, baby
No, no, no come on baby
I'm so into you
Love the things you do

Listen baby, driving me crazy
Come on baby
I'm so into you
Love the things you do
Come on baby
I'm so into you

I'm so into you, yeah
I'm so into you
