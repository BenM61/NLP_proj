A high
That's a swell take on this situation
I was trying to rectify
I was trying to skip out on this high
Keep away from the freaks on the fringe
They only talk to you
'Cause you give them a good excuse to cry 

But in a cleaner light, it's ok
In a cleaner light, it's ok
In a better light, it's ok
In a better light, it's ok

This strange old sunshine beats me senseless
But it's supposed to be keeping me healthy
It's a lie
You're a strange old thing that keeps me senseless
But you're supposed to be keeping me company

But in a cleaner light, it's ok
In a cleaner light, it's ok
In a better light, it's ok
In a better light, it's ok

I wake up feeling fragile
It's nothing the TV couldn't cure
Or lying here for my whole life

But in a cleaner light, it's ok
In a cleaner light, it's ok
In a better light, it's ok
In a better light, it's ok 

They only talk to you 'cause you're there
