Sometimes I feel so alone baby girl 
I call your heart but there's no one at home 
Taking a toll on my pride 
I'm reaching out but there's no one inside 
You know it doesn't feel right 
When I look in your eyes 
I know love is blind but the heart doesn't lie 
I'll ask one more time 
Maybe this time you'll try 
So tell me girl what's deep in your heart 
Chorus: Girl I care about you 
I'm there for you 
So why don't you care for me 
Like I care about you 
Girl I care about you 
I'm there for you 
So why don't you care for me 
Like I care about you 
I spend like all of my day, baby 
Trying to sense out just how things got this way 
I thought that we were in love 
But I swear right now I don't know what you want, babe 
I make sure that I give you quality time 
But lately I feel you're not home by design 
But still I'm gonna try to give you the love of my life 
In hopes that you, that you will open up your heart, baby 
Repeat Chorus 
Sometimes I'm not sure that 
That I'm all you got 
Sometimes I'm not sure you love me or not, baby 
Just one thing that I'm certain of 
Girl I care for you 
And the one thing that I want is that you care for me too 
Repeat Chorus 
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,baby, babe, yeah 
Yeah, oh yeah, ooooh 
I care for you, babe
