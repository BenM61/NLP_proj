He don't bring me anything but love
He don't bring me anything but love
If you offered me the stars I would decline
I don't need 'em I got mine
I don't know where to start
But I know what's in my heart
So keep your silver and your gold
'cause I got my man to have and hold
And even if you promise me the wonders of the world
It's not enough
Not enough

No poetry, no diamond ring
No song to sing
He don't bring me flowers, oh no
But he touches me, he touches me
No crazy dreams, no limousines
He makes me feel I can do anything
And that's power, oh yeah
When he touches me, he touches me

I know they'll say I'm crazy letting go
Of a man like you
Who seems to have it all
But they don't see what I see
No, they don't feel like me
And even it you promise me the wonders of the world
And all that stuff
It's not enough

No poetry, no diamond ring
No song to sing,
He don't bring me flowers, oh no
But he touches me
He touches me

He don't bring me anything but love
He don't bring me anything but love

Ohhhh
No poetry, no diamond ring
No song to sing
He don't bring me flowers, oh no
But he touches me
He touches me
No crazy dreams, no limousines
He makes me feel like a beauty queen
And that's power, oh yeah
And he touches me
He touches me

No poetry, no diamond ring
No song to sing
He don't bring me flowers. oh yeah
'cause he touches me, he touches me
No crazy dreams, no limousines, babe
And that's power, oh yeah
When he touches me
He touches me

He don't bring me anything but love
He don't bring me anything but love
