They gon' let me in this club in these dirty vans
Clean money, I count stacks with these dirty hands
Do a show, copped a rack with my new advance
50 bands, 80, bands, 100 bands
I'm the American dream
We the American dream
New money, no class
Look at them

Look at them
Uh
How to make it in America
Real nigga, day one, ain't a lot of us
Mom worked two jobs, it was hard for us
Me and sis made it out, now she proud of us
They ain't teach me how to rap in those private schools
Wasn't like my rich friends, had a lot to lose
Less money, less options, lot of rules
So when that first deal came it was opportune
And shawty got potential, I scout that
She say she in love, but I doubt that
Maybe it's the drugs or the clout
I get love in the north, I get love in the south, yeah
Shawty claim she a feminist and her ex man feminine
God damn girl you know that he average
God damn girl you know I'm a savage

New money
Now I'm in the Benz truck with a new honey
Yeah, they said I wouldn't make it
I'm like, "You funny"
Laughing at my haters like, "You dummies"
The night is young, girl what can you do for me?
Six figures, five shows, big ballin'
Look, I'm very important
I took a break, had some things I had to get sorted
I might retire in my prime like I'm M. Jordan
Table dancing in South Hampton
Use the wine glasses for dirty fantas
We coolin' out in the whip and I done damn near smashed every girl on my list
KD at the three, Djokovic with the racket
Phelps in the pool, I'm like Speith at the masters
God damn girl you know you a bad bitch
God damn girl you know I'm a savage

Another day in the U.S.A
Just another day in America
Kids from my hood look up to the drug dealers
The system set us up for failure
I just wanna make enough to pay dividends
Then invest in black businesses
They teach us to hate what we see in the mirror
But it can't break our spirit
