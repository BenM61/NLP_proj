I'm gonna be a shady lady bird, I've got an awful lot to learn
But if you tell me that my heart's on fire, I'm gonna let it burn
I'm gonna be a shocking mocking bird, I'm gonna mingle with the best
I'm try to find my hearts desire, I'm gonna rob the nest

Just like Little Miss Muffet eating away her curd
When I act a bit tough I find no way the bird
I'm gonna be slumming, hummingbird, I'm gonna pass along the word
I'm gonna have my fun and never tire and if the technique seems absurd
That's because I've never been a shady lady bird

I'm gonna be a shady lady bird, I hope the payment is deferred
Or if the fly back's simply to my first
You'll find the worst has not occurred
That's because I've never been a shady lady bird
