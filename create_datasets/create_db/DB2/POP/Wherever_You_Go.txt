Wherever you go 
That's where I want to be 
Want to go wherever you lead 
You are my heart and so I will always follow 

Wherever you go 
Wherever you go 

Life before you 
Was full of near misses 
Uncertain nights 
And half hearted kisses 

Isn't it unbelievable 
Almost inconceivable 
But here you are like a waking dream 
With love beyond imaging 

Wherever you go 
That's where I want to be 
Want to go wherever you lead 
You are my heart and so I will always follow 

Wherever you go 
Wherever you go 

You look in my eyes 
And I can see heaven 
You hold me close 
And it feels like a river 

Isn't it unbelievable 
Baby it's a miracle 
To see you all like an open door 
To everything I've waited for 

Wherever you go 
That's where I want to be 
Want to go wherever you lead 
You are my heart and so I will always follow 

Wherever you go 
That's where I want to be 
Want to go wherever you lead 
You are my heart and so I will always follow 

No matter how far 
Or whatever winding road you choose 
Wherever you are 
I want to be there 
I want to be there 

Wherever you go 
That's where I want to be 
Want to go wherever you lead 
You are my heart and so I will always follow 

Wherever you go 
That's where I want to be 
Want to go wherever you lead 
You are my heart and so I will always follow 

Wherever you go 
That's where I want to be 
Want to go wherever you lead 
You are my heart and so I will always follow
