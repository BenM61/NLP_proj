The glow of sunset in the Summer sky,
The golden flicker of the firefly,
The gleam of lovelight in your lovely eye,
These are the things I love.

A silver moonbeam peepin' through the trees,
A bed of tulips noddin' in the breeze,
The look you gave in answer to my pleas,
These are the things I love.

Oh, once I thought that life was just a Winter thing,
My heart was cold;
And then you came to me,
And like a breath of Spring,
You turned the silver to gold.

The robin's serenade when day is through,
The babbling brook beside our rendezvous,
your sweet voice whispering, "Darling I love you!",
These are the things I love.

A robin's serenade when day is through,
The babbling brook beside our rendezvous,
your sweet voice whispering, "Darling I love you!",
