I know how the ocean feels 
When her moon is away, and why won't he call?
And there isn't a star that cares what time she rolls in 
If she comes home rolling at all

Blue Cinderella, let's go to the ball 
Blue Cinderella, I'm ready to fall 

And nobody cares if she pounds on the sand 
If she throws up or grows up or digs up a man 
But the one that she wants is the 
One that won't call and say 

Blue Cinderella, let's go to the ball 
Blue Cinderella, I'm ready to fall 

And she cries 
Moon, why you gotta have so many oceans
And isn't my blue water ocean enough?
But the stars fell down laughing 
When they heard her hoping 
That she would be the only ocean 
He'd shine above 

I know how the ocean feels 
When her moon is away, and why won't he call?
And there isn't a star that cares what time she rolls in 
If she comes home rolling at all 

Blue Cinderella, let's go to the ball 
Blue Cinderella, I'm ready to fall
