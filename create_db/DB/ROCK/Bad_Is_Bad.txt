Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ooh
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah

Went uptown to see my cousin
Plays guitar, sounds like a chainsaw buzzin'
In the crowd, I see his mom and dad
I said hey, hey uncle, man your son is bad

But sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad

Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo 
Across the street, a neon sign
All you can eat for a dollar ninety nine
Aww, that old stew is the baddest in the land
But a one dollar's worth was all that I could stand

Sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo, aw
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo 

Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo 
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo 
Ooh
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo 

Back uptown to see Marie
Nobody home, I opened the door with my key
I love you, Huey was the note I read
But there's a strange pair of shoes underneath the bed

Sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Ah doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad
Oh
