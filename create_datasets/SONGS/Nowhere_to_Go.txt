I heard the thunder
So I braced for the rain
I tried to get out from under
But all was in vain

There's no way to stop it from pouring
Buckets down from the sky
When you're stuck in a cloud
And there's nowhere to go but down

You try to think about something
To erase all the pain
But you come up with nothing
All your thoughts are in vain

When your spirit is falling
Plummeting from on high
All you see is the ground
When there's nowhere to go but down

There's nowhere to go but down

Nowhere to go but down
When you thought it could not go lower
Down, as if under some old lawn mower
Life's been running you over

Everything's in slow motion
That hasn't come to a holt
Feels like all you emotions
Have been locked in a vault

It's like you're stuck in a painting
Unable to cry
Or to make a sound
And there's nowhere to go but down

The gravity of the moment
Plucked you out the sky
For trying to walk on the clouds
When there's nowhere to go, nowhere to go but down

Nowhere to go but down
Nowhere to go but down
