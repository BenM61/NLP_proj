Come here stranger
Come and dance with me
Listen life changes
Don't fret take a chance with me

When you move like that I can just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

You think, I'm speedin'
That's until you see, I wasn't
I was leading
The future for you and me

And when you move like that, I can just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please, do that for me
Let them know you're my baby

Speechless, enchanted
When I see you baby
Reach less romantic
Just keep dancing baby

When you move like that I could just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

Ooh, keep climbing
Make your mark in here
Your eyes keep shining
Though its dark in here

And when you move like that I could just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please, do that for me
Let them know you're my baby

It's weird I know
But somehow I know
I've been handed you
You've been handed me

It's like some fantasy
I like you
I want you
Dance with me forever and ever

You're undecided
You wanna mingle more
Your face just brightens
When you think of me as yours

And when you smile like that I can just fall
In love with you
(In love with you)

Seems like the world
Suspects something baby
They should pinch themselves
'Cause they ain't dreamin' baby

And when we get like that
The whole world could just fall
In love too
(In love too)

Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please, do that for me
Let them know, you're my baby
