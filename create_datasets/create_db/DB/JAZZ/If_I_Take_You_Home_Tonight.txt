If I take you home tonight
I will think of songs to sing to you
Music filled with joy and light
If I take you home tonight

If I tell you how I feel
Would you be afraid and run away
I would say my love is real
If you let me take you home tonight

Oh my love let me treat you right
Let me take you home tonight
Oh my love let me treat you right
Let me take you home tonight

If you let me take your hand
There are places I could bring you to
In some unimagined land
If you let me take your hand

Oh my love let me treat you right
Let me take you home tonight
Oh my love let me treat you right
Let me take you home tonight

If I take you home tonight
I will think of songs to sing to you
Music filled with joy and light

If I take you home
If I take you home
If I take you home tonight
If I take you home
If I take you home
If I take you home tonight
