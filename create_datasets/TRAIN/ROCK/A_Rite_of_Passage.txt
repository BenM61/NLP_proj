Since the new world order
played upon our fears
Spreading accusations
of radical ideas
The brotherhood of wisdom
Strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets
remain a mystery

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage

Men of wealth and power
Influence and fame
Philosophers and leaders
All members of the trade
Bound by oath and honor
Like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union
of esoteric thoughts

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The seven stars, the rising sun
A perfect world, a new life has begun
A rite of passage
