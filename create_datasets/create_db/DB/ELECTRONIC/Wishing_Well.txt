Kissing like a bandit stealing time
Underneath the sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me
Slowly
Surely
Yours appetite is more than I know
Sweetly
Softly
I'm falling in love with you

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tear
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Hugging like a monkey see monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
I want to be your midnight rambler
Quickly
Quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly
Loudly
I want to hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tear
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
