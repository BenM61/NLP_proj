Baby, oh baby, 
Boogaloo down Broadway,
Baby, oh baby
Boogaloo down Broadway.
Come on Sally, come on Sue,
All day long we're gonna Boogaloo.
But when the sweat begins to fill the air,
We're gonna funky Broadway everywhere.

Baby, oh baby, 
Boogaloo down Broadway,
Baby, oh baby
Boogaloo down Broadway.
Come on baby, it ain't hard to do,
You've been doin' it ever since you were two.

That's it baby now you've got de swing
Come on baby and shake that thing
Baby, oh baby, 
Boogaloo down Broadway,
Baby, oh baby
Boogaloo down Broadway.

Everybody in your town
Is gonna be boogaloo and Broadway bound.

So get your partner, get in line,
We're gonna have ourselves a heck of a time.
Baby, oh baby, Boogaloo down Broadway
Baby, oh baby, Boogaloo down Broadway
