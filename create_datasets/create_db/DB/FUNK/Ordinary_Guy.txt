I can't move a mountain top
Everything's ordinary on my block

I don't drive a beautiful car
And I don't own an elegant home
'Cause I don't have thousands to spend
Or a seaside cottage for the weekend

I'm just an ordinary guy you left behind
Ordinary guy you left behind

Exclusive nightclubs are out of style with me
'Cause I don't associate with high society
I don't hang around playboy millionaires

I'm just an ordinary guy you left behind
Ordinary guy you left behind

Subways take me downtown
My apartment is my home
I spend the weekends with friends
Otherwise I'm alone

Walk hard
Pay me no mind
You're ashamed of me
You girl

Walk hard passing by
Don't you know that I'm not the guy
Moving non-stop
You can't see beyond my block

I'm never gonna let you go, girl
Never gonna let you go
Need love so badly
