The cause of my affliction
Can never be resolved
A case for self infliction
Whose sin can't be dissolved

Lost in a room of mirrors
There's only one way out
But suicide is easy
When all you have is doubt

Idolize the demigods
The weapon of stigmata
Drowning in the grail of blood
The weapon of stigmata

Each day becomes fragmented
It's harder to connect
My world seems so demented
I see nothing to respect

But strength is born from weakness
And this is where I fall
I step up to the enemy
Then rise from where I crawl

Idolize the demigods
The weapon of stigmata
Drowning in the grail of blood
The weapon of stigmata
Idolize the demigods
The weapon of stigmata
Drowning in the grail of blood
The weapon of stigmata
The weapon of stigmata

Behind my back
In my face
Walking stalking

In my space
Think I'm closed up
But I know, I mark all
Watch where you go

Bide my time
Make you stop
Watch your mouth
Until you drop

Make me sick
I can wait
When you stumble
Seal your fate

Empty threats
Fucked up lies
Take you down
With alibis

Useless strength
Wastes on me
Crush you down
Dead enemy

Idolize the demigods
The weapon of stigmata
Drowning in the grail of blood
The weapon of stigmata
Idolize the demigods
The weapon of stigmata
Drowning in the grail of blood
The weapon of stigmata

Penance from the rancid icon
Virgin weeping plasma
Idolize the demigods
The weapon of stigmata
Weapon of stigmata
Idolize the demigods
The weapon of stigmata
Weapon of stigmata
The weapon of stigmata
