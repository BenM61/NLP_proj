I feel a change coming over me
Uh

I feel a change coming over me
Oh, you changed my life
When I let you in, baby
You know

I hold the key
Between right and wrong
If you want me
You gotta be right
Or leave me alone

I feel a change coming over me
I feel a change coming over me
Change is to the bone
Don't listen what people say
We got to face the world
Just you and me, baby

I hold the key
Between right and wrong
If you want me
You gotta be right
Or leave me alone

Some people say
The way we think
We should break up, but I know
We got everything together
Oh

I feel a change of loving you, baby
I feel a change, oh
You are my shining star
I said to myself
"Darling, come on home," uh

I hold the key
Between right and wrong
If you want me
You gotta be right
Or leave me alone

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Don't take my heart
If you don't need it
Don't take my love
If you don't want it
Baby, I'm tired
I wanna be loved
Don't take my heart
Just leave me alone
Leave me, ah
