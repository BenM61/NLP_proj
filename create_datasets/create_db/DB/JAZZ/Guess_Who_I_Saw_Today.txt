You're so late getting home from the office, Did you miss your train? 
Where you caught in the rain? 
No, don't bother to explain. 
Can I fix you a quick martini? 

As a matter of fact 
I'll have one with you, 
For to tell you the truth 
I've had quite a day too!

Guess who I saw today, my dear! 
I went in town to shop around 
For something new, 
And thought I'd stop and have a bite 

When I was through.
I looked around for someplace near, 
And it occurred to me 
Where I had parked the car, 

There is a most attractive French cafe 
And bar.
It really wasn't very far. 
The waiter showed me to a dark, 

Secluded corner, 
And when my eyes became accustomed 
To the gloom, 
I saw two people at the bar 

Who were so much in love, 
That even I could spot it clear 
Across the room.
Guess who I saw today, my dear! 

I've never been so shocked before. 
I headed blindly for the door.
They didn't see me passing through, 

Guess who I saw today?
Guess who I saw today?
Guess who I saw today? 
I saw you!
