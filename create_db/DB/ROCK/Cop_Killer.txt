I got my black shirt on.
I got my black gloves on.
I got my ski mask on.
This shit's been too long.

I got my twelve gauge sawed off.
I got my headlights turned off.
I'm 'bout to bust some shots off.
I'm 'bout to dust some cops off.

I'm a cop killer, better you than me.
Cop killer, f*ck police brutality!
Cop killer, I know your family's grieving,

Cop killer, but tonight we get even, ha ha.

I got my brain on hype.
Tonight will be your night.
I got this long-assed knife.
And your neck looks just right.

My adrenaline's pumpin'.
I got my stereo bumpin'.
I'm 'bout to kill me somethin'.
A pig stopped me for nuthin'!

Cop killer, better you than me.
