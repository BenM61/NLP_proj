I wake up every morning
With a smile on my face,
Everything in its place as it should be;
I start iut every morning
Just free as the breeze,
My cares upon the shelf,
Because I find myself;

With no strings and no connections,
No tie to my affections,
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy!

No dates that can't be broken,
No words that can't be spoken,
Especially when I'm feeling romamcy!

Like a robin upon a tree,
Like a sailor that goes to sea,
Like an unwritten melody,
I'm free, that's me!

So bring on the big attraction,
My decks are cleared for action,
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy!
