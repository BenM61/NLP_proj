It's hard
It's so hard

And it's a lonely planet joy, when
The song from from the other boys, that's when
I'm a lonely planet boy
I'm tryin', baby, for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, you pick me up
You're out and drivin' in your car
When I tell you where I'm goin'
Always tellin' me it's to far

But how could you be drivin'
Down by my home
When ya know, I ain't got one
And I'm, I'm so all alone

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, it's a lonely planet joy, when
When the song from your other boys, that's when
I'm a lonely planet boy
I'm tryin', I'm cryin'
Baby, for your love

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh, it's so lonely
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, can't you hear me callin'
I'm a thousand miles away
And I don't want to stay
I'm thinkin' words I gotta say

'Cause I want to be there witcha
And I know what to bring
I remember, from the days
You got over, everythin'

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, it's such a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys, that's when
I'm a lonely planet boy
I'm tryin', oh I'm cryin'
Can't ya see I'm dyin'
Baby, for your love

Whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Now you're a little runaway
