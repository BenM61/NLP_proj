Ah, ah, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Thank you girl for loving me 
The way that you do (way that you do)
That's the kind of love that is too good to be true
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Ah, ah, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
