You can't talk
I'm anxious
I'm off the walls
I'm right here just
Come outside
And see it
But pack your heart
You might need it

I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

You're locked up
You exhaled
You did it before
And I seen it
Come outside
And breath in
Relax your arms
And let me in

I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

I know what to say to take you
Higher, higher
No one else can take you higher
But I will try

I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

For you
