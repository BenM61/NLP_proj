Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your beat; she's so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
So be firm and be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now
Too close, much too close
She's much too close for comfort now
