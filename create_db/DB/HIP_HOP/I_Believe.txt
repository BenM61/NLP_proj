Ohhhh, baby, ohhhhhh, hmmmmm
(slow beat)
[Verse 1:]
We don't have to rush it baby let's slow it down
We've got plenty of time to fool around
If you really love me baby then you will wait
There are plenty of girls that won't hesitate
I'm not tryin' to dis it's just how I feel
Cause I want what we have to be so real
My mother always told me that true love would last
Don't you know that one night stands are a thing of the
Paaasst....

(fast beat)
[Chorus:]
I believe that love should mean much more than sex
Can't you see that sex ain't nothin' if you don't love me
I believe that love should mean much more than sex
Can't you see that sex ain't nothin' if you don't love me

[Verse 2:]
Lately I've noticed that you're shying away
Is it cause I haven't given you any play (cause I don't give you any play)
I'm not tryin' to tease ya, I've got to hold back
I can't give you my all and get nothing back
I'm not tryin' to dis ya (dis ya), it's just how I feel (it's just how I how I feel)
I want what we have (I want what we have) to be so real (to be so real)
My mother always told me that true love would last
Don't you know that one night stands are a thing of the
Paaasst........

[Chorus:]
I believe that love should mean much more than sex
Can't you see that sex ain't nothin' if you don't love me
I believe that love should mean much more than sex
Can't you see that sex ain't nothin' if you don't love me
(repeat 3x)

I believe that love is there
I believe that love is there
(Can't you see sex ain't nothin' if you don't love me)

[Bridge:]
It's the falling in love that's making me feel
It's the being in love that makes the sex more real
The fallin' in love that's makein me feel
It's the being in love that makes the sex more real

[Chorus: (till fade)]
I believe that love should mean much more than sex
Can't you see that sex ain't nothin' if you don't love me
I believe that love should mean much more than sex
Can't you see that sex ain't nothin' if you don't love me
