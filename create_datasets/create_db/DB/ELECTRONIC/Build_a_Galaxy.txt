We do the same shit everyday
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We forget about having a good time
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tonight forget about your break up
We'll take this town and we'll wake them up
Won't sleep tonight
We'll break rules tonight
We'll wait all night for the sunlight (sunlight)
It can be a little crazy
Up all night just you and me
You gon' do everything with me
I'll bring you back to life in the dark so

Come with me tonight
You and I will build a galaxy
We can be a big bang tonight
Be the blue moon tonight
We'll be shining so bright
We'll escape shit tonight, uh

We always spend our time at home
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We forget about having a good time
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tonight we'll forget about the time
Let's dance tonight like it's the end of time
We'll light up tonight
The dark side will shine
Even brighter than the moonlight (moonlight)
I know this is really crazy
Up all night just you and me
Let's forget about reality
I'll bring you back to life in the dark so

Come with me tonight
You and I will build a galaxy
We can be a big bang tonight
Be the blue moon tonight
We'll be shining so bright
We'll escape shit tonight, uh
