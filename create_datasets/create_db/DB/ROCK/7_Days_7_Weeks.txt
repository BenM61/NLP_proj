Sister love why don't you break it up,
You got to let someone look into your heart
Sister love how do you keep it up,
If you don't let no-one look into your heart
As a kid you couldn't live it up
You were so serious but always so smart
As a kid couldn't keep it up
And we were never close
So much apart

Here comes the sun smiling
How long have you been blue?
There'd ever be a time for us to recapture
All the time we lose (I want to give that to you)

There was a time when you were being so proud
Could have been anything that you aspired
There was a time when you were never around
When something good happened
Something good happened right
So sister love I'll help you off the ground
You got to let someone look into your heart
You got to turn this situation around
You got to turn this, turn it around

Here comes the sun smiling
How long have you been blue?
(And tell me now) there'd ever be a time for us to recapture
All the time we lose

'Cause it's plain to see
A storm is not the weather
And I'm telling you girl
You'll look at them and smile
And I'm telling you girl
You'll look at them and smile

7 days you should be giving yourself
All your belongings
All that you treasure
7 weeks you think of nobody else
Is this what you want
Is this what you are?
How did it come this far?

Here comes the sun smiling
The only thing that's true
(And tell me now) there'd ever be a time for us to recapture
All the time we lose

'Cause it's plain to see
A storm is not the weather
And I'm telling you girl
You'll look at them and smile (telling you)
And I'm telling you girl
You'll look at them and smile
And I'm telling you girl (telling you)
You'll look at them and smile
And I'm telling you girl
You'll look at them and smile
