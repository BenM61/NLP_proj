Fire, burn?

Danced with the devil
Now your soul is bruised and scarred
There ain't no pride and dignity
Weaving down the rust paved boulevard

You lived your life thought you'd be immortalized
The moral of your story, what goes up must come back down

Fire, burn?
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burn?
The fire burns Forever more

A moment of silence
Just before you hit the stage
This is your day of reckoning
To pay back all the dues and turn the page

You hit rock bottom and you stood the count to ten
Came back to harvest glory, now your star will shine again

Fire, burn?
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burn?
The fire burns Forever more

Cause every step the light tracers follow
And every move you make, might be your last mistake

Solo: Stefan

Fire, burn?
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burn?
The fire burns Forever more

Fire, fire, burn
