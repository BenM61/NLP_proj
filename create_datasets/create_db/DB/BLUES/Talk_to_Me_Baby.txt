Talk to my baby on the telephone
Stop what you're doin' woman and
Come on home
I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

Said, baby don't you worry you know my heart desire
You know I love you baby
I don't wanna see you cry
I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
A real good feeling people I'm just
Talking to you on the phone

Oh yeah

Baby don't you worry
You walk or fly
You know I love you baby
I don't wanna see you cry
I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling
Talking to you on the telephone
