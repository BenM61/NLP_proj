See those shoulder bend all weighted by the thought
One more day to carry on, now carry on
Trouble she cannot take
Dreams she would like to take her away, away

I'll be waiting for the sun to rise
So I can start again by and by
I'll be looking o'er my head to the sky
See the clouds open wide reveal my faith

Mercy me, o who do you say I am
Do I not love you, did I not nail a hand?
Trouble I cannot take
Dream I would like to take away, away

I'll be waiting for the sun to rise
So I can start again by and by
I'll be looking o'er my head to the sky
See the clouds open wide reveal my faith

Let the words of my mouth adore you 
Next time out, I'm gonna let it fly 
Although my dreams may be tattered
My will my heart battered
I know you will hear my cry
