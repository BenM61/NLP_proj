Day by day normal reaction
You are my center attraction
Every beat my heart beats is your song
From hurt and harm you're my protection
The path I take is your direction
'Cause I know with you I can't go wrong

Ever since that day
I asked you into my heart
My world has changed
So promise me you'll never part

'Cause I'm lost without you
Easy to see
I'm lost without you
And there's no letting go
So let me be the first to say
I'm lost without you
So don't ever go, go away
So don't ever go away

You pick me up those times I'm down
You make me laugh when there's no clown
No one else can love me like you do
Heaven knows that I'll proclaim
The love I feel When I hear your name
There's no substitution quite the same

Now some say I'm crazy
And I'm acting insane
But there's no life without you
So I'll stake my claim

I'm lost without you
It's easy to see
I'm lost without you
So I just keep going on
So let me be the first to say
I'm lost without you
So don't ever go, don't ever go, go away
Go away

Can you tell me about love
Love is sweet and love is kind
Love will bring you peace of mind
And how do you know?
Well, I'll tell you so
He won't ever go
Oh no, he won't ever

Now, that's what I love about it
That's what I love about it, oh yeah
'Cause you know never know you baby
You know never know you baby
