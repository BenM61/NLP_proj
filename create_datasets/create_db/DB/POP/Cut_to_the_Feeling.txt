I had a dream, or was it real?
We crossed the line and it was on
We crossed the line, it was on this time
I've been denying how I feel, you've been denying what you want
You want from me, talk to me baby
I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars, just say "oh"

Ah, I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Cancel your reservations, no more hesitations this is on
I can't make it stop, give me all you got
I want it all or nothing, no more in between, now give your
Everything to me, let's get real baby
A chemical reaction, take me in your arms and make me "oh"

Ah, I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way (all the way, all the way, all the way)
Take me, take me, take me all the way

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

I wanna cut through the clouds (mmm, cut to the feeling)
I wanna dance on the roof (oh, yeah)
I wanna cut to the feeling (I wanna cut to the feeling)
I wanna cut to the feeling (I wanna cut to the feeling)
