When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance

Went to the disco, couldn't belive my eyes
I looked on the dance floor, saw so many guys
I asked myself, could this really be
Whether it is or not, I'm going to see

When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance

The guys look really fine, they almost blew my mind
They almost blew my mind
The guys looked really good, just like I knew they would
And I'm gonna get a man if I get a chance
Here's my chance

When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance

When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance

The night is still young and I'm gonna have some fun
And I'm in a trance, all I want to do is dance
Watch me dance
Everybody's having fun, and the musics number one
And the lights shining bright, there's a party here tonight

When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance

It stated getting late, the night was really great
When I hear music, give me a chance, here's your chance
When I hear music, I want to dance
You got the music, I'm gonna dance

When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance

When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, here's my chance
