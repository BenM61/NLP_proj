Some things are so sacred...
Black On Black

A pretty little altar boy
Daddy's little pride and joy
Change the water into wine
Touch yourself and you'll go blind
A warning signal from above
A place where sinner's fall in love
They say that opposite's attract
So very strange:
Black On Black

Like pleasure and a little pain
The sacred and profane
Like a blasphemous contract
Just like Black On Black

A virginal trembling hand
A frightened sacrificial lamb
From a blinding light a shadow falls
A code of silence quakes the halls
A whisper to a piercing scream
A love that's way too frightening
They say that opposites attract
So very strange:
Black On Black

Like pleasure and a little pain
The sacred and profane
Like a blasphemous contract
Just like Black On Black

Change the water into wine
Touch yourself and you'll go blind
They say that opposites attract
So very strange:
Black On Black

Something's are so sacred...
Like a leading question
The power of suggestion
Like the face of danger
Like the kindness of a stranger
Like a Judas Kiss
Like pleasure and a little pain
Immaculate seduction
Absolute corruption
Like a blasphemous contract
No turning back
Like Black On Black
Black On Black
Black On Black
