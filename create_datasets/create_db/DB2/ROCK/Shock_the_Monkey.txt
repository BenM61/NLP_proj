Cover me when I run
Cover me through the fire
Something knocked me out' the trees
Now I'm on my knees
Cover me, darling please, hey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know when you're going to shock the monkey
 
Fox the fox
Rat the rat
You can ape the ape
I know about that
There is one thing you must be sure of
I can't take any more
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey, hey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey, hey, hey
Shock the monkey, hey yeah
 
(Monkey) Wheels keep turning
(Monkey) Something's burning
(Monkey) Don't like it but I guess I'm learning
 
Shock, shock, shock 
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey
Shock, shock, shock 
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey
 
Cover me when I sleep
Cover me when I breathe
You throw your pearls before the swine
Make the monkey blind
Cover me, darling please, hey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey, hey, hey
Shock the monkey, hey yeah
 
(Monkey) Too much at stake
(Monkey) Ground beneath me shake
(Monkey) And the news is breaking
 
Shock, shock, shock 
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey
Shock, shock, shock 
Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey
 
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey hey, hey
Shock the monkey 

Shock the monkey to life
Shock the monkey

Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey
Shock the monkey

Shock the monkey to life
