My baby likes buttered popcorn
He likes it greasy
And sticky
And gooey
And salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

He took me to a show
He said he wanted some more
I said kiss me please
He said after I eat

I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats buttered popcorn
Well it worries me so 
I don't know what to do
When I asked him what was happenin' in the world today
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

My baby likes buttered popcorn
He likes it greasy
And sticky
And gooey
And salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats buttered popcorn
Well it worries me so 
I don't know what to do
When I asked him 
What was happenin' in the world today
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

My baby likes buttered popcorn
He likes it greasy
And sticky
And gooey
And salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn
