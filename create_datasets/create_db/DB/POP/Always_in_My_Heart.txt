You are always in my heart 
Even though you're far away 
I can hear the music of 
The song of love 
I sang with you 
You are always in my heart 
And when skies above are grey 
I remember that you care 
And then and there 
The sun breaks through 

Just before I go to sleep 
There's a rendezvous I keep 
And a dream I always meet 
Helps me forget we're far apart 
I don't know exactly when, dear, 
But I'm sure we'll meet again, dear, 
And my darling, till we do 
You are always in my heart!
