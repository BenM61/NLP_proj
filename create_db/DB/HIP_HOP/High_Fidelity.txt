My name, Zaakir
I'm versatile
Plus I never eat the cow if ain't Halal
Why you rap or bit of styles in the third degree
Myself and 7even tight like cornbread Earl and me
Showcase with the voice that's oh so fresh
And I can still serve em up in a minute or less
I can talk all day but I'm gonna save my breath
And let my nigga Marc 7even just do the rest

I'll do the rest, but I won't rest
Get fresh off of any beat you suggest
High tech with the combination we prepare
Rap concierge behind the rhyme kickin' the snare
Check it
Marc's the word
7even marks the spot
Guaranteed to keep it hot
If you like it or not

MCs
With verbal potshots
Taking the top spot
Clutching top notch

And together we, will forever be
High Fidelity
Definitely
Switching the melody
Can it be
The Casanova speech therapy
That heavenly puts the flavor right where it should be
My words have been connected to the poets of old
The way I utilize the pen I turn ink to gold
Keep it overly creative
Innovator of soul
Check the flavor from the fader
Which my DJ holds

And together we
Will forever be
High Fidelity
Definitely
Switching the melody
Can it be the brothers that you rarely see
Got together for the better
Whether him or me
And together we
Will forever be
High Fidelity
Definitely
Switching the melody
Can it be the brothers that you rarely see
They got together for the better
Whether him or me

You better remember these
Incredible MCs
Our sounds invade spread plagues just like leprosy
Our weapons be our vocals
Guaranteed to smoke you
Better think twice about stepping
We nice
Never focused on ice
And still coming off tight
It's like the color of night
I mean the beat is so right
Damn
Soup and 7even
Betrayed your heart
The beat that's compliment of DJ Numark

And it's the fifth element
Never repetitive
Highly competitive
Classy and elegant
Super intelligent I'm telling it to ladies and gents
Never irrelevant now do I have to say it again

The fifth element
Never be hesitant
Totally accurate
Present or past tense
We immaculate in fact you get a whole crew
Backin' it
Show you what working with

And together we
Will forever be
High Fidelity
Definitely
Switching the melody
Can it be the way that we demonstrate
All of the twin powers we activate

I'll tear into competitors
Pluck them like chicken feathers
Or better than ever
Incredible poetical editor
Deader be better
I bid the regards to whether whenever
We're clever
Endeavors when me and 7even rappin' together

Your style is post mortem
No decorum
Stop borin
We explorin'
You ignorin'
I'm the foreman
Longshoreman
And I'm sure when we touring
That you whack and you boring
