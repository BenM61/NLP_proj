You seem to be in a dizzy spin
And you can't work it out
You can't explain the mood you're in
You're stumbling about

But it's the same thing happening to you
As happened to me

I understand what you're going through
Over emotional and confused
You can't keep up with your change of moods
But it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

You've got no time, for anyone
Even your friends get in the way
But you won't take any good advice
Or listen to what i say

Because it don't just happen to you
It happens to everyone

I understand what you're going through
It's nothing new ''cause i've been there too
It's all too much for a girl like you
Yes it's true
There are the things we do
When love takes over you

Ooh, baby la, la, la, la
Ooh, baby la, la, la, la

But it's the same thing happening to you
As happened to me

I understand what you're going through
Over emotional and confused
You can't keep up with your change of moods
But it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

I understand what you're going through
It's nothing new ''cause i've been there too
It's all to much for a girl like you
Yes it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

I understand what you're going through
Over emotional and confused
You can't keep up with your change of moods
But it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

I understand what you're going through
It's nothing new ''cause i've been there too
It's all to much for a girl like you
Yes it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you
