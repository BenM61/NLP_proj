You know I love you, but you don't know how much
You know I need you, I need your touch
You know I love you but you don't know how much
No you don't, no you don't, no you don't

You know I love you, but you don't know how much
You know I need you, I need your touch
You know I love you but you don't know how much
No you don't, no you don't, no you don't

But we can find a better way
Have to find a better way
We can find a better way
To prove it, prove it, prove it

It's a beautiful life if you give it a chance
It can make you dance
It's a beautiful life, alright, alright

Do you feel it, with your feet on the ground
Do you hear it, it makes no sound
Do you feel it, the world is turning
No you don't, no you don't, no you don't

We can find a better way
Have to find a better way
We can find a better way
To prove it, prove it, prove it

It's a beautiful life if you give it a chance
It can make you dance
It's a beautiful life, alright, alright

You know I love you, but you don't know how much
You know I need you, I need your touch

We can find a better way
Have to find a better way
We can find a better way
To prove it, prove it, prove it

It's a beautiful life if you give it a chance
It will make you dance
It's a beautiful life, alright, alright

It's a beautiful life if you give it a chance
It can make you dance
It's a beautiful life, alright, alright
It's a beautiful life, alright, alright
