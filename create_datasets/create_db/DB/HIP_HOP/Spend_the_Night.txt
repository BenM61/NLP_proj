Yo, what's up boo?
I know we never had a love like this before
But you know, I wanna be that one for you
Yo, Tim and Bob, drop that

And I'm not the average guy
'Cause I cherish you and I'm lovin' you baby
I'm tellin' you to single these guys
'Cause you really got my heart

You better hold onto me tight
It's not a dream, it's reality
And if you down, you got me for life
'Cause I really love you, girl

I'm gonna be the one
That comes home after work
And fix your bath water
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll make love through the night

Every night I'm treatin' you right
'Cause our chemistry is a mystery
To everyone lookin' from outside
'Cause they want what we have

When I look right in your eyes
I see your soul and I'm the mate baby
If you down you got me for life
'Cause I really love you, girl

Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin' for the rest of your life
'Cause I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring

Hope you accept this invitation
Everyday will be a celebration
Birthdays, holidays, could feel the same

I'm gonna be the one
That comes home after work
And fix your bath water
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll make love through the night

I'm gonna be the one
That comes home after work
And fix your bath water
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll make love through the night

Through the night
(Through the night)
When love feels right
I really love you can't get enough of you
Want you in my life, oh girl

You a star and sky so bright
You won't regret it match mate in heaven
Girl, whatever you want me to be

I'm gonna be the one
That comes home after work
And fix your bath water
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll make love through the night

I'm gonna be the one
That comes home after work
And fix your bath water
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll make love through the night

Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin' for the rest of your life
'Cause I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring

Hope you accept this invitation
Everyday will be a celebration
Birthdays, holidays, could feel the same

I'm gonna be the one
That comes home after work
And fix your bath water
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll make love through the night

I'm gonna be the one
That comes home after work
And fix your bath water
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be the kinda guy
That'll make love through the night
