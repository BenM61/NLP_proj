Norman the gambler
Rides around in a rambler
Diamonds and pearls in the back

Occupation, house master
He lives of the less
Running from the east to the west

Oh, let me tell you more
Norman never lose, always wins
Yet Norman never give a way a bit
If you ask for a less he said he wants more

Norman the gambler
Rides around in a rambler
With pretty girls in the back

He always sets the pack
Norman always jumps a jack
Every hand that he shows
Is a flush or straight

Let me tell you more
Norman never lose, always wins
Yet Norman never give a way bit
If you ask him for a less he said he wants more

He always sets the pack
Norman always jumps the jack
Yeah
