Alta, I want to know you
And to feel your green
I want to show you what I have not seen

Before you had a babe
Before the sailors came
I would fight to save you
I would to give my life

Alta, now it is morning
And I think of you
I can remember the perfect view

Before you had a babe
Before I feel shame
I would fight to save you
I would to give my life

Before you had a babe
Before the sailors came
I would fight to save you
I would to give my life

Life
Life
Life
