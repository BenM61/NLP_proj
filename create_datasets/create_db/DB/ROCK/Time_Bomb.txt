Over again it plays
I'm not scared to face the wreckage of my younger ways
Every little thing you do
It's measured by the damage that it does to you

You can screw me around
You can swallow me down
Well I don't really know why
All we do is get high
Guess I'd rather just save my breathe
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head My head

Everyone you think you know
It turned to something different only yesterday
All of us need to choose
It's easier to give in than it is to lose

They can blow up our head
They can leave me for dead
But I don't really know why
All is said is goodbye
Guess I'd rather just save my breathe
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head My head My Head

Everything takes so long
Everyone waits so long
I don't really know why
All we did is get high
Guess I need save my breathe
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head My head
