Back in 1957
We had to dance a foot apart
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
Holding their rulers without a heart
And so with just a touch of our fingers
I could make our circuitry explode
All we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in (come in, come in, come in)
Oh, come in from the cold
(We were so young)
Uh come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

We really thought we had a purpose
We were so anxious to achieve
We had hope
The world held promise
For a slave to liberty
Freely I slaved away for something better
And I was bought and sold
And all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(Come in, come in)
(We were so sure)
Who's coming in now (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I feel your legs under the table
Leaning into mine
I feel renewed
I feel disabled
By these bonfires in my spine
I don't know who the arsonist was
Which incendiary soul
But all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in, come in)
(You were too warm)
Please come in (come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I am not some stone commission
Like a statue in a park
I am flesh and blood and vision
I am howling in the dark
Long blue shadows of the jackals
Are falling on a pay phone by the road
Oh all they ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(I was so low)
Oh, come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

Is this just vulgar electricity
Is this the edifying fire
(It was so pure)
Does your smile's covert complicity
Debase as it admires
(Just a flu with a temperature)
Are you just checking out your mojo
(Oh oh)
Or am I just fighting off growing old
(Just a high fever)
All I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(It was so pure)
Please come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I know we never will be perfect
Never entirely clear
(When the moon shines)
We get hurt and we just panic
And we strike out
Out of fear
(You were only being kind)
I fear the sentence of this solitude
Two hundred years on hold
(For my loving crime)
Oh and all we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in)
Come in (come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in, come in)
(When the moon shines)
Oh come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

When I thought life had some meaning
Then I thought I had some choice
(I was running blind)
And I made some value judgments
In a self-important voice
(I was outa line)
But then absurdity came over me
And I longed to lose control
(Into no mind)
Oh all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Oh, come in from the cold (come in, come in)
(You were so kind)
Please come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(Come in, come in)
Oh come in, come in
(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
Come in, come in
(I was so low)
Come in, come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Coming from the cold
