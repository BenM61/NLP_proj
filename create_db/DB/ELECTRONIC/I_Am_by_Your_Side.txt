I am by your side
Give you strength when you're lost inside
You can always count on me
I will never hide you see

For I am by your side
Shelter from the coldest night
You can always run to me
I will be there can't you see, oh no

And when the world has knocked you down
And you are trapped by your fears
They can never reach you from high ground, oh no

And I will never disappear
Turn the darkest corner I'll be there
With every day I'm calling out your name

And I am by your side
In this truth I will confide
You can always count on me
I will never hide you see, oh no

Cause I will never disappear
Turn the darkest corner I'll be there
With everyday I'm calling out your name

And I am by your side
Suddenly I realize
I can always run to you
You will be there it's true I know

O I am by your side
I am by your side
O o

I am by your side
I said I am by your side
O o

You can count on me
I am by your side
I am by your side
O

You can count on me
O you can count on me
I am by your side
I am by your side
O
You can count on me
O you can count on me now
I am by your side
I said I am by your side
O o
I am by your side
I am by your side
I am by your side
