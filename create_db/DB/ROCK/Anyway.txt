'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway

I know you probably never had somebody
Loving you like I do, someone that's there for you
Don't judge ya 'cause I know we only human
I must be stupid babe, letting you slip away

If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, no longer need to hide

'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway

I wish that you could see you like I see you
It's like that you're no good, you're just misunderstood
Now it's my job to make you a believer
Them boys ain't like this man, can't love you like I can

If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, no longer need to hide

'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway

Lemme get it like
Lemme get it like
Lemme get it like
Lemme get it like

'Cause I'mma love you anyway
'Cause I'mma love you anyway
