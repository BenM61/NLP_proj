She was a women of mystery.
And what she wanted I could not see.
A three year trip on the dragon,
Until the clinic had to get me clean.
We were a party and always drunk.
Befre I knew it, the wreckage sunk.
Shake, trip, shimmy and we'd do the bump,
Everybody's swingin' to the Brown Derby Jump.

Jump ... do the Jump  ... do the Jump

The beautiful life is always damned
You gotta fall into the quicksand
A deadly kiss from a temptress can serve
To make a truly wayward man.
She's not a talker, her teeth are fixed
But she's a looker who lives for kicks
A nightmare straight from the Otto Dix
Everybody swingin' to the Brown Derby chicks

Jump ... do the Jump  ... do the Jump

I've come a long way and now I'm me
The darkest river that meets the sea
And all those lights on the harbor seem
To be sparklin' in bittersweet
I'm a survivor my heart is tough
I'm hanging in there and that's enough
Shake, trip, shimmy and we'd do the bump,
Everybody's swingin' to the Brown Derby Jump.
