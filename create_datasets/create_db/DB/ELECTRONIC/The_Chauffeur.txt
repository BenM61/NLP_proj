Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving 
All looking for a new place to drive 
You sit beside me, so newly charming 
Sweating dewdrops glisten, freshing your side 

The sun drips down bedding heavy behind 
The front of your dress, all shadowy lined 
And the droning engine throbs in time 
With your beating heart 

Way down the lane away, living for another day 
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze 
Swim, seagull, in the sky 
Towards that hollow western isle 
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze 

The sun drips down bedding heavy behind 
The front of your dress, all shadowy lined 
And the droning engine throbs in time 
With your beating heart
With your beating heart

Sing blue silver 
With your beating heart 

And watching lovers part, I feel you smiling 
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind 
To tear out from your eyes 
With a thought to stiffen brooding lines 
And I'll only watch you leave me further behind 

The sun drips down bedding heavy behind 
The front of your dress, all shadowy lined 
And the droning engine throbs in time 
With your beating heart
With your beating heart
(The front of your dress, all shadowy lined 
And the droning engine throbs in time)
With your beating heart

Sing blue silver 
With your beating heart
