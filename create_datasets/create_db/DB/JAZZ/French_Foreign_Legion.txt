If you turn me down once more, I'll join the French Foreign Legion
Bet you, they would welcome me, with open arms
First you love me, yes; then you love me, no
I don't know where I stand

Do we march together down the isle
Or do I march that desert sand
If you think I won't find romance, in the French Foreign Legion
Think about that uniform with all its charm

Just one more time are you gonna be mine, or au revoir cheri
It's the French Foreign Legion for me
