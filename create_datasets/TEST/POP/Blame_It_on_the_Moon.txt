Gonna blame it on the moon
Didn't want to fall in love again, so soon.
I was fine, feelin' strong
Didn't want to fall in love with anyone.

Now that it's gone too far to call for a halt
I'll blame it on the moon,
'cause it's not my fault.
I didn't think that this would happen so soon,
So I'll blame it on the moon.

I was happy to be free
Didn't think I'd give myself so easily.
Guilty feelings in the night,
As I wonder, is it wrong to feel so right?

Now that it's gone too far to call for a halt
I'll blame it on the moon,
'cause it's not my fault.
I didn't think that this would happen so soon,
So I'll blame it on the moon.
