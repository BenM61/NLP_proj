Words that form a sentence
 Words that form a phrase
 In a poem or a letter
 Could not convey the meaning
 Of what this man has done
 In a painting
 On canvas
 As the colors fading
 They dictate my mood
 Can you see me
 Are you near me
 I find myself on canvas
 I find myself on stage
 Can you see me
 Are you near me
 And I long to know you're real
 And I long for you to be part of me
 I long to know you're real
 And I long for you to be a part of me
 In the fading twilight
 I sit and stare at her
 In all her beauty
 Her beauty
 You know I have to wonder
 Why all great men must die
 And leave their treasure
 They leave their treasure
