Quarterthing
Quarterthing
Yeah
Young Purple

Ay
I got a bad little thing, she a freak, she a blessing
She a burden but she number 23, she a legend
Got a brand new whip, jet black, got it bussin'
Got a couple homies always do the most, learned their lesson
Got a good plug on that good girl, if you need her
She a bad thing, she a bad thing, she a demon
Pour, pour some, sip, sip some, this the season
This a theme song for them, stir it- stir it for a reason
I got big dreams, I got big dreams, big pimping
I got big team, gotta big rings on my finger
Try, try shit, they gon' block shit, blee- bleeding
This a classic off a quarterthing in a beamer

This a theme song, this a theme song for the summer
Gotta big cup of that dirty dirty and they love it
Selling quarterthing, sell a bad bitch, she a hundred
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga you know how I'm coming
Roll up
Quarterthing, yeah
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga you know how I'm coming

I hit the dope and transform, you should see my passport
Every week a different city, we don't play the same sport
Got the bankroll on me right now, thank god
Used to having quarterthings zipped inside the Jansport
Now my daddy and my brother was the real, real runners
Motherfucker round here, I'm the number one stunner
Gary Payton with the flow, gloves on, got it covered
Got a check off of rap so we still talking numbers

Quarterthing
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga you know how I'm coming

I hit the dope in different countries, you should see my resume
Had to play in every city, every week I'm getting paid
And I'm good in every hood, everywhere, everyday
Had six cell phones, jumping service, straight J's
Had the phone line booming, taught myself to add it up
Got the game from my daddy, taught me how to run it up
Got the work from my brother, let my bitch bag it up
And I'm selling everything, you know- you know how I'm coming
Roll up

Quarterthing, yeah
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga you know how I'm coming
I hit
Quarterthing, yeah
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga
