Its not the words 
You know I'll always love you 
It's not the words 
I wish that I could stay 
It's more the way your lips looked 
As you spoke them 
And how the moonlight fell upon your face 
I married her just because she looks like you 

And for every time you said no 
She says honey I'll be glad to 
And for every time you left me 
She says darling I'll be there 
It's not the words 
You'll get over me 
That made my dreams come true 
I married her just because she looks like you 

And if I had not searched for you 
I never would have found her 
And if I had not loved you 
I would never have known love 
It's not the words 
Please try to forget me 
That made my dreams come true 
I married her just because she looks like you 

And for every time you knocked me down 
She reaches out to help me 
And for every time you cursed me 
She says darling I love you 
It's not the words 
Time heals everything 
That made my dreams come true 
I married her just because she looks like you
