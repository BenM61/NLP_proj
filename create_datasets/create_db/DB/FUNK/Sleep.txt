Spend my nights howlin' at the moon
Never wake before noon
When the sun it rises
Oh it always rises soon
'Cause I spend my nights
Howlin' at the moon

Oh I never get sleep
No I just reach
I can feel it on the ends of my fingers
Taste it on the tips of my teeth
So you see why I never get sleep

Spend my night shootin' at the stars
Trying to change the world with this guitar
I know it's a long shot
But it's working out so far
So I spend my nights
Shootin' at the stars

Oh I never get sleep
No I just reach
I can feel it on the ends of my fingers
Taste it on the tips of my teeth
So you see why I never get sleep

(Now sleep)
I've already tried
(Drink whiskey)
It makes my throat too dry
(Smoke weed)
Makes my eyes all read
(Take a pill Al)
What and end up dead?

I can feel it on the ends of my fingers
Taste it on the tips of my teeth
So you see why I never get sleep

I never get sleep
No I just reach
I can feel it on the ends of my fingers
Taste it on the tips of my teeth
So you see why I never get sleep
Yeah you see why I never get sleep
So you see why I never get sleep
