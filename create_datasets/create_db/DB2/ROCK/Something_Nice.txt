Almost give it a try
I sure do
I wake up early thinking of you
And I paint my eyes
In light blue
Reflecting every promise I do
There's a brand new note in the middle of this song
I close my eyes and hope that nothing will go wrong

That I'll have something nice
To talk about while I'm walking home
Have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home

Almost wondering why
You want me
Sometimes I think you're better off on your own
When I make you cry
Over me
I almost want to leave you alone
But when I wake up in the middle of the night
And when I sometimes suddenly remember your smile

And to have something nice
To talk about while I'm walking home
To have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home
