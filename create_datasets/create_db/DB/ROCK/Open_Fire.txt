I walked the miles
Down the road that took me here to you
I travelled down those everlasting highways
You lit the candle to start this love anew

Just couldn't wait, life was a desert
Without the cure, without your love, so blue
Can't wait to see your face again
Only you can stop the pain
Girl my love has never been so true

An open fire, a great desire
It's an open fire in my heart
Open fire, burning desire
Open fire in my heart

Can't wait to see ya
Let's find a place where we can be alone
Somewhere to share the passion, free our feelings
I want to touch and hold you for my own

I've waited long for this love
To unfold the secrets from within
Under the moon, the stars, the sky
So alone that I could die
Without the cure, without your love, so pure

Let's find a place
Come on, I wanna touch ya
Wanna hold you, oh, come on
