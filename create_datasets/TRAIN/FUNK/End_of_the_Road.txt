I've gotta get away from you fast as I can
Oh you're too much for me baby
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You been reckless with my heart
If I stay around you sure to tear it all apart
Said the road's got to end somewhere
Every road's got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the low down
We've come to the end of our road

Just think about all the times you let me at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you know I loved you only
Runnin' around with every girl in town
I'm telling you boy no longer will I be your clown

Said the road's got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Sick and tired of your stuff
Said enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
No, no, no, no, no
Sorry baby I just have to go

You made more sense when you begged and you pleaded
Talkin' bout I'm the one you're needing
Said I done had my fill of you
Hurt me so through the years
I've done sure enough run out of tears
Telling you I couldn't cry if I wanted to
Said the road's got to end somewhere
Well now every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I beg you to slow down
So I'm givin you the low down
We've come to the end of our road

(This is the end, the end of our road)
(This is the end, the end of our road)
(This is the end, the end of our road)
