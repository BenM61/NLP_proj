On the surface everything seems right no one notices the dimness of the light
For the world outside our door our smiles are oh so bright
On the surface everything's all right
We have the grace of actors on the stage
We orchestrate the moves that complement the play
But the things that we believe in we just throw them away
On the surface everything's okay

We say goodnight and then we close our eyes
To drift in different worlds far from each other's sight
Dreaming of yesterday when we held each other tight
And on the surface everything's all right
What are you thinking tonight I don't know you (I don't know you)
My words disappear in the night and there's no one there to notice
Maybe our lives will never be the same
But we can face tomorrow if we can just get through today
I'm holding back the tears while you're pushing me away
But on the surface everything's okay yeah on the surface everything's okay
