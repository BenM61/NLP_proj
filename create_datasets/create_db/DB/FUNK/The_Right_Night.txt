When you want to impress
(Somebody)
And trying to catch
(Somebody)
Remember the old school
And don't forget the old rule
Haste makes waste
And you don't want to worry
Keep this in mind
All things in time

And all once you're there next to you
And you're burning with desire

Look her right into her eyes and tell her
Baby, I need your fire

The lady's got a way of knowing
If you really mean it

One thing more
You've got to make sure that
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love every time)

The right night
With the starlit sky
(It just makes it better when two are together)

Now you want her so bad
She's like no one you've had
That love is the passion
(It's causing that reaction)

Show her tenderness
Be gentle when you do it
You won't regret it
And she won't forget

And all once you're laying in your arms
Just before you start to do it

Remember it's not about what you've got, my friend
But how you use it

The lady's got a feel for what's real, and don't you forget it

One thing more
You've got to make sure
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love every time)

The right night
By the ocean side

The right night
And moonlight
(Nothing works better when two are together)

Well
Nothing gone better?
Nothing works better
When the two are together

To the guys worldwide
All things in time

You just got to make sure
That the time is right

Remember guys
The lady knows
Oh yes

You've got to make sure
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love every time)

The right
With candle-light
(Nothing works better when two are together)
