Preprogrammed romance 
When he looks at you, 
I´m watching, too, through his video eyes.

He was made to break your heart; 
He´s the Automatic Man. 
He´s the Automatic Man.

It has learned to feel. 
He cries electric tears; 
The impossible is real.

Ah-be-auto-we-bo-we, 
Ah-be-auto-we-bo-we, 
Ah-be-auto-we-bo-we.

Never dreamed he would steal her away.
