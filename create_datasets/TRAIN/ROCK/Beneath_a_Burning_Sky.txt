Holocaust - In the flames of fear burns fantasy, liberty is just another masqueraded lie. 
Break the world, set it all ablaze. 
With an iron fist you lead the way, conquering the lives of those who are on their knees. 
You preach your words of wisdom; "heartfelt" a "peaceful savior", 

You've sentenced us to death beneath a burning sky. 
As you dictate, your words encroached into our minds 
A thousand virtues betrayed. 
Guilty of waiting we bond together born to suffer, 

Only those ill fated eyes (can) liberate our minds. 
Behold the sign you are killing us. 
In a world of hate with bodies soaked in blood we are a living tragedy. 
Within this madness we must unite (and) 
Sever the chains of deceit and rise against the new world's impunity
