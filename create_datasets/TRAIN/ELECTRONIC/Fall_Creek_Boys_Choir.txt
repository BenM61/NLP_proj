All went in the fire, drowning in the sea.
A red dawn, oh red font.
Caught up in the sea. All went in the sea
If only if only. If only if only.

Did you want to find a way (fight) (fly away)
I always saw me love
I will be love befallen
I will lay my teeth
I'll wait for growing
And we both will know. And before you're all gone

Daring on the peak, telling on the teeth
I've been down to the open road
I'll wait for you, you know
And we both end up alone
And if only we could have known

Did you want to find a way (fight) (fly away)
I always saw me love
I will be love befallen
I will lay my teeth
I'll wait for growing
And we both will know. And before you're all gone

Daring on the peak, telling on the teeth
I've been down to the open road
I'll wait for you, you know
And we both end up alone
And if only we could have known

I will haaaaa

All went in the fire, drowning in the sea.
A red dawn, oh red font.

Caught up in the sea, all went in the sea.
If only if only, if only if only.

I was effin' low
