My desert is waiting;
Dear, come there with me.
I'm longing to teach you
Love's sweet melody.

I'll sing a dream-song to you,
Painting a picture for two:

Blue heaven and you and I,
And sand kissing a moonlit sky.
A desert breeze whisp'ring a lullaby,
Only stars above you
To see I love you.

Oh, give me that night divine
And let my arms in yours entwine.
The desert song calling,
Its voice enthralling
Will make you mine.
