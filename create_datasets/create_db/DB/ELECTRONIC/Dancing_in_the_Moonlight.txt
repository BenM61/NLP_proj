We get it on most every night
When that moon gets big and bright
It's supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
 
Everybody here is out-a sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
 
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight, everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine 'n' natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
 
We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance 'n' stay up tight it's supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
 
Dancin' in the moonlight, everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine 'n' natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
