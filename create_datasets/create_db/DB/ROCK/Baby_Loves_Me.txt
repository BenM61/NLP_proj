Record company hates me
The doctor says I'm sick
The bad girls think I'm just too nice
And the nice girls call me "dick"

But baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

Policeman flashes the red lights
Coach says that I'm weak
Teacher says I'm not too bright
Bodybuilder calls me "pipsqueak"

Baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

The neighbors don't like my flowers
The waiter don't like my tip
The librarian shushes me
Travel agent canceled my trip

Baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

Minister says I'm a demon
Dietitian says I'm a pig
Warmhearted say I'm freezin'
Promoter won't give me the gig

But baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

My tired body is breakin' down
The world is endin' soon
It's all crumblin' at my feet
Not sure what to do

But baby loves me!
And that's a real good thing
My baby loves me!
It's a beautiful thing

Baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

Baby loves me!
