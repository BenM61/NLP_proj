I met my baby by the station
She said, "Can I help you with some information?"
'Cause your train gets out at a quarter-to-five
But you could stay a while, you and I could get funky
To the rhythm of the choo-choo-train
Dancin' in the pourin' rain
I found myself in the most beautiful situation
A feeling I can't describe

So I forget my destination
And I pray, can you make a late cancellation?
And as the train pulls out at a quarte-to-five
With a knowing sigh, her and I, we get funky
To the rhythm of the choo-choo-train 
Dancin' in the pourin' rain

I found myself in the most beautiful situation
A feeling I can't describe

Oh how she gave me love, oh how she gave me love
Oh how she gave me love, she gave me love.
