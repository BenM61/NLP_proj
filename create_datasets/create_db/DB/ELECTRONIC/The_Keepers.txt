I walk blind with smoke in my eyes
It's like we don't know where we been
That's it, boy, just state your case
You're just as wrong as you were then
One tough move throw your hands up
Say I don't make no rules
No one even knows I'm here
Now its on you to man up
You say no weight'll hang on what you say

We're the keepers
While we sleep in America
Our house is burning down
Our house is burning
We're the keepers
While we sleep in America
Our house is burning down
Our house is burning
Down, down it burns down
Our house is burning down

Ask me why a dream gets you by
But let it want, turns a dangerous thing
Watch out for it, it snakes right past
Then turns around and it sucks you in
What happens when you get stuck
Get to the bottom of the illusion that you're in
From the roots now it's shook up
Know that what ails without will do you in

We're the keepers
While we sleep in America
Our house is burning down
Our house is burning
We're the keepers
While we sleep in America
Our house is burning down
Our house is burning
Down, down it burns down
Our house is burning down

And not a thing I've done
Abates my fear
And not a thing I've done
Abates my fear
And still although our hearts can't run
We are gone
We are gone
On the heels of all we have done, know

We're the keepers
While we sleep in America
Our house is burning down
Our house is burning
We're the keepers
While we sleep in America
Our house is burning down
Our house is burning
Down, down it burns down
Our house is burning down
