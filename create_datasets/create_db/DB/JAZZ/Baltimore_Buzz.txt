There have been a thousand raggy-braggy prances 
That were danced at every ball. 
There have been a thousand raggy-braggy prancers 
That have pranced at every hall! 
But the bestest one that was, 
Is called the Baltimore Buzz! 

Now, first, you take your babe and then you hold her, 
Then, you lay your head upon her shoulder, 
Next, you walk just like your legs are breaking, 
Do a bangle like a jangle then you start to tip and a-tangle. 

[Chorus]
Then, you do a raggy-braggy motion, 
Just like any ship upon the ocean, 
Glide! And then you hesitate, 
Slide, oh, honey, ain't it great? 
You will simply go in a trance with the Baltimore Buzzin' dance! 

First, you take your babe and just you hold her, 
Then, you lay your head upon her shoulder, 
Next, you walk just like your legs are breaking, 
Do a bangle like a jangle then you start to tip and a-tangle. 

[Chorus]

Look out! Get 'em! 'Atta boy.
