As they dig your ditches count my stitches
Generation justice wishes for world at war
Final score, media come and abhor us

These are hard times we'll work harder, harder
Through these hard times I'll work harder, harder

Divided nation in sedation, overload of information
That we have grown up to ignore mediocrity applauded

In these hard times we'll work harder, harder
Through these hard times I'll work harder, harder
For resolution show me some revolution
This battle will be won

Forced to count the hours since Two Towers
Fell to fiction those higher powers
Putting gods to war, who keeps score
Ignorance is still adored

And through these hard times we'll work harder, harder
Give me hard times, I'll work harder, harder
For revolution hard time for some resolution
Time for some revolution, this battle will be won

If they only see you with their fear
And they only hear you with their pride
And they only see you with their fear
And they only hear you with their pride

And work harder, harder, harder, harder
Harder, harder, harder, harder, hard times
