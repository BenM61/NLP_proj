Yesterday he said my eyes were fading fast away
I said well, what do you expect, you asked me not to stay
And if it had all been for the best
I wouldn't feel this way, he said, oh, he said

He said it's crazy how love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me ?cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene of love and fear
And apologies, apologies

My love is like a blanket, gets a little bit too warm sometimes
I wanna wrap somebody in it who can hold me in his arms
?Cause when it got a little too hot in there
He was always steppin' out for air and he froze, oh, he froze

But he says it's crazy how love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me ?cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene of love and fear
And apologies, apologies

Yesterday he looked at me with a tear in his eye and said
I always tell you you're my friend, I hope I don't have to lie
?Cause it?s clear you love another man
And I said, you're damn right and he said, oh, he said

He said it's crazy how love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me ?cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing to see me reading through this scene of love and fear
And apologies

He says it's crazy how love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me but I didn't figure it out before
And now it?s too late [Incomprehensible] miracle, way too late for dignity
It?s time for apologies, apologies, apologies, apologies
