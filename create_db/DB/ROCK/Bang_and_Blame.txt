If you could see yourself now, baby
It's not my fault you used to be, so in control
You're going to roll right over this one
Just roll me over, let me go, you're laying blame
Take this as no, no, no, no, no, you

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Then blame, blame, blame
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
It's not my thing, so let it go

If you could see yourself now, baby
The tables have turned, the whole world hinges
On your swings your secret life
Of indiscreet discretion's
I turn the screw and leave the screen
Don't point your finger
You know that's not, my thing you came to

[Chorus]

You've got a little worry, I know it all too well
I've got your number but so does, every kiss-and-tell
Who dares to cross your threshold
Or happens on your way, stop laying blame
You know that's not my thing, ooh-ooh
You know that's not my thing, you came to

[Chorus]

You kiss on me, tug on me, rub on me, jump on me
You bang on me, beat on me, hit on me
Let go of me, ooh, you let go on me, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
