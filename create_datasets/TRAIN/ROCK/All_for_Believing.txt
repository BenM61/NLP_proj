Pull back the shield between us, 
And I'll kiss you, 
Drop your defenses and come, 
Into my arms. 
I'm all for believing, 
(I'm all for believing) 

I'm all for believing if you can reveal the true colours within. 

I know you blanket your mind 
So much that I am blind, 
But I, I see you've painted your soul 
Into your guard, 
I'm all for believing, 
(I'm all for believing) 

I need to know just how you feel, 
To comfort you; 
I need to find the key let me in, 
Into your heart, 
To find your soul. 

Pull back the shield between us, 
And I'll kiss you, 
Drop your defenses and come, 
Into my arms. 

I'm all for believing, if you can reveal, the true colours within, 
And say you will be there for me to hold, 
When the faith grows old and life turns cold, (I'm all for believing) 

When the faith grows old, (I'm all for believing) and life turns cold. 
So if you're cold I will stay, maybe fate will guide the way. 
I believe in what I see and baby we were meant to be, 
Just believe. Just believe. Just believe. 
Trust in me.
