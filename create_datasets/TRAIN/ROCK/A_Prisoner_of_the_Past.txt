I'm a ghost to you now, I'm someone you don't really wish to see
I'm a ghost to you now, a shadow since you turned your back on me
Maybe you'll learn why it was I shook
Baby your turn to wear the haunted look

This ghost is here to stay
I survived the blast
Get Ready, get ready to pay
I'm taking you at last -
A prisoner of the past
This ghost is here to stay
He survived the blast
Get ready, get ready to say
"I've found my niche at last -
A prisoner of the past"

Anywhere that you go, I'm going to be the welcome there for you
Everywhere that you go - be certain that the table's set for two !
Maybe you'll learn - there's nowhere you can go
Baby you'll turn - as white, as white as snow

This ghost is here to stay
I survived the blast
Get Ready, get ready to pay
I'm taking you at last -
A prisoner of the past
This ghost is here to stay
He survived the blast
Get ready, get ready to say
"I've found my niche at last -
A prisoner of the past"

This ghost is here to stay
I survived the blast
Get Ready, get ready to pay
I'm taking you at last -
A prisoner of the past
