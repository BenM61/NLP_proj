From the West Coast gonna take a plane
Hit the East Coast gonna take an A train
Hit the East Coast, going all the way
Why don't you come to Harlem?

All the spies went out to sea
But I remained in Harlem
Had to pay my parking fees
Felt just like P.T. Barnum

Caught a couple Pinter plays
I should have stayed in Harlem
Then I heard a policeman say
I think we should disarm him
I think we should strong-arm him
So out of place in Harlem

Then I see you standing there
In your dyed black hair
And no underwear

Caught a couple Albee plays
I should have stayed in Harlem
Then I heard a policeman say
Do your best to not alarm him
I've got eyes for the policeman's wife
In her dyed black hair and her Bowie knife
I've got eyes for the policeman's wife
The policeman's wife,the policeman's wife

Unions went on strike today
But I remained in Harlem
I've got eyes for the policeman's wife
In her dyed black hair and her Bowie knife
As I see her standing there alone
In her dyed black hair
And her Android phone
