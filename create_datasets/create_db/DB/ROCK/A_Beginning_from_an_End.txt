She looks like you in every way
And I love her more with each passing day

But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes
Miss you
Miss her tender sighs
But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you

She reminds me of the morning
When you left me without warning
But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you

Whenever I'm holding her near,
I seem to sense your present's here
I even get the feeling that I could reach out and touch your hand

She waits each morning, smiling bright
She takes my hand and she'll squeeze it tight

But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes

I could still remember that stifling antiseptic smell
Of the hospital corridor
As you clutched my hand and hurried down the hall
I think you knew as you looked up at me
That we would never see each other again
And I felt so all alone as they wheeled you out the doors and told me to
Wait
And then there was a cry
And the doctor came out and showed me our baby girl
You never saw her sweetheart
But she must of known you somewhere
Because she looks, and acts, and talks the way I remember you

But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes
Miss you
Miss her tender sighs

But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes
Miss you
Miss her tender sighs

But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes
Miss you
Miss her tender sighs

But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes
Miss you
Miss her tender sighs

But that doesn't mean, I don't miss you
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes
Miss you
Miss her tender sighs
