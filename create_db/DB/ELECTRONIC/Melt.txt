Help me, please, you're breaking on my speech
While you smile at me you've got the whitest teeth
You leave me alone every time I rest here my head
Breaking bones, Breaking bones
You make me lose my time, fall all over the words
I'm not the kind to lose myself and behind
You gotta move and your body is the shape I want
Everything you say is on fire
Can't be easy this position, to destroy my life
All you have to do is arrive
Melt my happiness, some kind of fucked up mess
Looking out for you is a kinder way to gain, appease me
Run in circles into my brain
Oh, my loneliness will take no part in this
Oh, Oh, Overdose
Wasting my time with you, no
This only way to sunshine in my watch
Wasting my time with you, stop
I'll be erasing my mind, what you've got
Too much nerve coming into here
Turning loose and make a murder fear
God damn, boy, you so hot
It's no excuse to make my pole stop
I need a bit of coffee and a warm side
Dusty ideas only have spots
The verse I'm singing only half sung
High fretting in the mob's brow
Didn't mean to let it drift this far
I'm playing hard to get, you're playing your guitar
Damn, you should be so shy
Been working hard to drop me inside
Our dreams breaking all, breaking all my bones
Before I break it off, I break it off alone
Melt my happiness, some kind of fucked up mess
Looking out for you is a kinder way to gain, appease me
Run in circles into my brain
Oh, my loneliness will take no part in this
Oh, Oh, Overdose
Melt my happiness, some kind of fucked up mess,
Looking out for you is a kinder way to gain, appease me
Run in circles into my brain
Oh, my loneliness will take no part in this
Oh, Oh, Overdose
