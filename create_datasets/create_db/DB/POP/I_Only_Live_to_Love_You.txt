I only live to love you
Love you until forever
Day after day
Year after year
For always we will journey together

I only live to love you
Walk with my dreams beside you
Smile after smile
Tear after tear
In shadow and in sunshine
My love will guide you

When there are clouds above
If I have you to love
What do I care, when you are there
For when you came my way
There was no yesterday
Only tomorrow with you

Here is my hand to lead you
Here are my arms that need you
I only live, live for your love
For my love will be your love now and forever
