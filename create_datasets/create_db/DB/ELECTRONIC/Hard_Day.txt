Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now

Down, down, do-do-do-down
Don't bring me down, down, do-do-do-down
Don't bring me down, down, do-do-do-down
Down, down, do-do-do-down, down, do-do-do-down

I've never been one for playing games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Something like, bang bang you're dead
Couldn't we just make love instead
Say yes cause it's what we do best
And I've had such a hard day

Take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just

How much do I have to say?
What more do you have to see?
What will it take to make you love me?
Well, you're not the first, you're not the last
You're not even the one who loves me the best
But all I think about is you

So take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just

Down, down, do-do-do-down, do-do-do-do
Down, down, do-do-do-down, do-do-do-do

Take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down
Don't bring me down, down, do-do-do-down

Please don't wander from my door

I've never been one for playing games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Bang bang, you're dead
Shouldn't we just make love instead?
Say yes cause it's what we do best
And I've had such a hard day

Don't bring me down
So don't bring me down
Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now

Don't bring me down
Sweet little boy with, oh, such a big mouth
Harsh words can get you into hot water
When people don't understand you, baby
I'm always here for you
And I, and I will never bring you down
Down, down, down, down, my baby

Trust me, I want you to trust me, trust me, tru-tru-tru-tru
Oh, trust me
Cause I won't bring you down (don't bring me down)
I won't bring you down
Do you trust me (yeah)

Such a hard day
You had a hard day, such a hard day
You had a hard day, such a hard day
You had a hard day, such a hard day
You had a hard day, such a hard day, day, day

Won't bring you down, won't bring, won't bring you down
Won't bring, won't bring you down, my baby

Down, down, do-do-do-down
Down, down, do-do-do-down, down, do-do-do-down

Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now
Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now
Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now
Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now
Won't you give me a break?

Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now
Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now
Won't you give me a break?
Somebody give me a break now
