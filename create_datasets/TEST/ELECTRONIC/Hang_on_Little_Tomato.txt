The sun has left and forgotten me
It's dark, I cannot see
Why does this rain pour down?
I'm gonna drown in a sea
Of deep confusion

Somebody told me, I don't know who
Whenever you are sad and blue
And you're feelin' all alone and left behind
Just take a look inside you you'll find

You gotta hold on
Hold on through the night
Hang on
Things will be all right
Even when it's dark and not a bit of sparkling
Sing-song sunshine from above
Spreading rays of sunny love

Just hang on
Hang on to the vine
Stay on
Soon you'll be divine
If you start to cry, look up to the sky
Something's coming up ahead
To turn your tears to dew instead

And so I hold on to his advice
When change is hard and not so nice
If you listen to your heart the whole night through
Your sunny someday will come one day soon to you
