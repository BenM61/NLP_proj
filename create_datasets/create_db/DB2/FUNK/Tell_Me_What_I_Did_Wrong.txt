Walked up to my baby
Walked right up to my baby
Tell me what have I done wrong
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long

There something about you baby
Something 'bout you baby
That I just can't understand
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long
I phantom some other man

Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time
Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long
I am still a worry on your mind

Walked up to my baby
Walked right up to my baby
Tell me what have I done wrong
I want to know that you still love me
Have I been away too long
