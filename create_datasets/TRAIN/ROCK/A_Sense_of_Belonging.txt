Once there was confidence but now there is fear
Once there was laughter but now only tears
Once there were reasons for our optimism
But now we're all drowning in a sea of cynicism

But I hope and I pray in my own naive way
That one day we can reach some sort of understanding
Try a little more sharing
Try a little more giving
Might find a sense of belonging
Might find a sense of belonging

And I know you think I'm young and naive
Because I go on CND marches, well that's my decision
I think that you're the one who's naive
If you believe all the things you see on television
It's all propaganda and like a fool you accept it
And like a fool you ignore it
Why don't you try and stop it
To try and find a sense of belonging

I know you watch "World In Action" and "Panorama"
And to you it's just another soap opera drama, it can't happen here
Have a nice cup of tea and we'll all stay calm
And we'll come to no harm in our nice warm underground shelters
There'll be helter skelter
There'll be babies dying, you'll hear their mothers crying
I've seen the devil smiling, I've seen the devil smiling
Try to find a sense of belonging
A sense of belonging

And you laugh and make jokes about what you will do
When the button is pressed and we hear the four minute warning
And if you think it's funny now wait 'till the bomb goes off
You'll all be in fucking hysterics
You'll see babies dying, you'll hear mothers crying
I'm only asking for one thing
Just want a sense of belonging

No more weapons and no more wars
No more violence
What's it all for anyway?
