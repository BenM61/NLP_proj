We've been working all day
We're as tired as we can be 
We've been working all day
We're as tired as we can be

I'm gonna go find my baby
And take him on home with me

Ooh, oh ah oh ah

Mmh ah oh
Sha ba doo be doo be ah wee

I'll see you later
I'll see you later
One of these days
One of these days

See you later
Bye bye (bye bye bye bye bye bye)
So, so long
