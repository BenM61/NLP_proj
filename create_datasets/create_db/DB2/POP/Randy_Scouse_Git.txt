She's a wonderful lady and she's mine, all mine
And there doesn't seem a way that she won't come and lose my mind
It's too easy humming songs to a girl in a yellow dress
It's been a long time since the party and the room is in a mess

The four kings of emi are sitting stately on the floor
There are birds out on the sidewalk and a valet at the door
He reminds me of a penguin with few and plastered hair
There's talcum powder on the letter and the birthday boy is there

Why don't you cut your hair?
Why don't you live up there?
Why don't you do what I do, see what I feel when I care?

Now they've darkened all the windows and the seats are naugh-a-hyde
I've been waiting for an hour
I can't find a place to hide
The being known as wonder girl
Is speaking, I believe
It's not easy trying to tell her
That I shortly have to leave

Why don't you be like me?
Why don't you stop and see?
Why don't you hate who I hate,
Kill who I kill to be free?

Why don't you cut your hair?
Why don't you live up there?
Why don't you do what I do,
See what I feel when I care?

Why don't you be like me? (she's a wonderful lady)
Why don't you stop and see? (and she's mine, all mine)
Why don't you hate who I hate, (and there doesn't seem a way)
Kill who I kill to be free? (that she won't come and lose my mind)
Why don't you cut your hair? (it's too easy humming songs)
Why don't you live up there? (to a girl in a yellow dress)
Why don't you do what I do, (it's been a long time since the party)
See what I feel when I care? (and the room is in a mess)
