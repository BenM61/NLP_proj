Hey vanity, this vile's empty, so are you
Hey glamorous, this vile's not God anymore, yeah

Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go by the book
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back ah
Coming back around the fur

Prostitute, climb back down from the floor
Please don't f*ck around and die like this
'Cause I love her

Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashionOr go by the book
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back ah
Coming back around the fur

Take, it takes my eyes again
The fur, the fur, around, to me make it fine
Speak, speak, you're so bad to me
I don't wanna get pissed off, but anyway
Come on, came so far
I'm innocent, drop your weapons and come on
Speak, you're a liar, you're lying 
I don't care about ah
