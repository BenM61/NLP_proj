Come on baby, doo doo doo doo doo
Ooh yeah, come on

Now baby he keeps on saying that
He tells you you're the only one
But everybody's know he's out there having fun
Behind your back & that's a fact & it ain't right
'cause he's fly guy acting like a gentleman
But back in the day I can still remember when
He'd just turn around, wouldn't look twice at you
And I'm just being straight with you
'cause he takes you for a fool
So you should be on your guard
When he thinks you don't have a clue
And I think if the truth be know
That ypu'll end up all alone when
He gets everything he wants 
So girl open up your eyes & see with me

What you see is what you get
Ain't no hidden agenda
So girlfriend when he's playing around
You'd do well to remember
(x2)

Now lady when he tells you
That he loves you & won't give you up
Takes your car & it's your money that be filling it up
Look at what he's got, thinks he 's hit the jackpot & and it ain't right
'cause your connections keep him sweet & that's so 
Typical
He's only in it for himself & that's so cynical
He'd be out of sight girl if you lost it all,
So I feel bad inside when he's cruising in your ride
'cause I know baby late at night
There's some other girl by his side
And I want to let let you know that he really ought to go
And you should believe in me
'cause I care baby can't you see with me

[Chorus (x2)]

Now baby girl when he does you wrong
I'll make sure you're alright yeah
I just want to be your friend
'cause there's no reason to pretend
And that's the difference with me oh girl

[Chorus (x4)]
