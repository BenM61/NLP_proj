On a train out of town
Driving over swinging bridges
Rotten boards are givin' in
Yeah, here I go like an astronaut
Leaving for a new adventure
And all the stars are in my reach

You told me about your place
Where dreams grow in your flower bed

It's your planet I run to
I'm enchanted, I blame you
After all these stories that you've told
I dream diamonds, I dream gold
It's your planet I run to

The lights are out in the night
I stare out of a broken window
I think of you, that's all I do
Shaky rails, misty veil
Fifty feet away is out of sight
I turn my eyes to the ground

I swore I would never look down
But now's too late to turn around

It's your planet I run to
I'm enchanted, I blame you
After all these stories that you've told
I dream diamonds, I dream gold
It's your planet I run to

Oooh
Oooh-ah
Oooh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's your planet I run to

You're heaven, compose for me
A Mozart symphony, yeah
Strange tones in harmony
Oh, dreamer, set me free

It's your planet I run to
I'm enchanted, I blame you
After all these stories that you've told
I dream diamonds, I dream gold
It's your planet I run to
It's your planet I run to (I'm gonna run to you)
I'm enchanted, I blame you (I'm gonna run to you, yeah)
After all these stories that you've told
I dream diamonds, I dream gold
It's your planet I run to
