It's as much your fault as it is mine
We can point our fingers all damn night
But you know as well as I do we're both crazy

There ain't no one who can fight like us
Go all twelve rounds scream and cuss
'Till we don't remember why we were even angry

But you know I want you
And I know you want me
And that's all that matters
Ain't it baby

I'm never singing, unless my song is for you
So slam the door and I'll slam it back
Baby I love you, and it's as simple as that

Baby let's lay down and laugh about it 
Ain't it good, how good we got it
'Cause you can dish it out
And I can take it
But my heart, I know you'll never break it

'Cause you know I want you
And I know you want me
And that's all that matters
Ain't it baby

And I'm never running
Unless it's close to you
So slam the door and I'll slam it back
Baby I love you and it's as simple as that

It's an imaginary line we never crossed
But it might seem like all is lost
From the outside looking in

And it ain't always black and white
Sometimes you're wrong, sometimes I'm right
But it's all the same in the end

'Cause you know I want you
And I know you want me
And that's all that matters
Ain't it baby

And I'm never singing
Unless my song is for you
So slam the door and I'll slam it back
But who's to blame won't change the fact
Baby I love you, and it's as simple as that
