Blazing that I'm so amazing on the tracks bitch!

And I hop, and I flip over niggas like gymnastics (Hey!)
Watch the way I'm coming I'm giving the streets acid
Bastards niggas know I'm the king of the classics
Drastic measures, I'm spreading like a rash bitch
Class is in session you 'bout to get yo' ass kicked
Emperor, of every round table of the house
(And when I speak)
Niggas respect me as leader of the councilman

Dominant niggas respect my conglomerate
