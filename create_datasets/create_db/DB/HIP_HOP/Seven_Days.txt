I've been searching for someone
But never looked before my eyes
There you were to my surprise
It was so obvious looking into your face
After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place
I never thought that I
Would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed
I knew it had to be you
I never thought we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do
Oh

Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away
Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back
I wanted to kiss you
On Saturday
On Sunday we made love
Now what are we gonna do

As much as I, I want you
I don't want to wreck a friend
I've already found in you
I've been there before
And I can't ignore
How two friends became one
But walked away with none
I cannot risk a friend
But the love is so good
I gotta make a choice
I would if I could
I never thought we would be together
How can I address you
"Hey lover?", "Hi friend!"
"How ya doin'?", "Where ya been?"
I gotta make a choice

Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away
Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back
I wanted to kiss you
On Saturday
On Sunday we made love
Now what are we gonna do

On Sunday we made sweet sweet love
Tuesday we played a game
But Sunday we made love
Now what are we gonna do?
A friend of mine
