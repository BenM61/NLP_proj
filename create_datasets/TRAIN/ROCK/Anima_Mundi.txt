Dreams are engaging in battle
Cosmos is rising to fight
Our world is neglected and falling
Gaia, she screams in the night!

On the verge of decay and destruction
Hope is what keeps her alive
Sending her plea to her people
That nothing is written in stone

See the sun
See the sky
Hear the whispers of the wind
Take the time
Live the dream
Be the Anima Mundi

Clouds are beginning to muster
Oceans are stirring beneath
Life as it was may be lost now
'Cause Gaia, she screams in the night!

On the edge of the ending eternity
Hope is what keeps her alive
Sending her plea to her people
That fate can be altered somehow

See the sun
See the sky
Hear the whispers of the wind
Take the time
Live the dream
Be the Anima Mundi

A star on the night sky
Guiding her hopes
Her dreams are in motion
A sign of light
All will be well again

See the sun
See the sky
Hear the whispers of the wind
Take the time
Live the dream
