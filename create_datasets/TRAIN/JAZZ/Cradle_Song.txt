So goodnight now once more 
With roses roofed o'er 
All tied up with boughs 
Slip under the clothes 
When the morning shall break 
Please the Lord, I will wake 
When the morning shall break, 
Please the Lord, I will wake... 
Good night then once more 
By angels watched o'er 
In dreams thou shall see 
A fair Christmas tree 
Go to sleep, close thine eyes 
Thou shall see paradise 
Go to sleep, close thine eyes 
Thou shall see paradise... 
Go to sleep, close your eyes 
Thou shall see paradise...!
