You got a bad attitude 
Comin' up from inside 
You better watch your mouth
You got plenty to hide 
You come across so heavy you're a buck-o-five
Better rest your fist and try to use your mind
I'm not punkin' out
I'm just movin' up 
Say your comments loud
But try to back 'em up 

Keep your ass far away and stay with yourself 
Alonein a cage aggravate someone else.

Wise up because I'm fed up you better back up.

You in your baggy jeans 
With your baggy lip 
You 'bout to loseall your shit 
With the butt of my fist 
You better use your mind fast
And bring your pressure down quick
'cause you feather weight fuckin' in this heavyweight clique'
You know karate got a shiny gun in your hand 
Got a razor blade hat with a knife in the brim 
I ask you all the questions
Don't look at him your own stupid answers got you what you are in

Wise up because I'm fed up you better back up.
Wise up because I'm fed up you better back up.

No time spending on your thinking
Becuase somethings really strange
Dont care about the drinking
Makes the voices go away
Cause they hear what I am thinking
Let your ego get away

Then you'll frind that you are missing
What can teach you every day

No time spending on your thinking
Let frustrations get away
Im not holding it inside me
I'll just let it bay
What it wants to
When it wants to
Spontaneously
How it covered with me

Wise up because I'm fed up you better back up.
