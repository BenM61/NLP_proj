All the things I said, 
I should have said and didn't say, 
And I wonder why. 
Yes, I wonder why. 
I think about the time we spent, 
The places that we went;
Still makes me cry. 
Yes, it makes me cry. 

Why do they say that time will heal 
This broken heart? 
They would know it isn't true 
If they lost someone like you, oh. 

Some things can never be replaced. 
Some things are with me for always. 
These are the things I will remember 
When I remember when. 
I'd rather love and lose it all 
Than never have you to recall. 
These are the things I will remember. 
Again and then again, 
(Again and again.) 
When I remember when. 

You taught me how to love.
I am all I am 
Because of you. 
Just because of you. 
Everytime I lost my way, 
You shine a light, you made my day, 
You see me through. 
Yes, you see me through. 

So who's gonna come around to heal 
This broken heart? 
Show me how to laugh and cry, 
But never how to say goodbye. 

Some things can never be replaced. 
Some things are with me for always. 
These are the things I will remember 
When I remember when. 
I'd rather love and lose it all 
Than never have you to recall. 
These are the things I will remember. 
Again and then again, 
(Again and again.) 
When I remember when. 

This life goes on, you carry on. 
You do, and it's okay. 
(When I remember when.) 
This love goes on, and I will live 
To love another day. 
(Again and then again.) 
This life goes on, you carry on.
You do, and it's okay. 
I would laugh, and I would cry, 
But I will never say goodbye. 

Some things can never be replaced. 
Some things are with me for always. 
These are the things I will remember 
When I remember when. 
I'd rather love and lose it all 
Than never have you to recall. 
These are the things I will remember. 
Again and then again, 
(Again and again.) 
When I remember when. 

Oh, 
When I remember when.
