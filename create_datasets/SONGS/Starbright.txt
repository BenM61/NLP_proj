Starbright, I have made a wish upon you
Now my heart is counting on you
Won't you grant my wish tonight?

Starbright, won't you glow with all your splendor ?
Won't you make her heart surrender?
Won't you make her mine tonight?

Help me, help me make her heart discover
Just how much I really love her
Help me make her mine tonight

Oh starbright, since you know how much I need her
Can you spare some light to lead her
To my empty arms tonight?

Oh starbright, since you know how much I need her
Can't you spare some light to lead her
To my empty arms tonight?

Oh starbright
