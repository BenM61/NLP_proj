I was never cool in school
I'm sure you don't remember me
And now it's been ten years
I'm still wondering who to be
But i love to mix in circles,
Cliques and social coteries,
That's me
Hand me my nosering
(can we be happy?)
Show me the mosh pit
(can we be happy?)
We can be happy
Underground

Who's got the looks?
Who's got the brains?
Who's got everything?
I've got this pain in my heart
That's all
Hey you, with the long
And lonely face
There's gotta be something else
Let me tell you something else
There was a girl who passed me by
She gave a smile, but i was shy
And looked down, so down
Don't look there no no
Go go underground
Now now there's a place to go
It's the morning now
It's the evening
It's everything
I click my heels and i'm there

Underground, underground, ooh
Everything's happy underground
You been kicked around
Did life bring you down here?
Everything's heavy underground

And we'll be decked
In all black
Slamming the pit fantastic
Officer friendly's little boy's
Got a mohawk
And he knows just where
We're coming from
It's industrial
Work it underground
Get down, get down, get down

Underground, underground, ooh
Everything's happy underground
You been kicked around
Did life bring you down here?
Everything's heavy underground
We can be happy
We can be happy
We can be happy
Underground
Oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can be
Everything's heavy!
