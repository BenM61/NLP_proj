I Love you Cheri

(Yung Joc)
Mama Mi amor I adore
Let Joc give you the world & more
Purchase the blue's it you's of course
Or we could vacate somewhere off shore
Or we could stay home tonight
Tops & pop we gonna get it right
Dim them lights be my snack in the middle of the night aight

(Verse 1)
See you at the corner
Corner of my eye
When you walking by
I get an appetite
Wanna take your picture
Wont u strike a pose
Turning them to up
Just wanna let u know

(Hook)
I think you're sexy
Baby wont u let me
Paint the perfect picture of us
Its so electric (yeah)
Something classic
Make it everlastin'
Its gonna be incredible
Priceless
It cant be sold

Come & see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come & see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeah)

(Verse 2)
No need to be scared
Its not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Oh no
You gotta play it fare
I promise that I'll be the only one
To blow your mind and get you there

(Hook)

Come & see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come & see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeah)

(Bridge)
The color of love
Is it red?
Or is it blue?
The creation of love
Beautiful and simply true (You you you)
