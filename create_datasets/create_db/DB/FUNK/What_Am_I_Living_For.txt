What am i living for 
If not for you
What am i living for 
If not for you
What am i living for
If not for you
Ohhhh, nobody else
Nobody else will do

What am i longing for 
Each lonely night
To feel your lips with mine
And holdyou tight
You'll be my little girl
My whole life through
Baby, nobody else (nobody)
Nobody else will do

I want you close to me
That's all i know
I want you all the time
Cause darling i love you so

What am i living for 
If not for you
What am i living for 
If not for you
What am i living for 
If not for you
Ohhh, nobody else (nobody)
Nobody else will do
Ohhh, nobody else (nobody)
Nobody else will do

Baby, nobody else
Nobody else will do
