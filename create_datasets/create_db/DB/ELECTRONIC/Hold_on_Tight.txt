Okay, this is it hold on tight!
Woo!

Well since you told me yes, i'm out of control
We're gonna rock this town
We're gonna watch it rattle & roll

Hold on honey, hold on tight
It's only money & tonight's the night
In answer to your question just hold on tight

Mmm... well, i'm in a whirl
A lucky girl who's found her only treasure
Being without you
Thinking about you has been my one & only pleasure
Made my mind up, set my sights
Followed you morning, noon & night
And since you've put my lonely life to flight
Hold on tight

Hold on, hold on tight
Me & you're flying into heaven tonight
Hold on, hold on tight
Me & my sweet a little dynamite
Hold on, hold on tight
I've waited for you all of my life
Hold on, hold on tight
Don't let go just a hold, just a hold on tight

Well the dream machine is rolling now you're on board
We're paradise bound never got that far before
Me & you honey, we're two of a kind
We're heading for heaven in a vertical climb
In answer to your question just hold on tight

Made my mind up, set my sights
Followed you morning, noon & night
And since you've put my lonely life to flight
Hold on tight

We're gonna rock this town, yeah!
Hold on, hold on tight
Me & you're flying into heaven tonight, woo!
Hold on, hold on tight
Me & my sweet a little dynamite, hey!
Hold on, hold on tight, com'on!
I've waited for you all of my life, hey!
Hold on, hold on tight
Don't let go just a hold, just a hold on

Hold on, hold on tight, tight!
Me & you're flying into heaven tonight, hey!
Hold on, hold on tight
Don't let go just a hold, just a hold on...
Ha... woo!
