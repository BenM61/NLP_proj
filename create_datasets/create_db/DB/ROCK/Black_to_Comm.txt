Let it come on down, babe
In the midnight hour
Let it come on down, baby
In the midnight hour

Let it come on down, down, down
Let it come on down, down, down
Let it come on down, down, down
Let it come on down, down, down
In the midnight hour

Can't you feel it children
All around you?
Well, can't you feel it children
All around you?

And it's all for you, you, you
And it's all for you, you, you
And it's all for you, you, you
And it's all for you, you, you
