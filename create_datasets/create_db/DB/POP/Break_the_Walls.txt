Say whatever comes our way
You'll always feel the same
Through my eyes, my eyes
Only colors of love

Whenever you're around
The things I've lost I've found, I found in you
Under the stars, I walk with you bright as the moon
Your face is like an angel shining

Break the walls around my heart
'Cause I believe you're the only one
To set me free, break the walls
The walls around my heart

Take the sadness from my soul
No stranger to pain, it's like rain so cold
And now you fill my thoughts with love
A love that rises above

And when you look to the sky
I know why I believe
Under the stars, I walk with you bright as the moon
Your face is like an angel shining

Break the walls around my heart
'Cause I believe you're the only one
I'll ever need, break the walls
The walls around my heart

The walls around my heart
The walls around my heart
The walls around my heart
The walls around my heart

Break the walls around my heart
'Cause I believe you're the only one
I'll ever need to set me free, break the walls
The walls around my heart

And never be apart
The walls around my heart
The walls around my heart
The walls around my heart
The walls around my heart
