When the lights go out and the mercury rises
Angels fall to the other side
Fear meets lust just us colliding
When the lights go out we own the night

Blood red pumps up against your body
Beating like drums sucked in the fire
Wrong feels right don't try to fight it
'Cause the night dissolves into desire

When the light go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out

Now I lay you down but no ones sleeping
Now I lay you down here in the dark

Lights go out to shouts and screaming
No one gets out without a scar

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out

I can feel it coming
Feel your body humming
Pushing buttons when the lights go, lights go

I can feel it coming
Feel your body humming
Self destructing when the lights go, lights go

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go

When the lights go out the walls come down
We sound just like animals
Inhibitions lost and lines get crossed
You get me off when the lights go out
When the lights go out
