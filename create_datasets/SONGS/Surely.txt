Surely, you know how I stand on the question of my loving you;
Haven't I proved it in so many ways?
Surely, you can tell by the way I kiss your lips that I want you;
More surely than my words can say.

I see you stand and accuse me of no longer wanting you.
Misunderstanding what others have seen.
Surely, you won't let idle people, with nothing else to rely on,
Tear down all our hopes and our dreams.

Tell me, does the rain fall?  (Surely, surely...)
And does the summer always follow spring?
How does a turtle go?  (Slowly, surely.)
That's how my love grows, surely, surely, surely.

Darling, if your head misleads you
Just listen to your heart; it knows I need you.
Just as surely as the sun is gonna rise.
Just as surely as the birds are gonna sing.
Just as surely as everything is part of everything;
I'm a part of you.
Surely, you know I'm a part of you,
And surely, you know that I love you.
I love you.
