When I was the age of three
My dear mother had a
Little talk with me

She said a woman
Can be a contrary little thing
But, son, she mean a
Whole world to a man

If I hadn't loved
Your daddy this way
He wouldn't be the
Big man he is today

Don't you know
A man needs a woman
A man got to have a woman
To carry on (to carry on)
To carry on

Just like the fish needs the ocean
Just like rough hand need a little lotion
Like the window needs pane
Like the highway needs two lane

Don't you know
A man needs a woman
A man got to have a woman
To carry on (to carry on)
To carry on

Just like a vampire needs blood
Like a dead dog need them bugs
Just like the darkness needs the light
Just like the fisherman, he needs
He needs a little bite now, oh, yeah

Don't you know
A man needs a woman
A man got to have a woman
To carry on (to carry on)
To carry on

Just like a boxer need gloves
Just like me, I need a little love
Like the soldier needs a gun
Like a hamburger needs a bun
I need you, yes I do
I need you just to see me through
I've got to have you baby
