So you thought you might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
I got some bad news for you, sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they've sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall
(Yes the wall)
There's one in the spotlight now he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
(Yes the)
And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon
Who let all this riffraff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and that one's got spots
If I had my way I'd have all of your shot
