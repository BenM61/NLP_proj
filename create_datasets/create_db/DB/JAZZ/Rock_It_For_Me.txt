I heard it came to town
A new kind of rhythm
Spread around
Sort of set you sizzlin'
Now I'm all through with symphony
Oh, rock it for me

Every night
You'll see all the nifties
Plenty tight
Swingin' down the fifties
Now they're all through with symphony
Ho ho ho, rock it for me

Now it's true that once upon a time
The opera was the thing
But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme
So won't you satisfy my soul
With the rock and roll?

You can't be tame
While the band is playin'
It ain't no shame
To keep your body swayin'
Beat it out in the minor key
Ho ho ho, rock it for me

Can't you hear me singin', la-la-la-la-la
While the band is swingin'
Oh, Chick Webb's sockin'
And the band is rockin'
So send me lightly, politely
Brightly, and slightly
Ho ho ho, rock it for me

Now I'm all through with this stuff they call symphony
Come on, boys, and sorta rock it for me

It's true that once upon a time
The opera was the thing
But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme
So won't you satisfy my soul
With the rock and roll?

You can't be tame
While the band is playin'
It ain't no shame
To keep your body swayin'
Beat it out in the minor key
Oh, rock it
Oh, rock it
Say, won't you rock it for me?

Why even all the nifties they don't want to hear any more symphony
I'm tellin' you, Jack, you better get hip for yourself and rock it for me
