When I think of Tom
I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
And the soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill

I remember this
And I always will
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
Are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my mem'ries happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own
