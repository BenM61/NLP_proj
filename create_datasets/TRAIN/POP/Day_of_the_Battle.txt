There's a target on my chest
I need a bulletproof vest
I'm going into battle on my own
And I've got no other choice
Else I'm gonna be destroyed
In the middle of this firestorm

This armor doesn't go with me
In steel I don't belong

This is the day of the battle
This is the day of the battle for life
We're fighting fire with fire
We're coming out of the shadows alive

We got bullets we got shields
As we're running through the fields
Never knew that I could love so much
I'll give my blood my breath my tears
Live to chase away the fear
Ever fighting for the two of us

This armor doesn't go with me in steel I don't belong

This is the day of the battle
This is the day of the battle for life
We're fighting fire with fire
We're coming out of the shadows alive

Sometimes to win you gotta dare to lose your inhibitions
Sometimes to fly you gotta dare to try without permission
This is the day of the battle

I'll cover you, you cover me
Through this fire storm
I'll fight for you, you fight for me
We'll keep marching on

This is the day of the battle
