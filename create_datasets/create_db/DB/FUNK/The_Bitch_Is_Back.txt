I was justified when I was five
Raisin' Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changin' now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back, oh, oh, oh

Eat meat on Friday, that's all right
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, oh, oh, oh

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul, by dropping names
I don't like those! My God, what's that!
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back.

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
