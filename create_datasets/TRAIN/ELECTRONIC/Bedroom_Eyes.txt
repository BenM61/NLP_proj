Step out from work, two missed calls, private number but I know its her
So I call her right back ask 'what time are you coming over?'
Turns up at mine, half nine, never on time
Looking oh so so fine

We stay up late and talk about our dreams
Oh how they differ but we'll make them meet
See she's got ambitions, and I've got visions
She's doing hers, I'm doing mine
Keep telling her that we'll be fine

She's here to see her in the city lover
We fight the cold together under cover
I hope tonight will be no different from the others
As we set the scene, set the scene

She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I broke into my come here smile
She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I reached over and turned out the light

She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I broke into my come here smile
She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I realize, I realize

The suns gone down and the demons on the street come out to play
City lights light up, drinkers drink up, ravers rave
Meanwhile we're inside, me and my girl
I tell her it's your world, she says mine and we're doing all right tonight
While I play my guitar she reads her magazines
She giggles in the background looking at the singers and the beauty queens
I turn around, to look at mine, I feel inspired
I write a couple lines and over to her I slide

She's here to see her in the city lover
We fight the cold together under cover
I hope tonight will be no different from the others
As we set the scene, set the scene

She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I broke into my come here smile
She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I reached over and turned out the light

She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I broke into my come here smile
She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I reached over and turned out the light

She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I broke into my come here smile
She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
