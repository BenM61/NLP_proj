Twinkle, twinkle
Little me
I have a lonely life
I'm the star
Upon your tree
That makes your Christmas bright
Twinkle twinkle little me
I left the Milky Way
Just so I could be with you on Christmas day

Christmas brought me where you are
And heaven gave me life
I'm that friendly little star
You wish upon each night

Twinkle, twinkle
Oh, Twinkle, twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unselfishly
And make a wish come true
I'll always shine on you

Twinkle little me
Twinkle, twinkle little me
Oh, Christmas brought me where you are
And heaven gave me life
I'm that friendly star
You wish upon each night

Twinkle, twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unselfishly
And make a wish come true
I'll always shine for you

Twinkle little me 
I'll always shine for you
Twinkle little me

I'll always shine for you
