Like the moon moves the tides
You influence my mind
Like the planets and the stars
Keep the rhythm to your time
Are you happy with him?
Yes I let you go

[Chorus:]

Girl I love you
Cherie I love you so
Girl I love you
I was a fool to let you go

Like the alchemist
Who couldn't resist the devil's kiss
Base metal into gold
And the psychiatrist
Who's battling deep within his own soul
I was like them down the hole

All the memories of your life
Like Venice in the spring
New York City summers
Paris, London winters chill

I love you so
Want you to know
I love you so

As the apples fall, the leaves turn
Make it too autumn's call
But you still know your way
Never be outdone at all
And if I falter I see it in our child

Girl I love you
Cherie I love you so
Girl I love you 
No I won't let go

Girl I love you
Cherie I love you so
Girl I love you 
No I can't let go

Girl I need your sunshine to feel alright
Girl I need your sunshine to feel alright
