Love is warm and understanding
when you're seventeen
love is cold
kills your dreams and schemes
much too young
the words are comin'
like a neonlight
of and on
bringin' back last night
bringin' back last night.

Oh, Susie
we've run out of time
oh, Susie
say what's on your mind
we've got nowhere to run
we were much too young.

Oh, Susie
we've run out of time
oh, Susie
say what's on your mind
we've got nowhere to run
we were much too young.

I'm in love
and nothing else can 
make me feel this way
now I'm lost not much more to say
radio
the song they're playin' can't be rightly sung
off and on
singin' much too young
singin' much too young.

Oh, Susie
we've run out of time
oh, Susie
say what's on your mind
we've got nowhere to run
we were much too young.

Oh, Susie
we've run out of time
oh, Susie
say what's on your mind
we've got nowhere to run
we were much too young.
