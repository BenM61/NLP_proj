My love is deeper than the ocean higher than a mountain
And I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
Can't no other steal my heart or dampen my desire
Oh yeah baby you're the one to turn me on
 
So bring it on, on, on - and I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
So bring it on, on, on - come and get with this it's time to get it on

I've been waiting for some kind of sign your ship is sending
Patience is the thing my heart don't wanna know
Yeah we've come a long way but my love I am depending
Don't you try to fight the feeling let it flow

So bring it on, on, on - and I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
So bring it on, on, on - come and get with this it's time to get it on

Don't take a fool, a fool to see 
That your are the one for me stop faking me out
It's still a thrill to be down with you so baby please don't mess me around,
come on

So bring it on, on, on - and I'm gonna keep on reaching for the sun
So bring it on, on, on - come and get with this it's time to get it on

So bring it on, on, on

So bring it on, ooh-ooh-ooh
So bring it on, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
