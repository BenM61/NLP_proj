Where are you
When I am needing you
So far away
So far away
I think you're the most important
To me to me to me to me
My sunken footsteps put theirselves on
Through this gallery of deceased
I think their lives must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays

Where are you
So far away
It makes no sense
It makes no sense at all, ha

Where are you ?
Where are you ?
Where are you ?
Ha, ho

Where are you
So far away
I think you're the most important
To me to me
My sunken footsteps put theirselves on
Through this gallery of deceased
I think their lives must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays

Where are you
So far away
I think their lives must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays
Nowadays
Nowadays
Nowadays
Nowadays

It make no sense at all
So far away
In just one day
In just one day
It makes no sense at all
It makes no sense at all
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just
In just one
One day
