Let me tell you why I love him

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him
Then I must be fly, 'cause his light, it shines so bright
I wouldn't lie, no

I remember the very first day that I saw him
I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband, maybe he was my wife

And even the things I don't like about him are fine with me
'Cause it's not hard for me to understand him 
'Cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe the air he breathes

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him
Then I must be fly
Because his light, it shines so bright
I wouldn't lie, no, oh

How can the same man that makes me so mad (Do you know what he did?)
Turn right around and kiss me so soft (girl, you know what he did?)
If he ever left me I wouldn't even be sad, no
'Cause there's a blessing in every lesson
And I'm glad that I know him at all

'Cause he is the truth
Said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him
Then I must be fly
Because his light, it shines so bright, oh

I love the way he speaks
I love the way he thinks
I love the way that he treats his mama
I love that gap in between his teeth
Love him in every way that a woman can love a man
From personal to universal
But most of all it's unconditional
You know what I'm talking about?

That's the way I feel
And I always will
There ain't no substitute for the truth
Either it is or it isn't, 'cause he is the truth
You see the truth it needs no proof
Either it is or it isn't, 'cause he is the truth
And you know the truth by the way it feels
And if I am a reflection of him
Then I must be fly
Because he is, yes, he is (fly, light, bright)
I wonder does he know
