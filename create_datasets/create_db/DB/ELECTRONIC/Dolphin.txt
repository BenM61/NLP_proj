To the sea
To the end of the road
Could it be?
Has it always been so, so quiet?
I would always be
There when you need it
Wanna give you a hand
Gonna creep
Gonna switch off the screen, un-blinded
And I'll always find you
Knelt down upon the knee

To the end
To the things that we see
Clever bait
As a cat up a tree, so spry
In the space between
Comparisons to you
To the edge of a cliff
Us, the odd
Us, the frustrated crowd, so vile
Let it all define you
A clown among the thieves

To the end
