Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

Tied to a wheel fingers got to feel
Bleeding through a tar-decay smile
I spin on a whim, I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light

For our love, for our fear
For our rise against the years and years and years

Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red machinehead
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red

And I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

Deaf dumb and thirty
Starting to deserve this
Leaning on my conscience wall
Blood is like wine
Unconscious all the time
If I had it all again
I'd change it all

Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red machinehead
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red

And I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in

Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red machinehead
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red

Better than the rest, better than the rest
Machinehead

And I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine
