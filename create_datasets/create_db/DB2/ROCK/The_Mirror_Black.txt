One night I had a dream, of a maiden in black and silver
She said to me why are you afraid?
Why is the truth so hard to attain?

I will show you your fears, just look in the mirror
You can conquer your fears, look at me

Forty days and forty dreams, darkened visions
Incline the reason, philosophy cannot soothe your soul
But in the mirror the truth will be known

I will show you your fears, just look into the mirror
You can conquer your fears, look in deep

See unobtrusive, through the lies
No longer afraid, afraid to die

And so lived the dreams, danced with the maiden
Made love to blackness, she said to me you are not alone
Don't be afraid to cry
No more terror sleeps in me, I will not cry I'll be strong
The last tear has rolled down on my face
I am stronger, stronger than yesterday

I will show you your fears, just look into the mirror
You can conquer your fears, look at me

In the mirror you might not like what you see
For the mirror reflects the fears that you feel
In the mirror you might not like what you see
The mirror, the mirror is calling.
