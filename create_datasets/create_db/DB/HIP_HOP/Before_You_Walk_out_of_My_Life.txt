Here we are, face to face
With the mem'ries that can't be erased.
Although we need each other, things have changed.
It's not the same.

Sometimes it makes me wonder.
Where would I be if you hadn't discovered,
Reaching deep inside of me?
I know there was something
That we could compare.

Well, I never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
And I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.

Remembering the good times
From a portrait hung on high.
It's filled with so much color
And the laughter we left behind.

I made the choice when you couldn't decide.
I made the choice; I was wrong you were right.
Deep down inside I apologize.

Never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.

Well, I never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.

So I'll make plans with you
To always have time for you,
Before you walk out of my life.
I guess it's true,
Can not live without you.
Don't ever go away,
Oh, yeah,

Never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.

Never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well,I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.

Well, I never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.
