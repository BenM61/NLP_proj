I don't wanna be weak
I just wanna be strong
Don't wanna make you uncomfortable
Every time I'm wrong

I don't wanna be rough
Just wanna be sweet to you, baby
I wanna be your everything
Boy, you mean every little thing to me

Friendly pressure
From midnight into the sunshine

Don't wanna get wet until the rain begins
'Til the rain begins
Don't wanna get wet 'til the rain begins

I don't wanna be weak
Yes, I'm gonna be strong
Don't wanna make you uncomfortable
When every time you're wrong

I'm not gonna get rough
If you just let me be sweet to you, baby
I wanna give you everything
Oh, and try to be anything you want me to be

Friendly pressure
From midnight into the sunshine
Friendly pressure
From midnight, oh, the sunshine

I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be weak
I just wanna be strong
Don't wanna make you uncomfortable

Don't wanna get wet until the rain begins
'Til the rain begins
Don't wanna get wet 'til the rain begins

Don't wanna get wet until the rain begins
'Til the rain begins
Don't wanna get wet 'til the rain begins

Friendly pressure
From midnight into the sunshine
The sunshine
