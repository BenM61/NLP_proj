So what, you don't agree with the things that I do
And you always accuse me
I can never ever be a perfect fucking image of what want you
And nobody can ever live forever
Get over it
I'm ready now

We can only live our lives as we please
So just get the f*ck over it

I can never ever be a perfect fucking image of what want you
And nobody can ever live forever
Get over it
I'm ready now

And it goes on and on, and on, and on, and on, and f*ck it
Six, six, six
Party with the devil, bitch

Fill your cups
We're dancing with the devil
He'll drink you under the table
Fire burning in your lungs
So drink up
And now the devil's inside me
I feel better than I ever have before

You don't agree with the things that I do
And you always accuse me
F*ck

Let's go

I can never ever be a perfect fucking image of what you want
And nobody can ever live forever
Get over it
I'm ready now

Here we go

All you do is point and accuse
A useless flaming ball of shit
Causing trouble with my friends

I don't give a f*ck what you think
The devil's got my fucking back

If you keep running your mouth
You'll get your baby motherfucked

F*ck that shit

Go

Come on, get up and we'll party with the devil
And the party never stops
Until you're on my fucking level
It's another night alive
Another reason we can break shit
F*ck another hot bitch
My initials are six, six, six

F*ck you
