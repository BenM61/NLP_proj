I've been with the incrowd
Been on the outside too
I've seen life's many faces
Seen the high and the low

I've been on the crossroad
Between heaven or hell
Don't need no direction
Don't need no one to tell

It that's the Final Option
I'm gonna choose it
Don't point the gun
If you don't want to use it

This is - the Final Option - choose
I challenge the devil
For another game
Winning or losing
It is all the same

I challenge the devil
For another game
Where every bullet
Is having my name.
