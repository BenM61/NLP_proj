Lalalalalala

Saw you walking down the street
Holding hands with some other guy
Wearing a sharkskin suit, black patent leather boots
& big brown flying saucer eyes
I didn't talk to you then
You were kissing your friend
Besides it was the wrong time & place
I went home & took a shower
Read"Our Lady Of The Flowers" by Jane Genet
I knew we'd meet again
Don't want your diamonds
Don't want your gold
I want your love
I want your soul
Come on baby, let's have a good time

I searched all over town
Quizzed the dudes hanging around,
No one had ever seen a chick like you before
I hit strip joints & museums
Bars and Clubs & Jesus
I even prayed in a cathedral for your soul
Then one rainy winter Tuesday
I saw you on the subway
You were headed for the tunnel
Me the door
I pressed my face against the glass
You sped by me in a flash
Like a motorcycle crash
You smoked my skull

Don't want your diamonds
Don't want your gold
I want your love
I want your soul
Come on baby, let's have a good time

Here she comes now

So there I was walking in the pouring rain
Wonderin' who & why & where & what you were
I had hallucinatory dreams
Shivers sweats & screams
Like an opiate withdrawal only worse
Then one long hot summer night
I took a motorcycle ride
Saw you looking mean & evil
Voodoo rockabilly queen
'bout to kickstart your machine
Like a fighter pilot flying off to war
You had a tight black leather jacket
Skull & crossbones on the back
God bless your soul of sweet Gene Vincent
There you were

Don't want your diamonds
Don't want your gold
I want your love
I want your soul
Come on baby, let's have a good time
