Hot from Hell and Hades
For gentlemen and ladies
The little biddy babies
And the household pet

The punches and the Judys
The crunches and the bruises
The Humpty Dumpty boozers
Who are trying to forget?

The future that we're building
Something to be skilled in
How to teach the children
And to teach them well

From domestic science
To domestic violence
The right to remain silent
In your prison cell

You can dial M for Mother
Your sister and your brother
Or anybody other
If you really want

But it's the terrorist and traitor
That lights the blue touch paper
The fuse and detonator
Of the worry bomb

The worry bomb has gotcha
Your brain's about to rupture
And there's no wood to touch here
And you need some quick

The furniture's Formica
The doors are all glass fiber
You touch the floor beside you
And it's made of brick

The worry curse is on you
With paranoid insomnia
Twenty golden slumbers
Wouldn't get you forty winks

Alcohol enhanced it
And smoking's not the answer
Heart disease and cancer
Are the worry bomb kings
Worry bomb
