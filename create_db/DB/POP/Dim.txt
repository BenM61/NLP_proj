I can't see you, but you can see me waiting along the road
Thumbing a ride to get into town, hey where'd you get your automobe
See you around the corner, waitin' for my flame to burn
My eyes are dim, I cannot see
But I know there's a good time waiting for me 
Making my scene just groovin' around, making what chicks I can
I drink what I like and I dance what I do, I'm getting right through to the band
See you in the corner, wait for my flame to burn
My eyes are dim, I cannot see
I'd sooner feel you babe, feeling me 

Think I'll leap around a bit, and sow my seed somewhere
Go on around to the 46, gonna do the things that I dare
See you in the corner, wait for my flame to burn
My eyes are dim, I cannot see
You'd better not take that thought from me
