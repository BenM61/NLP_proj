Set the sails, I feel the winds a'stirring
Towards the bright horizon set the way
Cast your reckless dreams upon our Mayflower
The haven from the world and her decay

Who could heed the words of Charlie Darwin
Fighting for a system built to fail
Spooning water from the broken vessels
As far as I can see, there is no land

Oh my god
The water's all around us
Oh my god, it's all around

Who could heed the words of Charlie Darwin
Lords of war just profit from decay
And trade the children's promise for the jingle
The way we trade our hard earned time for pay

Oh my god
The water's cold and shapeless
Oh my god, it's all around

Oh my god
Life is cold and formless
Oh my god, it's all around
