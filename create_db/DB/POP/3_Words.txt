I met a guy at the club,
I let him know I'm in love,

I met a girl at the bar,
I let her know who you are.

I told her you are the love of my life and,
One day your gonna be my wife.
And we are gonna have some babies together.

I told him you are the man of my dreams,
You saved me from drowning in the streams
And I know were really gonna last forever. (and ever)
