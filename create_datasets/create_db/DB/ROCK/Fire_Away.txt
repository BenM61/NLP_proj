Load up the flares and fire away.
Search without rescue.
Of all the times you looked out to sea,
You never stepped in.
Why wait for me?

Abandon ship.
Fend for yourself.
You've got that sinking feeling and nothing else.

Priorities change,
And hope fades away.
How did you get here?
At first you thought you had control,
Now you're just following.
So lost again.

Abandon ship.
Fend for yourself.
You've got that sinking feeling and nothing else.

With the resources left in your heart,
Of course you're afraid.
And all you did was break another tie.
And all of this can break another time.

Abandon ship.
Fend for yourself.
You've got that sinking feeling and nothing else.
