Died in a motor crash
I came back for you
The perfect version of myself
Tomorrow we start again
Tomorrow came and went

I'm indestructible, how
I'm indestructible
I'm indestructible, how
I'm into, I'm in two

We won't say a thing
While you give your life away
Give your life away, not a thing
We won't say a thing
While you give your life away

Died in an amusement park accident
I came back for you
So you wouldn't be alone
And if I go away again
You can have my stereo

I'm indestructible, how
I'm indestructible
I'm indestructible, how
I'm into, I'm in two

We won't say a thing
While you give your life away
Give your life away, not a thing
We won't say a thing
While you give your 

I'm indestructible
I'm indestructible
I'm indestructible
