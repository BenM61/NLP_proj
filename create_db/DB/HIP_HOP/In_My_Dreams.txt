I used to think I was the only one
Who never knew what it was like to fall
But you came along and changed all the rules that day
And just for a moment I had it all

You are the dream I live with
You are the wish I made
The name I always whisper
In every prayer I pray
Now that you left me
While you forget me, I'll hold you in my dreams

Now I go on here in my lonely world
And there's still a bridge I cannot cross
I can't let go so please forgive me girl
Cause God only knows
All that I've lost

You are the dream I live with
You are the wish I made
The name I always whisper
In every prayer I pray
Now that you left me
While you forget me, I'll hold you in my dreams

Now that you left me
While you forget me

You are the dream I live with
You are the wish I made
The name I always whisper
In every prayer I pray
Now that you left me
While you forget me, I'll hold you in my dreams
