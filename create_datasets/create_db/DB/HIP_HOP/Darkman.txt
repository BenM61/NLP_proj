Refrain:
Oh can you hear him comin'
Is the darkman you better keep runnin'
Always believe in what ever you say or do
That's the point that's why I can't say I love you
I got more than a thousand problems on my mind
I'm commin' from the dark and light's so hard to find
Can't concentrate I steady loose control
The pain in my brain make me wanna explode
Like the fugees day and night searchin' for the score
To bring the vibes I'll be the key to your door
It all started off with a glass of wine
But now I need nine to feel fine before I sign
Somebody help me or else I'M gonna die
Don't be shy ask why before passin' me by
The best things in life is what I heard are free
Michael Jackson will definitely tell you the story
It's the darkman flowin' of the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be
I take a look in the mirror I see somethin' wrong
Last year I was strong somebody please blow the horns
Daily survival tactics and I pray
Dear lord forgive me and show me the way
To the light and the place called paradise
No matter when or how it I should I'll fight
You better be ready before you come to the ringside
No tears my friend only the strong survive
It always comes hard and direct in my face but my man
That the deal that the rule of the game that we play
Everyday what can I say
Real brothers don't die 'till they get their peace of the cake
Go for it go get yours stay on the course
Physical force like a rebel no doubt without a pause
Darkman flowin' on the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be
Mama always said son you reep what you sow
But today now I know I can feel it through my body and soul
Separate the good from the bad
You better do your own thing than ending up sad
It made me bad I didn't have the chance to ask dad
Nightmares in my sleep I wake up frightened and scared
Who cares a boy in young years all I wanted was to see the
Light in full gear
Yeah here I come here I am here I slam
Rollin' with the clique with another dope party jam
Look for what you want and finally succeed and believe
Your dream will come true yes indeed
Make a small step forward than a big step back
Any other direction will probably break your neck
It's the darkman Flowin' on the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be
Darkman reamaks chorus
National guard or FBI
Who's that nigga creepin' through
Tha wildside
That's my nigga called Nana
Tha dakman's comin'
Tha dakman's comin'
