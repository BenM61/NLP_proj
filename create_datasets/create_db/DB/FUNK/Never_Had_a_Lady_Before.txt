I've had girls and I've had women
But I've never had a lady before
I've been high and I've been flyin'
But I've never been this crazy before

Saying sweet things that I really wanna hear
And it's coming as no surprise
Whatever we got is oh-so hard to find
I realize too that a something like you
Doesn't come along everyday

And I'm turning over part of my mind to you now
I been loved, been befriended
But I never really bled before
I've seen brains and I've seen brilliance
But I never got 'em through my head before

Could've been a week or it could've been an hour
It could've been a thousand years
When I'm with you, baby, I'm losing my track of time
A little bit of me and a little bit of you
Is telling me to have no fears
And I'm turning over part of my mind to ya, honey

Emotion just can't be denied
Feelin' only comes when we're side by side
I've had girls and I've had women
But I never had a lady before
Hey na na na
Never had a lady before
Hey, no lady
Never had a lady before
Ah, ah, ah
Never had a lady before

Hey, now you're doin' it; whatever ya do, I'm gonna like it
Never had a lady before
Don't know what you're doin', but you keep on doin' it, baby
Never had a lady before
