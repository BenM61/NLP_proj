Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there's no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she

Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question, what are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass
I'm well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio and Cris with some lime what is this?
An immaculate version of Me and My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me

Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

Yeah, yeah, let's pour some cherry wine
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, ayo Salaam, yeah, I think they know the time
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah

Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what
Life is good, life is good
Life is good, yeah
Life is good
No matter what
Life is good
