Nobody wants to be alone.
The heart beats happy when it has a place.
And if it doesn't have a home
It can come into my space.

So you can be the one I love.
I can be the one you long for.
You can be the one I want... want.
And you can be the one I love.
This could be our world wide open.
You can be the one I want... want.

When you've fallen for someone
But that someone doesn't feel the same.
But before you come undone
You can call out my name.

So you can be the one I love.
I can be the one you long for.
You can be the one I want... want.
And you can be the one I love.
This could be our world wide open.
You can be the one I want... want.
So you can be the one I love.
I can be the one you long for.
You can be the one I want... want.
And you can be the one I love.
This could be our world wide open.
You can be the one I want... want.

(So you can be the one... one one one
I can be the one... one one one
So you can be the one... one one one
I can be the one... one one one)

So you can be the one I love.
I can be the one you long for.
You can be the one I want... want.
And you can be the one I love.
This could be our world wide open.
You can be the one I want... want.
So you can be the one I love.
I can be the one you long for.
You can be the one I want... want.
And you can be the one I love.
This could be our world wide open.
You can be the one I want... want.
