Lost in a fog
Groaning an ode to a clear moon
An empty song
A flash of light in the storming
Dawn
Remembered
As a blade
A stream
Cutting
The world awake
The only light:
Imagined clear moon in a black sky
A distant bell:
Imagined clear moon in a black sky
Through a wall of fog:
Clear moon remembered
I breathe in
Imagined clear moon in a black sky
