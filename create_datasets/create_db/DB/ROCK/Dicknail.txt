Hey, Daddy
Come over here
Got something for you
Dicknail
She liked it
You know she liked it
Well, she was asking for it
Dicknail

I said, I said stop
I did what you said
I did what you want
I was a good girl
I was a good girl
I was a good girl
I said, I said, I said, I said NO!

Hey, Daddy
One thing's for certain, baby
You have my guarantee
You won't forget me

I said, I said stop
I did what you said
I did what you want
I was a good girl
I was a good girl
I was a good girl
I said, I said, I said, I said NO!

Do you remember Christmas morning?
You know it's real because
Well, here comes Santa Claus
She liked it
You know she liked it
Fat claw on your sack
Fall on, on your sack
Claw, claw, claw, claw
