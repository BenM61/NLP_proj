Came down from the North
You know the way they do
Got a cheeky smile
Sexy Northerner

Hanging round the clubs
Gets in them for free
Don't know how he does it
Sexy Northerner

Drinks a lot of beer
At least he doesn't smoke
Hasn't lost his accent
Sexy Northerner

How does he do it?
How does he do it?
Acts like he's got nothing to prove
Sexy Northerner

It's not all football and fags
No it's not all football and fags

Don't you dare imply
that it's grim up North
He went last weekend
Sexy Northerner

In the latest clothes
Wears a posh cologne
Got a lot of pride
Sexy Northerner

Says he wants a job
Something interesting
like a graphic designer
Sexy Northerner

How does he do it?
How does he do it?
Acts like he's got nothing to prove
Sexy Northerner

It's not all football and fags
No it's not all football and fags
