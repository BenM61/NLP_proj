What the point of trying to meet you in the middle
You've got your point of view
There's nothing I can I do
Can't change you mind
Can't leave it all behind
Your living in the past
We talk and talk
This goes on for hours
About how my life should be
Why is it over me
Don't want to fight 
Don't want to waste my time
Baby this can't last
I'm moving on- moving on
Can I go now 
Say what you have to say
Happy you got you way
There's nothing to discuss
Can I go
You've given your point of view
Said what you wanted to 
What the point in this
Can I go now 
Say what you have to say
Happy you got you way
What's there to discuss
Can I go now(now now now)
Can I go now(now now now)

What the point of trying to reach a compromise
When you're the judging jury
What's the story
I can't make you see that I'm not always wrong
I can't make it right
Its time to move on 
I'm moving on ( yeah yeah yeah)
Can I go now 
Say what you have to say
Happy you got you way
There's nothing to discuss
Can I go
You've given your point of view
Said what you wanted to 
What the point in this
Can I go now 
Say what you have to say
Happy you got you way
What's there to discuss
Can I go now(now now now)
Can I go now(now now now)
 lets call it day
Ill pack my bags be on my way
Sure don't need to stay
Where I'm not welcome anyway
But now that's alright 
And that's ok

There's nothing left to do
Maybe I not for you 
So why don't you let it go
What the point of all this talk talk talk talk
We could go day and night
It still wouldn't make it right!
				
Can I go now 
Say what you have to say
Happy you got you way
There's nothing to discuss
Can I go
You've given your point of view
Said what you wanted to 
What the point in this
Can I go now 
Say what you have to say
Happy you got you way
What's there to discuss
Can I go now(now now now)
Can I go now(now now now)

Adlibing...
Can I go now
