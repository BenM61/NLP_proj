I can't imagine life
Without you by my side
This is love babe that I'm feeling
And I'm hoping that you're feeling the same way
Things tend to slip my mind
Like how you like to wine and dine babe
With romantic lights you mean a lot to me
In so many ways

Lately
Have I told you I love you
Lately
Have I told you you still mean the world to me
Lately
Have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want babe

Don't think twice of our love
I say these things because
I love you but it's hard to explain
And I'm hoping that you're feeling the same
You know that all of my
Feelings are inside
And verbally I tend to forget
How much I L-O-V-E U really means

Lately
Have I told you I love you
Lately
Have I told you you still mean the world to me
Lately
Have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want babe

Try your hardest to deal
Yes I forgot but you know how I feel
Things slip my mind baby that's a fact
Tell me you love me
And I'll tell you back baby

Lately
Have I told you I love you
Lately
Have I told you you still mean the world to me
Lately
Have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want babe
