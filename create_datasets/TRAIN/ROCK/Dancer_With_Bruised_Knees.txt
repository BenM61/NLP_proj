When I first knew her she was a dancer
She'd leap (confidently)
Knowing that should she fall
It would be into the arms of her partner
She never failed to get a curtain call
For years we had been one with the stars
A Pas de Deux of reknown
I'd leap and he'd catch me on the fly
And gently he'd put me down
The heights that I reached were dangerous
And I saw my partner strain
And felt when I had landed
His strength was on the wane
Back before my knees were blue
Backs broke bending in a step for two
For years we had been one with the stars
A Pas de Deux of reknown
I'd leap and he'd catch me on the fly
But once I came crashing down
Now I'm a weaver
Wall-hangings if you please
In everyone I feature
A dancer with bruised knees
Doop do...
