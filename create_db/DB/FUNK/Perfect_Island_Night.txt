Enchanted by the summer sky
And the moonlight
Does a mating dance of love
There in your eyes
The ocean sings it's summer song
In that moment
The touching feels so right
It can't be wrong, my darlin'
To enjoy some tropic bliss
Here in my arms, my darlin'
There's a wind-swept island kiss
To get it on, my darlin'
'Cause tonight was made for two
Becoming one
The passion has begun

See the waves, how they go
In the rhythm, it's as slow
It can feel (it can feel) the passion
The passion of a perfect island night

It's the same with me and you (feeling the same)
Sharing love is all we can do
'Cause we feel (we can feel) the passion
The passion of a perfect island night

Come quench the thirst that I call you
As the breezes
Pull the fire in our hearts
We can't subdue
Come let's fulfill love's fantasy
Seize the moment
'Cause there's nowhere else on Earth
I'd rather be, my darlin'
Than enjoying all of you
In ecstasy, my baby
It's as if our spirit knew that
This would be, my darlin'
The beginning of the rest of
Destiny
The best is yet to be, oh please

See the waves, how they go
In the rhythm, it's as slow
It can feel (it can feel) the passion
The passion of a perfect island night

It's the same with me and you (ooh, it's the same)
Sharing love is all we can do
'Cause we feel (we can feel) the passion
The passion of a perfect island night

On and on and so much longer
As the ocean grows stronger
Our hearts will beat
In perfect harmony

Oh, babe

See the waves, how they go
In the rhythm, it's as slow
It can feel the passion
The passion of a perfect island night

It's the same with me and you (feeling the same)
Sharing love is all we can do
'Cause we feel (we can feel) the passion
The passion of a perfect island night

See the waves, how they go
In the rhythm, it's as slow
It can feel the passion (oh, come on babe)
The passion of a perfect island night
