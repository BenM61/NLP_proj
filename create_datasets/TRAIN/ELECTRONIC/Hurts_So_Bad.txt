You're an obsession now,
Night after night I think of you,
A little mysterious, 
You're hot like the sun but you're cool like the moon

It would be easier, 
If I could only read your mind, 
Not knowing is killing me, 
Are you trying to be cruel 'coz I'm dying inside

Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cause you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
When it hurts so bad

Are you insatiable, 
How many hearts are on your list, 
When will you let me know, 
Am I touching your soul when I'm kissing your lips

Do you believe in love, 
Or are you making other plans, 
You're making it hard for me,
I know what I'm feeling but I don't understand

Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cause you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
When it hurts so bad
Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cause you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
When it hurts so bad

What can I do to make you understand, 
You've got to know you're my one and only, 
You're all I need baby, all that I have, 
How can it hurt so bad

Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cause you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
When it hurts so bad
Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cause you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
When it hurts so bad...
