Woman, you're an avalanche of love
Falling over me means I can't get you off
Woman you're an avalanche of love
Loving you means I'm under, you're above

We're getting loose tonight
It's gonna be alright
We'll paint the town red
Until the night is dead

We're gonna have a ball
We dance and rock and roll
We shake it all night long
Until we can't go on

But you'll fall in love, I mean
When I'm somewhere wasting on the floor
Woman you're an avalanche of soul
Rolling over me you shine out heat instead of cold

Woman you're an avalanche of soul
Lovin' you the way I do is lovin' hot coal
We're getting loose tonight
It's gonna be alright

We'll paint the town red
Until the night is dead
We're gonna have a ball
We dance and rock and roll

We shake it all night long
Until we can't go on
And you'll fall in love, I mean
When I'm somewhere wasting on the floor
