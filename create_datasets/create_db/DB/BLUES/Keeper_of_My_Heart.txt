If again you were just mine
The sun for me would always shine
Though fate had ruled that we must part
You're still the keeper of my heart.

Each night now I'm upon my knee
I pray that you remember me
When we are many miles apart
You'll be the keeper of my heart.

All alone without your love
I ask our keeper up above
To guide your footsteps back to me
Without you life's no good you see.

The treasured memories that burn
I keep and I will always yearn
All the love that once was mine
Of the keeper of my heart
