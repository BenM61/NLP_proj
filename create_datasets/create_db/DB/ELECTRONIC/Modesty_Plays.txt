Modesty Plays Modesty Plays
Modesty Plays Modesty Plays
She may like caviar and cocktails
She may like symphonies and sun
But underneath the gown and high heels
She's like a fully loaded gun
Modesty Plays Modesty Plays
Modesty Plays Modesty Plays
The world is running out of heroes
The world is running out of time
Where are those martial arts maneuvers
We're getting massacred by crime
Well listen buddy don't you worry
She may not look like Genghis Khan
And she may talk about her manicure
But she can sure get things done
Modesty Plays Modesty Plays
Modesty Plays Modesty Plays
Don't underestimate the lady
She may seem cultured and demure
But there's another side, and careful
She'll hit you like a 2x4
The world is running out of heroes
And everybody's out on bail
As long as Modesty is on our side
Good will surely prevail
