One a-these mornings
Soon one morning
I'm gonna lay down my cross
Get me a crown
Soon one evening
Late in the evening
Late in the evening 
I'm going home to live on high
Soon as my feet strike Zion
Lay down my heavy burdens
Put on my robe in Glory
Goin' home, one day, and tell my story
I been climbing over hills and mountains 
Gonna drink from the Christian fountain
You know, all a-God's sons and daughters, that morning
Will be drinking that ol' healing water
And we gonna live on forever
We gonna live on forever
We gonna live on, up in Glory after while
I'm goin' out sight-seeing in Buelah
March all around God's alter
Gonna walk and never get tired
Gonna fly, Lord, and never falter
I'm gonna move up a little higher
Gonna meet ol' man Daniel
I'm gonna move up a little higher
Gonna meet the Hebrew Children
I'm gonna move up a little higher
Gonna meet Paul and Silas
I'm gonna move on up a little higher
Gonna meet my friends and kindred
I'm gonna move on up a little higher
Gonna meet my loving mother
I'm gonna move on up a little higher
Gonna meet that Lily of the Valley
I'm gonna feast with the Rose of Sharon
It will be always howdy howdy
It will be always howdy howdy
It will be always howdy howdy
And never goodbye
Oh, will you be there early one morning
Will you be there, somewhere 'round God's alter
Will you be there, oh, when the angels shall call God's roll
God knows I'll be waiting, hmmm
Yes, I'll be watching somewhere 'round God's alter
Well, I'll be waiting, oh, at the beautiful, yes, golden gates
Well, well, soon as my feet strike Zion
Gonna lay down my heavy burdens
Gonna put on my robe in Glory
I'm going home, one day, tell my story
I been climbing over hills and mountains
I'm gonna drink from the Christian fountain
You know all God, God's sons and daughters that mornin'
Will drink that ol' healing water
Meet me there, early one morningj
Meet me there, somewhere 'round the alter
Meet me there, oh, when the angels shall call God's roll
