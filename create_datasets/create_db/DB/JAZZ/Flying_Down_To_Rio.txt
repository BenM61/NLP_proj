My Rio, Rio by the sea o, Flying down to Rio
Where there's rhythm and rhyme.
Hey Feller, Twirl that old propeller,
Got to get to Rio and we've got to make time.
You'll love it soaring up above it,
Looking down on Rio from a heaven of blue.
Send a radio to Rio de Janeiro
With a big hallo just so they'll know
And stand by there, we'll fly there.
Hey Rio, everything will be okay
We're singing and winging our way to you.
