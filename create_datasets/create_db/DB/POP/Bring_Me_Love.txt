I don't need my stocking filled with toys
And I don't need no gifts to bring me joy
Baby, I-I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

Baby I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

I don't wanna light this tree alone (no, no, I can't)
I can't sing Christmas songs if you're not home
No, I-I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

It's been so cold since you've been gone (been gone)
This winter seems so long (so long)
And I can't get in no spirit
It feels so wrong

Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year

Hope he's bringing me love (love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

Hope he's bringing me love (love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

'Cause I deserve you here (deserve you here)
Bring me love love this Christmas (love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year
