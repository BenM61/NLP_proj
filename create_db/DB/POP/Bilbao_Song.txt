That old Bilbao moon (doo doo)
I won't forget it soon (doo doo)
That old Bilbao moon (doo doo)
Just like a big balloon (doo doo)
That old Bilbao moon (doo doo)
Would rise above the dune (doo doo)
While Tony's Beach Saloon (doo doo)
Rocked with an old-time tune (doo doo)

We'd sing a song the whole night long and I can still recall
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)
Those were the greatest nights of them all
No paint was on the door (no paint was on the door)
The grass grew through the floor (the grass grew through the floor)
Of Tony's Two By Four (of Tony's Two By Four)
On the Bilbao shore (on the Bilbao shore)
But there were friends galore (howdy do, howdy do)
And there was beer to pour (chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug)
And moonlight on the shore (and the moon shines above)
That old Bilbao shore (on the shore, not the floor)
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)
Those were the greatest (the greatest) nights of them all
That old Bilbao moon
I won't forget it soon
That old Bilbao moon
Just like a big balloon
That old Bilbao moon 
Would rise above the dune
While Tony's Beach Saloon 
Rocked with an old-time tune
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)
Those were the greatest (the greatest) nights of them all
