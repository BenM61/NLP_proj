Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
and let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away
looking for a brand new start
but little does she know that when she left that day
along with her she took my heart

Rain, please, tell me now, does that seem fair
for her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

The only girl I care about has gone away
looking for a brand new start
but little does she know that when she left that day
along with her she took my heart

Falling rain
Cry in vain

But, rain, won't you tell her that I love her so
Please, ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart, and let the love we knew start to grow

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
and let me be alone again

Falling rain
Falling rain
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Falling rain
Listen to the rhythm of the
Listen to the rhythm of the
Cry in vain
Listen to the rhythm of the

The only girl I care about has gone away
looking for a brand new start
but little does she know that when she left that day
along with her she took my heart
