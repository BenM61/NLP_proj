Maybe I don't deserve your affection
But I got it bad, so bad for you
So baby I need some indication
That when I give my heart
You'll give me your heart too

[Chorus]
Could you learn to love someone
Could you teach your heart to love
I wonder if you could do it
Cause I know that I could sure love you
Could you learn to love someone
Could you teach your heart to love
Tell me that you could do it
Cause I want to give my love to you

Now what can I do to make an impression
I'll die 1000 times for you, baby
What more you want then dedication
Why can't you give your love to me
The way I give my love to you

In a world where people
Are longing for true love
How could anyone not know what they want
For once in your life
Don't be afraid to love
Don't run away from love
Don't be afraid to love

[Chorus: x3]
