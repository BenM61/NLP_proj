It's good to be wise
When you're young
Cos' you can only be young
But for once
Enjoy yourself
And have lots of fun
So gonna live, my friend
And it will never done

Enjoy yourself
It's later than you think
Enjoy yourself
Why you're still in the pink
The years go by
As quickly
Enjoy yourself
It's later than you think

Get wisdom, get knowledge
And understanding
Those three were given free
By the maker
Go to school
Learn the rules
Don't be no faker
It's not wise, for you
To be a foot stool

So enjoy yourself
It's later than you think
Enjoy yourself
Why you're still in the
The years go by
As quickly
Enjoy yourself
It's later than you think
