Blues man, play your hand
Do it right, come on strong
Don't stay too long

Runnin' wild, singin' child
Powered sound, push you hard
Lookin' to get down

Such a waste, left such a space
I shared your dreams, I felt your heart
Did I hear you scream?

Runnin' scared, you run everywhere
Could not choose where to hide
Singin' the blues

Played it mad, played it sad
Blues is pain, the way men cry
Like tired rain

Blues is mean, the real thing
Three good men, I knew well
Never see again

Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
...
