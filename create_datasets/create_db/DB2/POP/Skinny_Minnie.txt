My skinny Minnie is a crazy chick,
Six foot high and one foot thick,
Well, do I love her,
Does a boy love pie?
Well, she is the apple of my eye.

Skinny Minnie, she ain't skinny,
She's tall, that's all.

Well, though her shadow,
Doesn't take much ground,
Well, what there is really gets around,
Well, what there ain't,
That's what she be,
And even that's way too much for me.

Well, slightly slimmer,
Than a fishing pole,
She's one half rock,
And the other half roll,
Well, dig that chick from either side,
And man, you'll yell,
Where did she hide?

Skinny Minnie, she ain't skinny,
She's tall, that's all.
