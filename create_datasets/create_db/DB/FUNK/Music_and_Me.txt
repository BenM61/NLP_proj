Hey OG, could you tell how to find some good weed
I need it homie oh so fast
That last bag was the best weed I've ever had
Bass so deep, I can't even seem to feel my feet
Girls so fine, I can't help it got to make this one mine
I hit em with my, gangsta leans
They can't separate my music from me

Music and me (3x)
Music, my music and me

Time does change, but the music it remains the same
I hit em with the music from the slave
Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave
I don't want to think I don't know
They thought me how to reach deep down and touch the soul
Without my music, where would I be
You thought me how to cry and still remain a G
You keep a lot of soldiers at ease
And together the next next level proceed

Music and me (3x)
Music, my music and me

Music and me, go together perfect harmony
Soft at mellow, oh so hearted to make your sweet kiss explode
Stay with me, and together we will live out this dream
My music and me

Music and me (4x)
My music and me
Music and me (4x)
My music and me
