Forever

Forever may not be long enough for my love
I have a will but I'm lost inside your time
If you could, would you come with me to the other side?
Forever may not be long enough
Forever may not be long enough
Forever may not be long enough for this love
Forever! 
Forever! 
Forever! 

This world is never enough
And I'm not giving up
My faith in love is like blood
I spill it freely for some
My faith in love is like blood
It flows in everyone
Don't stop to look at the clock
Forever won't be long enough

Forever may not be long enough for you to know
Just how far I'd travel, just how far I would go
Open your heart and everything will be alright
Open your heart, baby, leave with me
Don't be afraid
Forever!

This world is never enough
And I'm not giving up
My faith in love is like blood
I spill it freely for some
My faith in love is like blood
It flows in everyone
Don't stop to look at the clock
Forever won't be long enough

Forver may not be long enough for our love
Forever! Forever! Forever!
Forever!

Forever may not be long enough (Forever)
Forever may not be long enough (Forever)
Forever may not be long enough (Forever)
Forever may not be long enough
For our love
