Baby, I've been waitin' for you
Don't run away now
You've got nothing to lose

Baby, I feel so alone
And I need someone
To call my own

'Cause my love just left me
And I need someone new
Who can tell me forever
In my eyes I own you

Baby, oh baby, oh baby
Come to me

Baby, I've been waiting on you
Don't run away now
You've got nothing to lose

Baby, I feel so alone
And I need someone
To call my own

'Cause my love just left me
And I need someone new
Who can tell me forever
In my eyes I own you

Baby, oh baby, ooh baby
Come to me
