'Cause I just got somethin' that I need to say

I mean sometimes when you just can't even sleep, you can't think
You just lose yourself, wrapped all up in it

You put that thang on me, that thang, baby

Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby mesmerized

Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby mesmerized

You got me mesmerized

Baby got me hypnotized
I think I'm in love with you
You got me so caught up
Baby, I'm spellbound

And I don't think I'm comin' down

Make me want to stomp my feet (My feet)
Make me feel real, real good (Real good)
When you put that thang on me

Boy you got me weak
Your love is so sweet

Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby mesmerized

You've got me mesmerized
Don't know just what to do, I'm hypnotized
