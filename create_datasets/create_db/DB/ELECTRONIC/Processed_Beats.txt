I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide

I drop beats from this processed meat
For a conversation, a meditation and
I cut waves like some unborn sage
Just like terrorists on a day of rest singing

I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide

I break bones stealing mobile phones
And I'm cuttin' deals for these homeless meals
Making idle threats using Chinese burns
As you load my head with the Grateful Dead singing

I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide
I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide
