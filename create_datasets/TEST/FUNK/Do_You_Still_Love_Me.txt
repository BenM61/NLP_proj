Take a minute to re-evaluate
All of the things you said was special
Now I am just a little on edge
About the way that you
Been treating me Lately
After all we've been through
Do you still love me like you use to
I want to know

Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Uh ooh
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Uh ooh

Take one minute
To open up your eyes
And see how I'm feeling.
Now I don't want to complain
But some things just ain't the same
With the way you hold me

You know all my love is true to you
But do you still love me like you use to?
I've gotta know

Do you still love me
Do you still love
Uh ooh
Do you still love me
Do you still love
Uh ooh

Do you still  
Do you still

After all we've been through
Do you still
Do you still love me like you use to

Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Uh ooh
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Uh ooh

Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Uh ooh

Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Uh ooh
