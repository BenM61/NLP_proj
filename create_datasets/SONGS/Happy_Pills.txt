Sometimes you wake to see yourself
Take happier pills to keep you well
And sometimes you talk to hear yourself
Screaming out loud

Never ever heard a word you said
Can't you see yourself? 
Can't you understand? 
There's more truth in the way that you lie

But you take a stab at all that's surrounding your mind
Can't you sweep this shit to the side
It's so fucking nice to have you here
To turn our lives from what we fear

But sometimes you're worthless and weak and alone
Will you ever grow? 
Here I am I want to help you out
Can't you see yourself? 

Can't you understand? 
There's more truth in the way that you lie
So you take a stab at all that's surrounding your mind
Well you won't believe when this cloud lifts what you might find

You'll find it's all over and can't you see it's all over
This face that stares back at you
Stares back at you, from these happy pills
They won't keep you well tonight

I'll be here to watch you shudder
I'll be the one that holds you under
Every time you try to shift it
Every time your stitch is slipping

Slipping through time
There's more truth in the way that you lie
So you take a stab at all that's surrounding your mind
Well you won't believe when this cloud lifts what you might find

Got it all over you now
Got it all over you now
Got it all over this
The face that stares back at you from these happy pills
They won't keep you well tonight
