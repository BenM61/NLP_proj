In this new world 
The world of today 
Now you might think 
That the world has changed 

But boy meets girl 
Same as before 
And they vow their love forever more 
In this world today. 

In this new world 
Of troubled times 
Just you look back 
And I'm sure you'll find 

Man fighting man 
For no cause at all 
And though it is wrong 
The fighting goes on 
In this world today. 

Why do you say 
We're in a different bag 
When all the things you did 
Were just as bad. 

In this new world 
Of suffering 
Love, peace of mind 
Should be our thing 

Let man join hands 
The old and the young 
And let every heart 
Now beat as one 
In this world today. 

Love, peace of mind should be our thing 
Love, peace of mind should be our thing 
Love, peace of mind should be our thing.
