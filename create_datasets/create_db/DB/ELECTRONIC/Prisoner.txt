I got no regrets
And I remember the day that we met
There was no way that I could forget you
So I followed you home
And I waited 'til you were alone

And I crept
Into your room while you slept
I laid next to you and I knew
That I could never let you go

And I know this seems so wrong
But I'm just a lovesick criminal

You can arrest me, baby, I don't wanna leave
Lock me up, throw away the key
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep
I'm addicted to your love

I'll be your prisoner
I'll be your prisoner tonight
I, I, I, I'm under your spell
And I just can't get enough

You woke up to me
Starin' at you in your sleep
Like a deer in the headlights I couldn't see
Anything else but the way you breathe

And you screamed at the top of your lungs
You couldn't believe it
You thought you were dreamin'
I knew, I never wanted you to let me go

I know this seems so wrong
But I'm just a lovesick criminal

You can arrest me, baby, I don't wanna leave
Lock me up, throw away the key
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep
I'm addicted to your love

I'll be your prisoner
I'll be your prisoner tonight
I, I, I, I'm under your spell
And I just can't get enough

I'm prepared for all the consequences
Believe me, I have the worst intentions
I'm prepared for all the consequences
Believe me, believe me

I'm prepared for all the consequences
Believe me, I have the worst intentions
I'm prepared for all the consequences
Believe me, believe me

Never let you go

You can arrest me, baby, I don't wanna leave
Lock me up, throw away the key
I don't care if I'm in trouble deep
I'm addicted to your love

I'll be your prisoner
I'll be your prisoner tonight
I, I, I, I'm under your spell
And I just can't get enough

I'll be your prisoner tonight
I'll be your prisoner
I, I, I, I'm under your spell
And I just can't get enough
