Taking a ride to another climb
Knees in my back 'cause we're flying high
Did I give it all?
I guess I gave it all

Seeing the mountains through the fog
Watching a film with a talking dog
'Cause if I fall
Then I guess I fall

Hawaiian air 

Hawaiian air 

Hawaiian air 

Hawaiian air 

Leaving the world down beneath the clouds
Hawaiian notes, don't need no pounds
Did I give them all?
Oh, did I give them all?

Ache in my leg from a broken seat
Skipping the meal for a G&T
'Cause if I fall
I'm beggin' not to fall

Hawaiian air 

Hawaiian air 

Hawaiian air 

Hawaiian air 

Touchin' down
Hit the ground
I'm breathin' new air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As we land, you pinch my hand
I'm still here
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

Up in the sky on a lunar bound
Steel guitar and the melly sound
Did I give it all?
I guess I gave it all

Feeling the shapes keeps me reticent
Stuck in my seat from the turbulence
And if I fall
Then I fall

Breaking open skies of green earths
Deserts,
In our eyes we're falling
Our hearts in our ?

Touchin' down
Hit the ground
I'm breatin' new air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As we land, you pinch my hand
I'm still here
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As the wheels, hit the ground
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

As the heat fills my lungs
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
Gonna take this all in
Gonna take this all in

Hawaiian air
