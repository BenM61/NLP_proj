She swims across the leather sea
Her skin reflects so beautifully
She looks to me and turns away
So this is the last real day

Your god is guilty, your god is nothing
You'll see things he'll never see
Your god was nowhere, a false confession
And never there to comfort me

Your god is nowhere, your god is nothing
You'll see things he'll never see
Your god is only a fallen idol
A ghost of sick humanity

There is a hate that burns within
Desolate places that I've been
Come back to me, I need to say
I'd breathe for you for just one day

Your god is guilty, your god is nothing
You'll see things he'll never see
Your god was nowhere, a false confession
And never there to comfort me

Your god is nowhere, your god is nothing
You'll see things he'll never see
Your god is only a fallen idol
A ghost of sick humanity
