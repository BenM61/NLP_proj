Floatin' I'm floatin' on down through the sky
Never had no ambition to learn how to fly
I'll be glad when it's over and ready to land
With this bag full of money I've got in my hand

Oh I grew up believin' in Jesse and Frank
Cause I never had nothin' or no one to thank
And I came pretty close to unloadin' a bank
But I was saved by my draft board who made me a yank

Floatin' I'm floatin'...

And in the 101st they busted your hump
But they taught me a man isn't always a chump
In the course of Korea I learned how to jump
In the card game of life I was holdin' a trump

Floatin' I'm floatin'

If you can't get a job and they think you're insane
If the years of your youth have been washed down the drain
And you wake up some mornin' with nothin' but pain
It was then I decided to grab me a plane

Floatin' I'm floatin'

With all of my trainin' it wasn't too tough
Now I'm through takin' orders and all of their guff
Gonna buy a Rolls Royce and some luxury stuff
Cause a veteran's pension ain't nearly enough

Floatin' I'm floatin'
