Most of all, I want your warm embrace
No one can take your place
I need you most of all

Most of all, I want your sweet caress
Truly, I must confess
I need you most of all

When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I'm awake
No one's there and that's why
I'm so blue

Most of all, the one thing that I, I miss
The way we used to kiss
I need you most of all

When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I'm awake
No one's there and that's why
I'm so blue

Most of all, the one thing that I, I miss
The way we used to kiss
I need you most of all
