There was a time 
Everybody was around 
And I was dancing with you 

We all went down 
To the party Friday night 
And had a drink there or two 

Oh what a hit 
Of a loving heartbeat 
That's electricity 

Majestic sound 
Round and round and round 
Glad you're next to me 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
Like a symphony 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
Like a melody 
Come see 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
Like a symphony 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
Like a melody 
Come see 

Time after time 
Everybody came around 
And I was dancing with you 

Don't know your name 
Making me ashamed 
To feel the way that I do 

The lights went out 
Couldn't be without 
It was a place to be 

I won't forget 
Greatest times ahead 
When I was dancing with you 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
We all want it now 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
We all want it now somehow 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
Like a symphony 

Feel my heartbeat 
Trembling to the beat 
Like a melody 
Come see 

Feel my heartbeat 
Feel my heartbeat 
Feel my heartbeat 
Now 

Feel my heartbeat 
Feel my heartbeat 
Feel my heartbeat 
Now somehow 

There was a time 
Everybody was around 
And I was dancing with you 

Don't know your name 
Making me ashamed 
To feel the way that I do 

The lights went out 
Couldn't be without 
It was a place to be 

I won't forget 
Greatest times ahead 
When I was dancing with you
