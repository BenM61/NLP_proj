You've got covert action
Prejudice to extremes
You've got primitive cunning
And high-tech means
You've got eyes everywhere, but
People see through you

You've got good manipulators
Got your store of dupes
You've got the idiot clamour
Of your lobby groups
You like to play on fears, but
People see through you

You've got instant communication
Instant data tabulation
You got the forces of occupation
But you don't get capitulation, 'cause
People see through you
People see through you
People see through you
People see through you

You've got the sounding brass
You've got the triumph of the will
You do what you want to
And we pay the bills
You hype the need for sacrifice, but
People see through you

You've got anti-matter language contrived to conceal
You've been lying so long you don't know what's real
You're a figment of your own imagination
And people see through you

You've got lip-service tributaries
You've got death-fetish mercenaries
You hold the tickets to the cemetaries
You're big and bad and scary
But people see through you
People see through you
People see through you
People see through you
