Mighty men have come and gone 
But the pride lingers on 
Heritage will claim every man 
With desire to make a stand 
Some say pride's for the strong 
What's the use, holding on 
We say pride's everyone who 
Wants to come, touch the sun 

While you pout, is your world 
In doubt, it's all about 
Life won't let you out of the scheme 
Just believe in your dreams 
Pressing on self esteem 

Now participate, 
Time for love 
To motivate 
Energies to say, 
Brighter you, 
Brighter day 

Set your mind in view, 
Of the real man in you 
Time to check it out 
Pride relieves all your doubt
