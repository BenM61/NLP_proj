Too young to go steady
Too young, I hear her say
She says we're not ready
But then why am I feeling this way?

Too young, so she tells me
She says we'll have to wait
Why wait till it may be too late?

Can she realize she drives me wild?
Is she made of stone?
Must she always act just like a child?
Won't she ever own up, we're grown up?

Someday she'll be sorry
Someday just wait and see
She'll wish she'd gone steady with me

Can she realize she drives me wild?
Is she made of stone?
Must she always act just like a child?
Won't she ever own up, we're grown up?

Someday she'll be sorry
Someday just wait and see
She'll wish she'd gone steady with me
