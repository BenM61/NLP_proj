Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go

They're forming in a straight line
They're goin through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkreig Bop

They're piling in the backseat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back seat
Blitzkreig Bop

Hey ho, let's go
Shoot em' in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go

They're forming in a straight line
They're goin through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkreig Bop

They're piling in the backseat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back seat
Blitzkreig Bop

Hey ho, let's go
Shoot em' in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go

They're forming in a straight line
They're goin through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
Blitzkreig Bop

They're piling in the backseat
They're generation steam heat
Pulsating to the back seat
Blitzkreig Bop

Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
