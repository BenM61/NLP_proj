I know he'll never be forgotten  
Long as there's still sound 
 He was a king uncrowned
  Not all kings are given crowns
  I know I'll always remember 
 Always
  The warmth
  All his warmth 
 Of his sound
  Was in his sound
  Lingers so long I'm sure he's still around
  Still around... Those who've heard
  For all those who've heard
  Truly, they repeat him yet
  Even yet
  So those who hear won't forget
  And the ever-present sound
  That abounds in his praise
  Echos throughout the universe
  For endless spans of time uncountable
  By days 
 The pretty little piquant passages
  Clifford played
  They are with us now  
And I'm positive that they will endure
  Should time and sacred circumstance allow 
 Yes, they'll live forever
  Oh, yes, I remember Clifford now
  Seems I always feel that Clifford's spirit's  
Hangin' roun' me somehow 
 We remember
  Each and every single day
  I hear his lovely trumpet tone
  Such exquisite singing 
 In every horn that seems to have a sound
  That's all its own
  So somebody tell me how
  How can we ever day for certain 
 Someone that played 
 Like Clifford Brown could play
  Could really be said to have gone away
  I only know that I hear him now
  And I believe that I always will
  You've got to believe
  I remember Clifford still, yes I hear him still
  I know he'll never be forgotten
  He was a king uncrowned
  I know I'll always remember  '

  I'll always remember Clifford Brown
