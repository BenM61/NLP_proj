[Chorus x2]
I specialize in love
I'll make you feel like new
I specialize in love
Let me work on you

If your broken heart is bending,
You can come to me
If you want a happy ending,
You can come to me
If your lover fails and gone nowhere,
You can come to me, you'll see how much I care

[Chorus]

If you think you've been mistreated,
You can come to me
If you feel you're being cheated,
You can come to me
If you've been hurt by love before,
Step inside, baby, and close the door

[Chorus x2]

I can mend a broken heart
I can fix it one, two, three
I can take away the pain
You can count on me
I can mend a broken heart
I can fix it just like new
I can take away the pain, yeah,
Give you love that's true
Give you love that's true
Give you love that's true
Give you love that's true

[Chorus]
