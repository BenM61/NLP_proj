I want my baby back
Hey, give her to me
Want my baby back now
Everybody must see
She went away and left me
In misery.

I want my baby back
Hey, give her to me
Gimme my baby back now
Don't make a scene with me
Well she went away and strew me free
She run, I can't.

When she went away and pass on my loot
And run on my train, it happened to be her
I see the dime I saw the look in her eye
(I wanna love you baby)
I've come to take my bride!

I want my baby back
Hey, give her to me
Want my baby back now
Everybody must see
How, she went away and left me
In misery.

Want my baby back!

When she went away and pass on my loot
And run on my train, it happened to be
I see the dime and the look in her eye
(I wanna love you baby)
I've come to take my bride!

I want my baby back
Hey, give her to me
Want my baby back now
Everybody must see
How, she went away and left me
Left me in misery.

I want my baby back, Oh won't you give her to me
I want my baby back now, I-I say I want my baby back now
Now give her to me, c'mon now, I want my baby back now
Won't you give her to me.

I want my baby back.

She went away and left me, left me in misery!
