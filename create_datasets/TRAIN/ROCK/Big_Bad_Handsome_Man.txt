The man is tall, mad, mean, and good-lookin'
And he's got me his eye
When he looks at me, I go weak at the knees
He's got me going like no other guy

Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man
He's got me in the palm of his hand
He's the Devil Divine, I'm so glad that he's mine
Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man

Oh, the music he plays, the way he moves me and sways
Rocks me to the core
When he sings in my ear, he makes me shiver and leer
Leaves me wanting more and more

Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man
He's got me in the palm of his hand
He's the Devil Divine, I'm so glad that he's mine
'Cause he's my big, bad, handsome man

With his rugged good looks yeah he's got me hooked
Got me where he wants me to be
With his arms so wide, he pulls me in by his side
He's the kind of guy that does it for me

Cause he's my big bad handsome man yeah
He's got me in the palm of his hand
He's the devil divine, I'm so glad that he's mine
Cause he's my big bad handsome man
Ooh

My big bad handsome man, yea
He's got me in the palm of his hand
He's the devil divine, I'm so glad that he's mine
Cause he's my big bad
I'm so glad that he's my handsome man
Hm
