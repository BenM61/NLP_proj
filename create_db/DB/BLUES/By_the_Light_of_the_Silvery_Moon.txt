Place park, scene dark, silvery moon is shining through the trees;
Cast two, me, you, sound of kisses floating on the breeze.
Act one, begun. Dialogue, "Where would you like to spoon?"
My cue, with you, underneath the silvery moon.

By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune,
Honeymoon keep a shining in June,
Your silvery beams will bring love dreams, we'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon.

Act two, scene new, roses blooming all around the place;
Cast three, you, me, Preacher with a solemn looking face.
Choir sings, bell rings,Preacher: "You are wed for evermore."
Act two, all through, every night the same encore.

By the light, (By the light, By the light),
Of the silvery moon, (The silvery moon).
I want to spoon, (Want to spoon, Want to spoon)
To my honey I'll croon love's tune.
Honeymoon, (Honeymoon, Honeymoon),
Keep a shining in June. (Keep a shining in June)
Your silvery beams will bring love dreams,
We'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon.

Your silvery beams will bring love dreams,
We'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon. (The silvery moon).
By the light that's silvery!
