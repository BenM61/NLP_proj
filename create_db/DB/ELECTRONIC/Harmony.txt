Harmony, harmony
You and me, that's harmony
Harmony, harmony
You and me, we're in harmony

There I was in all those shades of blue
Wondering if and when I'd make it through
I only knew the cat and dog in my life
You came along just in time
Threw me your lifeline

Harmony, harmony
You and me, that's harmony
Harmony, harmony
You and me, we're in harmony

Living with you helps me live with myself
I found a peace of mind, a brand new wealth
I never knew that sharing just meant caring
I didn't know a lot of things
Until you walked on in

Harmony, harmony
You and me, that's harmony
Harmony, harmony
You and me, we're in harmony
