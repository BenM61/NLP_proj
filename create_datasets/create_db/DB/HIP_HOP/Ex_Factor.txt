Why yo, why yo.. uhh 
Why yo, why yo.. uhh 
Why why yo, yo why yo.. 
Why why yo,

Why yo.. 
Uhh why yo.. 
Uh uh.. 
Why why yo.. 

It could all be simple but you'd rather make it hard 
Loving you is like a battle we both end up scarred 
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity 
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will 
Is this just a silly game that forces you to act this way 
Forces you to scream my name, then pretend, that you can't stay 
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity 
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will 

No matter how I think we grow 
You always seem to let me know 
It ain't workin, it ain't workin, uhh 
And when I try to walk away 
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay 
This is crazy, this is crazy.. 

I keep letting you back in, how can I explain myself? 
As crazy as this thing has been, I just can't be with no one else 
I know what we've got to do, you let go I'll let go too 
No one's hurt me more than you and no one ever will 

Yo, why-yo, yo yo 
I'm here now, not just because it's my year now 
I'm clear now, only feelin cats that's sincere now 
Heart of lioness, scientist, street Zionist 
Don't twist it, it's consistantly consistent 
If you missed it, this train is bound for glory 
End of story, my whole repoitory is ? 40 
They bomb for me 
Thinkin they can mess with your plan, but I'ma play lamb 
Knowin that the Kingdom's at hand, and showin those who want it 
You gon' bring em the land, descendants of Ham 
Not concerned with the platinum status 
Cause every joint I threw, I would do for gratis 
I'm on the train with my Pips like I'm lil Gladys 
Or in the Range throwin chips to the kids in Addis (Ethiopia) 
Abbaba, two kids and and a baby father 
Hot to lava, we Don Dadda, Don Dadda 

No matter how I think we grow 
You always seem to let me know 
It ain't workin, it ain't workin 
And when I try to walk away 
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay 
This is crazy, this is crazy.. 

Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me 
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me 
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me! 
Give to me, give to me.. 

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me 
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me 
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me! 
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me? 

Oh no, why won't you live for me? 
Why, ha, won't you live, for me, for me, for meeee 

Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me 
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me 
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me! 
Give to me 

Give to me 
It could all be simple, but you'd rather make it hard
Loving you, loving you, is like a battle
Hmm.
Give to me care for me
Give to me care for me
Care for me
