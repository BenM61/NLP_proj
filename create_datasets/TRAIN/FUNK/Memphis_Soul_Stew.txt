Today's special is Memphis Soul Stew
We sell so much of this, people wonder what we put in it
We gonna tell you right now
Give me about a half a teacup of bass

Now I need a pound of fatback drums

Now give me four tablespoons of boiling Memphis guitars
This goin' taste alright

Now just a little pinch of organ

Now give me a half a pint of horn

Place on the burner and bring to a boil
That's it, that's it, that's it right there.
Now beat, well.
