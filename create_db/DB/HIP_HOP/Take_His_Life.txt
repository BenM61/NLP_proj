What...what...yo...
(Take his life) all these niggaz wanna do is talk
(Nigga take his life) f*ck around and run into some real niggaz
(Take his life) don't these niggaz know it's not a game
(Nigga take his life) don't make me put this bullet in your frame

(Take his life) all these niggaz wanna do is talk
(Nigga take his life) f*ck around and run into some real niggaz
(Take his life) don't these niggaz know it's not a game
(Nigga take his life) don't make me put this bullet in your frame

We Detroit niggaz
The illest breed of niggaz to breathe
Detroit niggaz Kill on the street
Kill an MC
Kill on the beat
Kill on the creep
Kill in my sleep
Kill with my peeps
Kill a nigga
Ha! kill with my heat
Got them not moving their lips like ventriloquists
Issue the hit empty the clip until his ten becomes six
Trampoline you off your feet in the form of flips
Fill him with lead got him writing his name with his dick
I got niggaz like it's a walk to school worth my goods
I got niggaz pumping for blood in the heart of your hood
The fact remains you're better off praising our name
Beef with us that'd cost about your life in change
F*ck that all why'all strange niggaz to me
F*ck that my niggaz'll hang niggaz for me
You living or dying? Nigga you know I'm gripping the iron
For the drama your man is a bitch and I'm itching to try him

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I promise to live on the side of the tracks
Where witnesses is frequently trading shoes for ? tags
We want war so we coming to get it in blood
And we ain't leaving without something to put in the mud
Pleading for your life with more one-liners than rhyme fights
Backfire on niggaz who don't handle
