Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
Everything is made from dreams
Time is made from honey slow and sweet
Only the fools know what it means

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I can't resist

I just know that she is made of smoke
But I've lost my way
She knows that I am broke
But that I must play

Temptation
Temptation, yeah
Temptation
I can't resist

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I just can't resist

Dutch pink and Italian blue
She is there and waiting for you
My will has disappeared
My confusion is oh-so clear

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I can't resist

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I can't resist

Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
Everything is made from dreams
Time is made from honey slow and sweet
Only the fools know what it means

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
