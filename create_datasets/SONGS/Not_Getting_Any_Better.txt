It's not getting any better
I forgot what it feels like without you on my mind
All my friends, all my friends, all my friends say
I should give it up
I know it's never easy when nothing ever was

No I can't get by without your love
I know it's never easy because 
I'm awake every night
And you're cutting through my head just like a knife
And I'm awake every night
And you're cutting through my head just like a knife
Because I can't get by without your love

I forgot what it feels like without you on my mind
And all my friends, all my friends, all my friends say 
I should give it up
I know it's never easy when nothing ever was

No I can't get by without your love
I know it's never easy because 
I'm awake every night
And you're cutting through my head just like a knife
And I'm awake every night
And you're cutting through my head just like a knife

And I'm awake every night
And I watch you through your window
And you lay there with your sleepy eyes

You say it's getting easy 
It's not getting any better
