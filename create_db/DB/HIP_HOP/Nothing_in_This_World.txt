Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I can picture us in the living room
By the mantle piece
And you're tellin' me you're lovin' me
Put your hands on my thighs
While I'm starin' in yo brown eyes
And the expression on your face
Is tellin' me you want more than a taste
So tonight we're goin' all the way
We'll be lovin' 'til the break of day

[Chorus]
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you boy
I don't care what the others say now that I got you babe
No one can bring me joy like you girl
All the little things you do it's all about you boo

I can picture us runnin' in the rain
After a movie then we spark a flame
Oh I love it when you scream my name
Goin' 60 in a 30 lane
We pull over to the parkin' lot
In the park that's my favorite spot
Doing just about anything
We'll be goin' 'til the birds sing

[Chorus]

I think it's bout time that I make you mine
Oh what your saying to me boy come on break it down
To find another like you will be a lifetime
I think I see where you're going baby let it out let it
Out
Listen to me baby got something to say
Is it really what think don't take all day
Forever is what I want to give to you so what do you say
Baby I do

[Chorus: x2]
