Oh, oh, fly angel fly
Angel, angel, angel!
The one time I didn't know what to do
I had a problem with my attitude

'Cause I never had, never had
The young man blues, the blues before
Well I know it means none, none to you
Everyman's gotta walk in his own shoes

Ain't that hard, it sure is hard to see
Straight from the heart
I can't find nothing on my shopping list
I only keep hammerin' the nail I miss

I just cannot help, believin',
That heaven is a hard on
Well I know it don't mean a damn to you
The left hand guessin' what the right will do

Now ain't that, ain't that, 
The way it is, as a matter of fact
Straight from the heart
While I'm floating like a swan on a water bed

Drowning in a pond, in a pool of regret
I'm tryin' to remember not to forget
How you bring me down with your kiss of death
Angel, angel, angel, angel

I'm entertaining all the Gods for you
Buddha and Jesus and the other one too
Now ain't that, ain't that
Like apple juice, forbidden fruit

Moon jump, flyin' back to the sun
Cool burn visible for everyone
And the blood flows, don't you know
All through your body and back to your soul

Straight from the heart
While I'm floating like a swan on a water bed
Drownin' in a pond, in a pool of regret
I'm tryin' to remember not to forget

How you bring me down, with your kiss of death
Angel, angel, angel, angel
