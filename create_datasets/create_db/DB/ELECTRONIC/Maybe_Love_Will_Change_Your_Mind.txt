I'm beside myself 'cause I don't know and you won't tell.
Your distant world has somehow pulled me in.
It's so surreal, so out of time, with you it feels.
To give again, but you don't need a thing.
 
Maybe love will change your mind, maybe this time.
Maybe love will make it clear.
Oh, what words would keep you here?
Maybe love will reach your heart, thought I saw it in the dark.
Maybe love will change your mind, maybe this time.
 
A look, a touch just because I wanted them to mean so much.
You might not feel the same.
The day would end, but you'd go back to where you've been.
A kiss for luck, I wish you could have stayed.
 
Maybe love will change your mind, maybe this time.
Maybe love will make it clear.
Oh, what words would keep you here?
Maybe love will reach your heart, thought I saw it in the dark.
Maybe love will change your mind, maybe this time.
 
You want me to be there.
You take me somewhere.
You show me your lifeline, reveal your other side.
I would say but the words won't come.
I'd just come undone.
All I want to do is to be closer to you.
 
Maybe love will change your mind, maybe this time.
Maybe love will make it clear.
Oh, what words would keep you here?
Maybe love will reach your heart, thought I saw it in the dark.
