Not too pleased with what you're diggin'
I'm just busy livin' my life
Sources say but where ya gettin' it
Don't create the truth you like

It might sound strange to you
But what you think it don't mean nothing at all
Doesn't change who I am
It doesn't change who I love

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth

If you wrong would you admit it?
And take the heat up under the lights, yeah
Use your expert criticism
Then maybe you could get a life
Don't like seeing people happy
Is it jealousy or personal, yeah
'Cause I don't see why loving someone
Or what I do seem so radical to you

Still it might sound strange to you
But what you think it don't mean nothing at all
Doesn't change who I am (doesn't change)
It doesn't change who I love

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth

Once you know why you're here
It becomes crystal clear
To love someone is divine
That empty hole in your heart
It will tear you apart
Because hate will only divide (bless you)
(Bless you)

Hey hey hey hey
Nah nah nah nah nah
Hey
Nah nah
It's sad when you take such a beautiful thing
Blow it up and call it the news
It's not ok still I hope that one day
You'll find the great forever too
(L.U.T.F.A.)
Ooh
Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth, woah
Great forever, hey
Great forever, ooh
Tryin' to get to
The forever, hey
Great forever, hey
Great forever, ooh
Tryin' to get to
The forever
