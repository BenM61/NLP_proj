Wake up, little Susie, wake up 
Wake up, little Susie, wake up 

We both fell sound asleep 
Wake up, little Susie, and weep 
The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep 
Wake up, little Susie 
Wake up, little Susie 

Well, what are we gonna tell your Mama? 
What are we gonna tell your Pop? 
What are we gonna tell our friends when they say "Ooh la la"? 
Wake up, little Susie 
Wake up, little Susie 

Well, I told your Mama that you'd be in by ten 
Well, Susie baby, looks like we goofed again 
Wake up, little Susie 
Wake up, little Susie 
We gotta go home 

Wake up, little Susie, wake up 
Wake up, little Susie, wake up 

The movie wasn't so hot 
It didn't have much of a plot 
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot 
Wake up, little Susie 
Wake up, little Susie 

Well, what are we gonna tell your Mama? 
What are we gonna tell your Pop? 
What are we gonna tell our friends when they say "Ooh la la"? 
Wake up, little Susie 
Wake up, little Susie 
Wake up, little Susie
