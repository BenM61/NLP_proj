Nine of diamonds, nine of diamonds
Lord, that's a lucky card.
We'll celebrate it, when we've made it,
I'll jump all over your yard,
I'll jump all over your yard, I'll jump all over...
I don't know what hit me but I'm seeing stars.
This comic book life is like being on mars.
Thousands of warm hands are touching me.
All over, all over, I hope this will never be all over.
All over, all over, I hope this will never be all over.
The night queen fright wig street parade may fade.
When we laugh at the staues of gods we have made.
Oceans of love-waves are washing me
All over, all over, I hope this will never be all over.
All over, all over, I hope this will never be all over.
Nine of diamonds, nine of diamonds
Lord, that's a lucky card.
We'll celebrate it, when we've made it,
I'll jump all over your yard,
I'll jump all over your yard, I'll jump all over...
When you feel that your train of thought's been derailed
Let out your wild wishes from where they've been jailed
You feel the future embracing you
All over, all over, I hope this will never be all over.
All over, all over, I hope this will never be all over.
