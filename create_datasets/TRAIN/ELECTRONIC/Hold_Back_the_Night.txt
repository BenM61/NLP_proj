Well, well, it's all right, it's all right
Hold it, girl, squeeze it, girl, it's all right, shucks
Hold back the night; turn on the lights
Don't want to dream (dream about you, baby)
Come on, (hold back the night) hold it
(Turn on the lights; don't want to dream)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (dream about you, baby)
When you left, you took the sun right out of the sky
I'm wondering why you went away
Never told me, huh, told me why
And then the sun goes down, and the moon is clear
Scared to death 'cause your face appears
Come on
(Hold back the night) baby, (turn on the lights)
Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby
Come on, (hold back the night) hold it
(Turn on the lights) don't want to dream
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (dream about you, baby)
Loneliness is haunting me when I go to bed, honey
Like a character in a book; in a book that I read, huh
Now when the sun goes down, the moon is clear
Scared to death 'cause your face I've missed, you know
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, baby, it's alright
Hold it, girl, squeeze it, girl, it's all right, oh
Night time is the right time for loving you
Loving for loving you
Baby, baby, lady, baby
Why don't you just hold it, my love? 
Yeah, you know I need it, my love
Hold me, squeeze me, just love me, just squeeze me
It's alright talkin' about day or night
Talkin' about it's all right, oh yeah
Night time is the right time for loving you
Loving you, for loving you
Baby, baby, lady, baby
Bib-bib-bib-brrr-lib-idy-dib-bib bib-baby, it's all right
(Hold back the night; turn on the lights)
(Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby)
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, baby, it's alright
Hold it, girl, squeeze it, girl, it's all right, oh
