Lover you've gone from me and left behind
So many memories

Here's your old friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your old love letters
I can't read 'em anymore

Lover you've gone from me and left behind
So many memories

Here's that old Teddy Bear (come and get 'em)
That you won for me at the State Fair
Here's some old Valentine cards (come and get 'em)
Give them to your new sweetheart

Lover you've gone from me and left behind
So many memories
So many memories

Lover you've gone from me and left behind
So many memories
So many memories (so many memories)

Here's your old favourite record
I can't stand to hear it no more (no more)
Here's some old lingering love (come and get 'em)
It's in my heart and it's tearing it apart
Because of these memories
I never thought of anybody but you
So come on and get 'em
'Cause I found me somebody new
And I love him

So come on and get these memories 
(come and get 'em, since you've gone out of my life)
Come and get these memories, boy 
(come and get 'em, since you've gone out of my life)
Give them to your new love...
Give them to your new love...

So come on and get these memories
(Come and get 'em since you've gone out of my life)

Give them to your new love...
Give them to your new love...
