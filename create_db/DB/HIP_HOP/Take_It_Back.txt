In the middle of the night when I'm lonely
Thinking of it only how you used to hold me
Reminisce about the times when you loved
When you used to touch me
I wanna take it back in time
All of the little things, simple things, they remind me
Hidden deep inside of me, uh baby
All the sweet memories, all behind me, always seem to find me
So tell me can we take it back?
To you and me baby, how we used to be baby?
Can we take it back?
To you and me baby, sweet memories baby?
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Wasn't perfect all the time when a movie
Times you used me, it confused me
Then you threw me
But it's different now I swear I'm a new me
And I could be all that you need
Baby can we see?

All of the little things, simple things, they remind me
Hidden deep inside of me, uh baby
All the sweet memories, all behind me, always seem to find me
So tell me can we take it back?
To you and me baby, how we used to be baby?
Can we take it back?
To you and me baby, sweet memories baby?

We can take it back there, put me back there
I know you got lost still want to see that there
I know your ice box every time I be back here
We got a future and I know you see that clear
We saw crystal clear, no clouds up in it
We remember the storm but we never drown up in it
So we can slow it down this time instead of going 100 miles a minute,
I'm done with it

All of the little things, simple things, they remind me
Hidden deep inside of me, uh baby
All the sweet memories, all behind me, always seem to find me
So tell me can we take it back?
To you and me baby, how we used to be baby?
Can we take it back?
To you and me baby, sweet memories baby?
Can we take it back?
To you and me baby, how we used to be baby?
