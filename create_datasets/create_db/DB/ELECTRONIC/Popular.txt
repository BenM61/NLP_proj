I've got a plan to make it rich and famous,
Luck for me, for you it's a bitch you ain't in,
My plans are slowly changing,
Fame is so contagious,

I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I want to be pop-ular,
I don't want to keep my feet on the ground,
I want to be popular,

I must confess I've been a ve-ry bad boy,
Been sleeping around talk of the town,
My name is,
Hollywood will beckon,
Everyone will listen,

Play my Video,
Hear me on the Radio,
Dancing at the disco,
No-one ever says no,

I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I want to be pop-ular,
I don't want to keep my feet on the ground,
I want to be popular,

I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I want to be pop-ular,
I don't want to keep my feet on the ground,
I want to be popular,

My friends are all in Limousine's,
My friends are all Celebrities,

ha, ha, ha,
I just sold my soul,
Play my Video,
Hear me on the Radio,
Dancing at the disco,
No-one ever says no,

I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I want to be pop-ular,
I don't want to keep my feet on the ground,
I want to be popular,

I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I want to be pop-ular,
I don't want to keep my feet on the ground,
I want to be popular,

My friends are all Celebrities,
My friends are all in limousine's

Play my Video,
(I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,)
(I want to be pop-ular,)
Hear me on the Radio
(I don't want to keep my feet on the ground,)
(I want to be popular,)
Dancing at the disco,
(I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,)
(I want to be pop-ular)
No-one ever says no,
(I don't want to keep my feet on the ground,)
(I want to be popular)

Are you willing to sleep you way to the top?
Do you want to be pop-ular?
