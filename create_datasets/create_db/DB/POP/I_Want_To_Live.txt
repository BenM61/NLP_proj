When I look into your sad blue eyes, they whisper,
Love's been and gone...
It's the end of the line, we're wasting our time
I kiss you goodbye, now I can't believe I ever said that
I would die for you, your eyes do more than kill...
I want to live.

All's forgiven, so all's forgotten, I'm empty inside,
What I'm trying to say since you went away, I live a lie.
I drink all day I'm never sober just to ease the pain,
These lies do more than kill...
I want to live... I want to live...

Like a ghost in my head you keep haunting me
Every promise we made, every word you said
I can't live without you!
Baby baby, when lovin' we were hiding
When lying we were brave.
Baby baby, I can't live without you
All I need is you.
I want to live.
