Won't you hold me just a little closer
Tell me that you love me true
When you hold me just a little closer
This is what I want from you:

Just a little fond affection
That is all I'm thinking of
I have been in Heaven since the day I found you
It is really Heaven with my arms around you

Just a little fond affection
Cheers me when I'm feeling blue
Just a little love, a little affection,
Dear, from you.
