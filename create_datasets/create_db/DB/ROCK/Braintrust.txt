His embrace a fortress
Carries me, and places
A skeleton of trust
Right beneath us
Bone by bone
Rock by rock

If you ask yourself patiently
Who is it, who is it, who is it ?

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin' around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin' around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over

We all have been to the still place [???]
We all have learned the lightness
I carry my pain on my right
But I carry my joy on my left

If you ask yourself patiently
Who is it , who is it , who is it ?

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over

Who is it
That never lets you down?
Who is it
That gave you back your crown?
The ornaments are
They're goin around
And they're handin' it over, handin' it over, handin' it over
