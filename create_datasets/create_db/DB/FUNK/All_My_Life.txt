My thoughts they wait for me
But I just can't get there
I just sit in my room alone
And stare
All the things I do in a day
I just can't get there
I should use that time to pray
That time to care
All my life I have been trying to find
Something to keep me occupied
I guess I've known all along that it was you
I'm so sick and tired
Of running away
When I know that the good times go
They never stay
So sick and tired of dancing
The night away
I've forgotten what it's like to wake up
Early and greet the new day

All my life I have been trying to find
Something to keep me occupied
I guess I've known all along that it was you
All my life I have been trying to find
Someone that's always on my side
I believe that what you said is true
And God has shown me
That he won't turn away
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
It's just so hard to let go
And simply let him in
I've got to make the choice
Or be back where I've been
