I don't mind you telling me what's been on your mind lately
I don't mind you speaking up
I know sometimes I can be all wrapped up and into me
I can be in such a rush

Just slow me down, slow me down
Tell me tomorrow everything will be around
Just slow me down, slow me down
You're the one who keeps me on the ground

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do with love, love, love
You can tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love

I can take your honesty
All your words way heavily
Listening to you all the time
I wanna be there for you
The way you've been there for me
Always help me walk the line

And slow me down, slow me down
I know you will always be around

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do with love, love, love
You can tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love

All this time we finally know each other
Now that I've been leaning on your shoulder
I can tell you, baby, that
You're right, you're right
You're wrong, you're wrong
And I can't believe people know you're strong

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do with love, love, love
You can tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do with love, love, love
You can tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love, love, love, love
Just do with love
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love
