[Rah Digga:]
Yeah Rah Digga
First lady of the flipmode squad
First lady of the outsidaz, Jamelia
The collaboration is going down
UK meets the states
Some more Rocky Balboa Ish going down
Right here [oooh oooh]
Uh uh uh uh uh hey ladies
I wanna take this time to talk
To all my sisters out there
All my independent, hardworking sisters
Who don't need nothing from no man
Got their own business going down
You know what I'm saying?
But theres always that one brother out there
That just turn you out
You know what I'm saying
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah we goin' talk about him right now

[Verse 1:]
I've never seen somebody
Do to me what you do
Never been close to the edge nearly
Lose my cool
I'm usually Miss Inde-pendant
But I'm hung up on you
I think you're all that
How you feel about all that?
I'm kinda thinking that you feel it too and:

[Bridge:]
I know [uh uh] you know
We know where this should go and
I know [uh uh] you know
You'd be a fool if you tell me 'no' and
I can't let you pass me by
Just fly out of my life
With no goodbyes
Yeah yeah, alright
Let me see your hands in the air

[Chorus:]
Da B, da O, da U, da T
It is what you are baby
Da H, da O, da N, da E, Y are you so fine?
Da B, da O, da O, da M
I feel I need to get with him
See you so fine
I want your time
Tell me what you wanna do

[Verse 2:]
I need to know
What's up with you
Do you got a girl
And is she true?
I'm feeling that you don't because
Because
You got my hand in yours right now
Feel my walls breaking down
I got my own flat
How you feel about that?
Feel I should introduce the two of you and:

[Bridge:]
I know [uh uh] you know
We know where this should go and
I know [uh uh] you know
You'd be a fool if you tell me 'no' and
I can't let you pass me by
Just fly out of my life
With no goodbyes
Yeah yeah, alright
Let me see your hands in the air

[Chorus:]
Da B, da O, da U, da T
It is what you are baby
Da H, da O, da N, da E, Y are you so fine?
Da B, da O, da O, da M
I feel I need to get with him
See you so fine
I want your time
Tell me what you wanna do

Oh my god
Look at him

[Rah Digga:]
Look at honey over there
With the savoir faire
Got the girlies all pimpin'
But he really don't care
Postin' in the whip, shortie boom a trip
If he bout like I'm bout
We can take a little dip
That's me and you right
If you feeling my vibe
Got sister girl open
Ain't no need to lie
Any type way how
Me jocking your style
You know you got it goin' on
But I peeped your file
[I know] uh huh [you know]
I ain't tryin' to be a sucker for nobody
[I know] uh huh [I know]
Can't wait for the day to play with your body
I know you're nothing but trouble
And I might get hurt if my feelings start to bubble
But I'll just have to work it out
Peep everything else right now
You da Bout boy

[Chorus] [3x]
