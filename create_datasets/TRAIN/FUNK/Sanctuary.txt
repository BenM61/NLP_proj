And by the moonlight flow visions born from darkness
The answer shall now be found
And by the moonlight
All will be revealed, wisdom of the ages falls like rain
I am of the future, take my fire and release your flame

And so I leave this world, never to return
My candle has been burned, for deliverance I yearn
Time cannot erase the mark I leave on time and space
Sanctuary burns, raging grace

I will live on, pure energy and perfect knowledge
The eye of the storm, judgment now awaits for me
Am I born to darkness or to light?

I'm flying to the sun, wings are stained with blood
My journey has begun, am I blessed or am I damned
Years will melt away, my mortal shell left to decay
The sanctuary learns your love and hate

I will live on, pure energy and perfect knowledge
The eye of the storm, judgment now awaits for me
Am I born to darkness or to light?

And so I leave this world, never to return
I am the new life form, I have seen and you will learn
Time cannot erase, my passage through this sacred place
The sanctuary's hand, this is your fate
