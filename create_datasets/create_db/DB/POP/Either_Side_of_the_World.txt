Either side of the world
Chase the sun
Pay the maximum rate
To feel so lonesome
Wrapped up like little lambs
Safe from harm
Enjoy it while you can
Happiness is far from home

You know it, he knows it
Everybody knows it
When you're in love
The world moves with you
Whatever you want
They're happy to give you
The last resort

Where the famous have come
To be alone
Try to work it out
The same progression
Sometimes I try too hard
To overcome
Sometimes I think too much
Wish I could've held my tongue

You know it, he knows it
Everybody knows it
When you're in love
The world moves with you
Whatever you want
You turn yourself into
And then you're in Hell

Luxury and leisure
Never meant pleasure
Real life, but different
Passion and commitment
Commitment

Wish I could've held my tongue

You know it, he knows it
Everybody knows it
When you're in love
The world moves with you
Whatever you want
They're happy to give you
When you're in hell

Luxury and leisure
Never meant pleasure
Real life, but different
Passion and commitment
