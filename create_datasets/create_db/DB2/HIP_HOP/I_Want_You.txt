Feel like things are goin 
And then there gone
Your like a maze, I can't get through
Should I go left? Should I go right?
Should I let you stay for the night?
It's like a see-saw when it comes to your love
Boy when your up, this girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

'Cause you know that I want you
(Yeah)
And you know that I need you
(Yeah)
Is that anyway to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin' and 
(Yeah)
These tears can you wipe them?
(Yeah)
Is that anyway to be?
Just have your way with me

I'm going out with guys 
That I don't wanna go
To places that I been before
(They pitching the same game)
Ha, boy it's a damn shame
(How I wish it was you)
Callin' me
(I want it to be you)
Holdin' me
(Boy it needs to be you)
Kissin' me-e

'Cause it's like a see-saw
When it comes to your love
Boy when your up 
This girl is down
And I just can't 
Figure it out

'Cause you know that I want you
(Yeah)
And you know that I need you
(Yeah)
Is that anyway to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin' and 
(Yeah)
These tears can you wipe them?
(Yeah)
Is that anyway to be?
Just have your way with me

Listen

(Have your way with me)
Have your way with me
(Anytime or anywhere, have me)
(However I don't care)
(Have your way with me)
(I'll be your everything tonight)
(Boy tonight)
Tonight
(Boy tonight)
Oooh ahhh

'Cause you know that I want you
(Yeah)
And you know that I need you
(Yeah)
Is that anyway to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin' and 
(Yeah)
These tears can you wipe them?
(Yeah)
Is that anyway to be?
Just have your way with me
