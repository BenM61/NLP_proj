I hate to
Break it to you
But this convenience ain't convenient anymore
Now I realize I had different eyes

Back when I thought this was a good thing
Here I am my anger and me
Temper makes it hard to see
This situation I'm in again

Everything must come to an end now
There's some things that I want to do
And I don't want to lie to you
But it still makes me go

And do the things I know
All wrong
I'll dig to
Learn about you

I'm sure I'll find you were as evil as me
We can call it even
You can let me leave then
You can leave me to my own thing
