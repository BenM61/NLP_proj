Oh, far away in Africa
Happy, happy Africa
They sing a-bing-a-bang-a-bingo
They have a ball and really go
Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan

Oh, take a trip to Africa
Take any ship to Africa
Come on along and learn the lingo
Beside a jungle bungalow
Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan

Hot drums are drumming, the
Hot strings are strumming, and
Warm lips are blissful, they're
Kissful of Skokiaan

Oh, when you go to Africa
Happy, happy Africa
You live along like a king-o
Right in the jungle bungalow

Hokey-Skoki, Skoki-oki-aan
Okey-Dokey, anybody can
(Skoki-Skoki) man, oh man, oh man
You sing a-bing-a-bang-a-bingo
In hokey-pokey Skokiaan
Skoiaan

Oh, far away in Africa
Happy, happy Africa
They sing a-bing-a-bang-a-bingo
They have a ball and really go, go, go
Oh, take a trip to Africa
Any ship to Africa
Come on along and learn the lingo
Beside a jungle bungalow

Hot drums are drumming, the
Hot strings are strumming, and
Warm lips are blissful, they're
Kissful of Skokiaan

Oh, if you go to Africa
Happy, happy Africa
You live along like a king-o
Right in a jungle bungalow
Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan
Oh, right in a jungle bungalow
Skokiaan
