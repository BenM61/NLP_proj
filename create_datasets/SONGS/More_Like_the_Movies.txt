(Shel Silverstein)

I guess the dance is over now
So you just curtsey and I'll bow
And ask the band to play us Auld Lang Syne

Then I'll just take what's left of me
Right back to where it used to be
And you'll go sail your magic carpet, far across the sky

I wish I could have made it
More like the movies for you
Some pretty Technicolor way it's never been
I'm sorry when I kissed you
You only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
Did you girl?
No you never got to hear those violins, no

The castles that you built so high
Were just too steep for me to climb
And I guess these dirty streets of mine
Were just too rough for you

I wish I could've helped you see
Just one of your sweet childhood dreams
But though I tried I could not make not one of them come true

And I wish I could have made it
More like the movies for you
Some pretty Technicolor way it's never been
I'm sorry when I kissed you
You only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
Did you girl?
No you never got to hear those violins

Oh I'm sorry when I kissed you
You only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
No you never got to hear those violins
