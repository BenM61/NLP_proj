Jet, my love, your black eyes have capyured me,
And I am helpless in the web that you spin!
I'll regret, my love, regret you've enraptured me
In this midnight maze, this ebony blaze.

You'll fly away, for I know you're just a slave
In search of life's mysteries, the thrills that you crave.
Not even you can tell what smoking secrets hide
In the dark inside of your restless soul.

But I'll go on adoring you, for how can I forget?
Your memory won't let me, Jet my love!

Your memory won't let me, Jet my love!
