If you want it, we can get right to it
Mix some vodka with some OJ
Skip the mornin' and let's get right to it
Put your hands on my body

Me and my friends poppin'
No we don't need no man to be gettin' on down
Know how I like it
Like it
Don't need no excuse to be going this ham
We're bumping KC and the Sunshine Band
That's the way I like it
Like it

Sippin' so much Goose that you could call it geese
Sippin' so much Goose that you could call it geese
Feel like I can fly when you are next to me
Feel like I can fly when you are next to me

If you want it, we can get right to it
Mix some vodka with some OJ
Skip the mornin' and let's get right to it
Put your hands on my body
If you want it, we can get right to it
Mix some vodka with some OJ
Skip the mornin' and let's get right to it
Put your hands on my body
On my body

Now it's almost 2 and somebody passed out
Dropped my phone in the pool, lost my keys in the couch
But that's the way I like it
Like it

Sippin' so much Goose that you could call it geese
Sippin' so much Goose that you could call it geese
Feel like I can fly when you are next to me
Feel like I can fly when you are next to me

If you want it, we can get right to it
Mix some vodka with some OJ
Skip the mornin' and let's get right to it
Put your hands on my body
If you want it, we can get right to it
Mix some vodka with some OJ
Skip the mornin' and let's get right to it
Put your hands on my body
On my body

Body
On my, on my body
On my body
On my, on my body
Body
On my, on my body
On my body
On my, on my body
On my body
On my body
