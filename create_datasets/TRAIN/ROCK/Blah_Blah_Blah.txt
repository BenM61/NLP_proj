Pop before the war, lunch before the score
Steady as she goes, following my nose
I'm a bull mongrel, that's me
Baby, that's me

Shimon Peres, whatcha gonna do
I'm from Detroit, blow the reveille
Deatho knocko
That's me, little old me, glamorous me

Johnny can't read
Blah-blah-blah
I' can't see
Blah-blah-blah
Tuna on white, guns all night
Blah-blah-blah

Cat taboo girl, raped by an ape
Cat taboo girl jam the sucker in
You dig the mongrels
Guardian of the state who says you gotta go bombin' low

Senator Rambo merrily you go
Monkey butcher knows a cab to find abank
A bank to find a loan 'cause you can't be alone
You dig the mongrels, that's you
Heaven, it's you (Incomprehensible) you

Violent peace
Blah-blah-blah
Buy it right now
Blah-blah-blah
We are the world, we are so huge
Blah-blah-blah

Johnny can't read
Blah-blah-blah
I can't see
Blah-blah-blah
Tuna on white, guns all night
Blah-blah-blah

Blue jeans coolies, everything huge
Petrified food, pizza killers from napalm to nice guy
Hit 'em where they live, nifty fifty
(Incomprehensible)
The most spoiled brats on God's green earth
Pop before the war
