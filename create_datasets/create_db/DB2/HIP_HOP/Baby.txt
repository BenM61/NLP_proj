I've spent all my days, all my time
Thinkin' 'bout you, baby
Now it's the things you do
That's got me feenin' for you, my baby, ooh...yeah

Give me what I want
And I will make you happy
I'll give you what you need
And we can make it happen

Don't you wait no longer
I can't take this, baby
Can I be with you
Don't you know you got me hopin', baby

You know I want you badly (Mmm, hmm) , baby
And you know you feel the same way too
I'm the one to keep you happy, baby
Just let me be down with you
Baby-baby-baby-baby-baby

Seven days I miss you
Seven nights you know I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Now while we're wastin' time when you know you should
be mine
Stop fakin' 'cause you know you got it goin' on

You know (Uh) I want you badly, baby
You know you feel the same way too (Too)
I'm the one to keep you happy, baby
Just let me be down with you
Baby-baby-baby-baby-baby

You are the one I see in my fantasies
When I'm dreamin' (When I'm dreamin')
I'll be your everything (Everything)
If you get down with me, I'll give you what you need,
baby

Uh, yeah
You'll be beggin' me please, "Want you bad" on my
hands on knees
Got that fire, so you sweat when I take the T
Get it hot, baby, don't drop, feel the breeze
Get you sprung with the love shots I'll receive
Do it well when I freak you 
If you comin' with ends then I'mma keep that
Don't be waitin' too long or it will be gone be long
Before Dark singin' a song, now bring it on, what

You know I want you badly, baby (I want you badly)
You know you feel the same way too (You know)
I'm the one to keep you happy, baby (Baby-baby)
Just let me be down with you
Baby-baby-baby-baby-baby (I want to be down, I gotta be
down)

You know I want you badly, baby
You know you feel the same way too
I'm the one to keep you happy, baby
Just let me be down with you
Baby-baby-baby-baby-baby

I want you badly, baby
You
