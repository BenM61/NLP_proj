spoken): 
How do you live with a broken heart & only a memory? 
(sung): 
I'm sad we parted 
(spoken): 
& I know what's in store for me 

Hurt a little every day--that's what I'll have to do 
Hurt a little every day till I can stop loving you 
I'll be so upset, never will forget 
The love that I shared with you 
Turn & walk away, what is there to say? 
Nothing more I can do 

Hurt a little every day, time can heal every wound 
All the pain will go away, I'll forget someday soon 
Give a little smile, that should last a while 
Until I stop loving you so 
Maybe you can say "Let's call it a day" 
But how can I let you go? 
Hurt a little every day, cry a little every night 
Till I stop loving you, stop loving you, oh oh 

Give a little smile, that should last a while 
Until I stop loving you so 
Maybe you can say "Let's call it a day" 
But how can I let you go? 
Till I stop loving you so, oh 
(repeat & fade): 
Hurt a little every day, cry a little every night
