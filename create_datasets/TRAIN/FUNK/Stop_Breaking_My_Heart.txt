Why do you keep stressin' me?
I'm not into those kinds of things
Like arguing and fighting
I'm all about loving yes loving

So ooh
(Stop breaking my heart, baby)
Ooh
(It's not suppose to be that way)

I know you love
(Yes, I know that you love me)
Baby
(At times it's hard to see)
Why you break my heart, baby?

Often I sit pondering
Why love hurts and makes you cry
It's not easy, though it should be
It's all about loving, yes, loving

So
(Stop breaking my heart, baby)
Breaking my heart, baby
(It's not suppose to be that way)
Um, um, um, I know you love

('Cause I know that you love me)
Baby
(At times it's hard to see)
So hard to see why you keep breakin' my heart, baby
(Why you break my heart, baby?)

Oh, no, no
(Oh, no, no)
Tell me why you wanna break my heart
Can you tell me why?
(Can you tell me why?)

Don't take this the wrong way
Baby I, love you will always
But if you want this to last
You got to make changes fast
(Changes fast)
'Cause living with a broken heart is awful to bare

Oh
(Stop breaking my heart baby)
Stop baby, yeah
(It's not suppose to be that way)

Girl, I know that you love me
('Cause I know that you love me)
Sometimes it's hard to see, yeah
(At times it's hard to see)

Why you keep on breakin' my breakin'
My, my, my, my, heart yeah, yeah?
(Why you break my heart, baby?)

Stop breaking my heart, baby
Stop breaking breakin' my heart
(It's not suppose to be that way, yeah)
I know
('Cause I know that you love me)
You love me

(At times it's hard to see)
Baby, baby, it's hard, yeah
(Why you break my heart, baby?)
Why you breakin' my heart, baby? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Heart, oh oh, ooh ooh

('Cause I know that you love me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(At times it's hard to see)
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Why you break my heart, baby?)
You
(It's not suppose to be that way)
Oh

('Cause I know that you love)
You love me, oh
(At times it's hard to see)
(Why you break my heart, baby?)
Why you wanna, break my heart, baby? Yeah, yeah, yeah
