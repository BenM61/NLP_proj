Anuthatantrum to the ruck it.
Don't give a f*ck.
I'm denied nothing, gotta still get it.
Spoiled rotten, real with it,
Deal with it.
Don't you feel me living in you?
When muthafuckas make promises and can't come through,
Anuthatantrum to the ruck it.
Don't give a f*ck.
I'm denied nothing, gotta still get it.
Spoiled rotten, real with it,
Deal with it.
Don't you feel me living in you?
When muthafuckas make promises and can't come through.
Whatever obstacles that detour me from getting my way,
I gets revenge to the end, then begin the foreplay.
My forte is sipping Alize, and acting up.
Looked into your mirror at your face you started backing up,
What the f*ck?
You slowly step away and started panic,
As you witness anuthatantrum, fantastic, mantic, keeping niggas frantic.
Your manner don't want to be told shit.
If I can't get it you might feel my spirit off on another mission,
Fishing for my next victim with no permission.
Switching bodies, had to get some new Gotti's put on the Benz.
Jumped in the minds of many mens with no patience.
The worst thing to do is wait and waste time.
It's constantly sipping away taking.
Manipulating all ages, bring the frustration.
Waiting for the lift of my karat, to face in your location.
Appearing crazy on track, but seen daily,
Some say shady, but so what muthafucker?
