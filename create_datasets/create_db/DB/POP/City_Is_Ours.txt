The city is ours
The city is ours

Rollin' past graffiti walls,
Billboards lighting up the block
Everyone of us on a mission
Got a whole crew by my side
Cars beep, beep when they pass us by
We ready to get down to business

We pull up, open the door
All the girls, scream there they are
It's packed from wall to wall
And, everybody is calling
Here they come, it's almost time
Feel the rush, now hit the lights
We gonna get it all started

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but,
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but,
Tonight the city is ours
The city is ours
The city is ours

My, my look how we roll
Was it only a month ago
Everybody said we were dreaming
Now we're here like, yeah we told ya
Still far, but we're that much closer
And there ain't no way that we're leaving (oh no)

We pull up, open the door
All the girls, scream there they are
It's packed from wall to wall
And, everybody is calling
Here they come, it's almost time
Feel the rush, now hit the lights
We gonna get it all started

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but tonight
The city is ours
The city is ours

We gotta believe
It's destiny calling
So night after night
We rock the whole place out
As hard as it seems
I know if you want it
Then it's gonna happen some how

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but tonight

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but tonight
The city is ours
The city is ours
The city is ours
The city is ours

The city is ours
