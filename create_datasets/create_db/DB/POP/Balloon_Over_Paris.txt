I have a book and all these pictures that we took
From a trip to France last September
They help me to remember
Wanna know how you get this feeling
Thinking of the verbal beating
I got from you when I told you I don't want this

So why am I still sitting here crying
Thinking back to when we were flying
A balloon over Paris, and I kinda miss you

If I flew
Even though you were holding hands
I forget your name before we land
If I flew
Love it comes and lifes unfold
We'll figure it out when we grow old

Lie to my friends, I broke up with my boyfriend
And they all want to protect me
Thinking I can't go on without you
Can't seem to stop this feeling
Thinking of the verbal beating
I wanna give to you
When you tell me I seem lonely

So why am I still sitting here crying
Thinking back to when we were flying
A balloon over Paris and I kinda miss you

If I flew
Even though we were holding hands
I forget your name before we land
If I flew
Love it comes and lifes unfold
We'll figure it out when we grow old

Lovers are faded to climb these stairs
No complaining, nothing is unfair

Hmm, oh oh
