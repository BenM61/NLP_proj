Every time I hear a fiddle and it's cookin' just a little
Well it makes me want to jump up and run
And if he's sawing with some soul boogie woogie rock n' roll
Well I know I'm gonna have some fun

And when the rosin starts to fly and I'm looking in the eye
Like I'm just about to blow a fuse
Mama call the doctor 'cause your boy has got
The rocking Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues

I met a man from Tenessee this is what he said to me
He said music is a rhapsody
He picked up his violin stuck it underneath his chin
And started playing me a symphony

I said that ain't the way it's done let me see that fiddle son
And I sawed him off a chorus or two
He said you'd better call the doctor 'cause I think I've got
The rocking Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues

Now if you want to play me some fiddle
I'll tell you right from the start
You'd better play me something lowdown hoedown honking
I don't want to hear no funeral march

It's got to pick me up and roll me over
It's got to make me want to jump up and sing
If it ain't buzzing like a beehive, kick it into overdrive
Or it don't mean a doggone thing

So let me rosin up my bow and I think I can show you
The way I like to play this thing
Let's put some boogie rhythm in it kick it on up to the limit
I'm gonna' put some fire on these strings

And if you feel your feet start moving to the beat
And you feel like you've got ants in your shoes
Well you'd better call the doctor 'cause you've probably got
The rocking Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues
