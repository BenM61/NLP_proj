Yeah, I ain't sure that it's not the whiskey making me dizzy
Who knows? Who knows?
It's time now to put down my glass
This is my chance, and here goes, here goes!
You may think my lines are bad, and
Throw my number in the trash
But I can't let you get away
So I won't leave until I say

Come home with me,
Not just for tonight, but maybe for life
We'll see!
Come home with me,
'Cause I just can't change until I'll make you see
So come on, ho-oooome home with me
So come on, ho-oooome home with me
Come home with me!

Sometimes we're not in control,
You got to hold on, just take a ride
'Cause what if, what if tonight is the first night for the rest of our lives?!
You may think my lines are bad, and
Throw my number in the trash
But I can't let you get away
So I won't leave until I say

Come home with me,
Not just for tonight, but maybe for life
We'll see!
Come home with me,
'Cause I just can't change until I'll make you see
So come on, ho-oooome home with me
So come on, ho-oooome home with me
Come home with me!

Let's make this a night to remember,
Yeah to remember!
We won't remember!
Let's make this a night to remember,
Yeah to remember!
We won't remember!
[x2]

Come home with me!
Not just for tonight, but maybe for life
We'll see!
Come home with me,
'Cause I just can't change until I'll make you see
So come on, ho-oooome home with me
So come on, ho-oooome home with me
Come home with me!
