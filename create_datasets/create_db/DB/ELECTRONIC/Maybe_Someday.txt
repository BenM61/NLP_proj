No I won't do it again, I don't want to pretend 
If it can't be like before I've got to let it end 
I don't want what I was, I had a change of head 
But maybe someday... 
Yeah maybe someday 

I've got to let it go and leave it gone 
Just walk away, stop it going on 
Get too scared to jump if I wait too long 
But maybe someday... 

I'll see you smile as you call my name 
Start to feel, and it feels the same 
And I know that maybe someday's come 
Maybe someday's come... 
Again! 

So tell me someday's come tell me some days come again... 

No I won't do it some more, doesn't take any sense 
If it can't be like it was, I've got to let it rest 
I don't want what I did, I had a change of tense 
But maybe someday... 

I'll see you smile as you call my name 
Start to feel, and it feels the same 
And I know that maybe someday's come 
Maybe someday's come... 

If I could do it again maybe just once more 
Think I could make it work like I did it before 
If I could try it out 
If I could just be sure 
That maybe someday is the last time 
Yeah maybe someday is the end 
Oh maybe someday is when it all stops 
Or maybe someday always comes again...
