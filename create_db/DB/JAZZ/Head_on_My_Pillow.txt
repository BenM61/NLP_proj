Head on my pillow just thinking of you
Head on my pillow
So lonesome and blue,
I wonder where you are tonight
And if you miss me, dear
My heart tells me you can't deny 
My arms know you left near
Head on my pillow 
My thoughts turn to dreams
Head on my pillow 
Like heaven it seems
I see a vision build a home of happiness divine
My head on my pillow 
With yours close to mine
