The sun forgot to shine this morning
'Cause everything went wrong last night
I thought your arms would hold me the way they always do
Instead your kisses told me that our affair was through

Are memories we've shared forgotten?
Has every dream just faded out of sight?
The sun forgot to shine this morning
'Cause everything went wrong last night

The sun forgot to shine this morning
'Cause everything went wrong last night
I thought your arms would hold me the way they always do
Instead your kisses told me that our affair was through

Are memories we've shared forgotten?
Has every dream just faded out of sight?
The sun forgot to shine this morning
This love of ours has ended
The curtain has descended
'Cause everything went wrong last night
