Well, Young MC, that is my name
And rockin' it for you is my game
It is my game but whatdya like
The Young MC is on the mic

On the mic and in the place
I'm rockin' it to the vicious pace
The vicious pace, the vicious house
I'm really gonna make you hypnotized

Hypnotized but then you're gone
You're rockin' it to the break of dawn
The break of dawn, the break of D
'Coz my name is the Young MC

Young MC is what I'm called
I'm not too heavy, not too tall
I'm not too tall, I'm never the wack
The Young MC give a heart attack

Heart attack is what I give
I'm really gonna make you want to live
You want to live, you want to die
You're rockin' the vicious, can't deny

Can't deny just what you hear
You're rockin' it days and month and year
Month and year and month and day
I'm gonna really take your breath away

Breath away and breathalizer
Rhymin' like a synthesizer
Synthesizing music machine
Rock the house, you know what I mean

What I mean is what I say
Gonna really rock the house today
You rock today, you rock tonight
You're gonna really do it right

Do it right and do it wrong
I'm gonna really make you sing a song
You sing a song, cold with the glee
'Coz my name is the Young MC
