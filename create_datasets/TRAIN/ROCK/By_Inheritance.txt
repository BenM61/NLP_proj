It's something inside
It's hard to put your finger on
There's no reason to hide
So be proud you're in control

Not everyone can
You're one of a few
Neglected by man
No one really knew

The seekers of force, turned their heads away
Bid on the wrong horse, were only led astray
Mentally controlled, powers beyond reach
You keep it untold, all you do is tease

It's mine - by inheritance
no one can take it away
Why play - why take the chance?
Why not just make them pay?

An invisible touch, developed in time
And if things get too much
You change it with your mind
It's not to be seen
No one is to know
It starts like a dream, then you let it grow

It's mine - by inheritance
no one can take it away
Why play - why take the chance?
Why not just make them pay?
(Bridge:)
It's like the rain
You can't prevent from falling down on your face
It's not like pain
You can't ignore it, still there is no trace it's capturing
Reaching for you
There's nothing that you can do
Terrifying
You can feel the ice from inside of you

You've got no remorse, once you've increased your prey
No sense of divorce
When you hear them pray
It's easy as hell
No need to try hard
So why won't you tell "no"
You always state

It's mine - by inheritance
no one can take it away
Why play - why take the chance?
Why not just make them pay?
