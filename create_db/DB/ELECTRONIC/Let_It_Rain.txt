Rain on my skin
I feel a gentle summer wind
In your eyes
I can see the deep blue sky

Let it rain
Let it color all my skin
Let it rain
Wash away my doubts and pain
I wanna discover
I don't wanna make believe
Let it rain down on me
Let it rain down

Feels so divine
Only one thing on my mind
I'm alive
Let the island spirit shine

(Let it rain)

Let it rain
Let it color all my skin
Let it rain
Wash away my doubts and pain
I wanna discover
I don't wanna make believe
Let it rain down on me
Let it rain down

Let it color all my skin
Let it rain
