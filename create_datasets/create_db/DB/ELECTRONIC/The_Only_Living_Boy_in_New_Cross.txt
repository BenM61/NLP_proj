Hello, good evening and welcome
To nothing much
A no holds barred half-nelson
And the loving touch
The comfort and the joy
Of feeling lost
With the only living boy in New Cross

Fill another suitcase
With another hall
Of hotel towels and toothpaste
And the bathroom wall
Then wipe the lipstick hearts and flowers
From the glass and chrome
Take five or six hot showers
And come on home
To the comfort and the joy
Of feeling lost
With the only living boy in New Cross

I've teamed up with the hippies now
I've got my fringe unfurled
I want to give peace, love and kisses out
To this whole stinking world
The gypsies, the travelers and the thieves
The good, the bad, the average and unique
The grebos the crusties and the goths
And the only living boy in New Cross

Eyes down and I'll keep you up to date
Two fat ladies in 1988
The safe sixteen lovers who lied
Purley's queen and mother makes five
Butchered bakers, deaf and dumb waiters
Marble Arch criminals and clause 28'ers
Authers, authors, plastered outcasts
Locked up daughter, rock and roll stars
Goodbye Rudy, David and Rosie
Abraham and Julianne
And everyone that knows me

The gypsies, the travelers and the thieves
The good, the bad, the average and unique
The grebos the crusties and you and I
Hello, good evening, welcome
And goodbye
