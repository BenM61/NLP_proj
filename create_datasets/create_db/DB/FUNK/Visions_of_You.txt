I'm not numbed that anymore
Not longer feel the hate and pain
No longer drenched in shame
I'm not numbed that anymore
Now I am the key to the door
The kingdom of heaven lies inside
Makes a circle with the turning tide
Now the circle is complete
And the heart and mind they need
The kingdom of heaven lies inside

I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you endless

It's a vision for me and for you
Hell can be a circle too
And the truth remains unspoken
A vision for me and for you

I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you endlessly

I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you endlessly

I'm not numbed that anymore
No longer feel the hate and pain
No longer drenched in shame
I'm not numbed that anymore
Now I am the key to the door

I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you endlessly
I love visions of you
I love
Visions of you
I love visions of you endlessly
I love
Visions of you
