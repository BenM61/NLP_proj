Baby I would still be standing here
No matter what you do
If I let you down just tell me now
And I'll fix it like a man's supposed to

What if I know we can work
Don't you understand
Maybe I'm just making it worse
But I can't let go of your hand
Let's fix it, let's fix it, oh

Baby stop right there
Take a breath, no it's not too late
Wait, search yourself
Before you steal, steal my life away
You don't want to try this time
I'm here to fight this time
Don't you leave me empty hearted
Girl don't leave this love of ours
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished, woah oh oh 

How can you complicate what I see so clear
Maybe you're just scared
But if you run away in fear
That just won't be fair
So, close your lips and don't say those words
I know you want to say
Just let me kiss you anywhere it hurts
Tell me where to start first

And stop right there
Take a breath, no it's not too late
Wait, search yourself
Before you steal, steal my life away
You don't want to try this time
I'm here to fight this time
Don't you leave me empty hearted
Girl don't leave this love of ours
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished, woah oh oh 
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished, woah oh oh 

Just think it over, for a minute
We'd be losing so much, so much, so much

If you didn't stop right there
Take a breath, no it's not too late
Wait, search yourself
Before you steal, steal my life away
You don't want to try this time
I'm here to fight this crime
Don't you leave me empty hearted
Girl don't leave this love of ours
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished, woah oh oh 
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished, woah oh oh
