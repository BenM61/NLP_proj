Today for the very first time
We started planning out the ultimate crime
Lock it together to destroy this gold status
Rory C, what's your thesis?

I don't fucking believe this!

Institutions are established and invested
Put to us getting tried and tested
Noticed
Fore-swept and digested
It's about we damn contested

You can't save us
You can't contain us
You can't destabilize (the fight)
Or label us
You can't save us
You can't contain us
You can't destabilize

(Destabilize)

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
(Cause we know)
Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
(we're stuck in the middle)
Cause we don't belong here
(we don't belong here)
We don't belong here
Our minds are dormant and static
Don't ever accept conventional thought without reason

We need to fucking erupt!

Corrupted fucking tyrants
Instigating violence
This sporadic discordance
Will find maximum assurance

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
(cause we know)
Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
(we're stuck in the middle)
Cause we don't belong here
(we don't belong here)
Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the wall
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you

No one owns the ocean
No one owns the mountain
No one owns us
No one owns us
We've all inherited this world
We need to fucking erupt!
(cause this earth is ours!)

We need to fucking erupt!

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
(cause we know)
Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
(we're stuck in the middle)
Cause we don't belong here
(we don't belong here)
Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
Cause we don't belong here

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the wall
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you
