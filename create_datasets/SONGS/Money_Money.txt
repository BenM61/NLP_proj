Money, money, 
I wish I had some
I'd spend it on you, babe
Cause your really somethin'
Even though I don't have a lot
You can have what I've got

Money money
Money money
Money money
I just don't have none
But you're the kind of girl that
Makes me want to get some
So I can go where I've never seen myself
And you've never been

Money money
Money money
I've got get myself up, out of bed
Get some work today
If I'm ever going to keep a girl like you around
Got nine to five all week long
Till I get some take home pay
Cause everybody knows
That you like your fancy clothes
And that's where my money goes
 
Money money
Money money
Money money
I just don't have none
But you're the kind of girl that
Makes me want to get some
So I can go where I've never seen myself
And you've never been

Money money

And if I get the chance again
You know I'm gonna to grab it

If I want you to stay

Money money
