Elijah Rock, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord
Elijah Rock, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord

Elijah, Elijah, Elijah
Elijah, Elijah, Elijah
Satan is a liar and a conjurer too
If you don't mind high, he'll come to you
If I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood

Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord
Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord

Ezekiel said he saw him
Wheel in the mid' of a wheel
John talked about him
In the book of the seven seals
Some say the Rose of Sharon
Others say the Prince of Peace
But I can tell this old world
He been a rock and a shelter for me
Hallelujah

Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord
Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord

You can call my rock in the morning
Call him late at night
He's always with me
And all my battles he'll fight
When I'm in trouble
I can call him on the line
He put a telephone in my heart 
And I can call God anytime
Hallelujah

Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord
Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock I'm comin' up, Lord

You can call my rock in the morning
Call him late at night
He's always with me
All my battles he'll fight
When I'm in trouble
I can call him on the line
He got a telephone in my heart 
And I can call God anytime
Hallelujah

Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord
Elijah Rock, shout, shout, shout
Elijah Rock I'm comin' up, Lord
