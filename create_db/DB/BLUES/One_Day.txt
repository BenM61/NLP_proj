I've seen that look somewhere before.
Your sorrow's like an open door.
You've been this way for much too long.
Somebody must have done you wrong.
But one day the sun will shine on you,
turn all your tears to laughter.
One day your dreams may all come true,
one day the sun will shine on you.
I've seen that look so many times.
I know the sadness in your eyes.
Your life is like a wishing well.
Where it goes, only time will tell.
One day the sun will shine on you,
turn all your tears to laughter.
One day your dreams may all come true,
one day the sun will shine on.
Say goodbye to the lonely nights.
Say goodbye to the Northern Lights.
Say goodbye to the cold north winds.
Say goodbye to the autumn leaves.
One day the sun will shine on you,
turn all your tears to laughter.
One day your dreams may all come true,
one day the sun will shine on you.
One day the sun will shine on you.
One day the sun will shine on you.
