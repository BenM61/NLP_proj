There not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind
Where you are , there is a different feeling
I wake up , I'm on the ceilin' , opens up your eyes 
What a shape ! Someone you can't forget for any time 
Oh , let me show you mine , immediately

After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there , I wanna be there 
We leave immediately
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there , I wanna be there
We leave immediately 
After dark

There is no limit that I would not go 
if I could lie beside 
Where you are , there is a different out there
Love in the jungle can be hard to realize 
What a shape ! Someone you can't forget for any time
Oh , let me show you mine immediately

After dark where the lights are fading sweet and low
I wanna be there , I wanna be there 
We leave immediately
After dark where the lights are fading sweet and low
I wanna be there , I wanna be there 
We leave immediately
After dark

We leave immediately
