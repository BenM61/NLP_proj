[Featuring Black Attack] 
What? "I represent no question" 
"Entire life's a record"   Redman from Dat's My Word 
Yo I get hooknotic (what?) I catch that prey on they victims 
Big black I hi tech shit like radar systems 
Unsecessfully they try to get rid of me 
Shit on me you must be kdding me 
Thinkin' I'm a let that float (never) so it's time I severly touch 
this 
track up 
Back up cousin I'm about to twist this next sack up 
For real tho' I bang like steel toed tims 
Watch where you park at my man might steal your rims 
We in the dark at all time of the night steady cheefin' 
Rollin' with the illest of niggas so stop beefin' 
Occassionly (what?) you might find me blazin' 
The rawest of MC's to spice you like Cajaun 
Flow straight nasty like stank vagina 
And I keep my shit pumpin' from Chile to China 
Rewind it one time let me kick one more rhyme 
One more time roll one more dime 
Hook: 
We keep it tight right plus we keep it poppin' 
On top of that we hip hoppin' and don't stoppin' 
"I represent no question" "Entire life's a record" 
I'm cross country like Sony triple like Tony 
Get nasty like bologny, Ginuwine so ride the Pony 
Uncomparable, noncompatable to your whole shit 
You got it how can you tell to go get? 
Cause lyrically I'll twist your shit back 
Without no hesitation or the slightest bit of procrastination 
I'll blast the nation on some Black Attack shit 
What nigga don't try and stop me 
You need to hit up your local record shop and cop this bit 
I know you're sick of those nonsense cat's kickin' wack raps 
Talkin' about traps it's time to face the facts 
Perhaps you're trying to get doe like Suge Knight 
All the real niggas represent your hood right 
Hook 
Yo we keep it on some hip hop don't stop 
I pops the cherry 
Added a new edition to my shit so you don't have to worry 
Toss rhyme flurries 
Hot to Def like Keith Murray 
I'll bury your words and crush your thoughts in a hurry 
Mutilate your mental have your whole style up 
First A and be	 reach your card out then I pull your file out 
Stay on top of my game 
Moves be stratigic 
Battlin' don't f*ck around I'll leave you paraplegic 
I mean it I give props to those who climb poetically 
Not those who take it personal when I'm speakin' hypothetically 
I'm just reppin', flowin' steadily 
Unforgetable like Natalie 
Son switch up so incredibly 
So my joints be the total oppostie of gun clappin' 
Just blunts and rappin' 
Beat box and finger snappin' 
Who put the DAT in? 
I let my nigga DJ Honda cut it up live 
Spark up the lye 
Hook
