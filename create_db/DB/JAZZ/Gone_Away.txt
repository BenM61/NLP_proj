Yeah, say, why I'm lookin' that way
You ain't do nothin' wrong
I'm wildin'
It's five I waited up last night
Said you got too high
I'm tired

So you want me to give you honesty
Said you wanted every piece of me
You don't wanna hear me out tonight
I just turn around and say goodnight

You don't feel away
You're gone away
You don't listen
You promised you wouldn't change
It'd stay the same
But it's different
We were much happier when
It was always happy endings

Wait maybe it's just a phase
Took a minute for you to say 'I'm sorry'
Don't ask if you really don't wanna hear it
When I'm tellin' you how I feel
You're bothered

Said you want me to give you honesty
Said you wanted every piece of me
You don't wanna hear me loud tonight
Don't let me turn around and say goodbye

You don't feel away
You're gone away
You don't listen
You promised it wouldn't change
It'd stay the same
But it's different
We were much happier when
It was always happy endings

We were much happier when
It was always happy endings

You have the right to feel away
I tried to change you
I'm just scared you're gone away
You promised it would stay the same (same)
