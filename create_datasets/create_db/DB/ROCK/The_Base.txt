What I draw today
Will be recognized as shape

I spoke to the base
And the base says "we wait"
So I smoke an old cigar
While the giant sun fades

See, I spoke to the base
And the base says "we wait"
And the base says we're safe

Now and then I can see the truth above the lies
Now and then oh I feel, you're truly anesthetized
That's why

When I walk today
It's in silence and in rain

Can a man turn the page
While he's trying to amaze? 
So I hold my arms apart
But don't deny you any pain 

See, I spoke to the base
And the base says "we're there"
And the base says "we win"

Now and then I can see the truth above the lies
Now and then oh I feel those beauties, this life belies

They're like street lights
They tunnel on and on
Into these deep nights
Where the lights circle on are so steep

So steep 
I count the falling stars
So steep
Anonymous forces
So steep
That broken street light
So steep
Life is like a drug
Sky less night
So steep
I count the falling stars
So steep I will not be staying long

Now and then I can see the truth above the lies 
Now and then I can see those beauties that shun my eye
That's why
