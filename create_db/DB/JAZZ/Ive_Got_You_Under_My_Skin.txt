I've got you, under my skin 
I've got you, deep in the heart of me 
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me 
I've got you, under my skin 

I tried so, not to give in 
I said to myself this affair, it never will go so well 
But why should I try to resist, when baby I know damn well 
That I've got you, under my skin 

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, repeats in my ear 

Don't you know, you fool, you never can win 
Use your mentality, wake up to reality 
But each time I do just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin 
Because I've got you, under my skin
