I feel my heartbeat
When you run your fingers through my hair
(Yeah) I can feel you,
I can feel you by my side when you're not there
(Yeah) Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light
Show me that my search is over
I pay the price, I pay the price

Tell you someday baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun

The taste of love is sweeter like honey on the vine,
Like the wind that feeds the fire, two souls become entwined
Someday baby you and I should be one, one

So I'm standing 'round this corner
Tall enough to touch the New York sky, oh yes
My love is so blind
I just cannot hear or see the world go by, oh yes
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the sea
Truth can be stranger than fiction
This love is real
This love is real

Tell you someday baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun

Ah we are one, we are one

I will follow
Count on me, I'll never let you down, oh yes
My devotion
If love is like an ocean I'll surely drown, oh yes
You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together
Just me and you
Just me and you

Tell you someday baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always, brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun
Tell you someday baby, you and I should be one, one

(You know my life is in your hands, 
And every breath you take is planned 
And all this love goes on forever)

Tell you someday Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it someday baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it someday baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always baby, you and I should be one, one
