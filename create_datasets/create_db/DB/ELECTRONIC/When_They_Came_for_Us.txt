Why are the robots so sad?
We're not in trouble anymore, anyway
And no more synthetic fighting
They stopped the right thing after today.

When they took the beach that day
They stole the children, took them away
And I miss everyone, but most of all the little ones
And the shiny toy guns.

Each and everyone of us still pray
Hoping for evidence
Looking for clues
All the robotic families, searching the circuitry
For what remains.

When they took the beach that day
They stole the children, took them away
And I miss everyone, but most of all the little ones
And the shiny toy guns.

I remember mother that day
When her tears woke us so quietly
From our dreams
She told us, that father's sleeping
And he is watching from far away.

And the shiny toy guns.

When they took the beach that day
They stole the children, took them away
And I miss everyone but most of all the little ones
And the shiny toy guns.
