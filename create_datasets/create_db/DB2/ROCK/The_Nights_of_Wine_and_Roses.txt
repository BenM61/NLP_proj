Long lit up tonight and still drinking
Don't we have anything to live for
Well, of course we do, but until it comes true
We're drinking

And we're still smoking
Don't we have anything to live for
Well, of course we do, but until they come true
We're smoking

We all want to know what nobody knows
What the nights of wine and roses hold
For the wine and roses of our souls
So we down our drinks to the final friends
And we burn our plans right down to the end
We don't cry for those nights to arrive
We yell like hell to the heavens

We all want to know what nobody knows
What the nights of wine and roses hold
For the wine and roses of our souls
So we down our drinks to the final friends
And we burn our plans right down to the end
We don't cry for those nights to arrive
We yell like hell to the heavens
