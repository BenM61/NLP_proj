Mister Christopher Columbus
Sailed the sea without a compass
When his men began a rumpus
Up spoke, Christopher Columbus

There is land somewhere
Until we get there
We will not go wrong
If we sing, "Swing a song"

Since the world is round
We'll be safe and sound
'Till our goal is found
We'll just keep rhythm bound

Soon the crew was makin' merry
Then came a yell
"Let's drink to Isabelle
Hum, bring the rum, ho hum"

No more mutiny
What a time at sea
With diplomacy
Christy made history

Mister Christopher Columbus
He used rhythm as a compass
Music ended all the rumpus
Wise old Christopher Columbus
