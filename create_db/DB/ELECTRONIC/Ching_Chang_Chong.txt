He's definitely a cutie boy, 
And we could have a lot of joy.
My best friend loves him like I do, 
Let's play if it is me or you.

Ching, paper, scissor, stone
Chang, who will win the crown
Chong, who will win the game

Uh, do they play on me
Ah, like a magic key
What is going on?

Sing sing along, sing along, ching chang chong
Sing along sing along
Sing sing along, sing along, ching chang chong
Sing along sing along (oh oh)

Sing sing along, sing along, ching chang chong
Sing along sing along... (ohh ohhh)
Sing sing along, sing along, ching chang chong

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

He's lovely and he's so devine
Our hands are shaking hidden signs
Oh it's a game of destiny
One moment for eternity

Ching, paper, scissor, stone
Chang, who will win the crown
Chong, who will win the game

Uh, do they play on me
Ah, like a magic key
What is going on?
