Time, when the conversation dies
Oh there's a silence and it's come for me
It wouldn't let us get away this time
But I been crying
If I don't hear this beat return to me
It took my heart but it won't set it free
Ooh I won't let you get away from me this time

Make me fall in love with the music, fall in love
Make me fall in love with the music, fall in love
Make me fall in love with the music fall in love
Make me fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Love love love, fall in love, love love love love

Love
