Picadors at Babylon
You are my Zion
Pace of the tiger
The keeper's cage
Invisible light
Shoots from your eyes
A sign I can see from my high rise

Another castle crumbles
Another monkey falls
Just open up your joy
Let the sailors climb the walls
I thought I saw you laughing
Ten feet in the air
It doesn't matter where they touch you
Where they cut you can't get me

An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light to keep me alive up oh oh

Nothing on the Internet
Can feel it with a fingers in my mind

Opiate Utopia
Is harder by the hour
I found you a flower
In a field
In my invention
Among the tired among the poor
Among the broken, the huddled masses
Its your time
You answer to a new name
That changes all the time
I'll call you anything you want
If I say it's mine
The story's never ending
My footprints been erased
Here you are, kiss of evil
See your mouth, or is it really

An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light
An invisible light I want
An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light to keep me alive up oh oh

Something in the fifth dimension
Cant you feel it
Can't you feel it bend your sense of time

Babylon,
Where bricks of water and diamonds tower,
Sailor's lust and swagger 
Lazing in the moon's beams,
Who's laser gaze penetrates this sparkling theater 
Of excess and strobed lights,
Painted whores. 
Sexual gladiators. 
Fiercely old party children.
All waked from their slumber to debut the Baccara.
Come to the light! 
Into the light! 
The invisible light 

An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light
An invisible light I want
An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light to keep me alive up oh oh

An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light
An invisible light I want
An invisible light
An invisible light oh oh
An invisible light to keep me alive up oh oh
