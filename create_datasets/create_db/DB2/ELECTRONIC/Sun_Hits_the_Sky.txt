I know a place where the sun hits the sky,
Everything ages and blows out the night,
Everyone knows why my time can't be tied,
'Cause I want to be where the sun meets the sky!

I am a doctor,
I'll be your doctor,
I'm on my way, 
And you won't come down today,
Live by the rat race,
Been with the rat ones,
And they hold you down,
We'll turn the world around!

Well I just don't know why the sun hits the sky,
Everyone's dreams get to turn out the light,
Living is easy,
When time's on my side,
'Cause I want to live where the sun meets the sky!

I am a doctor,
I'll be your doctor,
I'm on my way,
You won't come down today,
Live by the rat race,
Been with the rat ones,
They hold you down,
We'll turn the world around!

I am a doctor,
I'll be your doctor,
I'm on my way, 
And you won't come down today,
Live by the rat race,
Been with the rat ones,
They hold you down,
We'll turn the world around!
