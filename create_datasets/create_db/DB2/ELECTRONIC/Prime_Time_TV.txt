Where there's a hero
You'll find a villain
It is a tried and tested most successful billing
They're in the kitchen
They're in the bedroom
They bring the world inside the home
They want to live in

As we look inside their private lives
It's really me and you
We're watching on the tube
In just one week
You'll be hooked so deep
A dairy dose of soap on the screen

This is prime time TV
A real life drama 

As seen on prime time TV
You can't turn it off and walk away

The same old story
From rags to riches
The conflicting morals of a family business
You can't predict it,No
The play's so twisted
Maybe that's the reason why it's so addictive

All the alibis and fake surprise
Will Cecil B.DeMille be turning in his grave
But even so like the ratings show
We'll watch it once again every time

'Cause this is prime time TV
More real life drama

Yeah, yey,yey,yey

Is it a window,is it a mirror
Is it just for entertainment for pleasure 

So when it's over we're back to people
Just to prove that human touch can have no equal

As we look inside their private lives
It's really me and you
We're watching on the tube
In just one week
You'll be hooked so deep
A dairy dose of soap on the screen
