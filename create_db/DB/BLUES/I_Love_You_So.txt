Oh my darling I was so lonely
Searching for you and for you only
Oh my darling I love you so
Oh my darling my love is true
Longing for you, no one else will do
Oh my darling I love you so
When I first saw you dear I knew you were alone
I said to myself that I'd make you my own
Your brother caught us kissing
I though he would surely tell
Until he started playing those wedding bells
Now my darling I'm yours forever
Don't ever leave me, leave me never
Oh my darling I love you so
Oh yes it's true, now I have you
And best of all I know now
That I'll never have to be blue
Oh baby, I love you so
I mean you, baby
