Oh, when you were young and your excitement showed
But as time goes by is it outgrown?
Is that the way things go? Forever reaching for the gold
Forever fading black and comes up cold

Walking free, oh, come with me, oh
Far away, oh, everyday, oh
Walking free, oh, come with me, oh
Far away, oh, everyday, oh

When you were young, you never knew which way you'd go
What once was grace now undertows
Well everyday do what you can, and if you let them turn you 'round
Whatever goes up must come down

Walking free, oh, come with me, oh
Far away, oh, everyday, oh
Walking free, oh, come with me, oh
Far away, oh, everyday, oh
