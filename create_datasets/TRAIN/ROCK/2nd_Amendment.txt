So you get in every fight you can
And it makes feel so much closer
To the man

Everybody wants to be like you
And the ones who don't well f*ck 'em
And you do

I get my killing in the free world ain't it fun?

For better television
Does anybody want it? come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun?

Does anybody wanna get off?
Oh oh inshallah
And the cars will run forever
Its good for everyone 
For better television
Does anybody want it come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun?
