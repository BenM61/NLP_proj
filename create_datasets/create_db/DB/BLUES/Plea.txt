Don't ever leave
Baby, baby, baby, baby, stick with me
Life would be fine
Baby, baby, baby, if you were mine
Please hear my plea, 
Come back to me, 
I love you so.

Dear lord, please hear my plea
And do something, something for me
I love him so, want him to know
That I don't ever want him to go.

Oh don't ever leave
Baby, baby, baby, baby, stick with me

It would be fine
Baby, baby, baby, if you were mine.

Dear lord, please hear my plea
Help do something, something for me
I love him so, want him to know
That I won't, ever, want him to go

Oh don't ever leave
Baby, baby, baby, baby, stick with me
It would be fine
Baby, baby, baby, if you-ou-ou-ou were mine
Ooo-ooo-oo
