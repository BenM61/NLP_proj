I haven't been here in a long long time
It feels so good to be home
Sitting right here light a fire inside
It's so hard to explain

And as the real world disappear
Awaken my memories
Oh, it's all coming back to me

There's something in here, I believe it's love
That sets me free to explore
All of the things that I chose to hide
Now I can see who I am

I am out in the garden where we played
Here began the endless dream
We will never come back

Now I am sitting here in the pouring rain
Something is guiding me right
I feel the fire inside
My heart is telling me that I am on my way
To redefine who I am
I will be stronger this time
I will be myself to the very end

Coming back here is like coming back to life
I feel empowered and new
It's hard to believe that it was so long ago
I called this place my home

Here in this town where I was born
Everything move so fast
I feel like a stranger out here

Now I am sitting here in the pouring rain
Something is guiding me right
I feel the fire inside
My heart is telling me that I am on my way
To redefine who I am
I will be stronger this time
I will be myself to the very end

My head is spinning, I've had the weirdest day
It's really hard to explain
I wish I could tame this ghost in my heart
One part of me will always remain here
