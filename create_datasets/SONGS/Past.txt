I suppose I'm naive
But I find it hard to believe
A person could make life so cheap
It's worth nothing today
Because you threw it away
Self-indulgence took you too deep
In a whole lot of nothing
You got up and went
Leaving behind
All the people you spent
I guess they could call you a friend
You took them for a ride
To the very end
What a waste
What a waste
What a waste of life
What a waste

So in the end you didn't
Have no friends
Because they sat and watched you die
A lot of bridges burned
With no lessons learned
But plenty of reasons to cry

I suppose I'm naive

I guess they could call you a friend

To the very end
What a waste
What a waste
What a waste of life
What a waste

No communication
Complete separation
No talk, no chance to help
I am guilty
I failed you
As a person who should of cared
I shut my mouth
Because I was scared
I hid my feelings
When they should have been bared
I turned you off and
And I, I should of cared
