It's alright to be someone else sometimes
Actions to feed on the right
Circle and wounded love in your life
Sustain her fears deep inside

Babe, hey babe, jar of hearts
Defeating the purpose and hangin' on the wall
Love is the moon in the sky with a string hangin' down
To the ground I can't touch it

Always the silent one
Who sneaks up from behind
Closer to the end

I'm right in front of you now
I try to be such a stank
All that I'll know tomorrow
Is what I've learned today

I'm right in front of you now
I try to be such a stank
All that I'll know tomorrow
Is what I've learned today
