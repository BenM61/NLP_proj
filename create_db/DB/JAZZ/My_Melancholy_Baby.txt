Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Please, cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too
