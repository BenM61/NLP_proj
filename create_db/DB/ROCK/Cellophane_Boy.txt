And I'm not the Judge or the referee
And I can't accept, cause I am uptight
And the smokes getting into my eyes are burning
My concern is I just might give you a life

And I can't relate to the hypnotist
And I can't get close , cause the plastic wrap
And I want to have kids, but their father's up inside the
clouds
The distance between is on my mind

Up Until now things have been fine, temporarily
You're cute, but the circumstance has changed
Your substitution method, crutch
Your whole protection from your pain
This presentation of my ploy
Is to change my cellophane boy

Oh, it's not the 70's
Let your future fly with me

Up until now things have been fine, temporarily
Your cute, but the circumstance has changed
Your substitution method, crutch
Your whole protection from your pain
This presentation of my ploy
Is to change my cellophane boy

And I want your habit to be me
Your harbor and your refugee
