[SP Killer]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, L-O-X, L-O-X, motherfucker 
Niggas don't know how we 'bout to come this time 
No more shiny suits 
None of that shit 

[Chorus: x2]
We gonna R-U-double F-R-Y-D-E 
Revolver, semi-automatic, and a P.G. 
Hooptie getaway driver 
Breathe easy 
Explain thing further 
Murder or get murdered 

[Styles Paniro] 
Half of them hustle, half of them killers 
All of them niggas want to kill Paniro 
Better send the guerrillas 
'Cause beef is like a brand new car 
You better ride 
Every time I sleep, I die 
Wish I was gone (Ya know) 
Felt dumb when I was young 
I used to wish I was on 
I'm a stay blunted and red with one in the head 
Niggas thinkin' they the don
Till their shit get bombed 
I put four in your shootin' arm 
Two in your legs 
Like ten in your chest 
The last one in your head 
I give you the whole clip
Like you cheated and stole shit 
Knocked off the pack
Flossed and no chips 
You know the business 
Empty rap kill your co-defendant 
Keep it, male, and catch a body in trial 
If you want a nigga dead then do it holiday styles 
Come with two guns up and empty both of the clips 
Kill you whole fuckin' crew and go 'n smoke on the fifth 

[Chorus: x2]

[Sheek Luchion] 
Yo, yo, yo 
I come to your town on a Peter Pan, no Jack 
One pair of clothes, two hos and buggy with that 
Want to beef me?
Y'all niggas is borrowin' heat 
Callin' all across town to borrow a full pound 
Meanwhile this nigga got his guns to your noggin'
While your man with the heat is with some bitch up in the project 
He clappin' at you, you duckin', makin' you dance 
You should have spent it on some guns 
Instead of Iceberg pants 
What, L.O.X. off top
Pullin' our triggers 
With our guns on our lap
We ride around like Cali niggas  (West side!) 
Target motherfuckers
Cold hearted motherfuckers 
'Stead of young dumb your moms, and whoever she got with her 
There's a new-born in the house
Then I'm killin' the babysitter 
Y'all niggas all clowns in Sheek eyes 
Your moms would wear glasses
With the nose disguise around me 
Talkin' greasy 
Y'all like watermelons 
Big but crack easy 

[Chorus: x2]

[Jadakiss] 
Now if you know Jay
I never been a brother to front 
I be in L.A. wearin' any colors I want 
Rock guns like shirts
Block under the punk 
And I put somethin' hot
Anyone of you chumps 
And I know a few of you want to get my watch 
But it be a funeral if you get my watch 
It ain't nothing y'all can do to stop the Lox' wealth 
Run up in a gun store; cop the top shelf 
The crack-game is dead
All they want is weed now 
Chicks that I went to school with, a seed now 
You know Kiss, stocky, bald head, light brown 
Ice down, in my Roll look like night-town 
To all y'all, lil' Jada's for the thousandth time 
I recall hittin' your moms or writin' your rhymes 
And just because you might have seen me
In and out of your house 
Is no way that she gon' have a baby out of her mouth 

[Chorus]
