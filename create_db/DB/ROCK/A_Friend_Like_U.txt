The Lone Ranger and Tonto
Laurel and Hardy 
Batman and Robin 
It was Snoopy and Charlie 
Friends through thick and thin 
Friends to the very end 
I think you would agree 
That's how it is for You and me 

I want to know I need You 
I want you to know it's true 
That there's no way 
I could have made it without You 
It's so good to know that 
I've got a friend like You 

I tell you it's black
But you see it white 
You say go left 
But I know it's right 
No matter where we go 
Be it through the highs or lows 
I will be by Your side 
'Cause You and I are friends for life 

I want to know I need You 
I want you to know it's true 
That there's no way 
I could have made it without You 
It's so good to know that 
I've got a friend like You 

Through all of the laughter and tears 
Through all the questions and fears 
Through all of the winning and losing and trying 
I will be by Your side 
'Cause You and I are friends for life
