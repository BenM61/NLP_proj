I unpacked my chest for you
Do everything that you want me to
Can't believe I gave you all my love
What in the world was I thinkin' of?

I just let it all slip away
With every minute, hour of the day
And if it really meant to be, just share with me
Why do I still feel incomplete?

Tell me, yeah
I need to know, baby
I got to know
Tell me, yeah
Tell me that you love me

If I give you what you need
Would you do the same thing for me?
'Cause I don't want to be alone
I want you here all night long

'Cause when you leave me, baby
I'm thinkin' about you always
I'm ashamed to say
How much I want you to stay

Baby, tell me, yeah
I need to know
Say it now
I got to know
Tell me that you love me

Now you see
I'm not tryin' to make a big fuss over this
But I'm just sayin', you need to let me know how you feel sometimes
Say it, it's not wrong, expressing yourself?
That's what wo-women like that, you know what I'm sayin'?
You know, you got to tap into your romantic side
Shoot, return the love, baby, return the love

I need to know, I want to know
I need to know, I want to know
I need to know, I want to know

I need to know, yeah baby
I got to know, oh, tell me
Tell me that you love me, love me, love me, love me
That you love me, love me, love me, love me

I unpacked my chest for you
Do everything that you want me to
Can't believe I gave you all my love
