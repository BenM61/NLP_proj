(While there is only one verse in this song, 
It was considered the Mills Brothers theme song 
In their early years and deserves representation here.)

Goodbye blues, Goodbye blues
Lost two loving arms I used to use
Lonesome nights, low down news
Now she might be I don't know whose
I've got those old goodbye blues
