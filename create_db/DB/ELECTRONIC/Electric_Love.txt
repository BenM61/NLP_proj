Candy
She's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste

And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder is getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it

All I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby, you're electric love, electric love

Drowning, you make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me, hold me deep beneath your weight

And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder is getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it

All I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby, you're electric love, electric love

Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me

Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it

And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby you're electric love, electric love
