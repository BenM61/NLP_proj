Just because I ask a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I rang his number by mistake
He thinks I still care

Just because I hog the same old places
With the memory of him lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy girl I used to be
He thinks I still care

But if he's happy thinkin' I still need him
Then let that silly notion bring him cheer
But how could he ever be so foolish
Oh where did he get such an idea

Just because I ask a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I saw him, then went all to pieces 
He thinks I still care
He thinks I still care
