Every evening I follow my master
Lead me down to the praying ground
No sir I can't seem to go no faster
I'll be taking the long way around
Early spring child you weren't getting no younger
When love just brought you down
All last fall I waited for the summer
I was taking the long way around
Sister take your time to come to me slowly
Lead me down to the praying ground
All that's sacred child, all that is holy
Bound to come to us on the long way around
Way down here where anything can happen
I mean down on the praying ground
Look out child it look like something be coming
It be coming the long way around
Coming the long way around
