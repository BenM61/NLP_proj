I know sometimes baby, you get hurt
When it's something I say
Or something I do

It's just so hard to find the right words
Make them sound the right way
To you

You make me sing inside
Sing this happy tune
And I just can't deny
That I'm smiling too

And when you try to hide
When the darkness comes to your room
It will sing back to you

Mm, mm, mm, no words can ever say
Mm, mm, mm, you make me feel this way
Mm, mm, mm, give me this happy tune
Mm, mm, mm, and I will sing it back to you

Some nights and days when I finally hold you tight
When you're close to me
I wish you could see

That in your eyes I see stars that shine so bright
You're a sunrise at sea
to me

You make me sing inside
Sing this happy tune
And I just can't deny
That I'm smiling too

And when you try to hide
When the darkness comes to your room
It will sing back to you

Mm, mm, mm, no words can ever say
Mm, mm, mm, you make me feel this way
Mm, mm, mm, give me this happy tune
Mm, mm, mm, and I will sing it back to you
