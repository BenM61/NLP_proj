Baby put me in
Everything you've ever wanted is here
Put me in
I don't care how you mix it
I don't care how you fix it but
Put it in

Whenever you want it
Or how you want it
Or where you want it
Just take my love and put it in your mix

I'm waiting patiently
Hoping that I can be in your mix (I'm still here)
It's you that I adore
Just wait, there's so much more in my mix
Sweet as honey it can be
But you're the lock and you're the key
All my love you need is near
So open up and have no fear
Help to you I'll give my all
And I will be there when you call
I know the things that you can do
Just know I'm always there for you

For all you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I wanna be right there
I know just what you like
Give me a chance tonight...in your mix
I need to be there

Don't you know for all you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I need to be right there
I can love you right in the stars tonight...in your mix

There's something you need to know
How much I need you so in my mix
So don't keep love to yourself
You'll find a greater wealth in your mix
Smooth as honey it will be
And I'll love you with dignity
I wanna be with you so much
I wanna feel the way you touch
All the love you need is here
No more lies and no more tears
Let me come inside your world
I can make your toenails curl

For all you know
I might be the best you know
Put me in you mix
I need to be right there
I can love you right if we start tonight...in your mix
I need to be there

For all you know
I'm the best you know...in your mix
I know just what you like
Give me a chance tonight...in your mix
I need to be right there

Don't you know for all you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I can love you right if we start tonight...in your mix

For all you know, I'm the best you know
