Hello, hello, I'm glad to see you
Now we'll only stop to say goodbye
We'll go, we'll go just where we want to
We won't let the others bleed us dry

'Cause I am but a fool for you, that's right
And I got nothing to lose that I'd choose tonight

Come on, come on we should be leaving
But I let another one go by
Oh no, oh no, I couldn't leave you
Though I know they'd like to make me try

'Cause I shot down the moon for you, that's right
'Cause I got something to prove to you tonight

I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up

You know, you know I want to please you
And now's the time to let me try
Will you, will you do as I do?
Will you wait for me to stew or die?

'Cause I don't ever want to see you cry
Yeah, I will never leave you high and dry
I, yeah, I

I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah
I will always wait for you to catch me up, yeah

I will always wait for you to catch me
I will always wait for you to catch me
I will always wait for you to catch me
I will always wait for you to catch me
