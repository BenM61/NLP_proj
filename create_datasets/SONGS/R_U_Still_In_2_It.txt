Are you still into it? 'cause I'm still into it. 
We haven't had sore bits for about a fortnight. 
Am I your only one? 'Cause you're still my only one. 
But if you need more, I'll just do it in some, right. 

We should go into town and spend some money. 
We could go to the pictures and see something funny. 
We'd share a popcorn and we can go to the pub at night. 
We can get right tanked up and go home and have a fight. 

Will you still miss me, when I'm gone? 
Is there love there, even when I'm wrong? 
Will you still kiss me, if you find out? 
I will now leave you but don't follow me.
