We like to chat about the dresses we will wear tonight
We chew the fat about our tresses and the neighbours' fight
Inconsequential things that men don't really care to know
Become essential things that women find so apropos

But that's a dame, we're all the same it's just a game we call it
Girl talk, girl talk

We all me-ouw about the ups and downs of all our friends
The who, the how, the why, we dish the dirt, it never ends
We're weaker sex, the speaker sex you mortal males behold
But though we joke, we wouldn't trade you for a ton of gold

It's all been planned
So take my hand
Please understand
The sweetest girl talk, talks of you
