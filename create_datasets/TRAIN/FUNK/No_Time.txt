Saw the folks down below crying
Heard them on the radio lying
Distant bells in the air ringing out, do they hear?
Do they know it's growing very near?

Everybody sitting here
They don't realize
They've got no time

Saw the transmitter sway slowly
Saw it crash in the lane coldly
Saw the sea rushing into the coast now they've seen
Now they know it's growing very near

Everybody sitting here
They don't realize
They've got no time

Saw them gather in slow motion
Setting sail on the tired ocean
Heard the clouds rolling by, shouting down from the sky
Hear them speak their last goodbye

Everybody sitting here
They don't realize
They've got no time
No time
