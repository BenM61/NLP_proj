You know my name, bitch
Uh yeah, hold up
The streets gave me heat, and the Eagle was the thing that they gave me
It's the rap guerilla that still clap, fucker
Yeah, guess who's back?

Mack, bitch, I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks from towns
Move out with small glocks and pounds (uh-huh)
And I take everything to the table bag and rock it down
F*ck who watchin' now, the neighbors, they in pocket now
F*ck you haters cop some pocket now
When it come to coke you cant outwit me, mine cheap
Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boyar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour siffin' it up
Coke spots runnin' by the hour shiftin' it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids, use gats don't rumble
Gorilla niggas goin' ape in this concrete jungle
Banana clips'll make them monkeys humble

Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie, Beanie Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Yeah, but guess who back

It's Mack, bitch uh-huh, back in the mix or the scuffle
I'm in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Boxman, Frito Lay, for that free dough boxin'
You will lay, nigga I'm not playin'
Listen, whether I make cash or take cash
I'm in the hood eatin' with my dog like when we break-fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Shit when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You bout, four-thirty cheap in wheels, small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill
Big Beans, sittin' in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly how you want it? You can have it
Drop top, stick shift, automatic
Back wheels still smokin'
64 still rolling, 3 wheel motion, it's ferocious

Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie, Beanie Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Yeah, but guess who back

Mack, hey yo
On the low doe (shh!) the whole city is mine
I'm trying to flood the whole city with dimes (yeah)
I'm in the kitchen yeah, with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, bullshit
You switch to hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wastin' your time spittin' the rhymes
I'm gettin' mine spittin' them rhymes, but still pitchin' them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calmin' the sound
Stick with the seven, strickly smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm poppin' for keeps
I'm not gettin' stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga tryin' to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay and he did it when I signed the contract

Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie, Beanie Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Yeah, but guess who back
