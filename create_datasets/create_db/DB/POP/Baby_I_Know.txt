You called me to tell me goodbye
I told you that I was some other guy
You said that you'd phone when he got home
You told me to tell him that you'd called
Now you don't have to tell me goodbye
You don't have to hear me cry
You don't have to tell me to go
'Cause baby
Baby I know
The phone rang again for some time
I knew it was you on the line
I hurt you before I knew it for sure
Forgive me for being unkind
Now you don't have to tell me goodbye

When you called much later that night
I said he'd out 'till daylight
But if there's something I can tell him
Forgive me for asking but is something not right
And than you broke down and cried
Told me you loved him
But your love had been denied
He didn't want you no more
I told her don't you be so sure
He'll never want you to go
'Cause baby
Baby I know
Baby
I know
I know
baby
I know
I know
