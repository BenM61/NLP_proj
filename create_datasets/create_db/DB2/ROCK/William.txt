Got my friend called William
He's been my friend since we were young
Gonna go out yeah
Gonna make it everywhere

Been my friend since we were at school
Did ya hero all of my rules
I knew I could trust him
He'll be there everyday

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bow
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bow
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bow

Now we're living in London
Meet up like we were young
We discussed the old days
Like they were yesterday

Been driving down the freeway
In his car out of the way
I'm cutting lines out on my knees
While discussing empathy

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bow
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bow
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bow
