You got your high heeled sneakers on
And your slip in mules
Got your high heeled sneakers on
And your slip in mules
You're more than all right now
I know know you're out of sight

You got a shapely figure, mama
That keep me uptight, hey
Got a shapely figure, mama
You know it keep me uptight
You're my heart's delight just about right now
I believe you're out of sight

Hey, the wee little things you do
The way you kiss me too
Lord, the wee little things you do
I know the way you kiss me, too
Oh, you're too much
I know you're out of sight, hey

You got a sweet disposition
Lord, you know you're always right
You got a sweet disposition, yeah
I know you're always right
You know just where it's at, mother
You know you're out of sight

Hey
You're too much, you're the end
So hip, baby
I know you know just where it's at more than I
There ain't no doubt you're, you're out of sight
Woo, hoo, too much
