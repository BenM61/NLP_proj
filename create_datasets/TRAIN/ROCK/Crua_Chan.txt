By the left, quick march, Crua Chan!!!
It was 1745
The Highland spirit has revived
Mc Dougall here and McDonald there
The clans had come from everywhere
Singing ...
Fee, fi, fo, fum !!!
I smell the blood of an englishman
Fee,fi,fo,fum!!!
Come on London ,here we come
We went all the way down south
We were frothing at the mouth
Comind down to Derby town
We'd beaten everywhere around, singing!
Fee,fi,fo,fum!!!
I smell the blood of an englisman
Fee,fi,fo,fum!!!
Come on England, here we come
We ended at culloden moor
Feeling bad and feeling poor
The redcoats has chased us there
There we died and there we stayed, singing!!!
Fee,fi,fo,fum!!!
I smell the blood, scotsman
UNited Kingdom here we come
The bonnie prince had gonne home
He's never gonna come back
The bonnie prince is going home
He's never gonna come back
We'll do it you in Wembley
We'll do it you in pubs
We're the scotish louts larking about
Here come your rats
Crua Chan lad
