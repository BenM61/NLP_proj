Baby, I'm out the door (I'm about to make you the star of the show)
Let your emotions soar (off to a place you ain't never been before)
Like on Monster's Ball (I'm willing to portray the role)
Make me feel good (that's all I wanna hear when I take control)

(Cut)

The scene is off the chain
I love it when you call my name
You're driving me out of my mind
I wanna do it one more time

The scene is off the chain
I love it when you call my name
Now that you're nice and warm
Stick to the script, girl
Let's move on

I'm your director (Yeah)
It's getting deep (Oh baby)
Let me direct now and we'll make our own movies (Me and you)

I'm your director (Yeah)
It's getting deep (Oh girl)
We don't need a video tape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene

I'm your director (Oh)
It's getting deep (My baby)
Let me direct now and we'll make our own movies (I got you)

I'm your director (Right here)
It's getting deep (Tonight)
We don't need a video tape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene (I want you)

Look in the mirror (I be watching something on the TV screen)
I can see your body (Rolling up and down on top of me)
You deserve a Oscar for the way you perform (For supporting actress)
Then you match and I

(Say cut)

The scene is off the chain
I love it when you call my name
It's driving me out of my mind
I wanna do it one more time

The scene is off the chain
I love it when you call my name
And now that you're nice and warm
Stick to the script, girl
Let's move on

I'm your director (Please)
It's getting deep (Baby, listen to me)
Let me direct now and we'll make our own movies 
(I wanna show you everything that I've learned)

I'm your director (Over the years)
It's getting deep (Let me.)
We don't need a video tape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene 
(Love scene)

I'm your director (I will be)
It's getting deep (Tonight)
Let me direct now and we'll make our own movies 
(We don't need nothing but me and you)

I'm your director 
(Please, believe it)
It's getting deep
We don't need a video tape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene 
(To make this ghetto love scene)

So it's over baby
It's done yet
I can feel it
This is the climax
We've been all over the place
Making progress

(But, I'm not done with ya)

Until it's a motion picture, baby

(I am)

I'm your director (All yours)
It's getting deep (Tonight.)
Let me direct now and we'll make our own movies 
(Oh baby, stay right there)

I'm your director (Let me)
It's getting deep (Rub your body)
We don't need a video tape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene 
(Let me)

I'm your director (Hold you baby)
It's getting deep (Right here)
Let me direct now and we'll make our own movies 
(In my arms)

I'm your director (Oh baby, I am)
It's getting deep (Yours)
We don't need a video tape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene 
(This ghetto love scene)

(I'm your director)

Feel me baby
Let me feel you
We can
Yes, we will (I'm your director)
Always

To make this ghetto love scene.

(Cut)
(I'm your director)
