You hear me callin'
Callin' brother, are you listenin'?
We need to cool at night for our future
For the little pretty boys and girls

We need to take a time, come together
Are you willing?
So we can make it right for the people
And everyone I love will come

Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight

We gotta come together
We gotta come together

Everybody searchin' in confusion
No solution
We look inside ourselves for the answer
But we really don't understand

We all must be unplanned
To start sharing, to start caring
And if the sun shines your way
You will find love 'cause love is the only way

Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love

Aye man, it seems so hopeful for blazin' my days
And brother, let's begin a stress off my chest with some sex
Can I get a little love for my peeps in the streets?
But this killing for colors, aye man this shit gotta cease, peace

Nothin', zero, zilch, amounts to what?
Nothin' but you've gotta have somethin'
'cause we're comin', comin' correct and together eternally
And with that little bit of love, we may live forever

See it's a time to live, there's a time to die
But when the livin' gets rough, that's the time I realize
I've gotta think twice using my ears to hear, L O V E
Just love, just love, just love, just love

Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love

Now look all around you
Children dyin', people cryin', no, no
But nobody seem to care
Till it's their time, they really don't give a damn

We've got to find a way to start loving
To start giving, yeah
But if we procrastinate and we blow it
Then everybody'll go to hell

Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight

We gotta keep together
We gotta keep together

We don't need destruction, we don't need it
We don't need to care, no, no
We don't need corruption
We just need to cheer, just a little bit

We don't need attacking, no, no
We don't need the pain
We don't need to cry down, we don't need it
We just need to change, let me just a little bit

Just a little bit of love to make it right
Just a little bit of time to cool at night
Just a little bit of space to keep us tight

Love can, love can be
Livin' life to see
All my children free, ooh
Just a little bit of love
