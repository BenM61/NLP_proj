I am a victim of the science age
A child of the storm, whoa yes
I can't remember when I was your age
For me, it says no more, no more

The atomic punk, oh yeah, ah

I am the ruler of these netherworlds
The underground, whoa yes
On every wall and place my fearsome name is hung
Just look around, whoa yes

Nobody rules these streets at night but me
The atomic punk, awh

Oh

I am the ruler of these netherworlds
The underground, oh oh
On every wall and place my fearsome name is hung
Look around, whoa yeah

Nobody rules these streets at night but me, nobody, ahh
The atomic punk
