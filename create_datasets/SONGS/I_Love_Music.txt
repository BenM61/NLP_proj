Oh, oh, oh
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, yeah

I love music
Any kind of music
I love music, just as
Long as it's grooving

Makes me laugh
Makes me smile all the while
Whenever I'm with you, girl

While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the
Things that you do

Oh, oh, oh

I love music
Sweet, sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringing

I'm so happy to be
In complete harmony
I love you, girl

And to hold you
So close in my arms
I'm so glad that
You're mine, all mine

Nothing can be better
Than a sweet love song
So sweet, so sweet
So mellow, mellow

When you got the girl
That you love in your armss
Honey, I love you
I love you, yeah

Music is the healing
Force of the world
It's understood by every man
Woman, boy and girl

And that's why
That's why I say
I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's
Grooving, grooving

Music makes the
Atmosphere so fine
Lights down low
Just me and you
Baby, you know

Especially when you got
A cold glass of wine
Mellow, mellow wine and song

I love music
Any, any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving

And I say I love, I love
I love, I love, I love music
Sweet, sweet music
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love music

I love, I love, I love
I love, I love music
