I was feeling lost, and kind of ill
So I wrote to God on my last dollar bill
My finances were nil
Please God, help me

I'm so poor
Send me something to wear
And something to eat
'Cause I want to cross over onto easy street
(Yes) I want to cross over onto easy street

I think I can see you through this fog of doom
You look like the type that rides on a broom
But can you tell me where I can rent a room
Please God, help me

Walking through the park at half-past nine
I met a bum who was drinking cheap wine
He said "Here have some of mine"
Please God, help me

Mister it looks like you've got money alright
I just wish you hadn't asked me to spend the night
I guess I'll go without a fight
Please God, help me
