Well I got a beat for your mama
Well I got a beat for your mind
Well you want to be what you wanna
Well you better reach deep inside
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind

Well I got a beat for your sister
Sister got a beat for mankind
See we got to love one another
See she's got the love that she finds
Deep inside
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind

Well you just turn it on
Turn it up, don't turn it down
And you want to belong
To the love from higher ground
Feel the love from higher ground

Well I got a beat for your brother
Well I got a beat for your kind
See you wanna reach one another
Well you better step, step in line, jump in time
Free your mind
