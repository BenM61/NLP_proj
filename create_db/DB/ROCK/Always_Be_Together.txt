When I look back on our early years
How we spent so much time in tears
It's a wonder that we're face to face tonight
But something saw us through all those times
Something stronger than you or I
Here we are and now it sure feels right

Oh, I, I have seen what your love has done for me
Oh, I could stay with you forever
Oh, I, I know love like this can't help but grow
That's why, we will always be together

And when I tried to live alone
I could have made it on my own
But part of me was missing
Yes and oh, all the words we used to say
How they just got in the way
Until we took the time to listen

Oh, I, I have seen what your love has done for me
Oh, I could stay with you forever
Oh, I, I know love like this can't help but grow
That's why, we will always be together
