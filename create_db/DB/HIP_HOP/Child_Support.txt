Bucka
I'll beat your badass

Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings
Nothin' but my chil'ren
One shot they disappearin'
Ain't no kings in this rap thing
They siblings
Nothin' but my chil'ren
One shot they disappearin'

Bitch niggas
Still wanna check my urine
Still can't believe
What you see and what you're hearin'
You motherfuckers
Thought you knew the whole story
Until your mama
Took a nigga on Maury

Read your test results
Are you the father
I looked at his bitch ass told him don't bother
I'm the father of this gangsta shit
Never thought that I have a bunch of bastard kids
Lil' bad ass kids
I whoop they ass every night
Send the paramedics bitch
And the black and white
I brought you in this world
I'll take you out
Do you ugly
So mama can't make you out
You know my style a colt
File a report
I'm a deadbeat daddy
No child support
You get fooled? like the last trick
Get it out your ass bitch
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
C'mon

Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings
Nothin' but my children
One shot they disappearin'
Ain't no kings in this rap thing
They siblings
Nothin' but my children
One shot they disappearin'

You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch

Y'all niggas know
Y'all bitches know
Where you get it from
Who's the original
You got your daddy's mouth
Talk like a criminal
Keep it gangsta son
Never get pigeon holed
Rap bastards tryin' to make a classic
Keep your dumb ass out of the casket
'cause in the *scope? and spend your money
They don't give a f*ck
About a dead rapper
Nigga they'll chop it up
Keep it movin' ya'll
They'll come mop it up
Corrupt LAPD cover up
Everyday nigga we know drama
They ain't lookin' for Osama
Ask Big E's mama
Thank God that the gangsta's back
We ain't got to put up with this brainless rap
May your lungs collapse in seas of funny
All you can rap about is pussy and money
C'mon

Ain't no other kings in this rap thing

Nothin' but my children
One shot they disappearin'

All y'all rappers should kiss and make up
Take your bullshit jewelry back to Jacob
Get your mind right nigga
And start to wake up
'cause the whole rap industry needs to shake up
You got million dollar niggas killin' million dollar niggas
Bustin' outta Bentleys
Wearin' chinchillas
There you go again rollin' in your limo
Comin' from the Grammy's shootin' out the window
I know the scripture
But there's something wrong with this picture
What you mad about
Diamonds all in your mouth
No car note nigga house paid off
I never heard of a rapper gettin' laid off
Boy you a fool
Or you just act crazy
Or you a grown crack baby born in the 80's
To all you motherfuckers say I went Hollywood
I'm gangsta
I know when I got it good

Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings
Nothin' but my children
One shot they disappearin'
Ain't no kings in this rap thing
They siblings
Nothin' but my children
One shot they disappearin'

You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch

Young rappers lookin' for pocket change
