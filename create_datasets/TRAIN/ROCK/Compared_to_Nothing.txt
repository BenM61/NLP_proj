It's hard to find a reason
To keep standing in the rain
I owe it to my heart to try again

Now I'm standing on the corner
In a town that's hard to face
'Cause it feels like I'm drifting
Through outer space

So was it in, was it out
Tell me what it's all about
Problems that appear so tall
Turn out to be so small
When you're left with nothing at all

I wanna wake up in the morning
Above these lonely streets
And feel you lying next to me

So was it black, was it white
Tell me, is it day or night
Problems that appear so tall
Turn out to be so small
Compared to nothing at all

So many people can tell you what's true
And the more that you listen
The more that we lose
You can feel it disappear

Was it in, was it out
Tell me what it's all about
Problems that appeared so tall
Turned out to be so small
Compared to nothing at all
At all, oh
