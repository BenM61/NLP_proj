Cannot fall, never do regret
Know just what is being said
Know the risk you take
Keep your head above it all
Sure you can fall
But not now you gotta prove
Something new, being you, being you

Can't feel, keep from asking why
Be the strongest at goodbyes
Know your place in life
Now expand your wings and fly
It reaches high but not,
Enough you seem to me
So incomplete, swept off your feet

And let me tell you they will always pull you down
Before you know it they will take your smile and push you around
They will fight and struggle
To blur and trouble
Your sense of solid ground

Cannot know, lose your self-control
Be and angel over all
Know your secret way
Laugh at everything they say
Will you remain the same?
And now you dare not see
What's letting go
Inside of me,is it me?

And they will always pull you down
Before you know it they will take your smile and push you around
They will fight and struggle
To blur and trouble
Your sense of solid ground

Keep your head above it all, sure you can fall
But not now you gotta prove

And they will always pull you down
Before you know it they will take your smile and push you around
They will haunt your every dream
They will make you come undone at the seams
And they will fight and struggle
To blur and trouble
Your sense of solid ground?

Keep your head above it all
Sure you can fall
But not now you gotta prove
Something new, being you, being you
