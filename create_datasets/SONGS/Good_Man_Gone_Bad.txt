I want you to stop right there, baby
Baby, and try to understand
Hey, I might have been your fool for a while, baby

But I know I'm a good loving man
And you shouldn't lie to me, baby
Makes me mad as a man can be
I know when you got home last night

Your kissing me was your plan
I know you were just faking me, baby
'Cause you'd been out with your other man

And you shouldn't lie to me, baby
Makes me mad as a man can be
Hey, I can't quit you, baby
'Cause you're honey but the bees don't know

There's one thing I got to tell you, little girl
Just one thing before I go
That is you shouldn't lie to me, baby
Makes me mad as a man can be
