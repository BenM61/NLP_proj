Oh, oh yeah, yeah,
She says I never listen and I'm inattentive to her emotions, yeah
I say she's got tunnel vision, only sees it her way,
So we never could work it out.
She's all ready to give up and move on, but I don't think she knows,
How I wish sometimes she could read my mind.

If she knew how bad I wanna make this work (yeah),
How my love belongs to her,
She wouldn't be able to walk away (never walk away).
If she knew how bad (how bad) I gotta have her close
(I gotta have her close),
If I ever let her go, I wouldn't make it a single day,
She would never have to escape
If she knew how bad

I've got yeah,
Gotta find a way to tell her how I feel before it is over oh,
I guess I could have done things better
I never should have let it get this far
She's all ready to give up and move on,
I don't think she knows
How I wish sometimes she could read my mind

If she knew how bad I wanna make this work (oh),
How my love belongs to her (her-are-r),
She wouldn't be able to walk away.
If she knew how bad (how bad) I gotta have her close,
If I ever let her go (oh-h-h), I wouldn't make it a single day
(not a single day),
She would never have to escape
If she knew how bad

The thought of loosing her ,'cause I did something wrong
Or 'cause I should have been there whenever she needed someone oh
It's a feeling that I know would kill me, 'cause
She's my heart, my soul, my love
I would never give her up

If she knew how bad (hey hey) I wanna make this work,
How my love belongs to her (oh),
She wouldn't be able to walk away (no, no, no).
If she knew how bad (how bad) I gotta have her close
(gotta have her close),
If I ever let her go (oh-oh-oh-oh),
I wouldn't make it a single day,
She would never have to escape
If she knew how bad

How bad I really love her
How bad, how bad,
If she only knew how,
How bad I really love her
I just can't live without her (oh oh)
If she knew how bad,
If she knew how bad
