Master, the tempest is raging
The billows are tossing high
The sky is o'er shadowed with blackness
No shelter or help is nigh

Carest Thou not that we perish?
How canst Thou lie asleep
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

The winds and the waves shall obey my will, peace be still
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons or men or whatever it be
No water can swallow the ship where lies

The Master of ocean and earth and skies
They shall sweetly obey my will
Peace be still, peace be still
They all shall sweetly obey my will, peace, peace be still

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief today
The depths of my sad heart are troubled
Oh, waken and save, I pray

Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul
And I perish, I perish, dear Master
Oh, hasten and take control

The winds and the waves shall obey my will, peace be still
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons or men or whatever it be
No water can swallow the ship where lies

The Master of ocean and earth and skies
They shall sweetly obey my will
Peace be still, peace be still
They all shall sweetly obey my will, peace, peace be still

Master, the terror is over
The elements sweetly rest
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored
And heaven's within my breast

Linger, o blessed Redeemer
Leave me alone no more
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor
And rest on the blissful shore

The winds and the waves shall obey my will, peace be still
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons or men or whatever it be
No water can swallow the ship where lies

The Master of ocean and earth and skies
They shall sweetly obey my will
Peace be still, peace be still
They all shall sweetly obey my will, peace, peace be still
