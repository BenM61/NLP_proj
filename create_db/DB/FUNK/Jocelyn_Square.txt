I wrote you a letter and I sent it on the first of July
Now it's November and still I haven't no reply
I'll be my birthday soon, if I don't see you I'll survive
But I would be happy, if you'd let me know you're still alive

I still live on Jocelyn Square, nothing much has really changed
I still think about you, but only really when it rains
Sometimes you don't know something's open till it shuts
I loved you so much, I hated your guts

You blinded me I refused to see your doubt
It's raining now
Raining on Jocelyn Square
It's raining now
Raining on Jocelyn Square

All the memories that flower and blossom
In the pale Endymion hour
They paint a picture of you
Too good to be true
And I hate myself for wishing, missing
Your soul kissing

All the things that once whet my appetite
Now bleed me dry, bleed me dry
Chasing rainbows and fireflies
To watch them fade away before my eyes

It's raining now
Raining on Jocelyn Square
It's raining now
Raining on Jocelyn Square

His smile lit up like a halo of despair
And the worst thing that could happen
Is the answer to his prayers

It's raining now
Raining on Jocelyn Square
It's raining now
Raining on Jocelyn Square
