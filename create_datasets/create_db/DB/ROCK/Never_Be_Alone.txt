Poor old forgotten fool
Do you have to do what you do
I agree that it hurts no one but you
But don't you think it gets us down?
To see your long sad frown 
We truly believe you'd be better off with us
So come...
Come to the land where anything belongs
No one else will let you know the truth

because we are your friends 
You'll never be alone again 
Well come on, well come on 
Well come on, well come on 
Because we are your friends 
You'll never be alone again 
Well come on, well come on 
Well come on, well come on 

take your time to decide
And keep it far from your eyes
Too many have failed to get this far
But don't let it get you down
We're doing all we can
We truly believe you're lovely when you're here

because we are your friends 
You'll never be alone again 
Well come on, well come on 
Well come on, well come on 
Because we are your friends 
You'll never be alone again 
Well come on, well come on 
Well come on, well come on
