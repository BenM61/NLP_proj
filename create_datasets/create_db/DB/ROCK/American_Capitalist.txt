I'm a red blooded
Rough neck
Son of a bitch
I'm a god damned
American capitalist
I've got a kill 'em all
Give a shit
License to hate
I'm that one shot
One kill
Bringer of pain

I don't wanna believe I'm empty
And I don't want to admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I've become
(When I'm)
I'm an American
Capitalist
American
Capitalist

Yeah war is the answer
Like I told you before
You're a coward
With no power
Just a stain on the floor
If you're a man
Be a man
Stop running your lips
Round three
No mercy
It's the way of the fist

I don't wanna believe I'm empty
And I don't want to admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I've become
(When I'm)
I'm an American
Capitalist

I don't wanna believe I'm empty
And I don't want to admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I've become

I don't wanna believe I'm empty
And I don't want to admit I'm wrong
