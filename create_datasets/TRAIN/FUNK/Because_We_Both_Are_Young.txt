Because we both are young, they say we're not in love
But what do they know of this feeling that we share
I wish that I could find a way to tell them
We're so much more than friends
And how much we really care for one another

Because we both are young, they just don't understand
They say the things we've planned are only foolish dreams
But, girl, they just don't know the way
We feel when we're all alone
Or just talkin' on the telephone, so close together

I don't know what they're thinkin' of
Do they think that love is just for them all alone?
No matter what they say, we're gonna stay
Together, and whatever, we'll do fine on our own

So, let them say that we'll grow up
And leave this all behind
But, girl, they must be blind
To the light in your eyes

But we don't need to prove a thing
To anyone, for we have just begun
And the best part of our lives is now
And all because, because we both are young

But we don't need to prove a thing
To anyone, for we have just begun
And the best part of our lives is now
And all because, because we both are young
