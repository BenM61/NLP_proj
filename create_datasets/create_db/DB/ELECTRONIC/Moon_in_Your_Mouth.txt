I'm alive
I feel your heartbeat
Moon in your mouth
We are perfection
Life and desire
I wanna stay here now
Every moment is a luxury

Just hold me now
And don't let go
You started something

I'm alive
I feel the blood
See stars in your eyes
Every cell in this shell
Lights a light

So, hold me now
And don't let go
We started something
We're alive

We're looking at the Moon
It's the same face we all see
