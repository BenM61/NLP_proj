I won't suffer, be broken
Get tired, or wasted
Surrender to nothing
I'll give up what I
Started
And stopped it
From end to beginning
A new day is coming
And I am finally free

Run away, Run away
I'll attack
Run away, Run away
Go change yourself
Run away, Run away
Now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll ah whoa

I would've kept you forever
But we had to sever
It ended for both of us
Faster than a,
Kill off this thinking
It's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now
But without you I can finally see

Run away, Run away
I'll attack
Run away, Run away
Go change yourself
Run away, Run away
Now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll ah whoa

Your promises
They look like lies
Your honesty's
Like a back that hides a knife
I promise you (promise you)
I promise you (promise you)
I am finally free

Run away, Run away
I'll attack
Run away, Run away
Go change yourself
Run away, Run away
Now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll attack
I will attack

Run away
I'll attack, I will attack
Run away
I'll attack, I will attack
Run away, run away
Now I'll attack, I'll ah whoa

Your promises (promises, promises)
I promise you (promise you)
I promise you (promise you, promise you)
