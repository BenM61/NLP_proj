Wanna get you home want make you moan
Wanna get you in my pleasure dome
Wanna make it hot
Get your pistol cocked
Gonna get ya if your ready or not

Wanna chew the fat
Wanna hit your back
What you say to that
Pardon me but please
On your hands and knees

Lets hit it hard
Now you're in charge
You wanna roll
Then take control
Get up on the floor
Show me what its for
Wanna score
Por favor
Come on rock it hardcore

Wanna bring it back sling back tickle fight
Wanna do it do it do it right
Make a women a man and a man can can
I think your mac needs a lot more ram
Be my moog and I'll twiddle your knob
Be my corn and I'll nibble your cob
Now take my apples and start to bob
You play the jewels and I'll grab and rob

Let's hit it hard
Now you're in charge
You wanna roll
Then take control

You wanna go
Then let me know
You want it bad
You never had it so

Get up on the floor
Show me what its for
Wanna score
Por favor
Come on rock it hardcore

Wanna hear ya hum my ding a ling
Gonna help ya stick but not cling
Let's break on out of this sing sing
Do me a favor and hold that thing

Some people think I'm a conduit
Wondering if I'm getting it
Well now ya know I don't have to prove it
Stay a while and I'll get to move it

Wanna feel your lust
I'm know I'm gonna bust
It's a must must must
Tell all the others to eat your dust

Let's hit it hard...

Get up on the floor
Shore me what its for
Encore
Gimme more
Meet me at my private door

Come on come on come on
Rock it hardcore
