Keep on running, keep on hiding
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
Who makes you understand
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be your man

Keep on running, running from my arms
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
Who makes you understand
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be your man

Everyone is laughing at me
Make me feel so sad
And everyone keeps talking about me
And make me feel so bad
Keep on running

Everyone is laughing at me
And make me feel so bad
Everyone keeps talking about me
Make me feel so sad

Keep on running, running from my arms
One fine day I'm gonna be the one
To make you understand
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be your man
Hey, I'll be your man

Let me feel alright
Yeah yeah
I'm gonna be your man
