Been working hard everyday
(9 to 5)
I need a place to get away
(Where I can feel alive)
Seems like my drama, it won't ever cease
(I had to stay away)
Now it's time to find my inner peace
(I'm coming out to play)

This will be my night
I will get up on this floor
And lose what's left of my mind
Let the rhythm take control

Step on up, let your body go
'cause I know you want to do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now

This party's got me feeling right, yeah
(I found a place to unwind, oh yeah)
I'm thinking 'bout myself tonight
(Relax and ease your mind)
Ain't holdin' back, I'm gonna let it go
(Throw all my cares away, yeah yeah)
Now I'll be sure to let my feelings flow
(I'm coming out to play)

This will be my night, yeah
I'mma get up on this floor
And lose the last of my mind
Let the rhythm take control

Step on up, let your body go
'cause I know you want to do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now

And you won't turn away
Gotta get on the floor
Let's go, before it's too late
Keep it movin' all night long

Step on up, let your body go
'cause I know you want to do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now
