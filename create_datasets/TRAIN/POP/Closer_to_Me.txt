One look, one touch, no chance
I know what you're thinking
Your move, you're mixed up, no choice
Say you get the meaning

And I'm not leaving here without you, baby
I like everything I've seen

Tonight we're just a little bit close
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be, yeah
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me

One day, one line untied
And we can talk it over
She's hooked, she's mine
I say stay a little longer

And I'm still waitin' on you, baby
And I've got anything you need

Tonight we're just a little bit close
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be, yeah
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me

Don't say, ya' too shy, hand jive
Anyway you want it
I'm here, all right, up tight
Ain't no doubt about it

And I'm not leaving here without you, baby
I like everything I've seen

Tonight we're just a little bit close
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be, yeah
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me

Tonight we're just a little bit close
Tonight it's just the way it's gonna be, yeah
Tonight I'm just a little bit closer
Tonight you're just a little bit closer to me
