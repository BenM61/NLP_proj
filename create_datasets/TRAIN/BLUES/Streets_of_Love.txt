You're awful bright, you're awful smart 
I must admit you broke my heart 
The awful truth is really sad 
I must admit I was awful bad 

While lovers laugh and music plays 
I stumble by and I hide my pain 
The lights are lit, the moon is gone 
I think I've crossed the Rubicon 

I walk the streets of love and they're full of tears 
And I walk the streets of love and they're full of fears 

While music pumps from passing cars 
A couple watch me from a bar 
A band just played the wedding march 
And the corner store mends broken hearts 
And a woman asks me for a dance 
Oh it's free of charge, just one more chance 

I walk the streets of love and they're full of tears 
I walk the streets of love for a thousand years 

Oh tell me now 
I, oh I walk the streets of love, yeah 
And they're drenched with tears, oh 

You had the moves, you had the cards 
I must admit you were awful smart 
The awful truth is awful sad 
I must admit I was awful bad 

And I walk the streets of love and they're drenched with tears 
And I walk the streets of love for a thousand years, oh 

I walk the streets of love and they're drenched with tears 
Oh every night, oh there's only one and not enough for him
Oh I, yeah and they're full of tears 
Oh everybody talk about it 
Everybody be walking down it 
Yeah but I found out, oh yes that I 

Oh yes I do 
Oh the streets of love, yeah, they're drenched, drenched with in tears
I, oh yeah I don't want to
