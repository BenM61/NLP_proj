Lately, I've been tryin' to fight whatever's pulling us under
It's got a hold and really making me wonder
What it takes to get through
I gotta stick with you, my baby
Baby, tell me
Maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
But being without you I can't imagine
It's just too close to the heart, and
And I won't stand it if were broken apart

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby

We've been cutting it close with the backwards and forwards
It's rocking the boat; we gotta get control of this
Let's take it back to three years ago
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Leaving was not an option, baby, never, never
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
In you is everything that I'm missing
So give us a chance

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby

Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go
We been on top for too long just to let it go under
I don't wanna hear that
I just can't hear that
And know
Wherever you wanna take me
I'll go
I been with you for too long to start over with another
I know that you hear me
Just tell me you hear me

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby
