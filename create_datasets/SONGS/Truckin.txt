We had to have something new,
A dance to do,
Up here in Harlem,
So, everyone start Truckin'.

As soon as the news got 'round,
The folks downtown,
Came up to Harlem,
Saw everybody Truckin'.

It didn't take long
Before the high-hats were doing it,
'Park Avenuing' it,
All over town,
You see them shufflin', shufflin', shufflin' down.

It spread like a forest blaze,
Became a craze,
Thanks to Harlem now,
Everybody's Truckin'.
