I'm dancing with my loneliness again
I'm dancing with my lineliness again 
Slowly to the music from within. 
I'm dancing with my lineliness again 
Feeling it can be my only friend. 
And I won't let myself go it's too near 
Too near to hear, near to hear... to hear

I'm dancing with my loneliness inside 
Knowing there's no place where I can hide 
Dancing with my lineliness inside 
There's no other place for me to hide 
And I won't let myself go out and cry 
I wonder why, I wonder why
I'm dancing, romancing
