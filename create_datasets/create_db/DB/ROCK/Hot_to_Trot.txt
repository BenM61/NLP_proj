She had a shake like a belly dancer
And a body like a tiger tiger (uh huh, uh huh)
She was looking at me 

Now you know that I ain't no dancer
But there's gotta be a way to meet her
So I just walked up to her and said
Are you hot to trot? 

Well I knew I was looking cool
Pretty sharp like a razor razor (uh huh, uh huh)
She was smiling at me 

So I said if you got the notion
We could take a little trip to the ocean
She said that'll be OK
Cause I'm hot to trot 

We were having a ball by the water
Talking about life and philosophizing (uh huh, uh huh)
She was really talking to me 

She said I can't understand why you gotta hustle
Struttin' and posin' and flexin' muscle
So I said, well that's easy baby
I'm hot to trot
