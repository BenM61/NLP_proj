Blues in my heart oh how it aches nobody knows the sorrow it takes
I should have known right from the start you'd leave me with these blues in my heart
Blues in my heart blue over you never believed you'd be so untrue
What can I do what can I say blues in my heart has got me this way

Oh everything's wrong since we're apart I wish I could lose these blues in my heart
