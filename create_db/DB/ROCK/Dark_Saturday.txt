Somewhere in the south of France
Or the Caribbean sea
She said "I don't need to make a living"
"Fake donors got nothing on me"

I meet her in the world below
She's a tourist of the world beneath
I said "everything, I've built from nothing"
She said "I'm so rich, everything's free"

So dark it ain't so dark
So dark it ain't so dark

Forever and ever
A torch in search of a flame
To be good, get better
Well I've been feeling this way
Forever and ever
A night in search of a day
As anxious as ever
In search of dark, dark, dark saturday

What's he getting away from?
While I'm worth your weight in gold
While we lie here in the sun
The whole wide world's about to explode

Now our bodies intertwine
And the truth is plain to see
I said "everything, I've built from nothing"
She said "don't you blame your problems on me"

So dark it ain't so dark
So dark it ain't so dark
So dark it ain't so dark

Forever and ever
A torch in search of a flame
To be good, get better
I'll change by staying the same
Forever and ever
A night in search of a day
As anxious as ever
It gets so, dark, dark, dark

Shine a light my way
Shine a light my way
Having such a dark, dark, dark, dark saturday
Shine a light my way

In search of
Dark, dark, dark dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark saturday
Dark, dark, dark dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday

Dark, dark, dark dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday
