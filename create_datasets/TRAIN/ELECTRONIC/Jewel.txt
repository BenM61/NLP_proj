Rare
This little thing that we got
So rare
I'll always be your rock

We get high, lost in the sky
Side by side
I was so low, dark inside

But now 
All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you
All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you

I used to have a heart of stone
Rolling, rolling, rolling on my own
But now
All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you
All of me

All of me
All of me

Stare (oh-no)
I got my eyes on you (on you)
So rare, oh
I dive in clouds right trough

We get high, lost in the sky
Side by side
I was so low, dark inside

But now 
All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you
All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you

I used to have a heart of stone
Rolling, rolling, rolling on my own
But now
All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you
All of me

All of me
All of me

All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you
All of me, all of me, all of me shines for you
