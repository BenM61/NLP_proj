You Keep on giving me the Hold up
You know I wish you'd make your mind up
'cause when we get it on its so-so
You use to be my Romeo

'cause you see my dear, I have had enough 
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
Your neurotic like a Yo-yo
You use to be my Romeo

Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)

You use to be my Romeo

You Keep on giving me the Hold up
You know I wish you'd make your mind up
'cause when we get it on its so-so
You use to be my Romeo

'cause you see my dear, I have had enough 
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
Your neurotic like a Yo-yo
Oh You use to be my Romeo

Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go
(You use to be My Romeo)

Let it go, let it all go

'cause you left me laying there
With a broken heart
Staring through a deep cold void
Alone in the dark
And I miss the warmth in the morning
And the laughter when I can't stop yawning
But the tears on the pillow have dried my dear
Gonna let it all go 'cause I have no fear

(Ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)
Let it all go(ro-me-o)

You used to by my romeo (ro-me-o)
You used to by my romeo (ro-me-o)
You used to by my romeo (ro-me-o)
You used to by my romeo (ro-me-o)
You used to by my romeo

Let it go oh oh oh
