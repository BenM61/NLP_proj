Flamed, the time when nearly changed
Still I was a slave, waiting to be saved
Dream, the body sleeps but I
Am not to proud to roll
On the back streets
So, so simple when you know
You'll know this when it's time to go

Strange, the sooner you leave behind
Lonely as you sold paradise
Scream, the body leaves the bone
To sit upon the throne
A better waits for life

Dream, dream your sins away
Sing your dreams away
Your holding back, still holding back Algier

Huh

Say you love me tonight
Save you love for me tonight
And I feel you now
I lie awake on the way of love
And I feel
But I

Heavenly demons outside my window
Sent here to see me outside this world
I call the shadow, you call the season
That's all it takes, woo ooo
