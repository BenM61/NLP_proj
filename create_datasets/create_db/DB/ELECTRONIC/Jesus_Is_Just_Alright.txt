Do do do dupe dupe
Do do do dupe
Do do do dupe dupem dupe dopem do
[Check it for me one time]
[Ohhhh, yeah yeah] 

(chorus)
Jesus is still alright with me
Jesus is still alright, oh yeah
Jesus is still alright with me
Jesus is still alright 

Toby Mac, and the Mac is back no slack
On a DC track that's jacked, beyond comprehension
I believe that I failed to mention that
There's a lack of recognition
When it comes to His position
Cause if Christ can't be crossed over,
Then I'll keep my beat up nova 

(repeat chorus 1) 

(chorus 2)
I don't care what they may say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care what they may say
Jesus is still alright 

Back in place, and I'm all up in your face
With a rhyme that I embrace, like a mother to her child
I'm kickin' it Jesus style
To the ones that think they heard
I did use the "J" word
Cause I ain't too soft to say it
Even if DJ's don't play it 

do do do dupe dupem dupe dopem do (3x)
Jesus is still alright
[Oh, I'm hopin' and I'm praying] 

Jesus is still alright
Jesus still alright, oh yeah
Jesus is still alright
Jesus is still alright
[oh yeah] 

(breakdown)
Jesus is alright, I know He's alright
Jesus is alright, you know He's alright
Jesus is alright, we know He's alright
Jesus is alright, we know He's alright 

[Now we come to the pay off] 

I'm down with the one that is known as the Son
Of the G to the O to the D never done
With the flow, in the know, on the go like a pro
Not for show cause I ain't in the biz for the dough
Or the me, or the ray, all the dough's gotta stay, 
Cause I can't, no I can't, take it home anyway
Never trite when I write cause the Lord is my light
And His Word is my bond so ya know, He's alright 

(repeat choruses 1 and 2)
