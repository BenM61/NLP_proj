Restless, so restless
Missin' you a baby
Is a makin' me a crazy and blue
Restless, so restless
Sittin' here wishin'
I was huggin' and a kissin' on you

Well, I wake up every hour
On the hour every night
Countin' down the minutes
Til you're here to hold me tight
This bed is full of empty
When I'm lyin' here alone
I got a deep desire
Baby come back home

Restless, so restless
Missin' you a baby
Is a makin' me a crazy and blue
Restless, so restless
Sittin' here wishin'
I was huggin' and a kissin' on you

Well, I've walked a hundred miles
Pacin' up and down the halls
Another pot of coffee and I'm bouncin' off the walls
Smokin' like a chimney cussin' up a storm
Damn, I need your lovin'
Baby come back home

I'm restless, so restless
Sittin' here wishin'
I was huggin' and a kissin' on you

Sittin' here wishin'
I was huggin' and a kissin' on you

Restless, so restless
Restless, so restless
