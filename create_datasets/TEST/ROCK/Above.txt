Inside I'm gone
You knew that all along
Without the distance you never get away

Plastic bag image
Is over now it's over now
The color fading is all the way to grey

We are strong but we're dumb
We look above

Trusting the instinct
Is not about what you think
The one reaction is only to obey

And I'm staring
All around not far down
Judge the distance from the ground and pray
We are strong but we're dumb
We look above
