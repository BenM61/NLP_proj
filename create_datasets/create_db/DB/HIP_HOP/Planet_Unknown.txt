Distress signal coming from
Beyond the depths of space and time
A long time had passed
Since the message was sent
It may be too late
They didn't understand or recognize
The true nature of the sign
That it was coming from
A possible future
A warning of what may have been

The Planet Unknown

And it's so strange
To experience
A phase transition of the mind
What we could do
And what we will do
That's a question for mankind
Chaotic clouds of signals crossing over
In and out of time
Paradoxical abstractions
Mix and mingle so sublime
