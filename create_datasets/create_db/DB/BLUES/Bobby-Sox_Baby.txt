My bobby sox baby
Just thrilled to rock n' roll
My bobby sox baby
Just thrilled to rock n' roll
Get a miserable feeling
When my baby do the stroll

She love to do the Chicken
She love to do the Duck
She love to do the Chicken
She love to do the Duck
If you can't dance these
Don't you know you're outta luck?

They wanna do a tag dance
Ain't gonna let my baby go
They wanna do a tag dance
Ain't gonna let my baby go
Gotta watch my baby
When she move across the flo'

No, no, no, no
No, no
Oh, no
No, no, no, no
No-ho
Ain't gonna let my baby go

My head is spinnin'
Just like a spinnin' top
My head is spinnin'
Just like a spinnin' top
She do the Zip, she do the Zorro
She even do the Turkey Hop
