People just don't know what I'm about
They haven't seen what's there behind my smile
There's so much more of me I'm showing now
(These are the pieces of me)

When it looks like I'm up sometimes I'm down
I'm alone even with people all around
But that don't change the happiness I found
(Theses are the pieces of me)

So when you look at my face
You gotta know that I'm made
Of everything love and pain
These are the pieces of me

Like every woman I know
I'm complicated for sho'
But when I love I love 'til there's no love no more
These are pieces of me

So many colors
(That make up the woman that you see)
A good friend and lover
(Anything you want yes I can be)
I can run the business and make time for fantasy
(These are pieces of me)

Now I'm gonna make mistakes from time to time
But in the end believe that I'm gon' fly
No matter if I'm wrong or if I'm right
(These are the pieces of me)

So when you look at my face
You gotta know that I'm made
Of everything love and pain
These are the pieces of me

Like every woman I know
I'm complicated for sho'
But when I love I love 'til there's no love no more
These are the pieces of me

Oh as the pieces of me start to unfold
Now I start to understand all that I am
A woman not afraid to be strong, strong

So when you look at my face
You gotta know that I'm made
Of everything love and pain
These are the pieces of me

Like every woman I know
I'm complicated for sho'
But when I love I love 'til there's no love no more
These are the pieces of me

I'm a woman
A woman
A woman
Woman
Woman

Yes I'm a woman
A woman
These are the pieces of me
