Lions always hit the heights
'Cause to kill it's always been an easy way out
Lions always hit the heights
'Cause to kill it's always been an easy way out

After a couple of drinks I think straight
Tears of joy sort the little girl out
Something you always wanted

And curvey lorraine always leads the way,
Admitting her love, it drips and drips
Something you always wanted

Gini,gini, look at me, gini
I let the stare that tries to cripple you
Slide down my back
Gini, gini, speak to me, gini,
I let the words they shove in front of you
Crawl right back

Lions always hit the heights
'Cause to kill it's always been an easy way out
Lions always hit the heights
'Cause to kill it's always been an easy way out

'Cause we take this world by storm
We don't look back
Let the stare that tries to cripple you
Slide down my back

'Cause the wheels keep us far apart
We can't look back
Let the words they shove in front of you
Crawl right back

Lions always hit the heights
'Cause to kill it's always been an easy way out
