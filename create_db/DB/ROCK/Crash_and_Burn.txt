I watched the sun come up on Portland 
I waved goodbye to all my friends 
I packed my car and headed to LA 
I gave away all my loose ends 

Somebody said you gotta get away 
To want to go back home again 
I left my universe standing there 
Holding the hand of my best friend 

And it's laughter that I feel when I think of you 
It's one more dusty rose about to turn 
I'll see you when I reach New Mexico 
If I'm in the mood to crash and burn 

I wrote a letter that I never mailed 
I rehearsed a dialogue in my head 
In case you ever wanted to track me down 
I'll take my cell phone to bed 

And it's laughter that I hear when I close my eyes 
And it's one more punchline I forgot to learn 
I call you up when my bottle's dry 
I'm on my way to crash and burn 

Antigone laid across the road 
And let a mack truck leave her there for dead 
Just because her lover split the scene 
Well love might be great but why lose your head 

Well, it's laughter that comes up when I cry for you 
And my heart may break again before it learns 
And I might be stupid enough to want to fall again 
'Cause I've gotten use to the crash and burn 

I say I've gotten use to the crash and burn
