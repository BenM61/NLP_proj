Everything is different today
I like it, like it
I feel very different today
I like it, like it

I'm not gonna be in your parade
'Cause I don't like it
You think I'm a dirty little game
You think I like it
You made up this fantasy with me
But I don't like it
I want you to get away from me
That's how I like it
How do you like it?

Today I'm gonna fly
There's nothing that can keep me on the ground
Touch the sky
I'm free inside

You think you're the master, I'm the slave
You think I like it
You don't even know me anyway
That's how I like it
I'm getting ready to move on
But you don't like it
You can kiss your fairy tale away
I like it, like it
How do you like it?

Today I'm gonna fly
There's nothing that can keep me on the ground
Touch the sky
I'm free inside
Today I'm gonna fly
There's nothing that can keep me on the ground
Touch the sky
I'm free inside

I'm free to do what I like
I'm celebrating my life
I'm free to be what I like
I'm celebrating my life
I'm gonna get what I like
I'm gonna celebrate 'till I die
I'm celebrating my life

Today I'm gonna fly
There's nothing that can keep me on the ground
Touch the sky
I'm free inside
Today I'm gonna fly
There's nothing that can keep me on the ground
Touch the sky
I'm free inside
