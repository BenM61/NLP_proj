You know I'm not much on words
But I've got to tell you how I feel
Open your eyes, don't try to hide my love
So hard to say but I think it's best
Gotta give your heart its time to heal
When you're ready, I'll be there

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

I'm serious when I tell you, Love
That little heartbreak
Is ten to a dime
Don't be afraid
Just turn the page my love
I'm curious when the day will come
I see my reflection in your eyes
Take your time and I'll be there

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

Only love, only love
Only love, only love

Looking through my eyes at the world
can't you see
Every time i see your face
There's a choice to be made

Walking hand in hand
Through the sands of time
As I peer into the past
Foreign steps are terrorizing

Watching what is now
There's a fork in the path
Of the future of your life
Which road shall you choose

Choices to be made
Past and present
It's not easy
But my love will let me die
Until your heart resurrects me

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

Sometimes I try
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I--Oh ah oh ah ohhhh ahh, Baby
I would even die for you
I would even die for you
I would even die for you

I will live or die--you choose....
