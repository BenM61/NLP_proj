Time rools on
N' that's as it should be
Here and gone
Seems to move so quickly

Man, we was happy
In our restless hearts
It was heaven Right here on earth
Yeah, we were laughin'
As we reached for the stars
And we had some
For what it was worth

Those were good times
Damn good times
Those were good times
Damn good times

Hey, take a look at this picture,
Can you believe that was you?
And who's that standin' there in the corner?
Not me!
Ah, the crazy things we used to do
Sure, we was acting like a couple of kids
Good to remember
You know that it is
I still feel it
Like the sun on my skin
Maybe that's better

Cause these are good times
Damn good times
Talkin' about good times
Damn good times

So it's one for the money
But that don't make the show
Count to three and I'll be ready
To follow that road (yes I will)

I see it comin'
Yeah, and this one is outs
We got heaven right here on Earth
Ain't nothin' like it
When you're reachin' for stars
And you grab one
For what it is worth

You can tell 'em
We'll be having good times
Damn good times
I'm talkin' good times (yes sir)
Damn good times
