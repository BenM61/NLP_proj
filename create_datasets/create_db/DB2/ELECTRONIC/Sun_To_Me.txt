So in in future lifetimes,
It's a certainty
That we'll again
Fit together perfectly

So in in future lifetimes,
It's a certainty
That we'll again
Fit together perfectly

You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me

I stumbled into you,
Accidentally
And yet,
Feels as though you were
Sent to me 
That we were meant to be
Together and grow with
Each other
Through the centuries

If my body was your mirror
You'd be able to see
Exactly,
What it is about you
That I'm addicted to
Helplessly you distract me
Like a mountain view of
Rivers crashing into the sea
Strangely,
You all seem familiar to me
Would so, love tie us
Together through eternity
So in future lifetimes,
It's a certainty
We will again
Fit together perfectly

You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me

So in future lifetimes,
It's a certainty
We will again
Fit together perfectly

You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me

If my body was your mirror
You'd be able to see
Exactly,
What it is about you
That makes me shiver,
You give me a soul fever
And I achieve
A new lever of greater

So in future lifetimes,
It's a certainty
We will again
Fit together perfectly
Perfectly
Perfectly
Perfectly
Perfectly
Perfectly

You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me

We do it so fervently
We do it so fervently
With your urgency
We do it so fervently

You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me

You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
You're the sun to me
