I watched him go where leaves were gold
And the air was smoky
The hazy days, the random ways
He was always walking

Do you remember my face?
Do you remember my face?
When I was sleeping
The tapes were all erased

When I was waking
Even the memories were replaced
Do you remember my face?
Do you remember my face?

Our hearts were strong, the world was young
And it was for the taking
He's waiting there beside the stairs
That's where he's always waiting

Do you remember my face?
Do you remember my face?
