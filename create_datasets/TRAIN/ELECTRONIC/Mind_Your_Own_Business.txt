Can I have a taste of your ice cream
Can I lick the crumbs from your table
Can I interfere in your crisis

No, mind your own business
No, mind your own business

Can you hear those people behind me
Looking at your feelings inside me
Listen to the distance between us

Why don't you mind your own business
Why don't you mind your own business

Can I interfere in your crisis
Can I have a taste of your ice cream
Can I have a taste of your ice cream
Can I lick the crumbs from your table
Can I lick the crumbs from your table
Can I interfere in your crisis

No, mind your own business
No, mind your own business

Listen to the distance between us
Can you hear those people behind me
Looking at your feelings inside me

No, mind your own business

Can you hear those people behind me
Looking at your feelings inside me
Listen to the distance between us

No, mind your own business
Why don't you mind your own business
Why don't you mind your own business
Why don't you mind your own business
