I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,
Alive as you and me.
Says I "But Joe, you're ten years dead"
"I never died" says he,
"I never died" says he.
In Salt lake city, Joe says I, in standing by my bed
"They framed you on a murder charge"
Says Joe "but I ain't dead"
Says Joe "but I ain't dead"
"The Copper Bosses killed you Joe,
They shot you Joe" says I.
"Takes more than guns to kill a man"
Says Joe "I didn't die"
Says Joe "I didn't die"
And standing there as big as life

And smiling with his eyes.
Says Joe "What they can never kill
Went on to organize,
Went on to organize"
From San Diego up to Maine,
In every mine and mill,
Where workers fight and organize,
It's there you find Joe Hill,
It's there you find Joe Hill!
I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,
Alive as you and me.
Says I "But Joe, you're ten years dead"
"I never died" said he,
"I never died" said he.
