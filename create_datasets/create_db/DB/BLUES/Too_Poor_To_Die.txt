Last night I had a dream
I dream I died
The undertaker came
To carry me for the ride
I couldn't afford a coffin
Embalmin' kinda high
I jumped off my death bed
Cause I too poor to die
I's in trouble
And I'll tell you the reason why
I'm just too poor people
I'm too poor to go lay down and die

I dream at the cemetery
I couldn't afford enough
To pay the gravediggers
To cover me up
It cost a lot of money
Cause they was union men
I guess before I die
I better think again
I'm in trouble
And I'll tell you the reason why
I'm just too poor people
I'm too poor to go lay down and die

Dream I met the devil
He is waitin' at the gate
Say "come on in Red
You ain't a minute late"
Said he lead me to his kingdom
Lead me by my arm
But he wouldn't move my body
Less I grease his palm
I's in trouble
And I'll tell you the reason why
I'm just too poor people
I'm too poor to go lay down and die
