When your day is long
And the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough of this life
Well, hang on

Don't let yourself go
Everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along

When your day is night alone
If you feel like letting go
When you think you've had too much of this life
Well, hang on

Everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts

Don't throw your hand
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

And everybody hurts, sometimes
And everybody hurts, sometimes
And everybody hurts, sometimes
And everybody hurts, sometimes

And everybody hurts
And everybody hurts
And everybody hurts
And everybody hurts
