I'll meet you at the gin-house
I wasn't walking that way
Here I'm lisping words so careful
I eat Viennas
Drunk parade
My drunk parade

I got my ears off a jackass
I cross my t's with black
I never ever knew there's a shyness
A shyness, also...
Help me out, to be sane
Help me out, to be sane

I was always a kitchen person myself (kitchen person myself)
I'll tell ya 'bout it, tell me when another shelf (aah)
Always a kitchen person myself (kitchen person myself)
I'll tell ya 'bout it, tell me when another shelf
I'll tell ya 'bout it, tell me when another shelf
I'll tell ya 'bout it, tell me when another shelf

I expect to be one who's safe
We're turning the heights in turn my hardcore against the wall
You will tease but I know I can talk...south central cities

Always a kitchen person myself (kitchen person myself)
