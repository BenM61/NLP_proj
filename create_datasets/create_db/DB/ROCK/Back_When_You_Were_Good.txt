I told you
Everyone's the same
But it's no use
It's no use
Lay it all to blame
At my door
That wont work no more
I've heard it all before
And I, I see you now
You have changed somehow
And I, I wish I knew you back then
Back when you were good

I know you
Better than you know yourself
And it's no use
You can't buy a new life off a shelf
It wont set you free
You're not fooling me
It's so sad to see
How you've changed your tune
And let go
You're like a vampire
You're soaking with bodies' blood
Oh how I wish I knew you back

When you were good
Back when you were someone
Back when you were good
Back when you were someone
When you were good,
You used to be so loud
You burned so bright
Your stars shined out so bright

You had it all right in the palm of your hand
And let it fall like a million grains of sand
You wear away to a place where nobody knew
Just who you are
And there's no one to answer to
No one to question the person you have become
And what have you done
What have you done
And you have gone to hide somewhere
Yeah you have gone to hide somewhere
