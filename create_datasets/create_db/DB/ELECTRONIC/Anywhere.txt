Deeper, I know you want it deeper
You know you want it deeper
I think we're going deeper
I know you want it

Faster, I know you want it faster
I know you want it faster
These days we're moving faster
I think we're moving

Further, I know we're going further
You know we're going further
Yeah, now we're climbing further
And I can see it

Warmer, yeah, now you're getting warmer
Feel like you're getting closer
Yeah, now you're getting so hot
Feel like you're burning

Surprise, surprise, you're on your own
It's in your eyes, the love's you've known
And the one's you loved
You lost completely

Darker, outside it's getting darker
Yeah, now it's getting darker
At last it's getting darker
And I can see it

Louder, yeah, now it's getting louder
The noise is getting louder
The night is getting louder
And I can hear it

Stronger and now you're going stronger
Yeah, now you're getting stronger
You're finally growing stronger
And I can feel it

Surprise, surprise, you're on your own
It's in your eyes, the love's you've known
And the one's you loved
You lost completely

So let yourself down tonight
Anywhere, I'll take you out tonight
Anywhere, put on that dress you like
Anywhere

The one with birds on it, they're flying around
Now when you're short of breath
Go anywhere and when your heart's in pieces
Anywhere, I'll take you out tonight
