My baby's always dancin'
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin'
And that's no lie

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good time
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightening leave me
My baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet

I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance

I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie

Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie

Sunshine
Moonlight
Good times
Boogie

Don't you blame it
You just got to
You just want to
Yeah
Blame it on yourself
Ain't nobody's fault but yours and that boogie
Dancin' all night long

Yours and that boogie
Ain't nobody's fault but yours
Dancin' all night long
