Coming home with the sentence saying 'I've missed you'
And to see your happy face again 
There is not a single moment that 
I ever think the thought 
Of not returning again 

Summer went and got pale once more 
A brand new city I have to explore
I have been searching for good answers and wisdom 
I keep on coming back with less, 'cause I've lost them 

She does not know that a part of me has left home
And it's never ever coming back 
There is nothing I can do with that
She does not know that a part of me has left home
And it's never ever coming back 
Never ever coming back

There's no sleep for the living nowadays 
Hanging in there with a steady course 
I can feel it from the back of my spine 
I am totally yours

Autumn comes I've seen it before 
Another town it's not that fun anymore 
I've been searching for those perfect answers 
I need you more right now than ever 

She does not know 
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
There is nothing I can do with that
She does not know
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
Never ever coming back

Coming home with the sentence saying 'I've missed you'
And to see your happy face again 

She does not know 
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
There is nothing I can do with that
She does not know
That a part of me has left home 
And it's never ever coming back 
Never ever coming back
