Imagination is funny, it makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey just as I think of you
Imagination is crazy, you whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy what to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss and then, and then
Find it's only your imagination again, oh well

Imagination is silly, you go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you 
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too
