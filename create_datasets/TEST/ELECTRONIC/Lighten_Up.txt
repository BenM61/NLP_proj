I can feel a storm brewing over nothing
We were having fun
There's no harm done there
You need attention 
I can see you're sulking
It's about time that you learn to share
 
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
I want to play
You're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
Just let it go
And I will throw you a lifeline
 
I don't what happened
To those resolutions
We think we found the truth at last 
When it escapes
Inside the mirror is a false impression
I can feel so swollen 
When I'm in good shape
 
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
I want to play
You're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
Just let it go
And I will throw you a lifeline
 
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
I want to play
You're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
Just let it go
And I will throw you a lifeline
 
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
I want to play
You're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up
It's gonna brighten up
Just let it go
And I will throw you a lifeline
