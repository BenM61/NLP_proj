Little prince livin' in a dream world
Using everybody at your beck and call
You could have it all
If you only knew who you really are

Little prince livin' in a fantasy
You're lonely, though illusion keeps you company
Take a look around
Does your little town exist
Or is it just too far from your reality

I know it can't be very easy
To be brought up treated royally
To have so-called friends all around
Who cater to you loyally
Don't it make you wonder 
As you listen for the thunder

Little prince though you may deny it
There's something in the quiet
Of your deepest soul
That's an empty hole
Though I know you don't
Want to hear it
You will never find your spirit 
Until you see and be
Who you really are

Little prince, oh, little prince
You know who you are
