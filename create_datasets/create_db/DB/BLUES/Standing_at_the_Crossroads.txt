Well I'm standin' at the crossroads,
With my head hung down and cryin'
Well I'm standin' at the crossroads,
With my head hung down and cryin'
Well I was thinkin' about my baby,
And I know she can't be found

I work hard for my baby,
And she treats me like a slave
I work hard for my baby,
And she treats me like a slave
Well she was be tired of livin',
I'll put her six feet in the grave

I was standin' at the crossroads,
And my baby's not around
Well I was standin' at the crossroads,
And my baby's not around
Well I began to wonder,
If this is Elmore's second down

I' standin' here waitin' baby,
With my heart right in my hand
I' standin' here waitin' baby,
With my heart right in my hand
Well I'm thinkin' about my baby,
And she's out with another man
