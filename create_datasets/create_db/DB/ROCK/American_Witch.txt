Body of a monkey and the feet of a cock,
Dragged from her home on the killing rock,
Black dog dying on the weather vain,
The Devil's in a cat and the baby's brain,

[Chorus]
The End - The End of The American,
The End - The End of The American,
The End - The End of The American Witch,

Alone on the hill and ready to die,
Cancer of darkness - blackend eye,
The mark of the wolf and the sign of the calf,
Angels bleed down above the raft,

We all pray for - 20 innocents,
We all bow down - 20 innocents,
We all hang high - 20 innocents,
We all accused - 20 innocents,

[Chorus]

Do you want to know where their dreams come from?
Some showed the faith and some showed none.

We all pray for - 20 innocents,
We all bow down - 20 innocents,
We all hang high - 20 innocents,
We all accused - 20 innocents,

[Chorus]

Do you want to know where their dreams come from?
Some showed the faith and some showed none.

The End - The End of The American Witch
