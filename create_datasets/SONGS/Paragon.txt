Pacifistic features
And damaged dreams
Endless hopes and promised treats
Pacifistic features

A futuristic sin
Hopeless matters 
An invisible thing
And all the beauty must die
And all the things that you said where a lie

Held the cup of passion
And learn from your mistakes
Smile when life decides
To take it back again 

Pacifistic features
And what lies beneath
A solution an end complete 
Pacifistic features

In a violent mind 
Hopeless matters 
A perfect crime
And all the beauty must die
And all the things that you said where a lie
