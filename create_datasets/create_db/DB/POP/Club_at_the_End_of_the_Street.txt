When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand
There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Oh, where we meet
Oh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye
In this smoky room
There's a jukebox, plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Oh, where we meet
Oh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
Lord, have mercy
Ooh, you can't sit still
Oh, you can't sit still

Oh, that's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Ooh, where we meet
Where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Oh, oh, yeah
You can't stand still
Where we meet
In the club at the end of the street
You can't stand still
Where we meet
In the club at the end of the street
You can't stand still
Where we meet
At the club at the end of the street
Where we meet
Where we meet
At the club at the end of the street
