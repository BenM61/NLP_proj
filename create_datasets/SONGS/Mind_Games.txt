I foresee it's true, that you would love me better
If I couldn't screw
All your moves that make me wanna run away
But I got stuck with faulty legs
I believe it's true that you would screw me
If I let you in my bedroom
And if I did then do I try to move away?
'Cause I know you like mind games

Do I ever have to notice?
I've been standing here and I don't know why
Did you ever even see me try?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
See me now, see me now, oh, see me now?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Better look amusing 'cause my addiction to
These contradictions make it confusing
And if I walk away I'm scared I will find other muses
'Cause I know you like olden days
I don't understand, you claim that I'm a handful
When you show up all empty-handed
The way you say you love me
Like you've just been reprimanded
'Cause I know you like mind games

Do I ever have to notice?
I've been standing here and I don't know why
Did you ever even see me try?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
See me now, see me now?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
Do you-oh-oh, see me now?
See me now, see me now, see me now?

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

Do you, oh, oh
Do you, oh, oh
Do you, oh, oh
See me now, see me now, see me now?
