If only I could read your mind
I could heal your broken heart
I could mend you when your falling apart

I want to love you
I want to care
But there's not a thing that I can do
Not until you say that you want me there
And that you want me to love you forever
I know it's what you want
Though it's easy to say that you don't

I know you want to
Girl I know you want to
I am not ashamed to say to you
(You're all I ever wanted)
I know you want to
Girl, I know you want to
So turn around
Come to me now
Is it worth it all if there's no love

No.no no no no love...
I hear your heartbeat
I feel you shiver
And in the stilness of the night
(I can hear the angels saying to me)
She wants to love you
She wants to care
But she's so afarid of a broken heart
(She's afraid to dall0
Will someone be there

We'll I'll pick you up and put you together
I know it;s what you want
Though you constantly say that you don't

I know you want to
Girl I know you want to
I am not ashamed to say to you
(You're all I ever wanted)
I know you want to
Girl, I know you want to
So turn around
Come to me now
Is it worth it all if there's no love

Do you spend every moment
Trying to hide out
From the way you know you truly feel
And is it really real... You know
How can you keep denying
That you really love me
You can try to fool somebody else
But your lying to yourself

I know you want to
Girl I know you want to
I am not ashamed to say to you
(You're all I ever wanted)
I know you want to
Girl, I know you want to
So turn around
Come to me now
Is it worth it all if there's no love

No love
No love doo doo do doo
Yeah...
