All the best is yours and more
The world is knocking at your door
First class
Breaking through in all you do
The leader of the fresh & new
You're a genius
From the bottom to the top
You made yourself
You never stop
You're an a-plus
You look too young to be alone
You seem so sad
And your smile is gone
So I have to ask
Hey, do you love enough baby?
Oh, do you love enough baby?
Hey, do you love enough baby?
Oh, do you love enough baby?
On your way to reach your dreams
You had it rough you had it lean
So tough, too tough
You had faith you made your move
You found your way into the groove
To trust enough
Did you ever ask yourself
Is so much work good for your health?
What do you deserve?
You choose your road you're on your own
Without a lover to call your own
What's it really worth?

Have you asked yourself lately
Do I get enough lovin' in my life?
Could you be makin' a mistake here
Maybe you better think twice
Do you really want to be lonely
Could you use a little company
Have you ever asked yourself lately
Do I get enough love for me?

Ride on
Ride on ride on
Ride on ride on
There's a stop light up ahead
It appears to be reading red
So I stop to see
Which way is best for me
Many avenues go east and west
Which will I choose
The right or left
'cause I got no time to lose
You see I must be free
I'll head for the east
Where I'll find peace, where I'll find peace
As I pump two tune
Underneath the moon
Going through the night till sunrise
As I ride, as I ride on
Ride on
Bumpa to bumpa groovin'
Ride on
Bumpa to bumpa groove
Ride on
Bumpa to bumpa groovin'
Ride on
Bumpa to bumpa groove
Now the journey has begun
As I'm breezin' into the sun
Still I wait to see
Which way is best for me
Many avenues go east and west
Which will I choose
Going forward
No turning back for me
I'll head for the east
Where I'll find peace, where I'll find peace
As I pump two tune
Underneath the moon
Going through the night till sunrise
As I ride, as I ride on

Have you asked yourself lately
Do I get enough lovin' in my life?
Could you be makin' a mistake here
Maybe you better think twice
Do you really want to be lonely
Could you use a little company
Have you ever asked yourself lately
Do I get enough love for me?
