I am the public highway, baby
I'm no place for pretence or protocol
I could take you
By way of a garden city
I could run you along
The Libido del Sol

I am this street now
I am the street where you live
See me from your window
And be a fugitive

Back of beyond the horizon
I cut and stretch
The outer space of open air
If there's somewhere
You just have to be, babe
Oh let me be your thoroughfare

I am this street now
I am the street where you live
See me from your window
And be a fugitive

There is a pale swamp
A glacier
Waxy crystal car
And the smell of wood smoke
Is on the evening breeze
And your engine's humming
Like a pleasure boat
In the distance of the heat
Tearing the blossom off the trees

We pass by Pere Lachaise
And broken fences
We pass hospitals
In the San Fernando Valley
And all of my tricks
And turns and inclinations
You can't find them in your Rand McNally

Live now, live a thousand other lives
Live now, and learn the secret names of time
Live now, all at once and forever
Live now, and you'll be all mine

I am this street now
I am the street where you live
See me from your window
And be a fugitive
