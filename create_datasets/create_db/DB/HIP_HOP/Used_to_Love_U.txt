Holla holla haaa

Maybe it's me, maybe I bore you
Oh no, it's my fault 'cause I can't afford you
Maybe, baby
Puffy, Jay-Z
Would all be better for you
'Cause all I could do was love you

Baby when I used to love you (there's nothin' that I wouldn't do)
I went through the fire for you (anything you asked me to)
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to

Holla holla holla haaa (yeaa)
Holla holla holla haaa (yea, yea)

Now maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss
But you are the cause
'Cause all I could do was love you

Baby when I used to love you (there's nothin that I wouldn't do)
I went through the fire for you (anything you asked me to)
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to

Holla holla holla haa (yeaa)
Holla holla holla haa

Do you remember (I used to) when I used (love you) to (used to) love you (love you)?
Baby no, not anymore (I don't love you)
(Used to love you) I love you
And you're gonna miss me now

Baby when I used to love you (there's nothin that I wouldn't do)
I went through the fire for you (but I'm not gonna play the fool)
And I can't live this lie
I can't justify
And I can't make you my wife, I don't love you
Not like I used to

Holla holla holla haa (not like I used to)
Holla holla holla haa (not like I used to)

Oh I used to love you (used to love you)
Oh but I don't love you (I don't love you)

I used to love you (used to love you)
Oh but I don't love you (I bet you miss me 'cause I)

I used to love you (you miss me 'cause I)
I used to love you (I bet you're miss me now 'cause I, I don't love you)
