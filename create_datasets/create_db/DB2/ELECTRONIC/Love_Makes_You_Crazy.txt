I was reading in a history book,
Before the seventh war,
They used to have a thing that they called love,
That we don't have any more.
I don't know the feeling,
But I'm told it was an evil thing,
It used to make you crazy and fall down,
No one knows what it could bring.

Love makes you crazy,
Love makes you cry,
Love made them crazy in days gone by.
Love makes you crazy,
That's what they say,
Love made them crazy in the olden days.

It must have seized the body and the mind
Like a strong disease,
Another plague that science has erased
Even from the memory.
Or maybe evolution wiped it out
So just the strong survived,
And no-one with that feeling could exist
In the race to stay alive.

Love makes you crazy,
Love makes you cry,
Love made them crazy in days gone by.
Love makes you crazy,
That's what they say,
Love made them crazy in the olden days.

Love makes you crazy,
Love makes you cry,
Love made them crazy in days gone by.
Love makes you crazy,
That's what they say,
Love made them crazy in the olden days.
