Ain't it lonesome when the one you love is gone?
Ain't it lonesome when the one you love is gone?
Well, you cannot help but to worry
I know you're bound to weep and moan

My night are lonely and my days are plenty blue
My nights are lonely and my days are plenty blue
Well, I can't find no contentment
No matter what I do

Umm, if I could just explain
Umm, if I could just explain
Well, but I'm upset and I'm bothered
And my heart is full of pain

Come back, baby, and I won't be bad no more
Come back, baby, and I won't be bad no more
Well, I will string along with you, baby
No matter where you go
