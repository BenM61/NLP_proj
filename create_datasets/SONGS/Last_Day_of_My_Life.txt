It's the first thing in the morning
The last thing late at night
I get overwhelmed with sorrow'
I know' I won't survive

I'm feeling that you're leaving
Just when the time is right
And I know there's no tomorrow
Will I ever see the light

You said it's forever
What did I do
Do you remember
I meant everything to you

You said you'd always love me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying now it's time to die
You swore you'd never leave me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying that you'll change
Your mind tonight

Oh I don't know
Where it started
But I know where it will end
And I pray that you'll still love me
Cause my life is in your hands

I'm lost inside without you
I hope you are as well
And I feel my soul is stranded
Alone in this living hell

You said it's forever
What did I do
Do you remember
I meant everything to you

You said you'd always love me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying now it's time to die
You swore you'd never leave me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying that you'll change
Your mind tonight

Now I'm still waiting
Alone bore in the dark
Collecting all the pieces
Of another foolish heart

You said you'd always love me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying now it's time to die
You swore you'd never leave me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying that you'll change
Your mind tonight

In the night when you told me you never let me go
In the night I'm still waiting for you
To hold me, you to in the night you will hold me and tell me we will go
And never let me go
And never let me go
