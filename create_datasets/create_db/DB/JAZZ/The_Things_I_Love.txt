The glow of sunset in the summer skies
The golden flicker of the fire flies
The gleam of love light in your lovely eyes
These are the things I love

A silver moonbeam peeping through the trees
A bed of tulips nodding in the breeze
The look you you give in answer to my pleas
These are the things I love

Oh! once I thought that life was just a winter thing,
My heart was cold
And then you came to me and like a breath of spring
You turned the silver snow to gold

A robin's serenade when day is through,
The babbling brook beside our rendezvous
Your sweet voice whispering "Darling, I love you"
These are the things I love
