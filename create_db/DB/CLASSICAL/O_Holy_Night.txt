O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of
Our dear savior's birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till he appeared
And the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, o night
O night divine

(O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of
Our dear savior's birth)

Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within hearts
Praise his holy name
Christ is the Lord 
Then ever, forever praise we
Noel, Noel, o night, o night divine
O night divine, o night
O Holy night
