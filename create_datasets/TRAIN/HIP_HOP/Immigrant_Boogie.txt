No one knows how many on the boat
Violent skies won't show us where to go
Huddle close, we wanna shall we jump?
Kind of sad ? they buy from

Oh, let us in
We never bite
Me and the four kids, show some love
Then it will all be right
We won't stay
Grand promise in every way
It's just the boat's going down
And I don't think we wanna stay
Immigrant boogie

I was dreaming of a better life
With my two kids and my lovely wife
But I can't swim and water's in my lungs
So here it ends, well, life has just begun

Oh, let us in
We never bite
Me and the four kids, show some love
Then it will all be right
We won't stay
Grand promise in every way
It's just the boat's going down
And I don't think we wanna stay
Immigrant boogie

Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
Immigrant boogie
