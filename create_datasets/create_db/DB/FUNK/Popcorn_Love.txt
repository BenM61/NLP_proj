Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know 
It's the real thing, girl 

They say it's popcorn love 
But it's more than that to me 
Popcorn love 
Just wait, they will see 
It's popcorn love 
Every morning, noon and night 
Popcorn love 

Don't you know, don't you know 
It's the real thing, girl 

When we go on those special dates 
We're always holding hands 
We're never, ever late 
You're on my mind all the time 

I keep thinking (I keep thinking) 
Thinking (I keep thinking) 
I keep thinking, thinking of you

Popcorn love 
But it's more than that to me 
Popcorn love 
Just wait, they will see 
Popcorn love 
Every morning, noon and night 
Popcorn love 

Don't you know, don't you know 
It's the real thing, girl 

I go to school and then I come straight home 
The first thing that I do is call you on the phone 
The things you say, uh, really make my day 
I need you, girl, in every kind of way 
I keep thinking 
I'm just thinking 
I keep thinking (thinking) 
Thinking (thinking) thinking (thinking) thinking 

That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 

Ah, P is for her personality 
I said the O is for originality 
And the other P is for the perfect love she gives to me 
The C is just 'cause she loves me 
And the O means she's the only love I got 
And the R and the N, our love will never end 

Well, I know, I know it's the real thing 
Because she told me so 
And I know, I know it's the real thing 
And I'll never let her go 

I just got to, I just got to have your love 

Popcorn love 
But it's more than that to me 
Popcorn love 
Just wait, they will see 
It's popcorn love 
Every morning, noon and night 
Popcorn love 

Popcorn love 
It's more than that to me 
Popcorn love 
Just wait, they will see 
Popcorn love 
Every morning, noon and night 
Popcorn love 

Popcorn love 
But it's more than that to me 
Popcorn love
