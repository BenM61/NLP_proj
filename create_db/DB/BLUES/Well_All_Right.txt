Well all right so I've been foolish
Well all right let people know
'bout the dreams and wishes that you dream
In the night when lights are low

Well all right, well all right
You know we'll live and love with all our might
Well all right, well all right
You know our lifetime love will be all right

Well all right so I'm not working
Well all right let people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes their way
