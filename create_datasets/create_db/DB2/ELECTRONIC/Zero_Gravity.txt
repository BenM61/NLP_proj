Feels like coming home
After traveling a million miles
I am not alone
Searching for the starlight in the darkest skies

A complex surface
Laid out right before our eyes
Everything makes sense
Now that you are by my side

I'm as light as I can be
You got me feeling weightless
You take me on an odyssey
You got me feeling weightless

You make me float free
My love for you is endless
No ties are binding me
Oh I'm in zero gravity

Now I'm in zero gravity
Oh I'm in zero gravity

All the pain in me
No more needs to be expressed
Feels like I can breathe
You lift a burden off my chest

Traces of sadness
No more chain me to the ground
I am limitless
Ever since you came around

I'm as light as I can be
You got me feeling weightless
You take me on an odyssey
You got me feeling weightless

You make me float free
My love for you is endless
No ties are binding me
Oh I'm in zero gravity

Now I'm in zero gravity
Oh I'm in zero gravity
Now I'm in zero gravity
Oh I'm in zero gravity

I'm as light as I can be
You got me feeling weightless
You take me on an odyssey
You got me feeling weightless
