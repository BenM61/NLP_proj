Hey, hey, we keeping it real, samba baby

[Chorus]
If you need love I'm loving, if you need a thug I'm thugging, if you need a hustla,
Whatever you need girl ima hold you down,
If you need a lil' dough we flipping got somewhere to go I'm whipping,
Be a love hustla whatever you need girl ima hold you down

Bun B da ima man amongst men my chain is white gold my steel is Tungsten 
I'm made of tough skin you gon' respect me
(hold up) take mo then a average nigga to check me 
I'm a rider till the wheels go balling they blow out
(damn) one hundred and one percent G and its no doubt 
That if you need a man to make you feel secure then baby
You ain't gotta look no more I got the cure

You want money and jewels (jewels) 
You want clothes and cars (cars) 
Wanna live VIP rubbing shoulders wit stars (stars) 
Wanna fly in G4's (4's) 
Or sail the seas then your wish is my command 
You can do what ya please (hey) 
The lap of luxury is what you'll be laying in just respect 
The playa and the game that hes playing in (for real) 
I can show you a side of life you never seen (huh) 
Cause even the king of trill needs himself a queen

[Chorus]

See all that listening to them hoes in your ear gotta quit 
I see they smile when I'm around when I leave
They talk shit they just mad cause I got you flipping jagos 
Popping tags brand new clothes you cant tell by the tag 
I don't mean to boast and brag but them hoes around you hating 
They just waiting on you to slip so I could leave yo ass with nathan 
Then when I do that they gon' back door and try to holla 
Hoping I'm a do them like you and drop them off some dollas 
But I ain't cause I can't afford to go back down that road 
Id rather stay on my J-O and stack a bank roll 
But I ain't cause I cant afford to go back down that road 
Id rather stay on my J-O and stack a bank roll 
But if you real and you down and in public you don't clown holla at me ill be around
(mike Jones) but if you real and you down 
And in public you don't clown holla at me ill be around Yea

[Chorus]

I been putting it down nigga and holding my grounds 
Nigga from off the mound nigga we ducking them clowns
Nigga taking they crown nigga and shoving the town 
Nigga rocks off the ground got the cush by the pounds
Nigga ankle blingin' baby wrist on freeze got 
The pinky on the ice love a bitch wit gold teeth nigga hot
Girl nigga loving the G keep the work under the seat 
She do it for me take a trip to port her off to the beach 
Tell her homie hold it down cause we hustle to eat 
And got me feeling like I lost my Jones I done lost my horns 
So H town is on and nothing change 
Cause the palms got chrome nigga do this in the early 
Cause we getting it on and baby girl you could shop alone 
And fly the four to France and take a hundred bones

[Chorus]
