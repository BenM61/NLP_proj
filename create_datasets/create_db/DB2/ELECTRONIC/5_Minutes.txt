I need a dream where I can live what I said
I need a place where I can put my head
I need a whole where I'll find darkness now
And if you hassle me mister I might just
Loose my head

Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead

They came on a Saturday night
They killed his cat and they raped his wife
And in their eyes there was fear and hate
And when they spoke they spoke with knives

Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead

Some say that I should hate them all
But I say that wouldn't help at all
I just want to find those guys that's all
I just want to find those guys that's all
That's all that's all

Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead

The night time comes and the streets they ring
With the fears of a thousand things
But if you worry about your ports of call
You'll never get nothing done at all

Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead

Some say that I should hate them all
But I say that wouldn't help at all
I just want to find those guys that's all
I just want to find those guys that's all
I just want to find those guys that's all
That's all
