Trying to win your confidence just wears me down
Trying to win your love will wear me out
You've been loved by many girls but left by only one
It made you doubt; it made you doubt

There are those of us who try to use a boy
But there is nothing further from my mind
As you will find
Brotherly love won't do no harm

A brotherly kiss on the cheek will only bring me comfort
Brotherly love ain't all I need
So if you love me in awhile
I'll put away your brotherly smile

Put a little trust in me and give again
You can let your reservations go
Put a little fire in the way you say hello
And I will know; yes I will know

Have a drink and make a resolution
Resolve to put yourself into my hands
Into my hands
Brotherly love won't do no harm

A brotherly kiss on the cheek will only bring me comfort
Brotherly love ain't all I need
So if you love me in awhile
I'll put away your brotherly smile

Brotherly love won't do no harm
A brotherly kiss on the cheek will only bring me comfort
Brotherly love ain't all I need
So if you love me in awhile

I'll put away your brotherly smile
