And my heart goes boom boom boom
And my heart goes boom boom boom, ay

I don't need no doctor treating me (no no no)
I don't need no pills or therapy (no no no)
Freud might work for some
But that just ain't for me
I don't need no shrink
If you're just comin' back to me

'Cause when I'm with you baby 
I'm feeling less confused
And my heart goes boom boom boom
And my heart goes boom boom boom, ay

I don't need to cross the seven seas (no no no)
I don't need to write a masterpiece (no no no)
And I don't want to play a role
On a fancy silver screen
I don't want to die alone
Oh rich and unhappy

'Cause when I'm with you baby
My whole world starts to bloom
All I ever want to do
Is to lay here next to you
When I'm with you baby
I'm feeling less confused
And my heart goes boom boom boom
And my heart goes boom boom boom

'Cause I need a little ah ah (boom boom boom)
And I need a little ah ah (boom boom boom)

'Cause when I'm with you baby
I'm feeling less confused
All I ever want to do
Is to lay here next to you
When I'm with you baby
My whole world starts to bloom
All I ever want to do
Is to spend my time on you
'Cause my heart goes boom boom boom
And my heart goes boom boom boom
And my heart goes boom boom boom

And my heart goes boom boom boom
And my heart goes boom boom boom
And my heart goes boom boom boom
'Cause I need a little hah ah (and my heart goes boom boom boom)
And I need a little ah ah (and my heart goes boom boom boom)
And I need a little ah ah, mmm (and my heart goes boom boom boom)
I need a little ah ah (and my heart goes boom boom boom)
Yah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, my heart goes boom every time you're in the room
My heart goes boom, boom boom boom
My heart goes boom every time you're in the room
Yeah, whoo
My heart goes boom, boom boom boom
My heart goes boom every time you're in the room
And my heart goes boom boom boom
