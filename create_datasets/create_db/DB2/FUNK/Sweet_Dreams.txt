Sweet, sweet dreams I have of you
Every night, night after night I have to go through
Why can't I forget about you and start my life over you
Instead of having, always having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me, you don't love me, it's plain
I should have known that I could never, never wear your name
I know, I should hate you, hate you the whole night, the whole night through
Instead of just having, always having sweet dreams about you

I know, I know, I should hate you, I should hate you the whole night through
Instead I keep having, always having sweet dreams about you
Oh baby, baby
