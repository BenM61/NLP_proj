Tell me that the casual panics will give in
When I hear a scream but my friend she'll zero in
So if anybody could prove what god must know
I tell myself the chances of suffering are slim.

I'm settled in this fog
You can't quit just stay on your feet
One day you'll see the blood of a ?
So will you sleep, will you be swept
It's just so hard to believe there's a way out of here.

Face the blood again
Face the blood again and again
Face the blood again
Face the blood again and again
And again and again

I didn't ever think I'd be sleeping with the sharks.
Now everybody said I'd be perfect for the part.
So if anybody remembers my old name
Tell everyone that I know that I'll always be the same.

My mother spoke the truth
She outlived all the men in the street
We hided all the blood on the floor
It's come to this, so go resist
It's just so hard to believe there's a way out of here.

Face the blood again
Face the blood again and again
Face the blood again
Face the blood again and again
And again and again and again
And again and again
