I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve
I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you mean
Oh oh oh

And now, I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
Like some kind of madness
Was taking control
Yeah

And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you need
Mm

And now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care)
But I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light)
I have finally realized (Realized)
I need to love
I need to love

Come to me,
Trust in your dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I have known, I can be wrong
Maybe I'm too headstrong
Our love is
Madness
