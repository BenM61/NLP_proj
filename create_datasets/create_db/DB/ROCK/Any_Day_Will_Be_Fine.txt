I love the sun
And the hi-lights in your hair
They turn me on

And if you wanna go
Just go we'll run away
'Cause I don't mind

Any day will be fine
Anyway will be fine
Still some distance to run
We keep movin' on

You say it's wrong
But it feels so right to me
You know it's true

And all these things
Are just a state of mind
You know it's true

Any day will be fine
Anyway will be fine
Still some distance to run
We keep movin' on

Any day will be fine
Anyway will be fine
Still some distance to run
We keep movin' on
