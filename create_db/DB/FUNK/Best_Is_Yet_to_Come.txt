Give me the sun
I'll give you the moonlight
Love will set us free
If we just believe the best is yet to come

[Chorus]
Show me your smile
I'll fill it with laughter
That will light your mind
As long as we believe
The best is yet to come

Can you see what I see
On the road ahead
Do you know 
there's a new life there 

Waiting there
Give me your world
And I'll give you heaven
Love will set us free
As long as we believe
The best is yet to come

[Chorus]

Give me the sun
And I'll give you moonlight
Yes I will?

Can you see what I see
On the road ahead
Do you know 
there's a new life there 

Waiting there
Give me the world
And I'll give you heaven
Love will set us free
As long as we believe
The best is yet to come

Baby don't you know that 
As long as we believe
The best is yet to come
Oh?
Play it now?

Break
I will give you love and understanding
If you show me your love
Hey, hey
Give me the sun
Show me your smile
Give me your world 
Baby ah, ah?
I'll be what you want me to be 
(Yeah)
I'll give you moon light
I'll fill you with laughter
I'll give you a
Hey, hey, hey, hey?
The best is yet 
To come
