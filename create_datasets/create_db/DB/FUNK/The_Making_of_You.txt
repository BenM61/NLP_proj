Hey
I wanna talk to you
Now woman, I know you don't know ways feel appreciated us, man
But we do appreciate you, you know, we may not say it to show it all the time,
But this is one of those songs, that you should turn up loud, listen.

Sometimes I take advantage of
Always, having you here with me
But don't think for a second love
That I, don't see how much, how much you do for me
From the way you kiss me every morning to just being there when I need you up here
And all I can say to you 

Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut

You can't always depend on love , no, no-no-no
It means more than that for our relation ship to work
That's when you come in, you make all this work by understand me 
Girl you don't have to say you love me, 'cause you show it everyday just what I need to you, to do

Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
Tut-tut-ut-tut
