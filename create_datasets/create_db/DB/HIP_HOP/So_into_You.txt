With every passing moment
Thoughts of you run through my head
Every time that I'm near
I realize that your heaven sent, baby
I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me boy
There's no one like you around, oh baby

I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

It could be that way you hold me
It could be the things that you say
(that you say)
Oh I'm not sure what it is boy
But I know I like feeling this way

I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
let's stay together, you and be boy
There's no one like around, oh baby

I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
