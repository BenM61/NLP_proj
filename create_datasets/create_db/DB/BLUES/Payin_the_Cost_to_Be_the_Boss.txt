You act like you don't want to listen
When I'm talking to you
You think you outta do baby
Anything you want to do
You must be crazy baby
You just gotta be outta your mind
As long as i'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

I'll drink if i want to
And play a little poker too
Don't you say nothing to me
As long as I'm taking care of you
As long as I'm workin baby
And payin' all the bills
I don't want no mouth from you
About the way I'm supposed to live
You must be crazy woman
Just gotta be outta your mind
As long as i foot the bills
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

Now that you got me
You act like you ashamed
You don't act like my woman
You just usin' my name
I tell you I'm gonna have all the money
And i don't want no back-talk
Cause if you don't like the way I'm doin'
Just pick up your things and walk
You gotta be crazy baby
You must be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss
