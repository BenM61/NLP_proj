Lucy worked a different club every day
And though she put her mind to it
Her heart was never in it
She stayed around just long enough to get paid
She won't pass the time with you
She can't stay a minute
And all these changing faces never bothered her at all
That just existed like a back-drop
Or a pattern on the wall
Lucy looks like someone who is waiting for a call
She knows will come
But no-one else can hear at all

Lucy finds the dressing room and the bar
Hangs her clothes up
Hopes tonight the contract won't be broken
Well, they kick you round so much when you're not a star
Make you play all night just for a pittance or a token
But all these imperfections never bothered her at all
She says it sharpens your perception
When your back's against the wall
There's something that enables her to rise above it all
To shrug it off, just when it seems to go too far

I think you almost
Feel the pain coming on inside
I think you almost
Feel it now and you don't know why
You don't know why

The last time that I saw her
She had given up the chase
Moved away to California
Got a suntan on her face
She says that life was just another time, another space
It's over now, she learned a lot
It's not a wasteI think you almost
Feel the pain coming on inside
I think you almost
Feel it now and you don't know why

I think you almost
Feel yourself reaching out inside
I think you almost
Feel it now and you don't know why
Don't know why
