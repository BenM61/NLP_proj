Make a wish, say a prayer
Maybe both, would be fitting here
Take away, what remains
What reminds

Just suppose, it was clear
Who we are, what we're doing here?
Take away, what is want
What is need

While you hesitate
Hearts like mine will wait
In two

Find a place, find a home
Face to face, why am I afraid?
In this space, not to know
This unknown

What is honest?
Is it greater than this promise?
What is obvious?
Is it greater than this silence?

While you hesitate
Hearts like mine will break

While you hesitate
Hearts like mine will break
In two

In two
