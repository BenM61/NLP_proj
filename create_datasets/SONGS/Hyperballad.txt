We live on a mountain right at the top
There's a beautiful view from the top of the mountain
Every morning, I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around
It's become a habit a way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early mornin' no-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slammin' against those rocks
And when it lands will my eyes be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

Safe up here with you
Safe up here with you
Safe up here with you
...
