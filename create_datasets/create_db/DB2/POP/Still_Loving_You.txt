I still recall those crazy nights
Days our love was at its height
The madness and the passion that we shared
Waking early in the gloom
Beside you in that bedsit room
Magazines and letters everywhere 

Pay phone ringing in the hall
Cheap emulsion on the walls
The smell of winter in the air
With you I feel alive and clean
And happier than I've ever been
When I'm alone it's hard to bear 

One day I will lose you and that I know
But sure as hell I'm gonna be yours forever
And till that day I'll still be loving you
The way I do while we're together
Be loving you still loving you 

The day we went back to the place
You spent your wild unhappy days
The hometown of a teenage refugee
I lay beside you on the grass
As trains to London thundered past
The ghost of who you used to be 

One day I will lose you and that I know
But sure as hell I'm gonna be yours forever
And till that day I'll still be loving you
The way I do while we're together
Be loving you still loving you 

Silences and sudden strains 
Fall between us now again
I know you're always on your guard
But you don't have to be sweet to me
Be what you want to be
Be rude and brutal if you are 

One day I will lose you and that I know
But sure as hell I'm gonna be yours forever
And till that day I'll still be loving you
The way I do while we're together
Be loving you, still loving you
