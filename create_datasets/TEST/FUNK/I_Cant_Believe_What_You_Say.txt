(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do

When she gets me in the dark, then she says I'm her man
But when we walk down the street she never holds my hand
She says one day that she will marry me
But she tells her friends that that will never be

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do

When we get to a dance I have to go in alone 
But she always kisses me before I get home
Then she wants to hug and kiss on me
Everybody's thinking but no one can see

How can I ever love you, girl
When I don't even know who you are?
You know you're one girl when you're in a bubbly place
But another when you're in my car

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do

I saw her kissin' some man that she said was her friend 
And before the night was over, she was doing it again
She said one day that she will be my wife
But she wants me to wait for the rest of my life

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
I can't believe what you say, 'cause I can see what you do
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) whoa, whoa
