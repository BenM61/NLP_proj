Is the struggle and strife we find in this life
Really worth while, after all
I've been wishing today I could just run away
Out where the west winds call

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by

Is the future to hold just struggles for gold
While the real world waits outside
Away out on the breast of the wonderful west
Across the great divide

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by
