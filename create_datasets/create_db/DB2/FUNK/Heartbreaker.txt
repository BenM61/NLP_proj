She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
Oh, real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

When she holds my hand I get warm inside
Something happened that I can't describe
She never talk serious 'bout love or romance
She's the kinda babe that won't give your heart a chance

A real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

No one man ever enters her mind
She loves to flirt with maybe eight or nine
When she goes out, man, she has a ball
She don't date one, she'd love to date them all

She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's real heartbreaker, don't you know?
A real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

Well, no one man ever enters her mind
She loves to flirt with maybe eight or nine
She made up her mind, man, to really live
She gonna go out and live for real

She's a mean manhater, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, a mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

A real heartbreaker, a real heartbreaker
A mean man hater, a real heartbreaker
