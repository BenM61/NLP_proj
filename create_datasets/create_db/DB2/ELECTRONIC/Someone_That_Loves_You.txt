Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
You have someone that loves you

Whoever said it was easy must have had it pretty good
Must have had it pretty good
I want you, boy, just to please me
Don't tell me that you could, don't tell me that you could
It's beautiful in a way, with love
But what's a girl to do when you can't seem to choose?
You're beautiful but your mind's restrained
When your mind is split two ways is when the comedown plays

Don't touch me, boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you, I'm waiting
And I'm patient, I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you

Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
You have someone that loves you

Yeah, you want me close so I hear you
I thought I made it clear, don't whisper in my ear
My heart, it keeps getting weaker
I know you want me near, but your love is what I fear
It's beautiful, the way you move
But what's a boy to do when he can't seem to choose?
Yeah I'm beautiful, but I must explain
My mind's not in a good place, and so the comedown plays

Don't touch me, boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you, I'm waiting
And I'm patient, I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you
Don't touch me, boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you, I'm waiting
And I'm patient, I feel stupid
When you have someone that loves you (that loves you, that loves you)
That loves you
Yeah, she loves you too
The way that I do

Don't touch me, boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you, I'm waiting
I'm impatient, I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you 
Don't touch me, boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you, I'm waiting
I'm impatient, I feel stupid
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
