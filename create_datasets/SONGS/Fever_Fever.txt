Struck down by a prayer
And she compels you, you can't help it
Drop down to your knees
She's in your mind and you are blinded
And she put a spell on you

she's nobodys angel
She's nobodys
Nobodys angel

fever fever leave my heart alone
Teardrops down my face
I curse the day that I was born

Lost inside her grace
And you surrender sweet surrender
Bound within a sigh
She takes you under, keeps you under
And she puts a spell on you

still my fading heart beats for your love
Still my fading heart beats for love
