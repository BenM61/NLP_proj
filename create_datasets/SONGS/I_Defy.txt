I defy! I love your way 
How could it be different? 
I defy! I love your way 
Well how could it be different? 

Ooh, now I'm kissing the real you 
Now I'm kissing the real you 

Will I get through my dark day 
Did you hear me? 
Did you hear me? 

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh 
How could it be different? 

I see the stars around your face 
They never seem to hurt at all 
The stars around your face 
They never seem to hurt at all 

Ooh, now I'm missing the real you 
Now I'm missing the real you 

Well I got through my dark day? 
Did you fear me? 
Did you fear for me? 

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh 
How could it be different? 

Don't want to see my baby fall 
It's the dawn I feel becoming ever after 
This is my matter, dear 

I defy! I love your way 
Well, how could it be different? 
I defy! I love your way 
How could it be different? 

Well I got to know you today 
And I adore you 
I adore you 

Ooh now I'm loving you 
How could it be different? 

Ooh now I'm loving you 
How could it be different?
