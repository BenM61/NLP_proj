Oh just a night like this
Filled with bliss
You led my heart astray
Oh just a real sweet chance
To learn romance
In a perfect way
It was the end of a perfect day, say

The moon was all aglow
And heaven was in your eyes
When I thought you told me 
Those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know
That you didn't mean all those sighs
When I thought you told me
Those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I've sighed but there's no regretting in spite of my tears

The devil was in your heart
But heaven was in your eyes
When I thought you told me 
Those little white lies

You may be having fun
Or maybe you think you're wise
To do what you're doing
With little white lies
Someday you'll meet someone
And you'll suddenly realize
You don't feel like telling
Those little white lies

Someday you will love that somebody who you think is true
Someday you will find that someone is cheating on you
A smile will be on her lips
But tears will be in your eyes
Your heart will be broken
By little white lies
