Christmas cards, Christmas cards
I love to see the pretty Christmas cards
Bringing you sweet regards
Wishing you the best of happiness

Love to write to someone I'm thinking of
Love to write to the place and folks I love
Love to send them a message of good cheer
With words sincere when Christmas is here

Christmas cards, Christmas cards
Love to see the pretty Christmas cards
Bringing you sweet regards
Wishing you the best of happiness

Little cards with their trees all dressed in snow
Little cards with their friendly fires aglow
Little cards with their lovely winter scene
When all the world is sweet and serene

Oh, Christmas cards, Christmas cards
I love to see the pretty Christmas cards
Bringing you sweet regards
Wishing you the best of happiness

Christmas cards, Christmas cards
Bringing you the best of happiness
