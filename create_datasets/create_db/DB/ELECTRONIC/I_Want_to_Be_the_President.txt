Big alliance.
For the fourteenth time.
Take you on.
Because you're strong.

Bigger love.
It's the hating kind.
We're not interested in your difference.
We like to be deflective.

My gun is bigger than yours.
My tank goes faster than yours.
My missile's turning me on.
My weapon makes me feel strong.

Bang bang bang.
Do you wanna see my gun?
Well come on.
We'll resist, we'll resist.
But let you take control.

But if they say that is so,
Is that the way you will go?
And if you thought it was wrong,
Would you still follow along?

They're building walls tonight.
They're building walls tonight.
Ain't it cold,
Ain't it cold,
Ain't it cold,
Where you empty your soul?
There'll be a war tonight.
There'll be a war tonight.
