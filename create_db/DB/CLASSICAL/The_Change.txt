Been a long time lonely, grown set in my ways
No eye for tomorrow, just a chain of yesterday
You were the first time, I knew where I stood
Now I walk a new line, and I think the change is gonna do me good

Gonna suit me fine, bring me back again
It's just a matter of time 
Gonna play my cards right, gonna knock on wood
I know that it's comin' I think the change is gonna do me good

Stone cold sober in the broad daylight
Downtown dancin' on Saturday night
Thinkin' about you makes me feel all right
It's the way that you love me the way that you love me

You love is a shadow, across all my dreams
I wake up and want you- and your face is all I see
The words are unspoken, it's all understood
My heart is wide open, and I think the change is gonna do me good

Gonna suit me fine, bring me back again
It's just a matter of time
Gonna play my cards right, gonna knock on wood
I know that it's comin' and I think the change is gonna do me good

I think the change is gonna do me good
I think the change is gonna do me good
I think the change is gonna do me good
I think the change is gonna do me good
