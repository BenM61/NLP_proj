What up Jon (testing one, two, three)
What up Kon (convict music)
Let's go (can you believe it?)

Fresh white tee (fresh)
Fresh car walls (fresh)
Summertime hood niggas look like stars (look like stars)
Jewelery drip, fresh white airs (fresh white airs)
Mummy shake it up keep your ass right there (oh can you believe it?)
My man got liquor and my cups right here (i got my cup)
I can smell smoke pass the dutch right here (pass that dutch)
Nigga pass that, Capri pants with the waist cut off
I wanna smash that (oh can you believe it?)
Party ran pack, mingling baby
And I can LL shake, you jingling baby
Back your ass up, I'm a start tingling baby
We can have more fun if wiggling baby (yea can you believe it?)
P hit the club with a dutch and a dub with it
Nigga don't cuff it if you ain't in love with it
Matter fact let the grub get it
Please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it

[Chorus]
Can you believe it?
Get a break and get off the streets
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke
Contact from the weed
That's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life
I ain't never gonna leave
The ghetto is all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga playing back trying get this dough
Yellin' out oh
All up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like oh
Bad little bitches with their booty on score trying to beat like, oh
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh
Let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe it?

Big ass truck (big new truck), brand new rims
Tank top Yankee (tank top Yankee), tanned out Tim's
Bracelet, chain, fronts bob thin (fronts bob thin)
New tattoos, new black shoes (hey can you believe it?)
Gucci, Ermays, do that too (do that too)
Wanna feel the breeze get a new black coupe
Nigga drop the top, come through the hood
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot 
(oh oh oh can you believe it?)
Lending outfits all on the bus (all of us on the bus) cause none of us could
See a summer without trips (none of us can see it)
Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you but they all act good 
At the hood barbecue

[Chorus]

Basketball tournaments, pit bull pups
Ladies in the club poring Chris in cups
Niggas in the jail calling home on the phone (they locked up)
But you still trying to act like aint shit enough (and now can you believe it?)
Mad sieves in the park, mad fights in the park
Niggas talk how they run every night from the narcs
Aside from the light to the dark (light to the dark) 
Then the dark to the light
I wanna smoke but I could search for my life

Can you believe it? I done spent ten again
Watching her bend again, dancing for many men
Tell me have ever though about getting in (have you ever thought)
A room full of convicts and D Block militants (D block militants)
We'll show you the time of your life (time of your life)
You can occupy my passenger side (come on girl)
Introduce you to the street life
Watch you fall in love after just one night
Oh all up in the club and you know how we roll, squad deep like
Oh
Bad little bitches with their booty on score trying to beat like oh
Know your ass feel it cause its outta control
Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh
Can you believe It?

Can you believe It? (Can you believe It?)
Lil Jon, Akon, S.P. the ghost
Feel what we trying to do (Can you believe It?)
Can you believe It?
