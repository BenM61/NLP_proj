In the morning when I wake up  I think about all of the crazy things 
That we been through. And my momma  she told me there were 
Gonna be days like this. And I guarantee she was tellin' the truth. 
When I close my eyes  I see Eazy   No more thuggin'  just love 
Every day  in the heavens above with his DJ  listenin' to music that I 
Just made. Hey... 

(CHORUS) 
Just want to sing a little somethin' for the people that done passed 
Away. Now tell me, can you feel it? When you're livin' in better 
Days. And I pray to God, I hope you're listenin', if we try then we 
Could one day be... For one time, in your mind, everything is alright. 
Until it happens, I'll be on my knees beggin' for a better way. 

Now my background say... Now every once in a while I remember 
That I... I miss my Grand daddy. All the little things we sat & talked 
About. I wish you could see me now. From the side of my bed with 
My head down - To outside wit' my homies tippin' Gin now. Seems 
Like I got a whole lot of friends now. So let me tell you what I'm 
Talkin' about. And now that I got my mind made up, I ain't got no 
Time to wait up. So I'm gonna keep givin' it way up. If you ever 
Should think I ain't true to that, in "My peoples if you wit me where 
You at." We brought y'all back! 

(Chorus) 

[Break it on down......] (Ad-libs) 

Just want to sing a little somethin'.. Somethin'... 

(Chorus - 2x)
