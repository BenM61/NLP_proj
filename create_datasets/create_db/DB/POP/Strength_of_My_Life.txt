open my eyes to the sound of morning news
And wish for ten more minutes left to sleep
And as I get into the shower the thoughts of facing one more day
Overwhelm me and I begin to weep
And I've never felt like I've needed Your help so bad

Well, my tears are pushed away now for the sake of morning rush
'Til the Bible on the table catches my eye
And I read that you are near to the hearts that break with grief
And I realize that I don't have to try
To live life myself because You're ready to help me live

And everyday I look to you
To be the strength of my life
You're the hope I hold onto
Be the strength of my life

Be the strength of my life
Strength of my life
Be the strength of my life today
Be the strength of my life
Strength of my life
Be the strength of my life today

Each day has its problems, it troubles and its tears
And it seems I'm always anything but strong
When I learn to know my weakness
I understand your strength
And even when the hard times last so long
I won't try by myself, I'll just ask for Your help
Each day

And everyday I look to you
To be the strength of my life
Breathe on me and make me new
Be the strength of my life

Be the strength of my life
Strength of my life
Be the strength of my life today
Be the strength of my life
Strength of my life
Be the strength of my life today

Be the strength of my life
Strength of my life
Be the strength of my life today
Be the strength of my life
Strength of my life
Be the strength of my life today
