You called all the way from America
And said hang on to love girl
But the weeks and the months and the tears
Passed by
And my eyes couldn't stand the strain
Of that promised love

All the way from America

You called all the way from America
And said I'll soon be home girl
But the years and the tears and the fears
Passed by
And my heart couldn't stand the pain
Of that promised love

All the way from America
All the way from America

I stayed all alone and I waited 'round
For you to knock at my door
But the knock never came and no ring
At all
And now I sit and wonder why
You made that first call

All the way from America

I don't believe I'll stay here
I don't think I wanna wait here any more
And if you search for me baby
Better bring some more love than you declared

All the way from America
