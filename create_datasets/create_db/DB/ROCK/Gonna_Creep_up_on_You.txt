I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna gonna

The writing on the wall showed the scandal
Pointed out the victim of the vandal
The lady was upset by the angle
Scratch your back and hot to handle

I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna gonna

You're sly, you're slick, you're sleek, you're outstanding
My legs are week, my heart, it beats, it's pounding
Soon you're gonna weep in your sleepless surrounding
'Cause I'm the one taking you down for grounding

I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna creep up on you
I'm gonna gonna

Little lady let me take a little bit of your love
