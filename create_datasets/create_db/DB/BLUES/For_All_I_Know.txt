Last time I saw you
it could've been Christmas eve
it could've been someone's birthday
it could've been make believe for all I know
it could've been make believe
last time I saw you
you had the room upstairs
I never knew for certain
what went on up there
no I never did know 
what went on up there
'course you had that boyfriend
with the Chevrolet
he never met Will Rogers
I'd be willing to say
yeah it's safe to say
he never met Will Rogers
I guess it must have been a thousand years
since I changed my number
does it mean a thing
when the phone don't ring
and I don't call back
can't help but wonder sometimesI never got to know you 
like I wanted to
you never seemed to notice
how I looked at you for all I know
you never even noticednow that crowd's all scattered
to here and yon
everybody graduated
or they just moved onfor all I know
they just moved onI guess it must have been a thousand years
since I lost your number
gonna rest my soul
by this fishing hole
gonna watch that pole
'till that float goes underlast time I saw you
it could've been Christmas eve
it could've been someone's birthday
it could've been make believefor all I know
could've been make believe
