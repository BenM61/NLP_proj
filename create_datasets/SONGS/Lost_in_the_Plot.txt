Take me for drive to the coastline
Pull me to the depths of the sea
Leave me in the middle of the ocean
I can walk the rest of the way

And I promise not to cry anymore
All the reasons beat the crap out of me
Everyday when I wake up they are waiting

But I promised not to cry anymore
'Cause it's the same old plot these days
Oh it's the same old plot these days
Oh it's the same old plot these days
Oh it's the same old plot

Our love, don't mess with our love
Our love is so much stronger
Our love, don't mess with our love
Our love is so much stronger

Oh it's the same old plot these days
Oh it's the same old plot these days
Oh it's the same old plot
Same old plot
Same old plot these days

Oh I promise not to cry
Oh I promise not to cry
Oh I promise not to cry anymore
