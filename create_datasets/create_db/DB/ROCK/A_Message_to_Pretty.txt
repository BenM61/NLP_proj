[Verse 1:]
People check to tell me
What they think is right
I don't listen to them
Don't know day from night
I'll go through life searchin'
Tryin' to find the one
I'd go slip, slip, you'd go slip, slip Away

[Chorus:]
And I don't need you to help me find my way
I can make it if I just don't see your face
 
[Verse 2:]
Once I had a problem
Didn't know what to do
Now I've got no problems
All I had was you
Guess I'll keep on searchin'
And try to find the one
'Cause I'd go slip, slip, you'd go slip, slip
Away
