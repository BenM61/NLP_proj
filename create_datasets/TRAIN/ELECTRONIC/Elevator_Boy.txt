Sometimes I feel I'm a bad man
Sometimes I feel like a fool
Sometimes I just don't know how to act
When people start playing cool

I'm going up
Down all the way 'round
Going up
Down all the way 'round

I'm an elevator boy
I'm an elevator boy
I'm an elevator boy, boy, boy

Going up and down
Going up and down
Going all the way 'round

I'm going up
I'm going down
I'm going up
I'm the elevator boy

Oh oh oh oh...

Sometimes I'm feel I've been wasting my time
Fooling 'round town with you
But every time when I'm looking out my window
I'm only looking for you

I'm going up
Down all the way 'round

(x2)
Going up
Down all the way 'round

I'm an elevator boy
I'm an elevator boy
I'm an elevator boy, boy, boy

(x2)
Going up and down
Going all the way 'round

I'm going up
I'm going down
I'm going up
I'm the elevator boy

Take me to the top
I'm going up
I'm the elevator boy

(x2)
Take me to the top

Oh yeah

Take me to the top
Top, top, top...
Take me to the top
c'mon take me to the top

(x2)
I'm going up
Woah woah
I'm going up
Woah yeah

I'm going up
Take me to the top
c'mon take me to the top
