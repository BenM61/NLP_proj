The bleak fimbulwinter arrived
Raging across the world
With a fury that defied the memory of man
Terrible wars where fought,
The like had never been seen
Men slew without a thought
The ties of kinship were no more

Skoll and Hati, the ravenous wolves
Arose and devoured the sun and the moon
Darkness descended upon the earth
And the stars fell from the skies
Loud blows heimdall the horne's in the air
Odin quests the head of Mim
Now shakes the holy ash where it stands
The ancient tree moans, Fenris breaks free

How are the Aesir?
How are the Alves?
Loud sounds Jotunheim
Aesir comprise
By the stonedoors dwarfs are moaning
The mountains wise men
Know you now or not?

With his shield at hand
Hrym travels from the east
The serpant is turning, enormous in rage

The serpant breaks the waves
The eagle screams
Nidhoggs tearing corpses
Free comes Nagelfar

Loki leads the legions of the dead
In holy war
Against the justice made by Aesir
