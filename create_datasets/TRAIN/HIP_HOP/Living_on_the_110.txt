Living on the 110
Four sharing one tent
Can't afford no rent
Forgotten by the government
Feels like a life time
Stuck and struck down
Waiting for the right time
Running out of luck now
And it's damn shame
See it from the fast lane
Living in the jungle
Tent city struggle
You drive by see the family camped out
By the underpass
You got your blinders on
You want to hit the gas

Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

I lost my home
So I roam wherever
And my belly's on E
And I gots no cheddar
Life gets no better
And my plate is empty
And my mind is hungry
Ain't got no penny
Sidewalk sleeping
Trying to keep on breathing
The hopeless pray
Trying to keep believing
A ghost you're seeing
Left behind by the system
You can see me southbound on Exposition

Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

You better hope and pray

Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You pretend there's democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality
Living on the 110
There's no end to the poverty, stopping me
You depend on democracy, hypocrisy
This is the reality

Hope and pray
Hope and pray
Hope and pray
You better hope and pray
Hope and pray
Hope and pray
Hope and pray
It might be you some day
