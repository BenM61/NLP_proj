Joy comes in the morning
The sun is rising
And I wait for You
Streams flow in the desert
There's an oasis
And I wait for You

Whatever the storm
Whatever is lost
Whatever it takes
Whatever the cost
I will praise You
I will praise You

Faith, faith is the substance
Of things we hope for
So I wait for You
Hope, hope and the future
Are Your plans for me
So I wait for You

Whatever the storm
Whatever is lost
Whatever it takes
Whatever the cost
I will praise You
I will praise You

I see the waters rising
I feel the coming storm
When fear is overwhelming
I hear, "Peace, be still"

I see the waters rising
I feel the coming storm
When fear is overwhelming
I hear, "Peace, be still"

Whatever the storm
Whatever is lost
Whatever it takes
Whatever the cost
I will praise You
I will praise You

You, I will praise You
I will praise You
Whatever the storm
Whatever it takes
I will praise You
I will praise You, You
