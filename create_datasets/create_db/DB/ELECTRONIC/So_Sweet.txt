Back then when the heartbreak came yeah it hit me pretty hard
I waved hello and goodbye to the ghosts on the boulevard
Well oh my baby you're so sweet it makes me cry
Well oh my baby you're so sweet it makes me cry 

You're so sweet
You're so sweet
You're so sweet
I wanna cry 

La La La La La 
La La La La La 
La La La La La 
La La La La La 

Locked up with the dope fiends honey just trying to sympathize
He turned and looked at me with his cold dead blood red drag queen eyes
Well oh my baby you're so sweet it makes me cry
Well oh my baby you're so sweet it makes me cry 

You're so sweet
You're so sweet
You're so sweet
I wanna cry 

Your former lover is leaving checking out not coming back
The downtown trains have taken him screaming on down the track
There is a terrible taste on his tongue from the chemicals
He's gonna spit his blood all over the dope white walls 

You're so sweet
You're so sweet
You're so sweet
I wanna cry 

La La La La La
