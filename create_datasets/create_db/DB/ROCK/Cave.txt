Leave me alone, it's nothing serious
I'll do it myself, it's got nothing to do with you
And there's nothing that you can do

You can see it and you can almost hear it too
You can almost taste it, it's nothing to do with you
And there's still nothing that you can do

So come in my cave, and I'll burn your hearts away
Come in my cave and I'll burn your hearts away

Please close your ears and try to look away
So you'll never hear a single word I say
And don't ever come my way

Leave me alone, it's nothing serious
I'll do it myself, it's got nothing to do with you
And there's still nothing that you can do

So come in my cave, and I'll burn your hearts away
Come in my cave, and arrest me for my mistakes
