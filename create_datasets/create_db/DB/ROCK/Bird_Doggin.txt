All these sleepless nights I'm so tired of
I've got to find some sweet little thing to love
To put my arms around and hold oh-oh so tight
Well, I know I just can't last another night

Call me an old hound dog on the prowl
But I got to get some love somehow
I'm bird doggin', yeah, I'm bird doggin'

I think of all the things she'd do and say
(Bird doggin')
Makes me want her more and more each day
(Bird doggin')

Well, now all these pretty girls just don't wanna turn around
Oh, just a-git it to me and I got to track a woman down
(Bird doggin')

Call me an old hound dog on the prowl
Well, I got to get some love somehow
Bird doggin', yeah, bird doggin'
(Oh, let's go, guitar boy, let's give you some of it)

Call me an old hound dog on the prowl
But I got to get some lovin' somehow
I'm bird doggin', yeah, I'm bird doggin', hey

Yeah, bird doggin'
I got to, got to, got to get me a woman tonight, love
(Bird doggin')
Yeah, I got to, got to, got to get me a woman tonight, yeah
(Bird doggin', bird doggin', bird doggin')
