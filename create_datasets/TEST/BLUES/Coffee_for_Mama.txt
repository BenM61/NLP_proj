Mama got mad at Papa
Everybody wonderin' why them's papa was gone
Mama got mad at Papa
When everybody wonderin' where papa had gone
They isn't wonderin' why mama got mad, 'cause
Papa didn't bring no coffee home

Mama said, "Papa"
Old man, you know you been doin' me wrong
Old man, I got to tell you
You know you been doin' me wrong
You been leaving, spending all your money
Then you didn't bring no coffee home

Wait a while boy, all right

That's all right!

I'm goin' to Muriel
See, can I bring some coffee home?
I'm goin' to Muriel, see, can I bring my mama some coffee home?
I'm gettin' tired of hearin' her tell papa
"You know you doin' me wrong"
All right

Hey, boy!
