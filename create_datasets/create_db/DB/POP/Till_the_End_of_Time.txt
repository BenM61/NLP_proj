Love you until the end of time
Baby I will love you until the end of time

Close to me 
Oh I need you close to me 
Loving me 
Close to you 
How can I get close to you 
Help me to 

Why can't you see 
I would give the world away 
To have you by my side 
I'm so in need 
Each and every night I pray 
You'll come and save my life 
I would love you 
'Till the end of time, oh yes 

I think of you 
Every moment I go through 
Thoughts of you 
I dream of you 
All I have are so many dreams of you 
Won't you please come true 

Oh why can't you see 
I would give the world away 
To have you by my side 
Oh I'm so in need 
Each and every night I pray 
You'll come and save my life 
I would love you 
'Till the end
'Till the end
'Till the end
'Till the end of time 

Tell me what you need 
Let me give you all of me 
'Cause without you nothing's real 
You're the reason that I feel 

Oh tell me what you need 
Let me give you everything 
Every moment I'm alive 
Until the end of time 

Oh why, why can't you see 
I would give the world away 
To have you by my side 
Don't you know that I, I'm so in need 
Each and every night I pray 
You'll come and save my life 
I would love you 
'Till the end 
'Till the end
I would love you 
'Till the end of time 

(I would love you 'till the end of time)
(Baby I will love ya)
Until the end
(I would love you till the end of time)
'Till the end 
(Baby I would love you 'till the end of time)
(Love you 'till the end of time)
(Baby I would love you)
(Love you until the end of time)
(Baby I would love you untill the end of time ah ah)
(Love you until the end of time)
