This is the hidden truth,
The world between the lines
There is no understanding us
These lines have marked divisions,
The weaker seek to malign
With this looming precious ending
There's no more room for reprimanding

Oh, when words are lightly thrown
In a world that's caught in a writer's web
Humiliation reigns

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah

Communications breaking up,
The static's cutting the line
This lying liar's had his turn
You've managed nothing more
Than a pathetic attempt at attack
This heart is everlasting,
Pushing forward, never crashing

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah

State your case and go hide
Leave us to your worst,
I will never give in
To the hurt of your lies
Cause' there is no hope
For all your jokes
And your plaguing insecurity
And now I play your enemy,
The only word you could find for me

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah

Just leave us alone
If it's not worth the letting go
It's trouble, woah, woah
