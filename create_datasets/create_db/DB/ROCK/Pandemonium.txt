She talks of supernatural aeons that we'll make
She says "look behind the wave of changes" feel the future taking shape

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium

I ask her of her next of kin and loved ones in her care
She gestures all around her then she whispers "everywhere
"There is no nuclear family required any more
"My parents are the village and the village is the law"

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
Hear the pandemonium

She said "unlearn you must forget the values that you hold
"Life is not longevity and beauty is the only goal"

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
Hear the pandemonium

Cymbals that crash and pipes of pan awaken from your trance 
There is no retribution here see how the heathen dance 

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
Hear the pandemonium

Apart from all discussion, we were functioning as one. 

I can see tomorrow 
I can see the world to come 
I can see tomorrow 
Hear the pandemonium
