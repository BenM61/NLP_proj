I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin' 
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin' 
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darling, when's she coming home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And that I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin' 
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever 
Sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me 
Cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow if 
I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know I'll keep on loving you 
Cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind 
But I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others 
But I know I'd love you still
Cause I get so doggone lonesome
