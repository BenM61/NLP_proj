Come along, catch a Heffalump
Sit with me on a muddy clump
We'll sing a song of days gone by

Run along now, don't be glum
Get you gone, now, have some fun
Don't be long, for the end is nigh

Don't let moments pass along
And waste before your eyes

March with me and the borogoves
Come with me and the slithy toves
And never ask us why

Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom

We'll dance and sing 'til sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

We'll be here when the world slows down
And the sunbeams fade away
Keeping time by a pendulum
As the fabric starts to fray

There's no such thing as time to kill
Nor time to throw away
So, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty
Thrice for another day

Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom

We'll dance and sing 'til sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

Come with me, catch a rare type specimen
Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton
We'll break our fast with friends

Once we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly
Many moons to the west of here and happily
Our journey never ends

Shut your ears when sirens sing
Tie armbands to your feet

Listen up and you won't go wrong again
Float along on a verse-less song and then
Get to where the two ends meet

Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom

We'll dance and sing 'til sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs
