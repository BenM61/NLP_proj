Sun said it's gonna shine on, down into my window
It's gonna light my room just right
Gonna shine and make the pain go

They go running from the rain in case it turn to thunder
I ripped out the reason, the truth that dragged you under
Speaking in disguises your words are ornamental
A vapour trail and then you are gone

And I've got a lesson to learn

There's a lot to be 
Said for this morbid self-attention
The problem lies in my external obsession
Animal is hungry been sleeping for far too long
Gonna fill this lacuna somehow

I'm thinking of a man I once knew 
I thought I had the hang of
He never learnt that the heart is perishable without love
But keep your heart out of it now 
Concentrate your vision
I'm lying here like a forfeit awaiting your incision
I don't wanna hear about it
Your new infatuation
I just wanna leave here wearing a smile

And I've got a lesson to learn

There's a lot to be 
Said for this morbid self-attention
The problem lies in my external obsession
Oh baby, don't make no difference, your preference
Come fill this lacuna at least for now

I can think of a good few reasons to get fucked up but
You're just looking for an excuse to call yourself a f*ck up
Look at her without the burden of what it is that you live for
She'll still be here when your carnival is over
She'll still be here when you are gone
