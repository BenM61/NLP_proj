Trippin' out, oh yeah
I'm freakin' out
This sound is bouncing me
Right on the wall.

Lose myself
I can't control myself
I'm a radio head
That's in free-fall.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Hazy man, oh yeah
I'm blasted man
Out there flippin' through my
paisley mind.

Ride the wave
From cradle
To the grave
Breathe it in with my own kind.

Gets me high
High
High
High

Boned with sound, oh yeah
I'm stoned on sound
No one gets to me
Inside this room.

Spacin' out, oh yeah
I'm racing here
This sound gets in my head
My head goes boooom.

Gets me high
High
High
High
