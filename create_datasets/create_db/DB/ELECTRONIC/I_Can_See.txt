Silently, I'm suffering
Hidden by an incidental smile
Holding on for something else
To come along and make my life worthwhile
'Till it comes 
I'm going to be okay
Slowly waiting for the end of days
Every night I'm gonna be alright
The demons come and take care of my plight

I can see in your eyes
That what's coming ain't a big surprise
I can see, oh, in your eyes
That what's coming ain't a big surprise

Over time
People change
Slowly their wealth will rearrange
All the while
I keep holding on
Trying to find the will to carry on

I can see in your eyes
That what's coming ain't a big surprise
I can see, oh, in your eyes
That what's coming ain't a big surprise

I just wanna know
Please, just let me know
I want to know
I'll do anything for you girl
Slowly life will take its toll
I don't want to lose control

Life is green
Alone for me
Ever since you walked right through the door
Please believe that things will change
But you said you've heard it all before

I can see, oh in your eyes
That what's coming ain't a big surprise
I can see, oh in your eyes
That what's coming ain't a big surprise

I can see, oh in your eyes
That what's coming ain't a big surprise
I can see, oh, in your eyes

Silently, I'm suffering
