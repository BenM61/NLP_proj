Did you know
Did you know
Did you know
That I love you
Did you know
Did you know
Did you know
Did you know
And I want you

I'll admit things ain't been the way I thought they would be
Didn't expect so much stress to develop between me and you
I knew that it wasn't easy but sometimes
When we fight it don't seems like God's design
But then I hear words you said
And I promised I would stand for you and be true through the bad and the good
And I know what it means to be committed
So here's a word for you but you just ain't with it

Stay down
(We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down
(You'll always be the pride in my heart)
Stay down
(We took and passed the test)
Stay down
(Yeah, we gotta lot of work)
Stay down
(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down
(The drama will not last forever)
Stay down
(We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this (Yeah)
We'll be like "Remember this"? (Remember this)
And it's gonna make us smile (Make us smile)
'Cause in the end we stayed down

I ain't gone lie, at time you amaze me
You be talking and I swear that you're crazy
But I learned a long time ago that pride don't help
It only hurts
And I just want you to know I need you baby
(I need you)
I'm just like Weezy baby
Not Weezy like the sauna baby
But the wife of George and we're moving on up
Ten years strong and we're looking like a plan
I'm looking like your woman and you're looking like my man
We looking like real
And the haters look fake
Especially when they hear me say

Stay down
(We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down
(You'll always have a place in my heart)
Stay down
(We took and passed the test)
Stay down
(You know we gotta lot of work)
Stay down
(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down
(The drama will not last forever)
Stay down
(We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this
We'll be like "Remember this"?
And it's gonna make us smile (Make us smile)
'Cause in the end we stayed down

Understand you are the one of my heart
And I'm holding yours so we can't live apart
When things stop making sense we'll figure it out
I walked into this and I don't wanna walk out no, no
Everything ain't gonna be how we like
And what is worth keeping if it didn't take a fight?
Your healing is in me and my healing is in you
So get your mind right cause this' what we're gonna do

Stay down
(We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down
(You'll always be the pride in my heart)
Stay down
(We took and passed the test)
Stay down
(You know we gotta lot of work)
Stay down
(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down
(The drama will not last forever)
Stay down
(We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this
We'll be like "Remember this"?
And it's gonna make us smile (Make us smile)
'Cause in the end we stayed down
