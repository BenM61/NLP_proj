Yeh
Every evening when all my day's work is through

I call my baby and ask her what schould we do?
I mention movies but she don't think with me beg.
And then she asks me why don't I come to her flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
By digging records beside a groovy hi-fi.
I say yeh-yeh, that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh.

My baby loves me
She gets me feelin' so fine

The way she loves me she makes me know that she's mine.
And when she kisses I feel the fire get hot

She never misses
She gives it all that she's got.
And when she asks me if ev'rything is okay

I got my answer
The only thing I can say,
I say yeh-yeh; that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh.

We'll play a melody
And turn the lights down low so none can see.
We gotta do that
We gotta do that

We gotta do that
We gotta do that.
And there'll be no one else alive
In all the world than you and me.
Oh
Pretty baby
I never knew such a thrill

It's hard to tell you because I'm trembling still.
But
Pretty baby
I want you all for my own

I'm even ready to leave those others alone.
No need to ask me if everything is okay

I got my answer
The only thing I can say,
I say yeh-yeh; and that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh
Yeh yeh.

We'll play a melody
And turn the lights down low so none can see.
And that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh

And that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh
And that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh.
