If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four
Lord I'm five hundred miles from my home
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles, five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Lord I'm five hundred miles from my home

Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name
Lord I can't go home this away
This way, this way, this way, this way
Lord I can't go home this away

If you miss the train I'm on you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
