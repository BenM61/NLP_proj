I guess it's funnier from where you're standing
'Cause from over here I miss the joke
Clear the way for my crash landing
I've done it again
Another number for your notes

I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
I'd be patient if I had the time
I could stop and answer all of your questions
As soon as I find out
How I can move from the back of the line

I'll be your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh
'Cause it's funny
I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown
On your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus
Round in circle 
I'm selling out tonight

I'd be less angry if it was my decision
And the money was just rolling in
If I had more than my ambition
I'll have time for please
I'll have time for thank you
As soon as I win

I'll be your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh
'Cause it's funny
I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown
On your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus
Round in circus
I'm selling out tonight

From a distance my choice is simple
From a distance I can entertain
So you can see me
I put makeup on my face
But there's no way you can feel it
From so far away

I'll be your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh
'Cause it's funny
I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown
On your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus
Round in circles
I'm selling out tonight
