Well I like what I do and I do what I like
What I do? I play the funky music
Some of my friends smoke a little dope I gotta tell you all
Some of my friends tootin' up coke
Well different strokes for different folks, but me?
Playin' funky music all night long, that's what turns
Me on

I might not ever make the big time yeah yeah yeah yeah
'Cause honky tonk joints that's my style
Hey in a one bulb lighted room, where the women wear
50 cent perfume

Big John is my name, playin' funky music is my claim to

Fame
From the big city, me and my band specialize in the
Nitty gritty 

Played my music in every honky tonk joint from Maine to
Mexico
Soulful folks ain't got no shoes smellin' like all
Out doors 
I got invited to the white house but I had to turn it
Down cause
This here band can't stand what saddity folks are
Puttin' down 

I might 

Big John 

I want to know can you get down, all the way
Down
