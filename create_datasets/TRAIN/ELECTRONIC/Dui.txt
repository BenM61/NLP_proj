Lookin' out in the crowd I see a lot of hotties,
Tell me which of you will be my mommy?
Don't be shy, come over put it on me,
Park it up and pass it all around me

We got drinks, anything, and food out for the starving,
Thank you all for coming to my party.
Don't be shy mix it up come and lay it on me
Oh, oh, oh, oooh!

Pick up the phone to solid gold,
Making the hits we get the story told.
We all got a heavy load,
But it won't get us down, no no no no.

Everybody got a Dj night,
Rocking the chance for all their friends to climb,
When it comes to closing time,
Who you gonna crush with a drunken dial?

Hey! What?
Who got a DUI out there?
Yeah.
I know you all do 'cause',
That's dialling under the influence!
When you come home at night,
And you had a little too much to drink,
This is one thing,
We all guilty!

Sittin' alone in my room at home,
Girl come on pick up the phone,
Keep the spot next to ya warm,
I know I got my own ringtone.

I made 'bout a million DUI's,
That's how I always win the prize.
All the times I get to night,
There's a hot little baby by my side.
D! Is the dial your fingers dance.
Give it to me!
You! Under the spell of romance,
Can you let me get
I! Is the dangerous influence,
I feel it!
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!
I'm the lonely man,
With a roaming climb.

I'm resisting the urge and turning on the telly,
Baby don't you have something to tell me?
It's 4 AM my brain has turned to jelly,
Come on baby hope you got the semi,
How long is this dong girl this cannot be healthy,
I'm so wet I have to get my wellies,
Whenever you're near you never get this filthy,
It's because I'm greeting and your wealthy.

Tip on the cotton candy bus,
I win a soft tiger just for us.
These are the broken promices,
That I won't recall when the sun comes up.

Everybody got a Dj night,
Rocking the chance for all their friends to climb,
When it comes to closing time,
Who you gonna crush with a drunken dial?

I see it!
