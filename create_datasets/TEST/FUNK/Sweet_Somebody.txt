Hey there,
I've been watching you sittin' there against the wall.
Say there,
I don't know what you're doing, but you're not having fun at all.
I can tell you're feelin' down 'cause you show no reaction;
And everybody's in the groove.
But you're not helping things at all sitting there afraid to move.
Gotta get up
When you're feelin' down;
Go meet somebody.

'Cause all you need to turn things around is a sweet somebody.
Gotta get up
When you're feelin' down;
Go meet somebody.

Sweet somebody.
Gotta get up.
Hey boy,
I know how you feel.
Sitting there all by yourself.
But say,
Boy,
Your heart will never heal until you find somebody else.
Let whoever broke your heart fade into the past, and give tonight another try.
This could be a brand new start;
Don't you let it pass you by.

Gotta get up
When you're feelin' down;
Go meet somebody.

Sweet somebody.
Gotta get up.
Gotta get up
When you're feelin' down;
Go meet somebody.

Gotta get up.
Sweet somebody.
Gotta get up.
Sweet somebody.
Gotta get up
When you're feelin' down;
Go meet somebody.

Gotta get up
When you're feelin' down;
Go meet somebody.
