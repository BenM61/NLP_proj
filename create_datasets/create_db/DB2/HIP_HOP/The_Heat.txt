Where's the sand, I'm set
My body, thumping, going pitty-pat
Gettin' tan and wet
And when I feel the beat
I lose control of it
Oh, baby, I'm feelin' you
I must admit
Looking tight and fit
And I imagine you and I in

Summer,bodies, shakin' to the ground
Music's going through ya
Can you feel the heat, the heat
The heat is movin'
Through your body
Temperature is rising
Can you feel the heat ?

Sleeping in till noon
Be naughty, put bubbles in the swimming pool
Skinny dip for two
And as you feel the rhythm taking hold of you
Oh papi, I love it when you, oh, eh, oh
And I'm hooked; it's true
I imagine you and I'm in

Summer,bodies, shakin' to the ground
Music's going through ya
Can you feel the heat, the heat
The heat is movin'
Through your body
Temperature is rising
Can you feel the heat ?

Summer's almost over, so you better hurry
Andale, Andale
Starting right now, let's dance and party
Ole, ole, ole
Give me a reason to love you through
Through the season
No need to hesitat
Come on, let's get it on
Let's celebrate 'cause it's

Summer,bodies, shakin' to the ground
Music's going through ya
Can you feel the heat, the heat
The heat is movin'
Through your body
Temperature is rising
Can you feel the heat ?
