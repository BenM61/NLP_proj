Travelin' on the road,each and every day 
In each hotel I stay, got a suitcase for a home 
Guitar in my hand, travelin' with the band 
Flyin' everyday, travelin' across the land 
So tired, so tired 
Got you on my mind, every time I go away 
In each hotel I stay, It's getting harder every time 
Suitcase in my hand, killing one night stands 
Travelin' across the land 
So tired, so tired 
Travelin' on the road,each and every day 
In each hotel I stay, got a suitcase for a home 
Got a suitcase in my hand, killing one night stands 
Flyin' everyday,travelin' across the land 
So tired, so tired, so tired, so tired
