Uh, it's all for you, my melody boo
This lovin' is all for you, break it down, how you feel about this

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing to back in our beginning
Sweet politicking in the heart of the village
We slid digits on low, exchanged a couple of 'hellos'
As you slid out the door
I remember clearly makin' moves up the steps we made eye contact
It was his gleam that brought me back, legit
How we met on some real ghetto star shit
Mad chicks on my melody's dick
See he got this kinda grace about himself
Dealin' with fast life all flooded up with wealth
So for him, cuties just be comin' like a dime a dozen
Smooth talkin' brothers always get easy fuckin'
But I ain't mad, at all of his cutie head lovin'
And all his playin hard to get was worth tryin' to get my loving
He's got personality for days
The kinda melody others bad talkin' many ways
The kinda beat that always stays paid, my special kinda boo who always 
Appreciates gettin' laid
My melody

Just the way. I want to be loved
Yeah

[Verse 2]
True, we been together from the very beginning
Since blocks be turned into states, baguettes be turned into cakes
So he be knowin' how I'm down by law
Plus his knowledge himself be havin' his mentality bore
He gets first bids when I'm blowin' in from tour
His sex is respected behind closed doors
Listen, he the bomb, I can't tell you different
It's a fact how he mystify me like Kaiser Sosack
Uh, it feels good to know how others wish they could be loved
In the clubs bitches screwin' up their mugs because
They envious to how my boo is true to this
Gold diggin' bitches always be disputing shit
That don't even concern them, I'm learnin'
The next chick that try to make your melody a B-track
But true, he be bigger than that
My boo be realizin' that his wifey'll always have his back, uh
Check out my melody

Cause you love me baby
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Communication be never a mess
Coz he be keepin' street conflict away from this relationship
He's got a mind of his own
He's a leader, not scared to be a dreamer, my black man digger
And I be down till the day that I die, loyalty bonafied
So how ask why I, dedicated all my love to his cause
Financially lock him down, hide his monies from the law cause
No matter what my melody be's a good man
No matter how he ran on the actions of his plan and
I be down till the day that I die
Loyalty bonafied, my melody and I

Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah, It's so nice lyin' here in you arms
Your personality has that charm
Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Oh I could stay here for the rest of my life
I want to be your lover, want to maybe you wife
Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah, yeah, you love me baby
