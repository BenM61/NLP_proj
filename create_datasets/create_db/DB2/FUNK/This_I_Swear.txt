If you can't depend
On no one else
And you're trying to make it through life
All by yourself

Look to me, I'll be there
I'll come to your aid no matter where
I'll treat you good, I'll be fair
Give you good loving always, this I swear
Feel so good about it, baby

Said, if life's ups and downs
Are too much for you to stand
And you search so long in vain
For that helping hand

Look to me, I'm the one
Cause life without love sure ain't no fun
I'll treat you good, I'll be fair
Give you good loving always, this I swear
Feel so good about it, baby

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, baby
Everyday of my life, I love you more
And more and more each day

Said, if life's ups and downs
Are too much for you to stand
And you search so long in vain
For that helping hand

Look to me, I'm the one
Cause life without love sure ain't no fun
I'll treat you good, I'll be fair
Give you good loving always, this I swear
Feel so good about it, baby

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, baby
Everyday of my life, I love you more
And more and more each day

Can't keep from loving you
No, no, this I swear, baby
Oh, I love you
Can't keep from loving you, no

I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, baby
More and more and more and more
And more each day, honey, I do love you

Play this song
Play this song for me, play it
Can't keep from loving you
Baby, this I swear
