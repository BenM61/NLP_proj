You know what pop? What's that son?
Christmas just isn't gonna be the same this year
Why is that?
'Cause Santa's got a brand new bag!

Come on jump up, oh
Sock it to me Santa, you know what I like
Sock it to me Santa, just bring me a bike
Christmas just won't be a drag, Santa's got a brand new bag
Don't you dare let those children bring you down
You gotta spread those toys all over town
My stocking's all hung so you can see
Don't hang me up Santa, lay some toys on me
Sock it to me Santa you know where it's at
Sock it to me Santa, I want a baseball bat
Christmas just won't be a drag, cause Santa's got a brand new bag
I say come on Dancer, come on Prancer
A brand new Santa's got to be the answer
Come on Comet, and come on Cupid
Don't just stand there lookin' stupid

He's got a bright red cape and a white moustache (sock it to me Santa)
He's got lots of toys but no time for trash (sock it to me Santa)
He's dressed real warm from his head to his toes (sock it to me Santa)
He's lost a little weight but his jelly still rolls (sock it to me Santa)
Sock it to me Santa, you heard what I said
Sock it to me Santa, just bring me a sled
Christmas just won't be a drag, 'cause Santa's got a brand new bag
Sock it to me Santa
Sock it to me Santa
Sock it to me Santa
Sock it to me Santa
Sock it to me Santa
Sock it to me Santa
