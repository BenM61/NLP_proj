Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging the Great White Sharks, swimming in the bed
And here comes a Killer Whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, it has me by it's teeth

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?
Am I losing touch?
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

What's with the long face, do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
Don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island darling, you can't touch the floor

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?
Am I losing touch?
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

And good God, under starry skies we are lost
And into the breach we got tossed
And the water's coming in fast

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?
Am I losing touch?
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
