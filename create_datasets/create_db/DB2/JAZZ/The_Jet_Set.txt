Hey pal
Can I take your picture for the people back home
They won't believe it when they see this stuff
You see the camera that I got in Hong Kong

Completely duty free
This really is a pretty scene
Could you ask your kid to smile please
Sorry what exactly do you mean

Can you say it in English
'Cause we're the . . .
Jet set - get out of our way
And don't be messin' with the . . . 

Jet set - get out of our way
We got a lot of things to see
Let's get a Big Mac
Get it while the dollar's worth a thousand yen

It's quite a bargain here
Next year
We'll save some money and we'll hire Big en
For our anniversary

This really is a pretty scene
But I'm happy I don't live here
Hey what's the matter with the waiter's face
Can you say it in English

'Cause we're the . . .
Jet set - get out of our way
And don't be messin' with the . . . 
Jet set - get out of our way

We got a lot of things to see
