I wear my skin like it's not a problem
Or is it a problem for you?
My past writes the page I walk on

Today writes the past for
I wage my war in the name of living
Or is it the killing you choose?
The pill is a bright condition
The pain but the souls I use
(Night comes in, night comes in)
I, I wish you happiness

I, I wish you all success I do
Life will bring you all good things

Time will bring you many things
Or is it a problem for you?
My past writes the page I walk on
I wear my skin like it's not a problem

Today writes the past for
I wage my war in the name of living
The pill is a bright condition
Or is it the killing you choose?
The pain but the souls I use
I wish you well; my mind is made up for me

(The pain but the souls I, the pain but the souls)
I see your hell; my mind is made up to be
I know your pain; my mind is made up for me
I see your hate; my mind is made up to be

Punch back punch back
You're so fucking easy, punch back throw
Punch back punch back

You're so fucking easy, punch back throw
Punch back punch back
You're so fucking easy, punch back throw
Punch back punch back
You're so fucking easy, punch back

I wear my skin like it's not a problem
Or is it a problem for you?
Today writes the past for
My past writes the page I walk on
Or is it the killing you choose?
I wage my war in the name of living
The pain but the souls I use
The pill is a bright condition
