Do you love me
Can we still be a part of tomorrow
Do you want me baby, baby
Or is this just a thing of the past

Need to feel your arms around me
I can't stand it whenever you're gone
Ever since the day you found me
I've been hooked on your kiss, but I know now that this

Can't go on
Been watchin' all my dreams slip right away
Seems so wrong
How all the good times live inside of yesterday

Do you love me
Can we still be a part of tomorrow
Do you want me baby, yeah
Or is this just a thing of the past

Said you wouldn't let love burn me
Like a fool I believed it was true
Can't you see just how you hurt me
Got a sensitive heart and it's tearin' apart

Over you
I need to see that sunshine like before
Don't be cruel
Don't give up on the things we've both been livin' for

Do you love me
Can we still be a part of tomorrow
Do you want me baby
Or is this just a thing of the past

Is it so hard to show what you feel
Can't you understand that I still care
You've got to tell me this love is real
Or are tears the only thing we can share

Do you love me (I need to know what's goin' on)
Can we still be a part of tomorrow (Is this thing right or is it 
wrong)
Do you want me, baby (Do you know what's goin' on)
Or is this just a thing of the past (Is this thing right or is it 
wrong)

Do you love me (I need to know what's goin' on)
Are you tryin' to tell me it's over (Is this thing right or is it 
wrong)
Do you need me, baby (Do you know what's goin' on)
Don't you know that this lovin' can last (Is this thing right or is it
wrong)

Do you love me (I need to know what's goin' on)
Can we still be a part of tomorrow (Is this thing right or is it 
wrong)
Do you want me, baby (Do you know what's goin' on)
Or is this just a thing of the past (Is this thing right or is it 
wrong)

Do you love me (I need to know what's goin' on)
Are you tryin' to tell me it's over
