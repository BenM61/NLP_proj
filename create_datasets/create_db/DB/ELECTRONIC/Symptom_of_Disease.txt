What you kept saying
And what I was told
Never related,
So I don't know,
Maybe tomorrow
Or Wednesday,
But I'll find excuses
To wait, wait, wait

The only date that's certain,
The wedding of our friends,
I think it's for the better,
I keep my cool till then
One out of many
Not how it feels,
But how I'll think of you
At the end of the year

I don't know what's happening to me
Is it a symptom of disease?

Wish I could tell you
About the distance between
How my life is unfolding and
How I thought it would be
Wish you were someone
With whom I could share what I find
In the people and places
In this new world of mine
