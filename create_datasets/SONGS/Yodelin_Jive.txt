Since Jackson went over to Switzerland
The Alps haven't been the same
Since he started practicing yodelin'
He's on the road to fame
And back in the states, he'd really rate
As big as anyone could
And the headlines say, 
in all the papers they say, 
yodel boy makes good

He sings his yodelin' jive
He sings his yodelin' jive all day
The mountains echo his jive
The mountains echo his jive all day

Sometimes he yodels so sweetly
To imitate the Swiss
But the echo comes back like this
The hills are always alive with yodelin' jive
The mountains echo his yodelin' jive

He sings yodelin' jive, yodelinl jive
He sings his yodelin' jive all day
The mountains echo my jive, my yodelin' jive
The mountains echo my jive all day

Sometimes he yodels so so sweetly
To imitate the Swiss
But the echo comes back like this
He sings his yodelin' jive jive jive all day
The mountains echo his yodelin' jive

Since Jackson went over to Switzerland
He sings it all day to keep the blues far away
He sings and he sings and he sings it all day
He sings the jive all day
