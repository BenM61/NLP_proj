Bye, bye, Birdie
I'm gonna miss you so
Bye, bye, Birdie
Why'd ya have to go (Bye,bye)

No more sunshine (Sunshine)
It's followed you away (You away)
I'll cry, Birdie (Birdie)
Till you're home to stay (Home to stay)

I'll miss the way you smile
As though it's just for me
And each and ev'ry night
I'll write to you faithfully

Bye, bye, Birdie,
It's awful hard to bear
Bye, bye, Birdie
Guess I'll always care
Guess I'll always ca-a-a-a-are 
Guess I'll always care!
