Spent 23 years trying to be what you wanted me to be
Though it seemed like you couldn't save me
Till I picked up the mic and I was on the TV
Now you're ringing off my phone like every week
Where were you at 6, 7, 11 and 13 when shit was impossible
Mama left nine months pregnant 
But she came home alone from the hospital

How could you call yourself a man if you can't 
love your only lesson can't contol them
You'd rather destroy their souls and she was 
13 years old and you couldn't protected the innocence from being stolen
And I don't give a damn what you was going through and mama wasn't able
To put food on the table
You left the family unstable
Now you come around and act like you were some kind of a praisel

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do?
You can't tell me shit 
I'm grown without you

I spent 23 years trying to be the fucking man you should be
Taking care of your responsibility
Putting clothes on our back and shoes on our feet no help
But you always had your bag of weed
Where were you on 12,13, 14 and 15 when life was unliveable
Momma was so damn angry the way she treated me was unforgivable
You call yourself a man your oldest son he had to learn from his sister
How to put a niggas fist up, how to f*ck a 
niggas shit up and I cut any motherfucker 
that had come and tried to diss us
And I don't give a damn what you was going through 
And I needed saving I spent my every second 
blazing a little girl with the blade in and 
trying to f*ck up and take my life just wanted to dig my grave in

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do? (now what you gonna do?)
You can't tell me shit I'm grown without you 

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do?
You can't tell me shit 
I'm grown without you

Can't come and tryin' to tell me tonight
