Alone am I,
And all the world stands still as though
It understands the way I feel.
No use pretending, darling, I don't care,
I know this time it's real!

I tried so hard
To make myself believe
That this was just another passing thing.
Although it seemed to be like this before,
I know this time it's real!

A fool was I to have scorned love,
I never dreamed it could be this way!

So let them say
He falls in love each day,
And then he falls in love with someone new!
Although I must confess it's all so true,
But this time I love you!
