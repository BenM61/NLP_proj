Wash it in the sea
Let it soak all night
Wash it in the sea
Let the saltwater wash it away

Soak it in bleach
till it's white on white
soak it in bleach
till the blood just washes away

hang it in the wind
let it blow all night 
hang it up high
let the high wind blow it away

hang it in the wind 
let the sun burn bright
hang it in the wind
till the blood just washes away

i have waited wasted years for the child that's come and gone today
say what about this wasted fear?  
how can i just turn and wash it away?

If I can then I will wash it away
if she can then she will wash it away.
If I can then I will, wash it away
if she can then she will, wash it away.

Forty years spent one by one
Forty years of life just slipping away.  
What I'd give for a firstborn son.
Forty years of blood just washing away.

I have waited wasted lives
I have waited long enough I'd say
Say what about this wasted child?
How can I just turn and wash it away?

If I can then I will, wash it away.
If she can then she will wash it away
I I can then I will, wash it away
If she can then she will
Wash it away

Send me an angel.
Send me the ghost that i was
Send me an angel
Send me the ghost that i was
That I was
That I am
I will wash it away
She will wash it away
If I can then I will, wash it away

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
