I want to live
Where they'll change what they have done
Yeah

I must die
cold and shunned by the sun
Yeah

Why should I stay
Where there are people that hate
The things I need
and making me wait
yeah

They will teach you the hows instead of the why's
They will turn your truth into lies

I feel like crying
when I'm groping for a way 
to stop it from going
cause I want it,
want it, to stay
Yeah

They will teach you the hows instead of the why's
They will turn your truth into lies

I want to live
try, look and understand
I needed you to take hold of my hand
and pull me up, yeah
I feel but I can't, yeah
(Yes I do)
I want to, I want to live
Yes, I want to live yeah, yeah
To feel and...
(I'm gonna lose it, yeah)
