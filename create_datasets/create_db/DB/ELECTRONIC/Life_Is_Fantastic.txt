Life is fantastic, the beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic, I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic, the joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic, I don't want to die

Lost in the age of innocence
Trapped in a traffic accident
Got to escape the hospital
Intensive care

Don't try to fool yourself, you bag of skin and blood
One day I break your heart and bury you in mud
Don't be an egotist, the doctor wants your room
You had your go at life, the time is up, you're doomed

Life is fantastic, the beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic, I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic, the joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic, I don't want to die

I have to boost my confidence
Build me a strong immune defense
Take on the virus drilling
In my chilling spine

Look at your body, how the pieces fall apart
There ain't no brainwave, ain't no pumpin' from the heart
That was your life, my dear, I'm bored with your account
Before your body blow pay back my full amount

Life is fantastic, the beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic, I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic, the joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic, I don't want to die

You think you're so unique, you think you have it all
Deep down inside you're weak, I shake and make you fall
Don't be an egotist, the doctor wants your room
You had your go at life, the time is up, you're doomed

Life is fantastic, the beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic, I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic, the joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic, I don't want to die

Life is fantastic, the beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic, I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic, the joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic, I don't want to die
