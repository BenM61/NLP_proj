Back in the beginning the days flew by so fast
Well, we hung on every moment like we thought it would be the last
And every breath I drew, I drew it just for you
Now I don't know what to do to keep you beside me

And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
Time was on our side

And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
But now it seems we're running out of time

And now we're always working, talking on the telephone
You're always going your way and baby, I go my own
Remember when we promised, we'd never let it come to this
But somehow we just missed our happy ever after

And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
Time was on our side

And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
But now it seems we're running out of time

I've been so cold, I've been unkind
Oh, well, I left you alone, selfish and blind
But baby, I'm coming home, is there still time
To make it up to you

And I remember time was
We were never in a hurry
Never had to worry, baby
'Cause time was on our side

And I remember time was
The only thing we ever
Had to give one another, baby
Time was

What a time it was
What a time it was
What a time it was
