Slow electricity drained from teacups
Oh, easy and morphine, clocking manifests for most to last
I got to tell him he don't owe me nothing
The same goes in reverse

You can never really know
When they don't know no better
You can never really know
When they don't know no better

He don't know no better

Smooth clarity, drank from teacups
Sage parallelism, they keep letters just to find our gain
Ongoing distraction, keep on running in circles from his past
I got to tell him he don't owe me nothing

You can never really know
When they don't know no better
You can never really know
When they don't know no better

You can never really know
When they don't know no better
You can never really know
When they don't know no better
