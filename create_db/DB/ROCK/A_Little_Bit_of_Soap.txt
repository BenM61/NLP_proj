A little bit of soap will wash away your lipstick on my face, 
A little bit of soap will never, never never ever erase, 
A pain in my heart, in my eyes, 
As I go through the lonely years, 

A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears. 
A little bit of soap will take away your powder from my chin, 
A little bit of soap will never, never never ever begin, 

To take away the hurt that I feel, 
As I go through the lonely years, 
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears. 
Have you heard when love begins to die, 

And he isn't one to cry, 
Night and day. 
Like a bird, you left the robin's nest, 
And you're just like all the rest, 

You flew away. 
Ooh a little bit of soap will take away your perfume eventually, 
A little bit of soap will never wash away the memory, 
Of your name, in the night, 

That I call through the lonely years, 
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears. 
No I'll never lose the memory of your name, 
In the night, that I call through the lonely years, 

A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears, 
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears, 
Mmmm it's never never never never gonna wash away my tears, 
Mmmm never wash away my tears.
