Let me tell you about a little situation
It's been testing my patience
Man, she was keeping me up all night
'Cause you only get so far reading faces
We were off to the races
And I thought to myself "hold tight"
You see there was just one complication
She was already taken
And what was so wrong felt so right
She said "no need for looking over your shoulder
When you could just come over
And we can work this out just fine"

I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
So beat down playing by your rules
If you're a joker then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got, all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up

It all started with a simple conversation
It was on the weekend and she was talking me up all night
Kept asking if I was only faking
She was there for taking
Showing me that she was all mine
She told me she lived just around the corner
I wanted to know her
Yeah, she was making me lose my mind
I didn't know quite what I was chasing
She left my heart racing
And all between it was just one night

I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
So beat down playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you

If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got, all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up
