Sometimes you're fake and sometimes you're shy
Sometimes the air comes at the right time
And everyone's a friend tonight
It doesn't have to end tonight
See you in the morning with new eyes

Open up your mind

And fly
And fly

Sometimes you ask and get a reply
Sometimes it's easy to make up your mind
And everyone's a friend tonight
See there is no end in sight
See you in the morning with new skies

Open up your eyes

And fly
And fly
And fly
And fly

Everyone's a friend tonight
It doesn't have to end tonight
See you in the morning with new eyes
Everyone's a friend tonight
It doesn't have to end tonight
See you in the morning with new skies

And fly (see you in the morning with new eyes)
And fly (see you in the morning with new skies)
And fly (see you in the morning with new eyes)
And fly (see you in the morning with new skies)
