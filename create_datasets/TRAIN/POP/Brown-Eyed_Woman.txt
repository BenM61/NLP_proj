You look at me and baby, all you see are my blue eyes.
I'm not a man baby, all I am is what I symbolize.
Brown-eyed woman. (Stay away, baby.)
Brown-eyed woman. (Stay away, baby.)
Brown-eyed woman. (Stay away, baby.)
I could love you so, (no no) I could love you so, (no no)
brown-eyed woman I could love you so.
Um, um, um. All of the years all the hate and the fears
have twisted your heart. 
Now you turn away, you won't trust what I say
and it's tearing me apart.
Brown-eyed woman. (Stay away baby.)
Brown-eyed woman. (Stay away, baby.)
Brown-eyed woman. (Stay away, baby.)
I could love you so, (no no) I could love you so, (no no)
brown-eyed woman I could love you so.
 
Yes, yes, I'm holding out my hand to you.
Darling tell me, tell me please what more can I do,
brown-eyed woman. (Stay away, baby.)
Brown-eyed woman. (Stay away, baby.)
I want you, I need you. (Stay away, baby.)
I'm holding out my hand. (Stay away, baby.)
I want you, I need you. (Stay away, baby.)
I'm holding out my hand. (Stay away, baby.)
I want you, I need you. (Stay away, baby.)
