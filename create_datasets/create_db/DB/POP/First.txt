Is that someone you used to date
Why is she hanging around here, what's her story
Doesn't she know that its too late
That the party is over and the cars' for me

Why don't you tell her what's been going on
'cause she seems to be dreaming instead of just leaving
If you don't have the heart to fill her in
Then just step aside and let me lay it on the line

'cause your mine
And tonight you don't revolve around her
Your mine
And this time I'm gonna scream a little louder

[Chorus:]
Don't want to be like
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'cause when I see you something inside me burns
And then I realize 
I want to come first
I want to come first

You look at me and I just die
Its like heaven arriving in my mind and,
I can't believe all this jealousy
I used to be a girl who could let a guy breathe
But your mine
And tonight you revolve around me
Your mine
And this time I'm gonna get a little louder

Don't want to be like
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
'cause when I see you something inside me burns
And I realize I want to come first
I want to come first

Don't want to be like every girl who's tried to get you
I want to be the one who's never sorry that she met you
I want to come first [Repeat: x2]
Hey!

Don't want to be like 
Every other girl in the world
Like every other one who wants you
When i(when i)see you something inside me burns
And then I realize I want to come first

Every other one in the world 
Like every other one who wants you
Cause when I (when I) 
See you something inside me burns
And then I realize I want to come first. [Repeat: x2]
