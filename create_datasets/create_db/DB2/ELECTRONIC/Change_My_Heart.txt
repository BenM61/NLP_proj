I can see that you're jealous as f*ck
But I think you're having fun
'Cause when you see him talking me up
You know you picked a good one
And when I think that I've had enough
Straight to you I'll run
I might look but I'm not gonna touch
Next to you there's no one

Come on, baby, let it go
No tripping on your ego
I'm never gonna let you go
I just wanna let you know
I'm giving you a free throw
I'm never gonna let you go

Nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change this story
Nothing's gonna stop the way
I'm thinking 'bout you all the time
Nothing's gonna change my heart
Baby, you don't have to worry
Even if you go away and change the world
You still can't change my mind
No, nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change my heart
No, nothing's gonna change my heart

Even though I'll be flirting all night
I swear, I'm not a traitor
I can tell by the laugh in your eyes
You know you're not in danger
So come on and show up any time
Kiss me like a stranger
Got no problem leaving him behind
It's you I wanna savour

Come on, baby, let it go
No tripping on your ego
I'm never gonna let you go

Nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change this story
Nothing's gonna stop the way
I'm thinking 'bout you all the time
Nothing's gonna change my heart
Baby, you don't have to worry
Even if you go away and change the world
You still can't change my mind
No, nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change my heart
Nothing's gonna change my heart
No, nothing's gonna change my heart

Nothing's gonna change this story
Nothing's gonna stop the way
I'm thinking 'bout you all the time
Nothing's gonna change my heart
Baby, you don't have to worry
Even if you go and change the world
You still can't change my mind
