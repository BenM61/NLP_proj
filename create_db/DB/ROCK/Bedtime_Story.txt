I am standing on a mountain
I am scared out of my wits
I am hungry for companions
I have had my fill of this
I am waiting for a signal
I am praying that it comes
I will fly down from this mountain
I will shine just like the sun

But I don't see the point of always
Crawling on my knees
Give up a little they want it all
They take just they please

We will meet them on the beaches
We will fight them in the fields
We will let this mountain teach us
We might fall but we don't yield
I have got no taste for glory
I just want to live in peace
This is not a bedtime story
Its not beauty and the beast

There has always been a valley
There were always strangers here
This is not a new conception
It goes back one thousand years

But I don't see the point of always
Crawling on my knees
Give up a little they want it all
They take just what they please

And it just goes on forever...
