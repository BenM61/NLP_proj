A thousand men in uniform
Kicked down the doors of my concern
And stormed the kingdom
To take its worth
Leaving every stone unturned

Fate can pick you up, you know that it can put you down
It can pick you up and spin your head around and round
If you hold us back you know that we can shout
We brought you into this place you know we can take you out

You've been in school for ten years now
Eighty grand indebted down
Every day's a missile test
Your dancing shoes and torn up dress

2017 we know
Reality's one big sick show
Every day's a crisis fest
Your dancing shoes and torn up dress

Fate can pick you up, you know that it can put you down
It can pick you up and spin your head around and round
If you hold us back you know that we can shout (no, no, no)
We brought you into this place, you know we can take you out (no, no, no)

If you hold us back you know that we can shout (no, no, no)
We brought you into this place, you know we can take you out 

There's a coup in our country
It's happening now
A coup in our city
It's happening downtown, every tragedy has its sad clown
Victory has its dark cloud

If you hold us back you know that we can shout (no, no, no)
We brought you into this place, you know we can take you out (no, no, no)

If you hold us back you know that we can shout (no, no, no)
