You know you had me
With your sensuous charm
Yet you looked so alarmed 
As I walked on by
In awesome wonder 
You had to know why I did not respond to carry on

[Chorus]
Love me in a special way
What more can I say 
Love me now
Love me in a special way
What more can I say 
Love me now (love me now)

'Cause I'm special
Not the average kind 
Who'd accept any line
That sounds good
So reach into your chain of thoughts
Try to find something new
Because what worked for you so well before
For me it just won't do.

[Chorus]

So reach into your chain of thought
Try to find something new
What worked so well for you before 
For me it just won't do
