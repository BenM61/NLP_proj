There so much I want to know
In every day in every notice
The hour it is going slow
So how am I to show this
And I've got this feeling
Something's going on

Wake up in a kinda sweat
Fingers slightly numb and shaking
Blood flows back into your hand
Must be the way you have been sleeping
And I've got this feeling
Something's going on

The hats that were stacked on the shelf
The glasses the clock the wall
The picture of Michael and Bubbles
Something's going on

They could give a tick or tock
And maybe that would be the problem
It could be a simple thought
It's something that is meant to solve it
And I've got this feeling
Something's going on
