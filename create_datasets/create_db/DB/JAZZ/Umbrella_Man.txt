Umbrellas, umbrellas for men
Men's umbrella, lady
Mend by hand, lady
Umbrellas to mend

Toodle-uma-luma-luma
Toodle-uma-luma-luma
Toodle-aye-ay
Any umbrellas, any umbrellas to mend today?

Bring your parasol
It may be small, it may be big
He repairs them all
With what you call a thingamajig

Pitter patter patter, pitter patter patter
Here comes the rain
Let it pitter patter, let it pitter patter
Don't mind the rain

He'll mend your umbrella
Then go on his way singing
Toodle-uma-luma-luma-toodle-ay
Toodle-uma-luma-luma-toodle-ay
Any umbrellas to mend today?

When there's a lull
And things are dull
I sharpen knives for all the wives
In the neighborhood
And I'm very good

I darn a sock
I'll mend a clock
An apple cart
A broken heart
I mend anything

But he'd rather sing
Toodle-uma-luma-luma
Toodle-uma-luma-luma
Toodle-aye-ay
Any umbrellas, any umbrellas to mend today?

He'll patch up your troubles
Then go on his way singing
Toodle-uma-luma-luma-toodle-ay
Toodle-uma-luma-luma-toodle-ay
Any umbrellas to mend today?

He'll patch up your troubles
Then go on his way singing
Toodle-uma-luma-luma-toodle-ay
Toodle-uma-luma-luma-toodle-ay
Any umbrellas to mend today?
