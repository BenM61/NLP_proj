I went to work this mo'nin'
My foreman looked me in the eye
He said, "Fella I don't know what's wrong with ya,
But you look sick enough to die"

He sent me to the company doctor
And he examined from head to toe
"Whatever's wrong with ya, young man,
My x-rays just won't show"

I say, angel of mercy
Won't you please look down on me?
Angel of mercy
A little mercy is all I need

The finance company
They just don't receive my check
They say they want a payment by Friday
Or they want all-a the furniture back

I went to the credit union
To try to get myself a loan
They said, "I would let ya have it young man,
But we hear that you won't be workin' here much longer

Angel of mercy
Won't you please look down on me?
Oh, angel of mercy
A little mercy is all I need

Lord have mercy! Oh angel! Oh!

Oh!

Cut my lights off this mo'nin'
They set my furniture out doors
I was listenin' to the weatherman 'while ago
An' he's says it's gonna rain an'snow

My daughter's got pneumonia
An' my son is down with the flu
My whole family's sufferin' from malnutrition
And I can't even 'fford them soup

I say, angel of mercy
Won't you please look down on me?
Oh, angel of mercy
A little mercy is all I need
