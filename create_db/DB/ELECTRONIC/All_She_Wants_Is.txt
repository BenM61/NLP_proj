Hey...
Spend your money on the corner now,
Know you've gotta save some for the shoeshine boy
You've been pulling them by the hand inside,
Oh...collecting all your toys.
If you need a lead to heaven now, just stick around
You're going to be there.
What do you care?
What do you dare?
What does your heart say now?
All she wants is...
All she wants is...
All she wants is...
Divine intervention, couldn't keep the word from leaking out,
With your pleasure in suspension
Not to mention what you hang it around
If you need a lead to heaven,
A place to share 
In every position..
What do you care?
What do you dare?
What does your heart say now?
All she wants is...
All she wants is...
All she wants is...
More!
All she wants is...
All she wants is...
All she wants is...

All she wants is...
All she wants is...
All she wants is...
