Too hot
Too cold
I'm sick and tired of doing what I'm told
It's not that my circumstances haven't changed
Can't appreciate
I know they're lying all the same

All I'm asking of you now
All I'm asking of you now
Where in the world must I go to find you?

Can't sleep
Can't eat
My whole body seems intent on defeat
Keep telling me my condition hasn't changed
Can't appreciate there's no one but myself to blame

All I'm asking of you now
All I'm asking of you now
Where in the world must I go to find you?

All I'm asking of you now
All I'm asking of you now
Where in the world must I go to find you?

Where in the world must I go to find you?
Where in the world
Where in the world

Keep telling me my condition hasn't changed
Can't appreciate there's no one but myself to blame
All I'm asking of you now
All I'm asking of you now
Where in the world must I go to find you?

All I'm asking of you now
All I'm asking of you now
Where in the world must I go to find you?

Where in the world must I go to find you?
Where in the world must I go to find you?
Where in the world must I go to find you?
Where in the world must I go to find you?
Where in the world must I go to find you?
Even in our wildest dreams
Here and now
Here and now
Here and now
