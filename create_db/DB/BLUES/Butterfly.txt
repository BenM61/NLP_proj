It's like a butterfly in a hurricane
It's like candle lights in the pouring rain
It's like fireflies gathered on the sun
My chances with you are a million to one

Like a driftwood on an ocean wave
That gets tossed and turned like you're doing to me
I was tight up but now I'm coming undone
My chances with you are a million to one

It's like a butterfly in a hurricane
It's like a butterfly in a hurricane

It's like a gunfight when all I got is a knife
Like a lost cause trying to turn back time
Like a double down with a suicide king
I'm DOA, baby, you're killing me

I'm at the starting gate after the race is won
My chances with you are a million to one

It's like a butterfly in a hurricane
It's like a butterfly in a hurricane

I don't care, I'm jumping in
It's hard enough to find the real thing
I don't care if it's a million to one
You're the one for me, yeah

It's like a butterfly in a hurricane
I'm getting beat up but I can take the pain
I got one shot, don't know how it will end
Sometimes baby, the losers win

It's like a butterfly in a hurricane
It's like a butterfly in a hurricane
It's like a butterfly in a hurricane
It's like a butterfly in a hurricane, oh yeah
Oh, in a hurricane
