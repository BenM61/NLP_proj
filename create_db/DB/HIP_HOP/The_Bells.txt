Dry your eyes
Wet your lips by kissing mine

I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells
Darlin', I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells

When your lips are kissing mine
Do you hear the bells, honey
Do you hear them ringing?
When I'm kissing you--lay it on baby

Do you hear the bells?

What do I have to do? (What should I do?)
To make you feel (Deeply into me)
Do you hear the bells, honey
Do you hear them ringing?
When I'm kissing you (I hear the bells)
Hear the bells (I hear the bells)
Hear them ringing and ringing
Oh, do you love me
(Do you love me like I love you)
Like I, I...

True love and joy and faith
All my strength I give to you
My love is yours exclusively
To enjoy and raise as you want to

There is one thing that I want you to remember
If you should ever leave me
I believe I'll go insane
Darling, I'll never hear the bells

Never, ever
Never gonna hear the bells without 'cha, baby
