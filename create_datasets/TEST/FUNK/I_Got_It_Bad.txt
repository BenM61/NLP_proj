I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on

You make me shiver
You make me weak
You make it so good sometimes
I just can't speak

Don't take this lightly, I'm in a daze
Infatuated baby, truly amazed
The way you hold me and call my name
Erases all the lies and all the games

So baby, squeeze me, don't let me loose
Keep lovin' me the way
The way you do

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on

There's no denyin'
There is no doubt
There is no use in tryin' to do without

Your love is so strong baby
Your eyes are deep
You turn me on my darlin'
Fulfill my needs

I'm not gonna bitch now baby
I won't complain
Your hooks are so far in me
I feel no shame

And everythin' has changed
Since you found out
You got me where you want me
Baby, I'm in your house

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

Keep it goin' on, keep it goin' on
Keep it goin' on, keep it goin' on

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

Never, never leave you alone
'cause I got it so bad

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on
