Sitting alone, my mind tends to wander
To the things I think will satisfy me
And every time I think I get somewhere, I seem to end back at the start
And I'm stuck 'till I find the one who wants my heart

Will someone say, yeah, yeah, I'll be there?

I will give you everything you need in time
And I will love you more you see, right now

Is it even true that there's good somewhere inside of me?
If I try my best it's still not enough
But tryin' only ever goes so far and in the end I feel the same
And the good I want only ends in shame

Will someone say, yeah, yeah, I'll be there?

I will give you everything you need in time
And I will love you more you see, right now

All I want is your love that you've given love for me
And now I've found all I need, yeah

And I, I will give you everything you need in time
I will love you more you see, yeah
And I, I will give you everything you need in time
I will love you more you see, right now
Right now, yeah
