Showed up at the right time
In a broke down limousine
All you had was red lights
I went and turned them all to green
I found you in the landslide
And pulled you out again

The hardest conversations
Are the ones you never had
Well you don't have to say it
'Cause you know I understand
Never been the bravest
But if you need a hand

I got two, baby
If you're in trouble I got you, baby
Nothing that I wouldn't do, baby
And you'll know, you'll know

That I am a rock, I am a stone 
I'll be your strength, I'll be your home 
And you may walk a lonely road
But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone, oh, woah

I don't have the answers
But I can listen for a while
Might not understand it
But I can try to make you smile
When you're in a black place
And need a shoulder you can cry on

I got two, baby
If you're in trouble I got you, baby
Nothing that I wouldn't do, baby
And you'll know, you'll know

That I am a rock, I am a stone (Oh, I am a stone)
I'll be your strength, I'll be your home (Oh, I'll be your home)
And you may walk a lonely road
But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone, oh, woah
You know, you know

I am a rock, I am a stone
I'll be your strength, I'll be your home
And you may walk a lonely road

But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone, oh, woah

'Cause I am a rock, I am a stone, oh
And I'll be your strength, I'll be your home
And you may walk a lonely road
But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
