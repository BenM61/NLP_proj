Our dad
would send us to our room
he'd be the voice of doom
he said that we would thank him later
all day
he was solid as a rock
but by eight o'clock
we'd be crumbling
one night
my brother Joe and me
climbed down the family tree
that grew outside our bedroom window
we ran
though we knew it couldn't last
running from the past
from things that we were born to be

Looking back it's so bizarre
it runs in the family
all the things we are
on the back seat of the car
with Joseph and Emily
we only see so far
- and we all have our daddy's eyes
looking back it's so bizarre

Dad rang
the officer in charge
a man so large
he barely fit his circumstances
he said
two kids out on the street
were picked up on the beat
and in the station
so there's me
with Emily and Joe
daddy driving home
all heading in the same direction
he knew
no matter what the breaks
we'd make the same mistakes
couldn't take his eyes of Joe and me

Looking back it's so bizarre
it runs in the family
all the things we are
on the backseat of the car
with Joseph and Emily
we only see so far
- and we all have our daddy's eyes
looking back it's so bizarre
it runs in the family
all the things we are
looking back it's so bizarre

Like a dream within a dream
we're all somewhere in between

Like a drummer plays his drum
like a father like a son
- and your gonna have to face the music
- face the music

Hey hey
we keep it running in the family
hey hey
we keep it coming in the family

Looking back it's so bizarre
it runs in the family
all the things we are
on the backseat of the car
with Joseph and Emily
we only see so far
- 'cause we all have our daddy's eyes
take me back into your arms
it's no longer a mystery
no cause for alarm
could have never come this far
with no sense of history
it always leaves a scar
- and we all have our daddy's eyes
looking back it's so bizarre

running in the family

Hey, hey!
