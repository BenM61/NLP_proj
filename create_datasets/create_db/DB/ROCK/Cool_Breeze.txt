There's a cool breeze in the air
Why should we be afraid to love
Warm, warm fires are here
As the breeze kindles the fire
Hold me near.

Chains, the world's wrapped us in chains
How can we let it hold us back from lovin'
Love, break those chains
And free us from the bondage we've known for years,
Free us from the bondage 
We've known for years.

There's a cool breeze in the air
Makin' me feel, feel like lovin' you
Warm, warm fires are here
As the breeze kindles the fire
Hold me near
Breeze, kindle the fire
And hold me near.
