Feel it
Break your bones
Mr. Jones 

Taste me
As I bleed
Taste my need

Spaceboy I've missed you
Spinning round my head
Any way you choose me
You'll break instead

Watch me
Death defy
Defile my life

I don't need
I don't care
Please

I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
'Cause when a lover aches
'Cause when a lover breaks
I want to go home
I want to go home

Spaceboy they'll kill me
Before I'm dead and gone
And any way you choose me
It won't be wrong
And any way you choose me
We won't be long

We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
We won't be long
