I thought it was the last time
Our ending was bittersweet
Thought you were out of my mind
Instead, you're stuck on repeat
In my dreams you belong to me
Hold me near, never set me free

I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every second
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken record
In my heart I feel it echo
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam

I don't know why
I don't know how you're here
Impossible to make you disappear
In my dreams you belong to me
Hold me near, never set me free

I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every second
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken record
In my heart I feel it echo
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam

Voice like a broken record

I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every second
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken record
In my heart I feel it echo
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam

I hear your voice like a broken record
Saying my name every
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
Voice like a broken, broken, broken, broken, broken record
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
I hear your voice like a broken, broken, broken, broken, broken record
Dum-dum-daram-dum-dum-daram-dam
