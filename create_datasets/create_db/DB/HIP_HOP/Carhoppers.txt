Uh, uh!  I call girls car hoppers
'Cause I make em hit notes like they was singin' at the operas
May I say, on any day, yeah they with it
They're in a Yugo, if you got the Yugo kitted (say what?)
Stand by your man, yes that's what they all claim
You don't have a car?  Then you're fucked up in the game
They'll walk by ya, and say hiya
Is he drivin' 'cause he cute?  Oh no, his shit is tired (oh no)
And they'll turn like you got the virus
'Cause you didn't have a car, or the one had there wasn't fliest
But for the record I'm not trickin'
But you can call me Timex, 'cause I'll still take the lickin'
So if you're hot and bothered, or in a frenzy
I'll pop the mack soundtrack in the Benzy
And you can tell me how you choose me baby
Baby, this no time for you, to act crazy
You can't play me, not like Play-Doh
Don't leave me for the kid honey, in the Laredo (speak on it)
But if you gots to go, you gotta go, I can't stop her
That's the lifestyles of the car hoppers

Ever since my dad put me up on his Rivi-era
Now I see things much clearer
When I'm in my ride, women want to be nearer to the
Showstopper, yeah the profiteer
Uh, excuse me honey, it's not nice to stare
Dare, if you want to get with this here
Put on your best gear, and step to the rear
I'll be there, say about ten thirty
And know that don't be late honey cause my beeper, is loaded
And, if you're not there, by the toot of the horn

Uh, now you think things is right 'cause she's on
The next man's goose neck and suckin' his exhaust pipe
She's got him and he's got an erection
Just because of his fuel injection, system
All before yeah she used to diss him
Now she knows money on down to his pistons
And his engine, or let's say his chassis
Just blow your horn and she'd run like Lassie
Or better yet, she'd flip like Kujo
If you got a Jag, or a Porsche Turbo (once again, break it down)
They got more promises than Thomases
And I think they better go and call, Hoppers Anonymous
But I know, where to send 'em
Ah to the Hyundai dealer to gets the Benz emblem
