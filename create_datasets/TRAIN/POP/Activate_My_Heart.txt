I've been played around
Love has let me down
Tore my feelings out

(Robot, robot lover)

I refuse to hurt
I refuse to cry
Not another time

(Robot, robot love)

I know I need to be rewired
I want to love again
Don't think my heart is just a hard drive
I'm just malfunctioning

Show me how to love,
Show me where to start,
Activate my heart

(Show me how to love, activate my heart)

Show me where to start
Activate my heart
'Cause it don't work anymore

Show me how to love
Show me where to touch
Teach me how to smile

(Robot, robot lover)

I can learn to kiss
I feel happiness
I can be the one

(Robot, robot lover)

I came equiped with all the same parts
I'm not just megabytes
So hold me close while I push restart
So I can love you right

Show me how to love,
Show me where to start,
Activate my heart

(Show me how to love, activate my heart)
