Brother Pele's in the back
Sweet Zina's in the front
Cruisin' down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming
Please step out onto the line
Pele preaches words of comfort
Zina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades
Is that a Chevy '69?

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Destination unknown, as we pull in for some gas
Freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions snakes monkey
Pele speaks "righteous," Sister Zina says "funky"

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
It's making me crazy, it's making me crazy
Every time I look around (look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face

Ring master steps out and says "the elephants left town"
People jump and jive, but the clowns have stuck around
TV news and cameras, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, "we're outta here," Zina says, "right on"
We're making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy and headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest, hey, buy the rights

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
It's making me crazy, it's making me crazy
Every time I look around (look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face
It's in my face

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
It's making me crazy, it's making me crazy
Every time I look around (look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
It's making me crazy, it's making me crazy
Every time I look around (look around)
Every time I look around (look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face
