Same old bills on the dresser same old sheets on the bed
Same old pans in the kitchen the same old day old bread
Same old sad eyed news man on my same old TV set
Talking about our big depression but I ain't worried yet
About hard times, hard times

Hard times is Betty and Bubba living in a mansion and hating each other lord
Hard times is a-losing your faith and watching your spirits fall
Hard times is the children too racking their brains about who loves who
We ain't got no hard times at all

Sisters got the same old dollies brothers got the same old trains
Same old love and laughter playing the same old games
I know you want to sail the south seas and I want to see Paree
But as long as there's a bed to lie in there's still a lot of sights to see

Cause hard times is Betty and Bubba living in a mansion and hating each other lord
Hard times is a-losing your faith and watching your spirits fall
Hard times is the children too racking their brains about who loves who
We ain't got no hard times
Honey we ain't got no hard times
We ain't got no hard times at all
