I love the way you keep them heels on
Hair ain't yours but it's paid for and it's real long
Show them tattoos when you switch it up
With your J's on
And you got ass so fat that I can't help but feel On
And you keep it real when it comes to having sex
Girl you don't ever flex
Long as I f*ck you good
You ain't worried bout what's next
That's why I keep you here
You ain't like them other hoes
Cause you the fucking best
Just in case you didn't know

Cause you ain't got
A half a million dollar condo
And you ain't got
A hundred thousand dollar car
But you got a billion dollar body
Trust me I know
You keep it hood no matter where you are

Cause you come from the ghetto
Love 'em from the ghetto
You're you the type I like
That's why I keep you right you off the ghetto
Love 'em from the ghetto
Ain't afraid to let it show
Baby, go on let them know
You out the ghetto
Let them know, you from the ghetto
Better let'em know
Girl you out the ghetto
Better let'em know
Better let'em know
You out that G-H-E-T-T-O

You hold it down
And you never let them haters
Come around, girl that's why I keep you on speed dial
Just in case some shit get bad
Just in case I need you
If they locked me down I know I'd see you
That's without a doubt
I know you understand how it go
But you're still down for the ride
That's why I still keep you by my side

Cause you ain't got
A half a million dollar condo
And you ain't got
A hundred thousand dollar car
But you got a billion dollar body
Trust me I know
You keep it hood no matter where you are

Cause you come from the ghetto
Love 'em from the ghetto
You're you the type I like
That's why I keep you right you off the ghetto
Love 'em from the ghetto
Ain't afraid to let it show
Baby, go on let them know
You out the ghetto
Let them know, you from the ghetto
Better let'em know
Girl you out the ghetto
Better let'em know
Better let'em know
You out that G-H-E-T-T-O

She G-H-E-T-T-O
My little buddy, my little hoe
Been fucking with her since I was in high school
She had my heart in secrets too
Born and raised in the projects
Never listen what other guys said
She been going though some shit
I can tell, because her eyes red
Her heart hurt, it's been beat up
Wanna start over, won't mislead ya
I pledge my heart like I pledge allegiance.
Give my all if won't leave me
She G-H-E-T-T-O
I love that shit
Just cause you see her with mine, don't mean she broke
(She got own stack nigga)
Yeah!
Shawty down with my pimping,
Shawty know how it goes,
Shawty know her position and shawty play her role
Got August here with me and I can rap it acapella,
I f*ck with you lil' baby
Even though you from the ghetto

Love 'em from the ghetto
Girl you the type I like
That's why I keep you right you off the ghetto
Love 'em from the ghetto
Ain't afraid to let it show
Baby, go on let them know
You out the ghetto
Let them know, you from the ghetto
Better let'em know
Girl you out the ghetto
Better let'em know
Better let'em know
You out that G-H-E-T-T-O
