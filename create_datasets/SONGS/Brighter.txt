We've been knowing each other
For many a year, it's true,
And I can't think of anyone else
Can make me feel as good as you.
Yeah, you make my day
A little bit brighter in every way.

I'm so glad to have you
In this old troubled time;
When true love and understanding, child,
Are so hard to find.
Yes, you make my day
A little bit brighter every day.

Some people live in darkness
Their whole life through.
I just know that I'd have been one of them
If it hadn't been for you.

Now, sometimes I feel afraid
As we all tend to do,
But I think of the loving good times we've had...

And I know we're gonna make it through.
'Cause you make my day
A little bit brighter, in every way.
