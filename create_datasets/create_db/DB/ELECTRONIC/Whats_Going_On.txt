Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Father, father
This don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on, yeah?
What's going on?

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Just because our hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
But just talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Tell me what's going on
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?

You tell me, I'll tell you
You tell me, I'll tell you what's going on
