Where is the ritual
And tell me where where is the taste
Where is the sacrifice
And tell me where where is the faith

Someday there'll be a cure for pain
That's the day I throw my drugs away
When they find a cure for pain
Where is the cave

Where the wise woman went
And tell me where
Where's all that money that I spent
I propose a toast to my self control

You see it crawling helpless on the floor
Someday there'll be a cure for pain
That's the day I throw my drugs away
When they find a cure for pain 

When they find a cure for pain 
When they find a cure find a cure for pain
