Now you heard about the shotgun, how bad it's gonna be
I got news for you, baby, just listen to me
You're twining and you're whining like all the rest
Well, I got my body poppin' out for you to witness

45, yeah, do the 45
45, yeah, do the 45

Well, here comes little sister, just twistin' on a storm
She's doin' the 38 and she's wavin' her arms
Well, come on now, girl, and dance with me
I got my 45 and I'm as bad as I can be, yeah

Now, don't just stand there lookin' so dumb
Act like that's a game and have you some fun
Everybody's dancin' and movin' all around
They've got their 45 and they're the best in town

45, yeah, do the 45
45, yeah, do the 45

Come on now, girl, do the 45
Twist up a storm, baby, do the 45
Why did you twine it, baby? Do the 45
Hey, hey, hey

45, yeah, do the 45
