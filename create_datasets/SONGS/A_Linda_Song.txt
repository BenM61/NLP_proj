He never wrote a song for Linda 
He wrote as though he lived alone 
He wrote of dreams that end 
And of sad brave men 
Inventing worlds he'd never known 

But he never wrote a song for Linda 
And she was right there all along 
Loved him back to life 
When his luck ran low 
But he never wrote a Linda song 

He nearly broke his heart at writing 
Linda kept him from despair 
Standin' by his side 
Through the hungry days 
But he hardly seemed to see her there 

And he never wrote a song for Linda 
And she was right there all along 
The one real thing in his crazy world 
And he never wrote a Linda song. 

When the bills piled up 
He couldn't pay 
He couldn't dream no more 
So he hitched a ride and he rode away 
And he left a note for Linda by the door 
By the door 

When times got rough he'd phone her 
Once or twice she took the call 
Then she changed her number and she turned her head 
And Linda never looked back at all 

He'll never write a song for Linda 
And she was right there all along 
All he knows is no one understands 
And he never wrote a Linda song 
No he never wrote a Linda song
