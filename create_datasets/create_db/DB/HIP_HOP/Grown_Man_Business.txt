If you ever had a grown man
Let me put you in a grown man business
If you ready for a grown man
Lay back and get this grown man business
If you ever had a grown man
Let me put you in a grown man business
If you ready for a grown man
B I'm about my grown man business

You tell me you like him, 'Cause he's young but wild (wild)
So you can't control him 'cause he's always out 
(deep in the streets)
And when he comes home he don't help with the bills or car note (no)
And although he got a young back, he don't know about that real stroke 
(that you really need)
I bet you thought that age was just a number 
(just a little number)
But baby nowadays it makes me wonder
Why he let's you down at the wrong time 
(You're at a stage where you trying to make moves and he)
Plays you out like a small child 
(I bet his age got a whole lot to do with it)

[Chorus]
When the lies and games he runs on you get old (baby, I'm right here)
And whenever you're ready for grown man love come on (I'm right here)
And when you decide that little boys finish girls (girl come here)
Get back and get this grown man business girl ('cause it is right here)

If you're ready for a grown man
Lay back and get this grown man business

He's not really man enough to take care of home (home)
You need that security, somebody sexy and grown (grown and sexy)
He spends what he can, but mama I gives all I have (have)
Just check my track record baby, everything I do is first class 
(I thought you knew)
I bet you though that age was just a number 
(just a little number)
But baby nowadays it makes me wonder
He let's you down at the wrong time 
(Girl I can see that you're out of his league but)
Plays you out like a small child 
(so if you're ready for me)

[Chorus]

I got all you need
So make up your mind
And have it the way you like
If you do choose me
I'll promise you, you'll never go back

[Chorus]

I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
Ooh, yeah
