Turn, turn up the song
Takes me higher than the sun
Sing, sing from your gut
Sing until we become one

Hold, hold on to me
Stay with me until it's time
'Cause for tonight
Feels like everything could turn out fine

We're higher than the sun
And nothing's gonna change the way I'm feeling now
May you go on and on
It's never gonna fade the way I'm feeling

Sounds, sounds like a storm
Rages in the shaken air
Oh, whispers low
Like a friend you never knew was there

We're higher than the sun
And nothing's gonna change the way I'm feeling now
May you go on and on
It's never gonna fade the way I'm feeling now

There's a song to ease your fear
A song to take you far from here
One for joy, one for desire, one for despair
Yeah

We're higher than the sun
And nothing's gonna change the way I'm feeling now
May you go on and on
It's never gonna fade the way I'm feeling

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
