Something may go wrong
If you come too close to me
Something may go wrong
Hold me closer, let us see
I want to fall in love
Perhaps with you it might happen
But something may go wrong

Something might go wrong
My heart's been too long napping
It's been asleep too long
I'm afraid to let you hold me
But I want to fall in love
So come a little closer
Let's see, perhaps this can be love

Something may go wrong
Irresistibly, delightfully, fascinatingly wrong

Something may go wrong
Irresistibly, delightfully, fascinatingly wrong

I want to fall in love
Delightfully, irresistibly, uh-huh, fascinatingly wrong

Something may go wrong
Irresistibly, fascinatingly, delightfully, uh-huh, wrong
