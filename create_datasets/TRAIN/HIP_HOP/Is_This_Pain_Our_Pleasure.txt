Spoken
Sometimes relationships
Sometimes they just don't work out
You gotta do what you gotta do
You know?

Damn
We tried so hard to get it right
But this relationship has been denied
Between the sheets we thought that everything would be alright
Talk
That's something we both used to do
But now you always got an attitude
Don't know what we supposed to do, and I don't know what to say but

Is this pain or pleasure, cause all we do is firhgt
Been so wrong for so long girl, that it's feeling right (2x)

I'm looking
At you baby lookin' so good
When any man sees you it's understood
Why I would do the things I do, just to be with you
Oh, I love you
And then sometimes I feel that I can't stand you
But I just can't bring myself to leave you
And you keep pushing me away from you, and I don't know what to say

Is this pain or pleasure, cause all we do is firhgt
Been so wrong for so long girl, that it's feeling right (2x)

Bridge
Oh why, oh why, oh why 
Do we do what we do baby
Oh why we fuss and fight
Between me and you baby
