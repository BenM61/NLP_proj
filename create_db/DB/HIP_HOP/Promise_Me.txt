All of my life it seemed I waited for this day
All this time I was searching cause I never knew 
You could make me feel this way
So much love 

You captured my heart and my soul
And baby I'm loosing control I don't ever want to let go
Of what you give me

[Chorus]
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from a love
Promise me, promise me

If you could grantee that what you say is true
Everyday you're my life ill be there threw the night
And I give my self to you
So much love 
I cherish the moments we share
The feelings that won't disappear 
The magic you bring when you're near
So take that from me

[Chorus:Repeat x3]
