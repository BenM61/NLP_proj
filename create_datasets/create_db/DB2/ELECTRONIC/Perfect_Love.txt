Your perfect love
Your perfect love

Oh, boy, what a fight
We fought and the thing is
We were both right
Okay, I'm crazy but maybe

Quiero tenerte
Quisiera odiarte
Quiero besarte
Quiero olvidarte

Both of us, what a sight
In the morning screaming
Believing it could be so right
'Cause you know that you're mine, baby

Yes, you are
Still you're in my dreams
Not constantly
Not constantly

Your perfect love
Your perfect love
Your perfect love
Your perfect love

Through the day and the night
Dreaming of you, baby
Here with a love that feels so right
I know it's hazy but maybe

Yo quiero amarte
Quiero olvidarte
Debi sacarte
Pero no puedo

But believe me enough
To be eternally, eternally

Your perfect love
Your perfect love
Your perfect love
Your perfect love

Your perfect love
Your perfect love
Your perfect love
Your perfect love

Your perfect love
Your perfect love
Your perfect love
