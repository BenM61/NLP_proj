Take back what we know is a hurricane
It moves faster than anything we try to feign
Sleep tight this storm is a lullaby
In time it'll pass us by

It comes back to haunt us again and again
It's a white noise, it's a white noise
The heartache, the thunder, the dust rising high
It's a white noise, it's a white noise

In this life
We can see everything
In this life

If I could give her, giver her, give her
Everything she wants
If a could show her, show her, show her
Everything she needs

If I could give her, giver her, give her
Everything she wants
If a could show her, show her, show her
Everything she needs

Take back what we know is a hurricane
Goes out every time you get your own way
Sleep tight this storm is a dark sky
Wake up and it's passed us by

It comes back to haunt us again and again
It's a white noise, it's a white noise
The heartache, the thunder, the dust rising high
It's a white noise, it's a white noise

In this life
We can see everything
In this life

If I could give her, giver her, give her
Everything she wants
If a could show her, show her, show her
Everything she needs

If I could give her, giver her, give her
Everything she wants
If a could show her, show her, show her
Everything she needs

You're still the girl who rules my heart
I'm still the boy to tear it all apart
You're still the girl who rules my heart
I'm still the boy to tear it all apart
You're still the girl who rules my heart
I'm still the boy to tear it all apart
You're still the girl who rules my heart
It's all for us, it's all for us

If I could give her, giver her, give her
Everything she wants
If a could show her, show her, show her
Everything she needs

If I could give her, giver her, give her
Everything she wants
If a could show her, show her, show her
Everything she needs
