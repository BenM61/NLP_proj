I am diving up this mountain
I am climbing to the bottom of this sea
I'm wearing shades when it is midnight
I'm walking backwards and my eyes, they are closed

And now that all four walls come crashing down
And now that all four walls come crashing down
Crashing down

Anybody there, anybody there to tell me
Tell me what is wrong
'Cause now I think that I just can't go on
Anybody there, anybody there to tell me
Turn me around
'Cause now I think my world is crashing down

I am dreaming when I think that I'm awake
I am running when I really want to stay
I was laughing when I had the chance to cry
I am drowning and the water ain't so high

And now that all four walls come crashing down
And now that all four walls come crashing down
Crashing down

Tell me now

Hear me angel
Hear my soul
Need you to rescue me
Show me the way
