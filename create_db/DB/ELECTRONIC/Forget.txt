They'll give us something
They'll give us so much to forget
Or an offer to deal with it.
Or an offer to deal with it.

With pencil and knife
You heard your love again
You wrestled your nightmares, the sweat from your bedsheets
This is all of it, this is everything I'm wanting to forget.

The winter sets in.
It has a way of crystallizing the bad times, the fevers, the heartaches
This is all of it, this is everyone I'm wanting to forget.

They'll give us something
They'll give us so much to forget
Or an offer to deal with it.
Or an offer to deal with it.

With pencil and knife
You heard your love again
You wrestled your nightmares, the sweat from your bedsheets
This is all of it, this is everything I'm wanting to forget.
