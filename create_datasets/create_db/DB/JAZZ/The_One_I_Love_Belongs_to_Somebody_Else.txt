The one I love belongs to somebody else
She means her tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around her

I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else
The hands I held belong to somebody else
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else

It's tough to be alone on the shelf
It's worse to fall in love by yourself
The one I love belongs to somebody else
The one I love belongs to somebody else
