Mandy, Mandy
Make up your mind
Preacher man is handy
Mandy, easy to find
Marching down the aisle with you
We'll make them all stare
With a little Black-Eyed Susan
Stuck in your hair
Mandy, Mandy
Won't you decide?
Everything is dandy
Mandy, once you are my bride
In a year or two
There may be three of a kind
Listen to me, Mandy
Make up your mind
