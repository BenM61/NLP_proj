You got your hands in my pockets
You're whisperin' lies in my ear
Such promiscuous intentions
Don't mistake me for someone who cares

There were times I fooled myself, yeah
Thinkin' I was no one else

Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I could do, yeah
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, that's right
True, yes, it's true

Such a restless condition
The way you're turnin' it on
Love 'em, tease 'em, for all the wrong reasons
You know you're such a bore

There were times I told myself
There was really no one else

Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I can do
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, it's true, baby
True, yes, it's true, look out

Is it some kind of shakedown
You know I really don't care
But you push it too hard, girl,
Yeah, you know it's just not fair

There were times I fooled myself
Thinkin' there was no one else

Hard days, cold nights
There's nothin' that I could do
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, true
Come on, come on, come on

Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I can do
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, yes, yes, it's true

Hard days, cold nights
Oh, there's nothin' that I could do, yeah
Lovers are babes in arms
(Babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, yes, it's true
