Baby when we're grinding
I get so excited
Oh how I like it
I try but I can't fight it
Oh you're dancing real close
Plus it's real real slow
You're making it hard for me

All the slow songs you requested
You're dancing like you're naked
Oh it's almost like
We're sexing

Yeah ooh I like it
No I can't deny it
But I know you can tell I'm excited

Step back you're dancing kind of close
I feel a little pull coming through
On you

Now girl I know you felt it
Before you know I can't help it
You know what I want to do

Baby when we're grinding
I get so excited
Oh how I like it
I try but I can't fight it
Oh you're dancing real close
Plus it's real real slow
You're making it hard for me

Baby us dancing so close
Ain't a good idea
'Cause now I want you now and here
The way that you shake it on me
Makes me want you so bad sexually

Step back you're dancing kind of close
I feel a little pull coming through
On you

Now girl I know you felt it
Before you know I can't help it
You know what I want to do

Baby when we're grinding
I get so excited
Oh how I like it
I try but I can't fight it
Oh you're dancing real close
Plus it's real real slow
You're making it hard for me

I love when you shake like that
I see that you like it like that
I love when you shake like that
I see that you like it like that

Baby when we're grinding
I get so excited
Oh how I like it
I try but I can't fight it
Oh you're dancing real close
Plus it's real real slow
You're making it hard for me

Baby when we're grinding
I get so excited
Oh how I like it
I try but I can't fight it
Oh you're dancing real close
Plus it's real real slow
You're making it hard for me
