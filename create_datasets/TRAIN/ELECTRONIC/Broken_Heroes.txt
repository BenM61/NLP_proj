Love is like a looser's game
I'll never play again
I'm through with love forever.
Oh
I'm like a fallen star

Love can leave a scar
It's raining in my heart
babe.
Yes
it's true
I'm still missing you.

Broken heroes and fallen angels
Broken dreams and hearts ot stone
There's no smoke
girl
without a fire

And I'm standing here alone
all alone.

How much have I sacrificed?
My heart aches deep inside
In the name of love
girl.
And how much time and loneliness
I traded for a kiss

It's raining in my heart
babe.
Yes
it' s true
I'm still missing you.

Broken heroes and fallen angels
