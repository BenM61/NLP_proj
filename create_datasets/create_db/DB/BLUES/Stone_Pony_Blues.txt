Baby saddle my pony, saddle up my black mare 
I'm gonna find a rider, baby, in the world somewhere 

Hello central, what's the matter with your line? 
Come a storm last night, tore the wire down 

Got a brand new Shetland, man, already trained
Just get in the saddle, tighten up on your reins 

And a brown-skinned woman like somethin' fit to eat 
But a jet black woman, don't put your hands on me 

Took my baby, to meet the mornin' train 
And the blues come down, baby, like showers o' rain 

I got somethin' to tell you when I get a chance 
I don't wanna marry, just wanna be your man
