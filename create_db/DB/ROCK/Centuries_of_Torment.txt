Generations
Denying penance
Eternal life reborn
Time and time again
Deny
Salvation
I refuse it
I will not be saved
Return to human form
Murder

Heartless
Bestial
I kill
Without
Pity for victims with untrue gods
My instinct will push beyond
Feelings like guilt, remorse or mercy
My flesh holds a soul of

Generations
Denying virtue
Eternal hate reborn
Time and time again
Defy
Redemption
Spit upon it
My soul they cannot claim
Return to kill again
Butcher

Unclean
Spirit
Searching
Hunting
Another life to maim and kill
A beast with brutal will
Lifetimes spent on a quest for blood
And with my death it does not end

Evil reborn for eternity
Centuries of torment

I will not be saved

[Solo - O'Brien]

When I die
They beg me to repent
I refuse

I return
The past forgotten but evil innate
They have lost

They will not be saved
They will die
