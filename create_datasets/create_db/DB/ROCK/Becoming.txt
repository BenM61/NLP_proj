A long time ago I never knew myself. Then the memory
Of shame birthed its gift.
No more. The small one, the weak one, the frightened one.
Running from beatings, deflating. I'm becoming more
Than a man. More than you ever were. Driven and burning
To rise beyond Jesus.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I found my life was slipping through my hands. Perhaps
Through death my life won't be so bad.
I can see you, can f*ck you, inside of you. Staring through
Your eyes. Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me,
To realize my saving grasp. I of suicide. I the unlord.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize
