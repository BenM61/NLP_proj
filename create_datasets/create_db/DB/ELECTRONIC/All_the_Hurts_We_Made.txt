Won't you save a place for this?
Facing all there is to miss
A change of heart
A change of pain
It was going wrong
For the longest time
I'd rather die than feel this pain

Whoa now oh
Whoa now oh
Fallen disgrace
Falling from grace

Give up the world
Give up my life
Give up the pain
Give up the right
Give up the love
Give up the shade
Give up the blame for all the hurts we made
Give up the sun
Give up the night
Give up the fear
Give up the fight
Give up the guilt for all the ways we strayed
Give up the pain for all the hurts we made

What to do, with old dreams?
To feel a new kind of pain
As the sun pulls behind the sky
I'd rather die than feel this pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa now oh
Whoa now oh
Fallen disgrace
Falling from grace

Give up the world
Give up my life
Give up the pain
Give up the right
Give up the love
Give up the shade
Give up the blame for all the hurts we made
Give up the sun
Give up the night
Give up the fear
Give up the fight
Give up the guilt for all the ways we strayed
Give up the pain for all the hurts we made

Whoa now oh
Whoa now oh
Fallen disgrace
Falling from grace

Give up the world
Give up my life
Give up the pain
Give up the right
Give up the love
Give up the shade
Give up the blame for all the hurts we made
Give up the sun
Give up the night
Give up the fear
Give up the fight
Give up the guilt for all the ways we strayed
Give up the pain for all the hurts we made

Whoa now oh
Whoa now oh
Fallen disgrace
Falling from grace
Fallen disgrace
Falling from grace
