Don't you get tired
Don't you feel you got a lot to do
Do you wonder if it's all for you
Can you give it all to me

How can you live
Knowing everyone is out for you
Really seems as though you want them to
Can you tell me what you see

And it seems so small,
I ask if you'll give it all
Can you give it all to me

I can't believe
All the love you sent you gave to me
Whoever told you was so hard to see
Then you took it all away

Somehow I knew
Wouldn't see what I was going through
It wasn't much at all I saw for you
But I'll look again today

And it seems so small,
I ask if you'll give it all
Can you give it all to me

And it seems so small,
I ask if you'll give it all
Can you give it all to me
