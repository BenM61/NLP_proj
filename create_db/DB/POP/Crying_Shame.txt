Baby said she's leaving and you know 
She didn't even tell me why, why, why
She really broke my heart when she 
Loaded up the car and said goodbye, bye, bye
All alone in this blues cafe, 
Wondering how we got this way

When love takes the blame, it's a crying shame

Baby said she's sorry and she never 
Really meant to make me cry, cry, cry
She promised me forever but you know that 
She could never live a lie, lie, lie
All alone in this corner booth, 
Wondering if I'll ever know the truth

When love takes the blame, it's a crying shame [Repeat: x1]

When love takes the blame, only the tears remain
And no one's there to hear you call when you need them most of all

Baby said by morning that she'd probably be 
A thousand miles away, way, way
She asked me to forgive her but I said 
It didn't matter anyway, way, way
All alone with my head bowed down, 
Wondering if she'll ever turn around

When love takes the blame, it's a crying shame [Repeat: x1]
