Once I loved, 
And I gave so much love to this love, 
It was the world to me.

Once I cried, 
At the thought I was foolish and proud, 
And let you say goodbye.

Then one day, 
From my infinite saddness you came, 
And brought me love again.

Now I know, 
That no matter whatever befalls, 
I'll never let you go.

I will hold you close, 
Make you stay.

Because love, 
Is the saddest thing, 
When it goes away.

Because love, 
Is the saddest thing, 
When it goes away.
