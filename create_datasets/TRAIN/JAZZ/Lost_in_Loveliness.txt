What a thrill you are,
What a sight to see,
Something the eyes of mortals have no right to see.
Am I on the earth or in the sky?

Lost in loveliness am I.
When I look at you,
I forget myself,
I could go mad about you if I let myself.

Should I let myself, or pass you by?
Lost in loveliness am I.
I know I'm reaching for a star,
What's more, I know how dangerous you are.

If I were wise
I'd close my eyes
Or walk away and worship from afar.
In the lonely night,

You would haunt my heart,
And I would pray that someday you might want my heart.
And I'd have to live my whole life through
Lost in loveliness, the loveliness of you.
