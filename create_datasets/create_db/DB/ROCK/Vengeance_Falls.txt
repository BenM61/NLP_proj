I am outnumbered
My vision blurred
I'm absorbed by rage
The outcome turns
Bit the hand
Greater man
When you wrought my wrath
Your end began
You broke me down
A shattered crown
I shoveled deep
And tried to drown
This attack
Turned life black
So I built this flame
To burn you back
To burn you back

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From the dark desire
Our vengeance falls

I have climbed through dirt
Through mud and earth
In this quest for life
I've only hurt
I lost myself
And none could help
Felt unending pain
Perpetual hell
Death arrived
Smile contrived
He pulled me close
But I survived
This attack
Turned life black
Now I own this flame
And burn you back
I burn you back

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From all the pyre
A new life calls

We build it higher
We will storm their walls
From the dark desire
Our vengeance falls (vengeance falls)

Vengeance falls (vengeance falls)

Gather the strength just to hold it close
Choking the spark that became my pulse
Waiting so long just to make you feel
My vengeance now has become so real

We start this fire
Just to burn it all (burn it all)
From all the pyre
A new life calls (new life calls)

We build it higher (build it higher)
We will storm their walls (storm their walls)
From the dark desire (desire)
Our vengeance falls (our vengeance falls)
