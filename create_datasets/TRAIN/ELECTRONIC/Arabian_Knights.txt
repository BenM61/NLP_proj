Arabian nights, we're just Arabian night 
Arabian nights, Arabian night 

I've been to France and England 
And the shores of Timbuktu 
But nothing can compare to that strange land where I met you 
The desert sands of Baghdad was the place we fell in love 
And the nights we spent in that mystic land is all I can think of 

Arabian nights, we're just Arabian night 
Arabian nights, Arabian nights 

Too many words unspoken 
And promises unkept 
And now my heart is broken 
So many nights I've wept 
Made love in an oasis 
While the moon was up above 
And the nights we spent in that mystic land is all I can think of 

Arabian nights 
The night that you were with me 
So right, it was meant to be 
The heat of the love and the feel 
Are all that can happen when you sail

Arabian nights, it's just Arabian nights 
It's just Arabian nights, it's just Arabian nights 

The way I feel about you girl 
I'll chase you all around the world 
The nights are getting stronger 
Arabian nights
