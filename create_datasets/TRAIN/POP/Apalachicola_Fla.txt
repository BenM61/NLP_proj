We're on our way to Apalachicola, F.L.A.
Magnolia trees in blossom and a pretty southern gal
It's better than the orange groves in Cucamonga, Cal.
We're gonna stay along the Apalachicola Bay
We'll stop in Ochlockonee for some hominy grits
We'll go to Tallahassee if the weather permits
We're on our way to Apalachicola, F.L.A.
