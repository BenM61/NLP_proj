A-back in the days when the battles raged
And we thought it was nothing
A bookstore man meets the CIA and we know
Throw me a cord and plug it in
Get the cradle rocking
Ah, out with the redneck pig old men
And it's go

The hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memories in the shadow
Back in time again

Ah, I can't forget your terrorized face
When you cried for the shameless
Wasted life Ameri-K-K-Kan
And you smile
So why should we run when we cannot hide
And my flag is burning?
We could be wrong but that's alright
We'll rise again

The hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memories in the shadow
It's back in town again

Lookin' away it's another day
And of course we love you
Radical man is the CIA
And we say no
We'll round up the Durham H.C. kids
And the Char-Grill Killers
Jesse H. come into our pit
All-ages show

The hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memories in the shadow
It's back in time again
