Bad Boys Blue
"I Totally Miss You"
I did you wrong,
My foolish heart went out to play.
And then I lost you,
Oh What a price for me to pay.

Where have you gone,
Baby where you've gone.
Oh I totally miss you,
My heart is painted blue.
I totally miss you,
I can't stop loving you.
So please come back,
Please come back,
Please come back,
Please come back,
I totally miss you.

I keep on waiting,
And in my dreams I see a face.
You're still in my life,
No one else can take your place.

Where have you gone,
Baby where you've gone.
Oh I totally miss you,
My heart is painted blue.
I totally miss you,
I can't stop loving you.
So please come back,
Please come back,
I totally miss you.
Please come back,
Please come back,
I totally miss you.
Please come back,
I totally miss you.
I totally miss you...I totally miss you.
Oh I totally miss you.

Where have you gone,
Baby where you've gone.
Oh I totally miss you,
My heart is painted blue.
I totally miss you,
I can't stop loving you.
So please come back,
Please come back,
I totally miss you.
Please come back,
Please come back,
I totally miss you.
Please come back,
I totally miss you.
Oh I totally miss you...I totally miss you.
