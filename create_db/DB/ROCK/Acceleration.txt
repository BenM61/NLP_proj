Accelerating darkness
Designer light
Iron constructions, concrete and wood
Flaring light echoing consumer minds

Mountains are only future sand
Forests are only unreleased heat
Darkened glasses kill dirty rays
Handbags weighed down with asphalt dust

Thought process standardized
Philosophy a set of guidelines for inefficiency
Religion a fluffy cushion of synthetic feathers

Life itself a mechanical movement from A to be	
See is always a thought but never an option
