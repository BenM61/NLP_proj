People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers, very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person (one person) 
One very special person (one very special person)

A feeling deep in your soul (in your soul)
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
First be a person who needs people
People who need people

First be a person who needs people (people need people)
People who need people
Are the luckiest (luckiest) people in the world
