I've been crushed beaten down
And I'm frozen to the ground
Like a fool I've trusted you
Still I'm hopelessly in love

I never thought that I would be this helpless
I can't believe I'm giving in for you
I've been crushed, I've had enough

Now I wanna leave but I'm lost
So now I can't break away
Although I've made up my mind
My heart is refusing me
(hey yeah ey ey)
My heart is refusing me
(hey yeah ey ey)

Me for you, you for me
It was us against them all
But slowly it came to me
What was underneath it all

I never thought that you could be this reckless
I can't believe you're doing this to me oh
Strip me down I'm naked now

And I wanna leave but I'm lost
So now I can't break away
Although I've made up my mind
My heart is refusing me
(heeey yeaah eeeey eeeey)
My heart is refusing me
(heeey yeaah eeeey eeeey)

heeey yeaah eeeey eeeey yeaaah

And I wanna leave but I'm lost
Now I can't break away
Although I've made up my mind
My heart is refusing me
(heeey yeaah ey eeeey)
My heart is refusing me
(hey yeah ey ey)

I've been crushed, beaten down
Still I'm hopelessly in love
