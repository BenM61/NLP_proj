Too many to convince
Too many to hire
And nothing you ever own
The world's a dead sorry hole
And I'm cold, and I'm cold
And I'm cold, and I'm stubborn
I'm sick to keep it open wide
And speaking words to the blind

Speaking words, to the blind
Speaking words, to the blind

And the soul of the pure
And the eyes of the lover
And the one who truly saw your soul
And the one who truly saw your soul

I'm the one, who truly saw your soul
I'm the one, who truly saw your soul

And if you tell me to shut up
And if you tell me to shut it
Did you tell me to shut up
Oh if you tell me to shut it
I'll shut it now

Young, just born
Fragile and trembling soul
You hold it to the light
That pours down the moon at night
You kept on holding it
You kept on holding it
It was a dangerous thing to do 
But you did it when no one knew
When the eyes were closed
And the people asleep

Not an animal
Not a human
Not a soul
Not a soul

And if you tell me to shut up
And if you tell me to shut it
Did you tell me to shut up
Oh if you tell me to shut it
I shut it now

I am a breaker of ocean
Leaden like a bullet to the sun

I am a breaker of ocean
Leaden like a bullet to the sun, to the sun, to the sun
