Oh oh
Oh oh

You're pushing me away from you
And there's nothing I can do
And I can't fight all of your battles for you

You're pushing me away from you
Oh and I know what I'll do
I'll ?
So I can get out of this mess

Ooh
Oh ooh

So I'll call you mine ?

You're pushing me away from you
And there's nothing I can do
And I can't fight all of your battles for you

You're pushing me away from you
Oh and I know what I'll do
Yeah, I know what I'll do
I know what I'll do

I'll get you out of my mind
I'll get you out of my mind
I'll get you out of my mind
Get you out of my mind

Shh!

Ooh
Ooh

You're pushing me away from you
And there's nothing I can do
And I can't fight all of your battles for you

You're pushing me away from you
Oh yeah, I know what I'll do

I'll get you right
Give you a ride
I'll get you right
Give you a ride
I'll get you right
Give you a ride
Outta town
