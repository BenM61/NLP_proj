Rising! (4x)

Rising--we're so bright we are blinding.

Rising--somehow we keep reminding.
Rising--grafted from a hybrid breed.

Survivalist unique and hard as concrete

I'm not going to let you let me die.

So damn easy when you're living a lie.

Haven't you heard cream rises to the top.

I hope you know we ain't never gonna stop.
Some cock blocking, others coping much love.

To the fans 'cause we're still rocking.

Haven't you heard cream rises to the top.
I hope you know we ain't never gonna stop.

Some cock blocking, others coping much love.

To the fans 'cause we're still rocking!

Rising! (4x)

Rising--all I see are Kinko's bands.
Rising--nothing new just recycling the fans.

Rising--skip to the loop in cement shoes.

Breaking free up out of this cesspool.

I'm not going to let you let me die.

So damn easy when you're living a lie.

Haven't you heard cream rises to the top.

I hope you know we ain't never gonna stop.

Some cock blocking, others coping much love.

To the fans 'cause we're still rocking.

Haven't you heard cream rises to the top.
I hope you know we ain't never gonna stop.

Some cock blocking, others coping much love.
To the fans 'cause we're still rocking!

Rising! (4x)

It doesn't matter to me anymore who you think I am.

I am all I can be.

It doesn't matter to me anymore who you think I am.

I am all I can be.

And I'm rising.

And I'm rising.

And I'm rising.

And I'm rising.
