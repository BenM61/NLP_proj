Hear my silence, see my blindness
A love ascending, and never ending
You did cut me, from the same tree
A love incision, my inner vision

Loving on our hands and knees
Always trying hard to please
Never in my life have I
Questioned or discovered why

Live and discover
Take from each other
A love believing
And never decieving

Loving on our hands and knees
Always trying hard to please
Never in my life have I
Questioned or discovered why

Him say leave now
Give and believe how
A love revealing
My inner feeling
