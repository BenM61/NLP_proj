Heavenly shades of night are falling it's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling it's twilight time
When purple-covered curtains mark the end of day
I'll hear you my dear at twilight time
Deepening shadows gather splendor as day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting sun
I count the moments darling till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day we keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the same and sweet old way I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold
Each day I pray for everything just to be with you
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day we keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the same and sweet old way I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you
Together at last at twilight time together at last at twilight time
