Hey turn the base off, turn the base off
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Dirty, dirty stinkin' big
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Base, base, base

I don't need no speed, no
I don't need no heroin, no thanks
I don't want no coke
You can keep your ketamine
I'm a bassline junkie, what?
I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again
I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again
I don't like it funky

I'm a fiend for a big day bassline
When I hear one I have a great time
A bit of bass' all what I require
I let the bassline take me higher
My friends think that it's a bad habit
But I'm just like f*ck you, damn it
If you take my base away
I'll blow your fucking face away
You might think I'm over the top
But when I hear that bassline drop
I just can't control my actions
But I still feel satisfaction
So don't come around here whinging
I just wanna hear the bassline rinsin'
Or we can just skank out all day
If not get the f*ck out my way

I don't need no speed, no
I don't need no heroin, no thanks
I don't want no coke
You can keep your ketamine
I'm a bassline junkie, what?
I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again
I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again
I don't like it funky
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Dirty, dirty stinkin' big
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Base, base, base

You ever doubt, go the other day I got an asbo order
And I think it's well out of order
All my neighbours throwing the fifth
So I told them suck my dick
And I told them I got the power
And I turn the music up louder
All night till 6 in the morning
Old bastards, they just boring
You know me, I'm the bassline father
Nobody can tell me no other
And the police turned up and they took me
We drove out to the nick and they booked me
When they said they'd give me a caution
If I didn't give them no distortion
But I said don't bother, I'm guilty
I'm a bassline fucking filthy

I don't need no speed, no
I don't need no heroin, no thanks
I don't want no coke
You can keep your ketamine
I'm a bassline junkie, what?
I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again
I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again
I don't like it funky
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Dirty, dirty stinkin' big
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base
Base, base, base
Base, base, base
Base, base, base.
