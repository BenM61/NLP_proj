Step right up, you were right on time
Right on time
Come aboard, baby and you will be mine
You will be mine

I've been dreamin' of you all my life
Inside of my head
Wishin' I could have you
So let's got to bed

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train

See, I can tell you wanna ride
By looking straight into your eyes
Straight into your eyes
And I believe you when you say
That you ain't never told a lie
Ain't never told a lie, baby

Halelluijah, you're one of the dream come true
Must have known that I was waiting for you
Come inside so I get what you want, baby
Come inside, come inside

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train

I'll move it just like you like
Just how you want it to feel
I'll do it real slow like chill
So tell me if you know the deal

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train

Don't be late, baby, don't
Don't be late, baby
It's only leaving one time baby
Hop aboard, you'll be mine, lady
I got the love for you, baby

Do you love, do you love me, baby
Do you love me, baby
Say you love you, baby

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train

All aboard, get your ticket to ride
'Cause it's leaving tonight, baby
Don't be late, bring your love to the gate
For my physical train
