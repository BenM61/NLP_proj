We are gonna burn it up like rock stars
Go Nirvana in here
We're gonna set it out, tick tock
Life is a video game
And we could be in love oh, not like
See, I really don't care
I just wanna be right here
I just wanna be right here

Ah, we can rule the oceans
We can rule the world
We'd be the commotion, baby

So we'll never regret that
Life's gonna be what we be
So we'll turn the music up tonight
Let the beat set you free
Give everything you got and
Dance all your worries away
Forget yesterday, this life is a game
And love is the name
Na na na na na
Oh, love is the name
Na na na na na

I love the way your skin feels on mine
I'm diging your style
The way you let me in
On secrets that are already mine
And we can be in love, oh, not now
See, I really don't care
I just wanna be right here
I just wanna be right here

Ah
We could rule the oceans
We could rule the world
We'd be the commotion, baby

So we'll never regret that
Life's gonna be what we be
So we'll turn the music up tonight
Let the beat set you free
Give everything you got and
Dance all your worries away
Forget yesterday, this life is a game
And love is the name
Na na na na na
Oh, love is the name
Na na na na na
This life is a game
Na na na na na
And love is the name
Na na na na na

So we'll never regret that
Life's gonna be what we be
So we'll turn the music up tonight
Let the beat set you free
Give everything you got and
Dance all your worries away
Forget yesterday, this life is a game
And love is the name
Na na na na na
Oh, love is the name
Na na na na na
And life is a game
Na na na na na
And love is the name
Na na na na na

And love is the name
