Do you remember when this number first come out, man?
Yeah, I was a young boy and you were an old man!
The old master used to do this number... old man Roosevelt Sykes.
He the first one I heard gassin' on with this number,
"In the evening when the sun go down". And I used to be crazy
about that number, you know? I used to have a gal in my arm, you know...
a bottle of corn liquor on my left... (Moonshine, man). Oh, no 
moonshine man, corn whiskey! C.H.O.D.N., corn, man, real corn, you know!
(yeah) And, and, I mean, I'd get in the groove, and... and
this is what I would say, man, with that gal on my left...
I'd let her know that I was no square, that I was hip.

(Sung:)
In the evening, in the evening
In the evening, when the sun go down
In the evening, baby when the sun go down
Nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
In the evening, when the sun go down

The sun rise, rise in the east
And it sets down in the west
The sun rise in the east, baby
And it sets down in the west
Well, well I love, love two women
Ain't it hard to tell which one you love the best
In the evening, when the sun go down

(Spoken:)
Look out there, Mickey, talk about it now
Well I'll be doggone

(Mickey's solo)
Oh, you're really going in the sun there!
Stay out of the sun, doc, you're goin' back to Mississippi...
Yeah, that's bad!
Mmmmm, I believe I'll try a little bit of that myself, man

(Jack's solo)
Well the sun goes sinking down with that one....
I got to sing a little bit more of that other man, 'cause that's somethin'!
(Talk about it like a dog!)

(Sung:)
I'm a warn you, I'm a warn you one
