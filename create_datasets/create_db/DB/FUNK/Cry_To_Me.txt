When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody call you on the phone
Doncha feel like crying
Doncha feel like crying 
Well, here I am, my honey c'mon baby, cry to me 

When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume
Doncha feel like crying
Doncha feel like crying 
Doncha feel like crying
C'mon baby, (c'mon) cry to me

Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness loneliness, it just a waste of your time, oh yeah
But you don't ever you don't ever have to walk alone
You see, Come take my hand, and baby, won't you walk with me? whoa yeah

When you're waiting for a voice to come
In the night there is no one
Doncha feel like crying (cry to me)
Doncha feel like crying (cry to me)
Don't you feel like cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cry (cry to me) cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-crying? (cry to me)
Don't you feel like cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cry (cry to me) cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-crying?
