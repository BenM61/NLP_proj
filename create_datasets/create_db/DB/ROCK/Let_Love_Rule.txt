Love is gentle as a rose 
And love can conquer any war 
It's time to take a stand 
Brothers and sisters join hands 

We got to let love rule 
(Let love rule)
We got to let love rule 
(Let love rule)

Love transcends all space and time 
And love can make a little child smile 
Oh can't you see 
This won't go wrong 
But we got to be strong 
We can't do it alone 

We got to let love rule 
(Let love rule)
We got to let love rule 
(Let love rule)

(Let love rule)
You got to got to got to 
(Let love rule)

You got to got to got to, yeah 
(Let love rule) let let let let love rule 
(Let love rule)

You got to, got to, got to 
Just say yeah 
You got to yeah 
You got to 
You got to, got to, got to yeah 
Let love rule
