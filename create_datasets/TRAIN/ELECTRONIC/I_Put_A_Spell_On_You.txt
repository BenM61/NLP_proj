I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine
Put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

You gotta stop the things you do
I ain't lying
You better stop the things you do
I ain't lying

I just can't stand it, babe
I just can't stand it, babe
I just can't stand it, babe
I just can't stand it

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine
I put a spell on you
I put a spell on you

You've gotta stop the things you do
You've gotta stop the things you do
You've gotta stop the things
Stop the things, stop the things

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
