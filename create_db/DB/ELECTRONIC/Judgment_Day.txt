On judgment day
I will get back on you
Naked to the bone
You will stand alone

On judgment day
I will get my revenge
Driving you to tears
After wasted years
Without me

I can't recall the day we met
I forced it out my brain
You're locked up in your obliette
You're doomed to live in pain

We had a chance to get things right
Mistake after mistake
Where once I saw a halo bright
I sense a fur of fake

A mirror waits before the throne
The price you pay for fame
The day you face a frightening freak
The night you go insane

On judgment day
I will get back on you
Naked to the bone
You will stand alone

On judgment day
I will get my revenge
Driving you to tears
After wasted years
Without me

Your head goes well with plastic bags
Becomes you when you scream
Predictable a loser's tag
Goes perfect with your theme

We had a chance to get things right
Mistake after mistake
Where once I saw a halo bright
I sense a fur of fake

A mirror waits before the throne
The price you pay for fame
The day you face a frightening freak
The night you go insane

On judgment day
I will get back on you
Naked to the bone
You will stand alone

On judgment day
I will get my revenge
Driving you to tears
After wasted years
Without me

Shema israel
Adonai eroheino
Adonai echad
Shema israel

On judgment day
I will get back on you
Naked to the bone
You will stand alone

On judgment day
I will get my revenge
Driving you to tears
After wasted years
Without me
