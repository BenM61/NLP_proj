Now you feel it, a shiver and you begin
Frozen breath that scrapes across the skin
And a sound you've never heard before, you screaming

Welcome to the world of random noise
Where you simply haven't got a choice
When they push your levers and pull your strings

It's another world, it's a better world that we bring

Here you are on the planet of hot and cold
Where you'll do as exactly as you're told

In a world of a 1000 furry toys
You can hear the screams
Of little girls and boys
It's a charming noise
If you really want that kind of thing, mama

Now you feel it, a shiver and you've begun
When they pull those strings how you'll start to run!
And there's no stepping off or stepping down

It's another world and it's a better world,
That's what we have found
