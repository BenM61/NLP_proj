Come closer for myself
And let your angels fly away.
As I am, forgiven by them
Mine angels.

Feel mine cleansing touch
Fall through your worlds
Fall
Onto me.

Let me caress you
Let me take you through mine worlds.
Let them (mine angels) taste you with this night, 
With this tongue of this might.

Perish
Onto us
Feel your mind weaken, your cold body withered
Let us
Take you far of this night, 
Far away within distress to die
