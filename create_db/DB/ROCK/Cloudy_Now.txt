In a violent place
We can call our country
There's a mixed up man
And I guess that's me
The sun's in the sky
But the storm no seems to end.

Its a place of sorrow 
That we call it a home
In the darkest thoughts
Yeah, I guess their my own 
There is welth in the bank 
But there is nothing sure inside.

Its cloudy now 
Its cloudy now
Its cloudy now
Its getting cloudy now

In a special place
That I call my life
My father is cruel and he lost his wife
But I don't see either 
Cause I live a cross the street 

Its a beautiful thing when it starts to rain
The man who drinks 
Just to drown the pain
And I can't stop from dreaming
Of something else.

Its cloudy now 
Its cloudy now 
Its getting cloudy now
Its cloudy now 
Its cloudy now 
Its getting cloudy now

We are a fucked up generation
Its cloudy now
