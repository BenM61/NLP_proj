No one move, no one speak
Please don't say that its just me
Its not just me, and even though
I wont forget, just don't want this to end 
Just yet, not just yet

But if I had one chance to freeze time
And stand still and soak in everything
I'd choose right now
If I had on night where sunshine
Could break through and show you everything
I'd choose right now

If this is it, all we have
I know I've done all I can
If this is it and we can't stop
And start again
We cant fast forward to the end
This is it

But if I had one chance to freeze time
And stand still and soak in everything
I'd choose right now
If I had one night where sunshine
Could break through and show you everything
I'd choose right now
Before the fears that I once had start coming back

And I can take the slings and stones and fire
'Cause I know you'll make it all worthwhile
And everytime I fold, dissolve I'm lying on the ground
You drag me up again, and again
Oh please come back again
Oh please come back again

And I'm so scared, I might forget
Just don't want this to end
Just yet, not just yet

But if I had one chance to freeze time
And stand still and soak in everything
I'd choose right now
If I had on night where sunshine
Could break through and show you everything
I'd choose right now
Before the fears that I once 
Had start coming back again
