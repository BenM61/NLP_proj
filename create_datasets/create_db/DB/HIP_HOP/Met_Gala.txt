Yeah, playin' for keeps (keeps)
Suck a dick gang, she a leech (leech)
Came in the game with a key (key)
My pockets blew up, Monique (Monique)
Ooh, she got that perfect physique (ooh)
I'll tape a brick to her cheeks
Now that I'm gettin' this money
I'm fuckin' these thotties, they tryna get come up (come up)
This a good week, I been stackin' up Ms
And I'm snatchin' that Wraith in the mornin' (Wraith)
I was that nigga locked up in the cell
And they treated me like I was normal (normal)
Thankin' the Lord for the blessings
I just left the Met Gala dressin' up formal (formal)

Look at my boogers, they big as you (booger)
You could get shot with your nigga too
This stick make a nigga do boogaloo (brr)
Bentley Mulsanne but the seats masseuse
I'm havin' more stripes than Adidas Boost (havin' that)
Dick in her mouth like I'm edible (dickin' that)
Nigga start shootin', you better move (brr)
I fight for my gang, I won't let 'em lose (gang)
Your bitch, she wantin' the pipe, aight
This shit all started off likes
Hopped in my DM and rode me a kite, flight (yeah)
And she on the very first flight
Finesse a nigga then get this shit right
Sight, right, nigga, goodnight (sight)
Poppin' that shit 'cause he thinkin' he pipe, pipe
Hunnid rounds drum with the knife (brr)
Me and the Wop, Biggie and Pac (Wop)
But we so different, we keepin' the Glock (bow)
I'm on a yacht and a yacht on my watch (yacht)
Fuckin' a thot on the ocean, Dubai
I'mma play dumb but that's see out the plot (plot)
She know what I'm 'bout
You hit this dope and your heart gonna stop (hey)
They callin' the cops (twelve)
Hop on the jet, this a twenty passenger (jet)
Offset the mania, I'm the massacre (hey)
I take your heart out and shoot your bladder up (agh)
Get to the top and we blew the ladder up (top)
Ran up my money and I'm talkin' lateral (bang)
Had that bitch high off a Perc and Adderall (high)
Pull out the fire and you better grab it all (brrr)
Bitch, I'm Offset and I'm 'bout to set it off (hey, hey)

I'm havin' this shit what you hadn't
Showin' respect like your daddy
Yeah, Gucci the man, cash in the caddy
I just woke up in a palace
I did a walk through, I'm in Dallas, man
Flew in two bitches from Cali
These Bs on me, I can barely
They drunk and they just walkin' barely
I'm headed to Paris to pick up a bag
And they treat me like one of the Jacksons
These niggas ain't trippin', ain't makin' transactions
A nigga rob you, he be practicing
Four bitches all tryna swallow this
I feel like I'm fightin' an octopus
Thought it was killers, camped out in my bushes
Then come to find out it's photographers
Feds watch me with binoculars
Mad 'cause a nigga gettin' popular
Flex on a hoe wanna lock me up
Drop Top Wop when the top is low
Negative turn to a positive
I don't care nuttin' 'bout no obstacles
I could care less 'bout the bloggers, boy
80k stuffed in my joggers, boy (eighty ball)
