Waking up in the middle of the night
Blurry eyes into my telephone light
All your words in disguise
Makin' me think like you're mine

We were such a pretty picture in a frame
Now it's like you don't remember my name
Let me in where you've been
Where we gonna be this time?

Just for tonight, just for tonight
Forget who we are, give up and ignite
Go with me through the dark
For tonight

What you mean when you say we're better now?
All these clothes like you still want me around
I can't give you this for nothing, 
help me out

Just for tonight, just for tonight
Forget who we are, give up and ignite
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
Just for tonight, just for tonight
Forget who we are, give up and ignite
Go with me through the dark
For tonight

Make me believe that you need me most
Be the real thing, don't be just a ghost
I try to call but I can't get hold
Call me right back, call me right back

You told me no matter, everywhere we go
I was your rock, was it just a joke?
If I come-a-lookin' would you even know?
Call me right back, call me right back
Make me believe that you need me most
Be the real thing, don't be just a ghost
I try to call but I can't get hold
Call me right back, call me right back

Just for tonight, just for tonight
Forget who we are, give up and ignite
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
Just for tonight, just for tonight
Forget who we are, give up and ignite
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight

You told me no matter, everywhere we go
I was your rock, was it just a joke?
If I come-a-lookin' would you even know?
Call me right back, just for tonight
Call me right back, just for tonight
Be the real thing, don't be just a ghost
Why can I call but I can't get hope?
Call me right back, call me right back
