Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Yo I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number
seventeen  and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you
Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Everytime I look at you, you turn and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me loosing my mind
With your zodiac sign, my perfect match in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drug
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away
I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying,
If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eyes when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day
What can I say?
All I can do is reminisce like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us

Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did
How we planned to live
How you got rid of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down
Now look what you found state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away
I can't get you out of my mind

I can't get you out of my mind
Think about you all of the time
Got to get to know you babe, baby, oh
I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew excepted you
Even my ex called you
She wasn't insecure
Feeling she got a little hurt but was being mature
Gave her blessing
She learned a valuable lesson
Now she's my best friend
Don't even stress, Cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're queen lets bring some unity
Ain't no reason to fight, We're always keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine
It's all about you boo, and all the things you do
Making dreams come true, buying rings for two
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
