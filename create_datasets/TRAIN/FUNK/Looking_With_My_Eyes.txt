Well, here I go again
Looking with my eyes
Seeing with my heart
Just like I used to do

You said hello again
Suddenly the lies
Sound just like the truth
And I believe in you

The tears of yesterday have gone away
Here in your arms I will stay
This time my happiness won't disappear
Loneliness is over

Well, here I go again
Looking with my eyes
Things look bad for me
Seeing with my heart
I just close my eyes
And I can see we're so in love

Oh, darling, darling, darling
Don't you ever go away from me
This time you've got to promise
You're gonna stay with me

This time my happiness won't disappear
Loneliness is over

Well, here I go again
Looking with my eyes
Things look bad for me
Seeing with my heart
I just close my eyes
And I can see we're so in love

Oh, darling, darling, darling, promise
You're gonna stay with me
No, no, no, don't ever
Don't ever go away from me

Oh, my darling, my darling
Don't ever go far away from me
