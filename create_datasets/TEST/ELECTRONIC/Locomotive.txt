Wish I cared about the things you care about, but I don't.
Your scrill and the bars and the lake and the stars, but I don't

Hey we may, hey we may, 
You know my name, you know my name
Hey we may, hey we may 
Know your name, I know your name

I wish I cared about the things you cared about but I don't.
Your locomotive, keep going keep going no focus.
Locomotive slow down, slow down.

Now come on call me sugar, call her honey, call me darling.
But I leave it at the door cause nobody saying nothing.

Hey we may, hey we may
You know my name, you know my name
Hey we may, hey we may
I know your name.
I wish I cared about the things you care about but I don't.

Your locomotive, keep going keep going no focus.
Locomotive slow down, slow down.
Look down on what you started.
Look down on what you started.
Look down on what you started. 
Look down.

Locomotive, keep going keep going don't focus
Locomotive slow down, slow down
Look down on what you started
Look down on what you started
Look down on what you started
Look down

Now look down on what you started
Keep goin' keep goin keep goin'
Now look down on what you started
Keep goin' keep goin' slow down.
