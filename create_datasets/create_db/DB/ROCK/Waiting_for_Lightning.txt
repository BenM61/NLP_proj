Standing on the edge of the truth,
Looking out at the view
Of all you used to believe,
From where you are you can see you're far away from home.

Echoes of the life you once knew
Call out to you from across the divide,
And you know its time to step back over the line,
But you're...

Waiting for lightning,
A sign that its time for a change;
And you're listening for thunder,
While He quietly whispers your name.

Night falls and the curtain goes down;
No ones around,
Its just you and the truth.
As you lie in wait
For a feeling to take you by storm,

Somewhere in the depths of your heart,
Where its empty and dark, there's a flicker of light,
And the Spirit calls,
But do you notice at all;
Are you . . .

Waiting for lightning,
A sign that its time for a change;
And you're listening for thunder,
While He quietly whispers your name.

But the sign and the word
Have already been given,
And now its by faith
We must look and we must listen,
Instead of...

Waiting for lightning,
A sign that its time for a change;
And you're listening for thunder,
While He quietly whispers your name.
