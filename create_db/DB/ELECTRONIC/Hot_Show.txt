Hot Show
She's my technicolor disco
Yo, yo
Ya we're gonna make a video
She'll keep it on the down-low
Dig It
Hot show
You look beautiful in slow-mo
Quid Pro Quo
Cause she's my sexy queen of Soho
And the reason that I come and go
From Brooklyn to Manhattan
You're the one
Who makes me hum

Every time I see ya girl
I get to feeling sorta down
And kinda out
Like you'll never be mine
And you and I could be so crazy
Like a crazy roller coaster ride
Let me in 'cause
I'm out of my mind

Hot show
I didn't know that you go stereo
Yo, yo
Meet me at the local Ho-Jo
Drop that good for nothing zero
And come into my life
Forever more my little
