Have you ever loved someone so much
That you feel it deep down in your soul?

Well, this is how I feel about the one I love
Let's sing it together

Always boy, I never knew a love like you before
You came into my life and gave me more
You are my friend, also my man
And I'll love you always

You were my friend, and now you're my man
And I want you always
