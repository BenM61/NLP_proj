And love can be too kind
The truth may find you
Running from the way you feel inside

Say it to me now
Say it to me anyway
Everything your heart would say
If all the walls came down
Say it to me now
Even if the truth tears us apart
I need to feel the closeness
Of knowing what's in your heart

Eyes are like windows
Oh, and I've tried, but I can't see
What makes you cry
Your eyes closed
And stay a million miles away from me

Say it to me now
Say it to me anyway
Everything your heart would say
If all the walls came down
Say it to me now
Even if the truth tears us apart
I need to feel the closeness
Of knowing what's in your heart
Say it to me now
Say it to me anyway
Everything your heart would say
If all the walls came down
Say it to me now
Even if the truth tears us apart
I need to feel the closeness
Of knowing what's in your heart
