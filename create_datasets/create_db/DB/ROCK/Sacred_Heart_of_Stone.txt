Sacred heart, sacred heart of stone
Even the sword of love cannot penetrate you
Sacred heart, sacred heart of stone
I used to love you 
Now I think I hate you

When I was younger I believed your lies
Your shield and armor that would not compromise
You won your war with a ghostly kiss
Whoever thought it would come to this
Sacred heart, sacred heart of stone

Sacred heart, sacred heart of stone
Maybe if I saw you shed a tear
The feeling of love might re-appear

You're all alone now
You've got nothing to fear
It'll be your own doin'
To survive in the ruin

I think its time for me to turn away
You invented the world we're living in today
When you inherit the earth and all its gold
It's not my hand you will get to hold
Sacred heart, sacred heart of stone

Sacred heart, sacred heart of stone
Even the sword of love cannot penetrate you
Sacred heart, sacred heart of stone
I used to love you
Now I think I hate you 
Sacred heart of stone
