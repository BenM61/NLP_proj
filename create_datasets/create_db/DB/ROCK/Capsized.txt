I hate you still
Yet I imitate you
You're in my dreams
Pushing me around

I move my mouth
I watch her cry
It's killing me
And you wonder why

Always said I wouldn't be that way
I always said I wouldn't be that way

[Chorus]
Capsized
Cut down to size
Like colors bleed
Now they're all the same to me
I feel his hand
And I know
I'm damned
A puppet on a string
And the man behind the screen

This is the last time I treat you like that
This is the last time I act like a man
This is the last time I drink myself to sleep
This is the last time I act before I think

Oh, but the things kids say

[Chorus]
