I never understood before
I never knew what love was for
My heart was broke my head was sore
What a feeling

Caught up in ancient history
I didn't believe in destiny
I look up you're standing next to me
What a feeling

What a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall I don't care
I'm yours and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly you're mine
And it's brighter than sunshine

I never saw it happenin'
I'd given up and given in
I just couldn't take the hurt again
What a feeling

I didn't have the strength to fight
But suddenly it seemed so right
Me and you
What a feeling

What a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall I don't care
I'm yours and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly you're mine
And it's brighter than the sun
It's brighter the sun
It's brighter than the sun, sunshine

Love will remain a mystery
But give me your hand and you will see
You're heart is keeping time with me

Oh what a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall I don't care
I'm yours and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly you're mine

I've got a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall I don't care
I'm yours and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly you're mine
And its brighter than sunshine
