Lavender skies over Avenue 8,
Beats fill the streets from the sidewalk DJ,
Chattering nightbirds in hollow chin trees,
Good pals sip coffee in a mocha cafe...
Completed celebrities 
Cruising in a fancy car...
I am looking for a singularity,
I am not a superstar, no!

Am I? You are. Are you? I am...
Am I? You are. Are you? I am...

Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!
Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!

What goes around comes around, it seems to me...!

I see a woman with a picture-perfect smile,
A man walks by with silver screen eyes,
Living their life in thirty second dreams,
Sound-byte conversations, TV lullabies...

Am I? You are. Are you? I am...
Am I? You are. Are you? I am...

Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!
Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!

What goes around comes around, it seems to me...!

Girl dancing in the city park
Sets fire to the night with electric sparks...
What you gave to me, I'll give back to you,
When you open your heart...

Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!
(I am a supermoon, supermoon.)

Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!

Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!
(Am I? You are. Are you? I am...)

Tra la-la la-la la-la-la!
I am a supermoon! Supermoon!
(Am I? You are. Are you? I am...)

Who are you...?
