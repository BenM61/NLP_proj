(This... Fire... Grows... High...)

When there's a burning in your heart
An endless fury in your heart
Build it bigger than the sun
Let it grow
Let it grow
And there's a burning in your heart
Don't be alarmed

(This... Fire... Grows... High...)

When there's a doubt in your mind
'Cause you think it all the time
Framin' rights into wrongs
Move along
Move along
When there's a doubt within your mind

When there's a burning in your heart
And you think it'll burst apart
Oh, there's nothing to fear
Save the tears
Save the tears

When there's a burning in your heart

And if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born
Then, it's time to go
And you find your destination with so many different places to call home
'Cause when you find yourself a villain,
In the story you have written
It's plain to see
That sometimes the best intentions
Are in need of redemption
Would you agree
If so, please show me

(This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...)

When there's a burning in your heart,
When there's a burning in your heart, (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
When there's a burning in your heart, (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...)
When there's a burning in your heart, (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...)
When there's a burning in your heart.
