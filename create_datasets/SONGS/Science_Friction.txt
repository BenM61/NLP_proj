I look out of my window at night
I see the stars and I'm filled with fright
I have a feeling someone's looking

It ain't the aliens at the foot of my bed
It's more the aliens inside my head
I have a feeling something's cooking

Science friction burns my fingers
Electricity still lingers
Hey put away that ray
How do you Martians say, "I love you"?

I read my comics from front to back
I'll be ready for any attack
I got a feeling someone's looking

It ain't the aliens at the foot of my bed
It's more the aliens inside my head
I have a feeling something's cooking

Science friction burns my fingers
Electricity still lingers
Hey put away that ray
How do you Martians say, "I love you"? (psychedelic)

Science friction burns my fingers
Electricity still lingers
Hey put away that ray
How do you Martians say, "I love you"?
