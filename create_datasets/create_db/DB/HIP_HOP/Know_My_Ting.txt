Rude boy
Got your baby in my new toy
I made her be National
I took Nat west before you Lloyd
My turn
I was in this queue before you joined
Eye this, night shift
She don't deserve no penthouse viewpoint

Don Gorgon, Don Dada
Dun all of them mans badder
Mr Lover Lover like Shabba
And all the peng tings in the manor
No skeletons in my wardrobe
Just bags worth of swagger
What the f*ck's that on your torso?
That ain't worth the hanger

Bad man
Yours wife's postcode in my Sat-Nav

Leave the toilet seat up and smash that
So many condoms in the trash bag
Man's gonna think its a gang bang
Man's got a girl doing cartwheels, backflips, handstands
