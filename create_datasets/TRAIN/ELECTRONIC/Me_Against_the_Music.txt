All the people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down
It's just me against the music, its just me and me, yeah come on

Hey Britney, are you ready, uh-huh, are you?

When no one cares
It's whipping my hair
It's pulling my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is dripping all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancing up in this place
Tonight I'm here
To the beat of the drum, gotta give it that bass

I want to get stupid
Trying to take my music
It's like a competition
Me against the beat
I want to get in the zone
I want to get in the zone

If you really want to party
Send my love and get ya
Really to hit, you could die
In a minute, I'ma take-a ya on, I'ma take-a ya on
(Hey hey hey)

All my people on the floor let me see you dance
All my people up for more let me see you dance
All my people, 'round and 'round let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
(Wont you let me got to show just take on the zone)
Let's take on the zone, lets take on the zone
(If you really want to battle)
(It's you and me baby and the music turns our body all night long)
All night long

(We're almost there)
I'm feeling it bad and I can't explain
My soul is there
My hips all moving at a rapid pace
Can you feel it burn
From the tip of my toes, running through my veins
And now's your turn
Let me see what ya got, don't hesitate

I want to get stupid
Trying to take my music
It's like a competition
Me against the beat
I want to get in the zone
I want to get in the zone

If you really want to party
Settle up and get your rhythm
Try to hit, you could die
In a minute, I'ma take-a ya on, I'ma take-a ya on
Hey, hey, hey (here we go)

All my people on the floor let me see you dance
All my people up for more let me see you dance
All my people, 'round and 'round let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
I wanna see you

Get on the floor
Baby, lose control
Just work your body
And let it go
If you want to party
Just grab somebody
And baby we can dance all night

Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here I got something to show you
Sexy lady, I'd rather see you bare your soul
If you think you're so hot
Better show me what you got

All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
Come on Britney lose control
Watch me take it down

Get on the floor
Baby, lose control
Just work your body
And let it go
If you want to party
Just grab somebody
Hey baby we can dance all night

All my people on the floor let me see you dance
All my people up for more let me see you dance
All my people, 'round and 'round let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
I wanna see you

All my people in the crowd,
Let me see you dance
Come on Britney take it down
Make the music dance
All my people 'round and 'round
Party all night long
Come on Britney lose control
Watch you take it down
