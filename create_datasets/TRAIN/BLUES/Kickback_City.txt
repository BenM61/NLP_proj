They say this town will kill you
They say this town ain't got no soul
This town could take a child's smile
And turn it into stone

But don't you think I know that?
This place has cut me to the bone
Trouble crawling up your back
Fear just eats your soul

You say this town will eat you up
You say this town don't have a heart
You try to learn all your lines
And you try to play the part

With all this double dealing
I tell you brother, you'll get smart
Here in Kickback City
You're lost before you start

The people in subways
Look nearly half dazed to me
Renting tomorrow, investing in sorrow
No belief, yeah

Faces in side streets
Hiding like angels from grace
Selling you sorrow, renting tomorrow
You're out of place, yeah

They say this town will kill you
They say this town ain't got no soul
They'll set you up and pull the stitch
'Til you're unraveled on the floor

But I won't let it beat me
Though trouble's knocking at my door
Somehow it's just your smile
That keeps me coming back for more

Yeah, here in Kickback City
Feel I'm goin' down slow
Here in Kickback City
Feel I'm goin' down slow, yeah, yeah
