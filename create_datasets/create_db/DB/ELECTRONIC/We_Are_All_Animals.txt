We are the animals,
Who have lost our hair.
Retained some of our teeth,
And gained a choice

We'll chase food, money and sex,
Until satisfied.
And when its time to rest,
Ask 'whats next?

We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals

Well its hard enough to retain control,
When our instincts are egging us on,
With biologists and chemists reducing our souls,
To four letters
And when we think about it,
We're like a masterpiece,
Whose glimpsed, the artist?

We are, the machines,
Carrying our various genes.
Then discarded,
When the job is done.
We are the disciples,
Who have lost our way.
Kicked from our pedestal when Darwin burnt the book

We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals
We are all animals

Well its hard enough to retain control,
When our instincts are egging us on,
Biologists and chemists reducing our souls,
To four letters
Will genes replace Genesis?
We're like a masterpiece,
Whose glimpsed the artist?

We like to think we're at a special place, the stars revolve around the human race,
But we're just mammals, just, primates
Like chimps or guerrillas
We see the hair on our face,
And look at another primate,
You and I, we relate
