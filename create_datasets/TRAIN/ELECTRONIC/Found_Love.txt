I found love
I finally found love

I found someone
Who will always love me
I've found 
Deep inside
Something I cannot hide
It was you
Only you
Who showed
The magic that love can do

Even more than I've known before
I can only imagine what's
In store
Cause I've found
Happiness
And I've found someone to love me
I found deep inside something I cannot hide
I can't believe I found love
I found love found love
I've found love
Well I found it.

Yes known love before
But in my eyes only
In your sweet embrace 
My heart 
Has found a place
What could I do
But fall for you 
The lover that makes 
All dreams come true

Even more than I've known before
I can only imagine what's
In store
Cause I've found
Happiness
And I've found someone to love me
I found deep inside something I cannot hide

I can't believe I found love
I found love found love
I've found love
Well I found it.

Looking to the skies above me
The path I found was never far
Gone were the ties that had bound me
I come to you with open arms
What we have I want forever
A bond so strong will never fail
Example to the world around me
True love will always prevail.

I found it 
Found love.
