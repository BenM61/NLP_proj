I can say it more than once
'Cause I'm thinking twice as fast, yodel-ayde-a
Everything I like is nice
That's why I try to have it twice, yodel-ayde-a

Well, once I saw a bore
Who was a social whore, yodel-ayde-a
And they said I had a limp
And then they tried to pass around a pimp, yodel-ayde-a

Was on my last leg
I couldn't even borrow my friend's extra peg at all, yodel-ayde-a
Once I turned red
And it looked funny in the head, yodel-ayde-a
