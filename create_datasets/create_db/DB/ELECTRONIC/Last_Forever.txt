Falling out the fire escape
Driving out the city
Together

Feel the breeze against your face
Touch my hand, a warm embrace
Forever

I can't face this rain
So things won't change

Now that we're here
Feel so alive
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together

Now that we're here
The sun in our eyes
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together

Leaving all our friends behind
Kidnap each of those minds
Oh my love

I can make you laugh
I can make you cry
We would find that it's in the sky
But brothers

I can't face this rain
So things won't change

Now that we're here
Feel so alive
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together

Now that we're here
The sun in our eyes
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together

I can't face this rain
So things won't change

Now that we're here
Feel so alive
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together

Now that we're here
The sun in our eyes
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together

Now that we're here
Feel so alive
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together

Now that we're here
The sun in our eyes
We can make this last forever
We can waste time together
