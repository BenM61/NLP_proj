Tune my weaker eye
Spit white
Hold the world up all day paracetamol
She's blue in the face again
Sleep the darkness all away
And drinking kitchen paint to dye the winter
I hope we'll never see again

Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Married by signs
Married by signs

Personal holloway
Six month linen
It's safe to say we are alone
Suburban suicide
Watching night come amber
It's all so temporary

Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Deaf and dumb with the lights on
Married by signs
Married by signs
Married by signs

Move a little way forward
Move a little way now
Move a little way forward
Move a little way now

Bleed life
Breath life
Could be a better plan
Could be a better plan
Could be a better plan
