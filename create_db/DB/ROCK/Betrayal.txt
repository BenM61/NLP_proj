I love how they used to say
It's all in your head
You're a paranoid picture
You're a photograph

Exposed by the light
When you stepped outside
Burnt by the sun
That's in your eyes

But when I saw it in my face
In this mirror that needs to break
Something bothered me and left me to feel

Betrayal, Betrayal
It rips right through me
How you lie right to me
Betrayal, Betrayal
Will this world make better sense?
Once you mean nothing to me...

It's on the cutting room floor
Footage of this mess
Filmed then packaged and ready to sell

Betrayal, Betrayal
It rips right through me
How you lie right to me
Betrayal, Betrayal
Will this world make better sense?
Once you mean nothing to me...

Betrayal, Betrayal
You used to live in a memory,
Now those pictures are burning now (now)

You're a memory
A fingerprint on the film
You're a shadow in the sun
Now it's your time to burn

Betrayal, Betrayal
It rips right through me
How you lie right to me
Betrayal, Betrayal
Will this world make better sense?
Once you mean nothing to me...

One day, you will come crawling,
To the same place that I have been...
