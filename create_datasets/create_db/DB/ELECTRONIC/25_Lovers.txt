Touch down with your broken wing 
Give me your love and we'll begin 
To leave the past
Time moves on much too fast
So give me your kick don't be shy 
And use every trick don't tell me why 
You still need the sky to fly on high

I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling in love again
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling in love

Check the hearts of your 25 lovers and you'll
Find the answer why it's you who's losing
Check my heart cause you're still on the outside 
It's your last chance to get in on the inside now

Words are a waste of time 
When what we feel can't be denied 
Say goodbye and it would be a lie
So look at me don't walk away 

I can see in your eyes that you want to stay 
You should know that only winners score

I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling in love again
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling in love

Check the hearts of your 25 lovers and you'll
Find the answer why it's you who's losing
Check my heart cause you're still on the outside 
It's your last chance to get in on the inside now
