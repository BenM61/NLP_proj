And if in love she cried
Something wasn't right
I'm sorry
Would be easy
To say I love you

Headlights on the parade
Light up the way
Headlights on the parade
Light up the way
I go, yeah

Close your eyes
Come with me
Only love is alive
Close your eyes
Can't you see
Only love will survive, yeah

Headlights on the parade
Light up the way
I love you

Headlights on the parade
Light up the way
I've made up my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Only love will survive
Yeah
The city wins while you and I
Can't find a way
Oh, headlights on the parade, yeah, yeah

Fly little angel
Fly little angel
Yeah
