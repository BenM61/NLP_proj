I'll only ask you once more
You only want to believe
This man is looking for someone to hold him down
He doesn't yet fully understand the meaning

Never heard about Oscar Wilde 
Don't know about Brendan Behan
Know anything about Sean O'Casey
Or care about George Bernard Shaw
Or Samuel Beckett
Won't talk about Eugene O'Neill
He won't talk about Edna O'Brien
Or know anything about Lawrence Stern

Shut it, you don't understand it
Shut it, that's not the way I planned it
Shut it, shut your mouth 'til you know the truth

I'll only ask you once more
It must be so hard to see
This man is waiting for someone to hold his hand
He doesn't yet fully understand the meaning

Shut it, you don't understand it
Shut it, that's not the way I planned it
Shut it, shut your mouth 'til you know the truth

Oscar Wilde and Brendan Behan
Know anything about Sean O'Casey
Don't care about George Bernard Shaw
Or Samuel Beckett
Don't know anything about Eugene O'Neill
know anything about Edna O'Brien
Won't talk about Lawrence Stern

Now listen
All these other people, they don't mean a thing
And no less than what you said
Makes no difference at all
If I knew it, I would tell
Give you anything
I'll listen to what you said
But you must

(Oscar Wilde and Brendan Behan)
