Sing it from the mountain, tell it to the people
Sing it from the mountain, tell it to the people

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it

You got this feeling you've been wanting to share
It makes you feel as though you're walking on air
You say this feeling needs a thing called love
Then you should tell the one you're thinking of

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know it
It is time to show it

Oh, yeah
Oh

In every person there's yearning to love
This is the message that is sent from above
In every heart there's a love so true
That's why I'm sayin' that I love you

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know it
It is time to show it

You know that I love you
You say you love me too
So why don't you let me know
Let's open our hearts and let the feelings show

Sing it from the mountain, tell it to the people
Sing it from the mountain, tell it to the people

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
