I feel like I'm falling, I'm out on the ocean
I'm lost on the road somewhere
Darlin' don't wait up I'm counting on my luck
I hope it can get me there
Keys in my pocket I don't mind the walkin'
But you feel so far away
The bus fare, I had it, but I got bad habits 
That don't get me far these days

Sometimes I wish I was the driver
But I'm always the hitchhiker
I want to be there for you even though you don't need me to, no
I wish I was the driver, driver
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh

In bed with your eyes shut
You're holding the sky up
You're trying to keep control
You started from nothing
But it's good to want things 
When you're out here in the cold
Yeah

Sometimes I wish I was the driver
But I'm always the hitchhiker
I want to be there for you 
Even though you don't need me to, no
I wish I was the driver, driver
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh

I tried to be someone
Your boat in your ocean
I'm lost on the road somewhere
Darlin' don't wait up
I'm counting on my luck I hope it can get me there

Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh
I wish I was the driver, oh oh
I wish I was the driver, driver, ooh ooh ooh
I wish I was is the driver, oh oh
I wish I was the driver, driver, ooh ooh
Oh, I wish I was the driver, oh oh
