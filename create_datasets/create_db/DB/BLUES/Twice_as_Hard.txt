Clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She got no dirty little fingers
Bloodshot eyes are gone
Tell me I"m wrong

Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

And no one ever want to' know
Love ain't funny
A crime in the wink of an eye

Your sister always singing
She play the step child
A broken little memory
Her heart was never kind
Tell me I'm blind

Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone
Tell me I'm wrong

Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

Twice as Hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
