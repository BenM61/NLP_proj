I see you in my head
You ain't like the rest
You ain't bringin' me down, baby
You're right next to me
We're makin' history
The sun's about to go down, baby

Ooh
I wanna be wherever you are, baby
Ooh
Impossible to take it too far

Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
You and I, makin' lust forever
Makin' lust forever

I see you in my bed
Gettin' undressed
It's about to go down, baby
It wasn't just a dream
I guess it's meant to be
I got to tell you right now, baby

Ooh
I wanna be wherever you are, baby
Ooh
Impossible to take it too far

Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
Summer nights, gettin' high like the first time
You and I, makin' lust forever
You and I, makin' lust forever
Oh
Makin' lust forever, baby
Oh yeah

(Making lust forever)
