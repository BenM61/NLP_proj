We said high gloss is bullshit
It's tragic, yeah, that's it
You said f*ck this, I said f*ck that
We stood together, we said, what you mean dad?

They are the millionaires, we are broke
They make a statement, well it's gotta be a joke
They drive a limousine, we ride a bike
They own the factory, but we're on strike! 

Say anti-anti, anti-anti
Anti-anti, anti-anti

We were best friends, against big fish
Throwing cocktails, yeah, eat this! 
You're all stupid, we're not joking
We will change it, this gun is smoking

They are the millionaires, we are broke
They make a statement, well it's gotta be a joke
They drive a limousine, we steal a bike
They own the factory, but we're on strike! 

Say anti-anti, anti-anti
Say anti-anti, anti-anti

Now this is long gone yesterday
I won't say no, it's yes I say

Low budget craze with a fistful of rage
Censorship madness, your brain is the cage
I'm a professional, just watch my dance
I've got fifty percent better chance
On one side or the other, when the curtain falls
I shake your hand, then I'll kick your balls
No trigger nerves, just throw down the stitch
Yeah, I nod and bow, then you're my bitch

Say anti-anti, anti-anti, 
Anti-anti, anti-anti

Now this is long gone yesterday
I won't say no, it's yes I say
