You got those big dark eyes that flash at me, baby
You got a head on your shoulders, you know what I mean
You got legs so long like you could walk on air
For you darlin', I'd go anywhere

For your love, your precious love
I'd do anything, yes I would
I want your love, your precious love
I've been too lonely too long

You got a kind of walk that's just so fine
The way you fill those blue jeans baby, my my my
Yes and when you smiled at me like you did just now
All I want is just to get to you somehow

For your love, your precious love
I'd do anything, yes I would
I want your love, your precious love
I've been too lonely too long

Yeah those big dark eyes that flash at me
It's just your precious love that I want, you to see

For your love, your precious love
I'd do anything, yes I would
I want your love, your precious love
I've been too lonely too long

For your love, your precious love
I'd do anything, yes I would
I want your love, your precious love
I've been too lonely too long

Yeah, your precious love
Your precious love
Your precious love
