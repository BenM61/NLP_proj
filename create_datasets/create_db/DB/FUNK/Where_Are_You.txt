Where are you?
Where have you gone without me?
I thought you cared about me
Where are you?

Where's my heart?
Where is the dream we started?
I can't believe we parted
Where are you?

When we said goodbye, love
Or was it just a game? Yeah
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain?

All life through
Must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending?
Where are you?

Please tell me where
I ask you where
I wanna know where
Is that you over there?
I said where are you
