Lost in a feelin'
So very deep inside of me
Something's not healing ever since
You left this place
Oh, but I loved you and although
I didn't know you
Just the idea of you brought
Rapture to my face

I feel I almost got to know you
At least you made it to my heart
Even though we'll always
Be a world apart
Now I'm getting on without you
But I need to cry sometimes
'Cause I know we'll always 
Be a world apart

Voices of children 
In the streets I hear them laughing
It all fades to one voice 
I hear crying in the night
I think about you wondering
If you're out there listening
As if the words I sing
Will somehow bring you light

Well I almost got to know you
At least you made it to my heart
But I know we'll always 
Be a world apart
Now I'm getting on without you
But there's a shadow in my heart
'Cause I know we'll always 
Be a world apart

Seems I almost got to know you
At least you made it to my heart
But I know we'll always
Be a world apart
Through the constancy of memory
You will live inside my heart
Then we'll never have to 
Be a world apart

Over and over I never knew
How much till you were gone
Over and over and over
You will be mine eternally
