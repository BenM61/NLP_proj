I'm leaving on a fast train 
Don't ask me when I'm coming back again
I reckon it's only a matter of time
Before the law kick in the door
Mother I'm running out of change,
but I had to phone to let you know

They'll never take me alive
They'll never take me alive

Mother I killed someone
It wasn't that I hated him
You see, he was trying to stop me
but he found out
I've gone the whole way

They'll never take me alive
They'll never take me

I can't tell you how I feel
Maybe you don't wanna know
Maybe, maybe
But anyway, I love you so

They'll never take me alive
They'll never take me

They'll never take me alive
